# Continuing Education Activity

Nadolol is a medication used to treat angina and hypertension, which are significant risk factors for the development of coronary artery disease, heart failure, stroke, and a host of other cardiovascular conditions. Nadolol belongs to the class of beta-blocker medications. Off-labeled it is used for the management of atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmias due to congenital long QT syndrome, ventricular premature beat, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, gastroesophageal variceal hemorrhage prophylaxis in patients with liver cirrhosis, and thyrotoxicosis. This activity reviews the indications, mechanism of action, adverse drug reactions, toxicity, management, and contraindications for using nadolol as a valuable agent in managing hypertension, angina, and other conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of nadolol.
- Identify the most common adverse effects associated with nadolol therapy. 
- Explain the importance of monitoring patients on nadolol therapy. 
- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team members to enhance care delivery and improve outcomes for patients receiving nadolol.

# Indications

**FDA-labeled Indications**

**Angina**

Nadolol has approval for long-term use in angina pectoris. Nadolol showed significant symptomatic improvement in exercise tolerance and exercise duration and was more effective than propranolol in slowing heart rate at rest and during exercise.

**Hypertension**

Nadolol is a second-line agent in the treatment of hypertension. Nadolol should not be used as the first line in treating hypertension in the absence of indications to start beta-blockers. Nadolol can reduce blood pressure significantly with minimal cardio-depressant effect.

**Non-FDA Approved Indications**

**Atrial Fibrillation**

Nadolol can be used to attain heart rate control in the acute management of atrial fibrillation. Oral beta-blockers, including nadolol, are also widely used as the primary therapy for chronic atrial fibrillation. Nadolol also decreases relapse in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

**Ventricular Arrhythmias due to Congenital Long QT Syndrome**

The AHA recommends using nadolol in patients with ventricular arrhythmias due to congenital long QT syndrome to reduce adverse cardiac events and syncope and the prevention of sudden cardiac death.

**Ventricular Premature Beat**

Nadolol is an option for the suppression of premature ventricular beats. This effect is due to bradycardia-induced prolongation of the RR interval.

**Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia**

Nadolol effectively reduces the incidence and severity of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Nadolol appears to reduce ventricular arrhythmia by reducing the catecholamine effect on the beta receptor.

**Supraventricular Tachycardia**

Nadolol is effective in the termination of acute onset supraventricular tachycardia in those patients where the vagal maneuver is not an option or failed and did not respond to adenosine.

**Gastroesophageal Variceal Hemorrhage Prophylaxis in Patients with Liver Cirrhosis**

Clinicians use nadolol to prevent and manage gastroesophageal varices and variceal hemorrhage in patients with liver cirrhosis.

**Thyrotoxicosis**

Nadolol produces clinical improvement in patients with thyrotoxicosis by reducing palpitations, nervousness, and tremor. It produces this effect by reducing the level of free thyroid hormone in the bloodstream. It also reduces the T3 levels and increases the reverse T3 levels.

# Mechanism of Action

Nadolol is a synthetic non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor blocker and an inverse agonist.

# Administration

Nadolol administration is primarily through the oral route. Tablet formulations are available in 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, 160 mg, 240 mg, and 320 mg strengths.

- According to the FDA, in patients with angina pectoris and hypertension, nadolol should be started as a 40 mg once-daily oral formulation. It should be gradually increased in 40 to 80 mg increments to achieve the required therapeutic concentration and tailored to the patient’s response.

- In patients with atrial fibrillation, the American Heart Association recommends an oral dosage range of 10 mg to 240 mg to be tailored based on the patient’s response.

- In patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, and ventricular arrhythmia due to congenital long QT syndrome, the American Heart Association recommends an oral dosage of 40 mg to 320 mg once a day.

- In patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmia, the American Heart Association recommends a dosage of 160 mg for long-term control.

- For both primary and secondary prophylaxis in patients with gastroesophageal variceal hemorrhage, the initial dose is 40 mg per day. This dose can increase to 80 mg per day in patients with ascites and 160 mg per day in patients without ascites. Dosing should be gradually increased every 2 to 3 days to reach a maximum tolerated dose in these patients. Heart rate should be maintained at 55 to 60 bpm, and the dosage should be stopped or decreased if the blood pressure drops below 90 mmHg.

- In patients with thyrotoxicosis, the American Thyroid Association recommends an oral dosage of 40 to 160 mg.

- The American Academy of Neurology and American Headache Society recommends an oral dosage of 40 to 160 mg once a day for prophylaxis in patients with migraines.

**Pharmacokinetics**

Various animal studies in dogs and rabbits have shown that pharmacological half-life is 12 to 24 hours.

**Specific Population**

**Renal Impairment:**Nadolol reduces renal blood flow. Therefore, dosage intervals should require monitoring with creatinine clearance.

**Hepatic Impairment:**There is no information on nadolol use in patients with hepatic impairment.

**Pregnant Women:**Nadolol is considered a pregnancy category C drug. Research has shown it to reduce birth weight in infants.

**Breastfeeding Women:**It is also contraindicated postpartum as it is expressed in breast milk. It may induce hypotension and hypoglycemia in neonates and infants.

# Adverse Effects

Nadolol has been well-tolerated in most clinical studies with minimal side effects.

The most common adverse effect is drowsiness and insomnia. Some other common adverse effects of nadolol are as follows:

**Cardiovascular**

- AV block

- Bradycardia

- Hypotension

- Raynaud phenomenon

**Central Nervous System**

- Dizziness

- Depression

- Memory loss

**Gastrointestinal**

- Hepatotoxicity

- Weakness

- Impotence

**Respiratory**

- Cough

- Bronchospasm

Severe hypotension, bronchospasm, and allergic reactions are rare but life-threatening adverse effects, often necessitating immediate emergency treatment. Clinicians should not abruptly withdraw nadolol [US BOX WARNING] as it can cause rebound tachycardia, hypertension, or ischemia. Treatment should be stopped gradually to avoid these complications.

# Contraindications

**Asthma/COPD:**The effect of nadolol on the beta-2 receptors of the bronchial lining prevents bronchodilation and increases airway resistance, which exacerbates the effect in patients with a bronchospastic disease like asthma, thus causing wheezing and shortness of breath.

**Sinus Bradycardia:**One known effect of nadolol is reducing the resting heart rate. In patients with low heart rates originating from sinus node dysfunction, nadolol can further reduce the rate unless a pacemaker is present.

**Greater than first-degree AV Block:**Nadolol reduces conduction through the AV node, potentially causing an AV block. Thus, nadolol can lead to serious bradyarrhythmia in patients with partial or complete AV block. The use of other drugs that might impair AV nodal conduction can exacerbate AV blockage.

**Cardiogenic Shock:**The combined effect of lowering the resting heart rate and increasing the AV nodal conduction delay can potentially aggravate the already reduced cardiac output in patients with cardiogenic shock.

**Decompensated Cardiac Failure:**Beta-blockers are a cornerstone in the long-term treatment of compensated chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. It reduces the detrimental effect of sympathetic drive on the heart. However, nadolol is contraindicated in patients with uncompensated heart failure. These patients rely on catecholamines for sustaining their heart rate and cardiac output, and nadolol in these patients can exacerbate the symptoms of heart failure.

**Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**For managing hypertension during pregnancy, beta-blockers like labetalol are preferable to nadolol.

Hypersensitivity to nadolol.

Anesthetic agents that can cause myocardial depression.

# Monitoring

**Heart Rate:**The clinical team should maintain the patient's heart rate above 55 bpm in patients taking nadolol. The heart rate specifically requires monitoring while escalating the dose, which can cause further bradycardia, and while withdrawing the medications, it can cause rebound tachycardia.

**Blood Pressure:**The blood pressure should be maintained above 90 mmHg systolic, especially while escalating and withdrawing the medication.

**Signs and symptoms of Exacerbation:**Abrupt withdrawal of nadolol can cause rebound tachycardia and reduced blood flow to the myocardial tissue, generating anginal symptoms or worsening angina.

# Toxicity

Most nadolol poisonings occur via the intentional consumption of the tablet. There are no reports of significant toxicity in the literature.

Signs and symptoms of moderate to severe poisoning include severe hypotension, bradycardia, bronchospasm, heart failure, hypoglycemia, seizure, and coma. First, maintaining a patent airway is essential. Use suction if necessary, attempt to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%, and resort to endotracheal intubation if necessary. Continuously monitor the patient for pulmonary edema or signs of shock. There is no specific antidote for nadolol toxicity. However, for the treatment of hypotension, glucagon, dopamine, or sodium bicarbonate, followed by multiple IV boluses of epinephrine if the former is not adequate, can be used.

Treat heart failure with cardiac glycosides and diuretics.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

The primary use of nadolol is in the treatment of angina and hypertension.

Interprofessional healthcare team members, including clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists, should be cautious while withdrawing or stopping the drug as it can cause life-threatening rebound hypertension, tachycardia, and signs and symptoms of angina. Nadolol should be used cautiously with diuretics as it can potentiate the effect of hypotension by nadolol.

To improve outcomes and lower morbidity, the pharmacist should educate the patient on medication compliance and avoid using other drugs/herbs without consulting the physician. The pharmacist should also perform medication reconciliation to monitor any potential interactions and report these to the rest of the healthcare team. Nursing staff will have more frequent contact with patients and should gauge treatment success and observe for adverse effects. These factors must get communicated to the prescribing clinicians for dose and/or drug changes to the therapy regimen. Nadolol therapy requires the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team, including physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results and minimize adverse events.
