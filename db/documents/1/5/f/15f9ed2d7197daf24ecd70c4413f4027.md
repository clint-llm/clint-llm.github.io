Bacterial prostatitis (BP) isÂ a bacterial infection of the prostate gland occurring in a bimodal distribution in younger and older men. It can be acute bacterial prostatitis (ABP) or chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) in nature and, if not treated appropriately, can result in significant morbidity. As a result, the causes, pathophysiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of BP are important for providers to understand in emergency and ambulatory settings.

In general, acute bacterial prostatitis is rare; when it occurs, it is often associated with bladder outlet obstruction or an immunocompromised state.
