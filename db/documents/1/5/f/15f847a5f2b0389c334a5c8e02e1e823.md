The incidence of angioedema occurring as an adverse effect is 0.1 to 0.7% due to vasodilation and plasma extravasation.

In cases of hepatic failure, it is crucial to avoid prescribing any ACE inhibitors. In addition, patients experiencing the adverse effect of acute liver injury from fosinopril should refrain from using other ACE inhibitors to prevent further damage.

In patients with diabetes, fosinopril should not be co-administered with aliskiren, as aliskiren may enhance the hypotensive, hyperkaliemia, and nephrotoxic effects of fosinopril.

One needs to be careful while using fosinopril with other drugs due to drug-drug interaction.

- Potassium (K+) sparing diuretics: Fosinopril may cause hyperkalemia due to the attenuation of potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics.

- Lithium: Fosinopril causes serious lithium drug interaction. It may slow the elimination of lithium from the body, resulting in increased lithium levels.

- Antacids: Antacids may alter the absorption of fosinopril, resulting in reduced serum levels. It can further reduce the urinary excretion of fosinoprilat.

- NonsteroidalÂ anti-inflammatory agents: in elderly patients, co-administration of fosinopril may result in deterioration of renal function, possibly resulting in acute renal failure.
