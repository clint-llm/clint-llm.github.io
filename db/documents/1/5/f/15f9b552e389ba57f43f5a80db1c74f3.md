There are a few more frequently diagnosed vulvar conditions that can present similarly to a vulvar hematoma. These include Bartholin’s gland cysts and abscesses, vulvar varicosities, and folliculitis.

The Bartholin’s glands are two pea-sized glands located symmetrically at the vaginal opening. These glands function by lubricating the vagina through mucus production.

Vulvar varicosities can also be a differential diagnosis. However, it is important to note that there have been case reports of postoperative vulvar hematoma following surgical management for vulvar varicose veins.

Vulvar folliculitis arises due to inflammation of the hair follicles and often resembles acne in the genital region. Patients with vulvar folliculitis may present to the clinic with genital pain or itchiness. However, on examination, it is usually seen as small papules or pustules uniformly distributed over the vulva.

Finally, although vulvar carcinoma can present as a fleshy lump or mass, most cases have a history of pruritus and do not usually present with pain. In addition, vulvar carcinoma can also be described as ulcerated, leukoplakic, or warty.
