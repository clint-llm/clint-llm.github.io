The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism varies from 3 to 15% based on the study population. Statistical research demonstrates a higher incidence of subclinical hypothyroidism in women and elderly individuals. Vanderpump et al. in the Whickham survey found 8% of women and 3% of men to have subclinical hypothyroidism.
