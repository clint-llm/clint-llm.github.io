While the major cause of these tumors remains unknown, several risks have been described for soft tissue sarcomas, such as genetic predisposition, radiation therapy, lymphedema, gene mutations, and chemotherapy.

Clear cell sarcoma was initially described as “malignant melanoma of soft parts” due to their histological similarities. Both share immunohistochemical markers, and their gene expression profiling suggests that CCSST are a genomic subtype of MM.
