On CT scans, neurilemmomas are hypodense compared to muscle and enhance with contrast. On MRI, neurilemmomas are isointense to muscle on T1-weighted imaging and bright on T2-weighted imaging with occasional low signal cysts. While inconsistent, the best way to distinguish a neurilemmoma from a neurofibroma is an eccentric displacement of the nerve and heterogeneous appearance with cystic degeneration, suggestive of a schwannoma.

Biopsy of the neoplasm, as discussed above, is the best way to confirm a diagnosis of a schwannoma, with a defined fibrous capsule and Antoni A and Antoni B bodies on histology.
