EMG and NCV studies are beneficial to diagnose the nature, location of compression, and prognosis. If the test shows delayed latency and slow velocity, as well as conduction block at the involved segment with no evidence of denervation potentials and plenty of motor units on needle EMG, it indicates neurapraxia with a good prognosis. Conversely, if there is evidence of denervation potentials coupled with no viable motor units, the prognosis is guarded.
