- Have all of the materials at hand.

- Supinate the wrist and hold in 20 degrees of extension.

- Apply the stockinette and smooth over the extremity with 2 cm extra proximally and distally.

- Wrap the cast padding, starting at the metacarpal head circumferentially to the antecubital fossa. Avoid wrinkles and gaps in the padding.

- Thoroughly wet the splint material with cool water and squeeze out the excess.

- Lay the moist splint along the palmar aspect of the hand, wrist, and forearm to 4 cm proximal to the antecubital fossa.

- Fold the excess stockinette over the ends of the plaster or fiberglass and wrap under the elastic wrap.

- Beginning at the metacarpal heads, wrap the elastic bandage with 25% overlap circumferentially around the splint, working proximally, and secure with clips or tape.

- Mold the splint to the palm and forearm maintaining the 20-degree extension and hold until firm. The elastic bandage should be tight enough to hold the splint in place but allow two fingers to be inserted underneath.

- Check the capillary refill.

- Elevate the arm with a sling.
