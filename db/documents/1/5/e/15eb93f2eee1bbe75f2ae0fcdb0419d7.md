NF2 is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait in some patients. The abnormal gene can be inherited from either of the parents, and the risk of passing the gene to offspring from a parent is 50%. In some patients with NF2, there is no family history; and the disease is caused by a de novo mutation in the NF2 gene. NF2 is caused by mutations in the NF2 gene located in the long arm of chromosome number 22 (22q12.2). The NF2 gene encodes for the protein known as merlin, which acts as a tumor suppressor gene.
