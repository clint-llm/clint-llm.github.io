ECT provides patientsÂ with certain psychiatric disorders a treatment option for improvement in their mental state. Performing ECT requires an entire team composed of interprofessional colleagues, including anesthesiologists, psychiatrists, and nurses.

Prior to undergoing ECT, a patient should be evaluated by an anesthetic provider to ensure the patient is safe to undergo general anesthesia and consent to the use of general anesthesia. Additionally, this allows the anesthetic provider to determine if the patient's comorbidities and current medication regimen require alterations to the anesthetic plan. The anesthesia team should also coordinate with the psychiatrist to determine the severity of the patient's psychiatric disorders and the length of seizure desired. A nurse is present before, during, and after the procedure to ensure the patient is ready for the procedure and monitored afterward. Nursing staff help to position the patient and to make sure all safety guidelines are followed. During recovery, nurses help recognize side effects and reactions to either the anesthesia or seizure.
