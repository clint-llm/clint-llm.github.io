Diagnosis is initially made usually based on clinical signs and symptoms. Diagnostic confirmation is by serology, or occasionally muscle biopsy may be needed.

A complete blood count can show leukocytosis and eosinophilia, which correlates with the number of worms causing the infection.

Serological tests that are available are ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), indirect IF (immunofluorescence), and latex agglutination test. Serologic test confirmation can be via western blot.

Plain x-rays may show calcific densities in the muscles. A computed tomography (CT) scan is done to rule out other causes of neurological dysfunction.

The electrocardiogram (ECG) may show features of pericarditis, ischemia, or myocarditis. There may be premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), PR interval prolongation, conduction block, or atrial arrhythmias.

The definitive diagnosis method is a muscle biopsy.
