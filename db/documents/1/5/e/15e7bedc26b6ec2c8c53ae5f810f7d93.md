Hypertension is a chronic progressive disease that develops over many years, and patients require education on the risks of uncontrolled blood pressure. Automatic blood pressure cuffs are widely available and inexpensive and should be prescribed to every patient for home monitoring of their blood pressure.  Patients should keep daily logs of their blood pressure; this is especially important for those at higher risk of disease progressions such as treatment-resistant hypertension or those with multiple concomitant risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Routine measurement of blood pressure has been shown to improve compliance and allows for more patient involvement in the management of their disease.

Again, hypertension ranks as the most common modifiable risk factor for premature cardiovascular disease and often coexists with other major risk factors. Proper management requires identifying these risk factors and modification to slow the development of complications. An evaluation of the patient’s lifestyle choices with particular attention to major modifiable risk factors should be conducted with a recommendation of tobacco cessation and decreased alcohol use, increased physical activity (three times a week) and low sodium diet (under 2 g/day) can all improve blood pressure control. Modification of specific lifestyle choices such as cessation of smoking or weight loss provides significantly more cardiovascular benefits than pharmacological treatment alone.
