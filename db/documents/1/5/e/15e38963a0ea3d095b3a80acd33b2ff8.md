Primary prevention recommendations for adults age between 40 to 75 years old With an LDL Level of 70 to 189 mg/dL. High levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are risk factors for coronary heart disease.

According to the 2018 Guideline on the Management of Blood Cholesterol,**Statin Intensity**

Moderate-intensity statin therapy is expected to have a 30 to 50 percent LDL-C reduction, as following,

- Lovastatin 40mg daily;

- Pravastatin 40mg daily

- Simvastatin 40 mg daily;

- Atorvastatin 10 to 20 mg daily;

- Rosuvastatin 5 to 10 mg daily;

- Pitavastatin 4 mg

High-intensity statin therapy is expected to have a greater than or equal to 50 percent LDL-C reduction, as following,

- Atorvastatin 40 to 80 mg

- Rosuvastatin 20 to 40 mg

In most of the cases, do not intensify statin therapy for patients who are on moderate-intensity statin therapy. The efficacy of statin therapy should undergo evaluation in six to eight weeks after the initiation. Statin therapy management should take place when statin-induced muscle adverse events, elevated aminotransferase, or renal dysfunction such as proteinuria have developed. However, routine monitoring of serum creatine kinase (CK) levels is not currently a reocmmendation for patients on statins. For medical practitioners, obtaining a baseline CK level should be considered before initiating statin therapy. Education on lifestyle modification, medication compliance, and awareness of new onset of muscle discomforts or weakness is crucial.
