Physiological, pathological, or pharmacological conditions can cause hyperprolactinemia.

**Physiological Causes**

- Pregnancy

- Nipple stimulation and lactation

- Exercise

- Stress (hypoglycemia, myocardial infarction, surgery)

- Seizures

- Sleep

- Neonatal period

- Sexual intercourse

During pregnancy, the pituitary gland increases in size, also increasing the size of lactotrophs. The gland may double in size during pregnancy.

Nipple stimulation increases prolactin secretion which is mediated by neural pathways during breastfeeding. Prolactin secretion increases transiently with suckling reaching up to 300 ng/ml above baseline. The levels increase to 10 ng/ml above baseline in the first week and continue to rise for several months after delivery.

**Pathological Causes**

**Pituitary Disease**

- Prolactinoma

- Acromegaly

- Cushing disease

- Macroadenoma (compressive)

- Plurihormonal adenoma

- Lymphocytic hypophysitis

- Parasellar mass

- Macroprolactinemia

Prolactinoma is a benign tumor of lactotrophs. It accounts for up to 40% of all pituitary adenomas. It can present with any level of prolactin elevation from mild elevation to 50,000 ng/ml. In contrast, prolactin elevation from other causes rarely exceeds 200 ng/ml.

**Hypothalamic Disease - Stalk Damage**

- Tumors like craniopharyngioma, suprasellar pituitary mass extension, meningioma, dysgerminoma, hypothalamic metastases

- Granulomas (sarcoidosis, tuberculosis)

- Infiltrative disease (histiocytosis disease)

- Rathke's cyst

- Pituitary stalk transection (Sellar surgery, head trauma)

- Cranial Irradiation

**Pharmacological Causes**

- Estrogen therapy

- Thyrotropin-releasing hormone

- Antipsychotic/dopamine receptor blocking agents:  risperidone, haloperidol, fluphenazine, among others

- Antiemetic/dopamine receptor blocking agents: metoclopramide, domperidone, prochlorperazine

- Tricyclic antidepressant, selective serotonin receptor inhibitor: amitriptyline, clomipramine, fluoxetine

- Anticonvulsant: Phenytoin

- Antihypertensive: Verapamil, methyldopa, labetalol

- H2 Antihistamines: Cimetidine, ranitidine

- Opioid analgesics: Methadone, morphine, apomorphine, heroin

- Cholinergic agent: Physostigmine

**Systemic Disorder**

- Chronic renal failure

- Polycystic ovarian disease

- Liver cirrhosis

- Pseudocyesis

- Reflex causes: Chest wall trauma, surgery, herpes zoster

- Primary hypothyroidism

**Genetic
**

Inactivating prolactin receptor mutation

**Ectopic Production**

Bronchogenic carcinoma and hypernephromas

**Idiopathic**
