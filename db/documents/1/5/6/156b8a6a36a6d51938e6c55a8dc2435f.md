Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) is a laser refractive procedure used to ablate the corneal stroma to correct refractive errors. Though not performed as often as laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), there are select situations in which PRK may be the preferred option. This article reviews the surgical technique, complications, and visual outcomes associated with PRK, and highlights the role of the healthcare team in evaluating and treating patients who undergo PRK.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the indications and contraindications for photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and when PRK may be preferred over laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK).
- Describe intraoperative techniques during photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) that may reduce the likelihood of postoperative complications.
- Explain the standard regimen to manage postoperative pain following photorefractive keratectomy (PRK).
- Identify the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to maximize visual outcomes and satisfaction of patients undergoing photorefractive keratectomy (PRK).
