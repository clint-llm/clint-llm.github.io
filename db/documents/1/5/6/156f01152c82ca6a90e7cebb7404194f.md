The mechanism of action of amantadine is uncertain. Antiviral activity primarily interferes with viral replication. Amantadine disrupts the transmembrane domain of the viral M2 protein, which prevents infectious viral nucleic acid entry into the host cell. It may also inhibit the assembly of influenza A virus isolates from each of the subtypes (H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2) during replication. Influenza B has a structurally different M2 protein, which makes amantadine ineffective.

In the treatment of Parkinson disease, studies have shown amantadine acts on dopamine neurons. Amantadine is a weak, non-competitive antagonist of the NMDA receptor, which increases dopamine release and prevents dopamine reuptake. Although amantadine does not have anticholinergic activity, there may be anticholinergic side effects such as dry mouth, urinary retention, and constipation clinically.
