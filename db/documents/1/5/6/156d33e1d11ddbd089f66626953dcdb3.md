There are major known contraindications to neuraxial anesthesia (spinal and epidural). The absolute contraindications are lack of consent from the patient, elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), primarily due to intracranial mass and infection at the site of the procedure (risk of meningitis).

Relative contraindications are

- Preexisting neurological diseases (particularly those that wax and wane, e.g., multiple sclerosis)

- Severe dehydration (hypovolemia), due to the risk of hypotension - risk factors for hypotension include hypovolemia, age greater than 40 to 50 years, emergency surgery, obesity, chronic alcohol consumption, and chronic hypertension.

- Thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy (especially with epidural anesthesia, due to the risk of epidural hematoma)

Other relative contraindications are severe mitral and aortic stenosis and left ventricular outflow obstruction as seen with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.

In the setting of coagulopathy, the placement of neuraxial block requires re-evaluation. The American Society of Regional Anesthesia (ASRA) publishes updated guidelines that detail timing for neuraxial anesthesia for patients on oral anticoagulants, antiplatelets, thrombolytic therapy, unfractionated, and low molecular weight heparin. Review the latest guidelines before proceeding with the procedure.

Overall because these are elective procedures, it is imperative to undergo a risk/benefit analysis before proceeding.
