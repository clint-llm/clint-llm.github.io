Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid that acts on both epithelial (e.g., kidney) and nonepithelial (e.g., heart and blood vessels) receptors to induce sodium and water reabsorption. In addition to its hypertensive effects, aldosterone is implicated in the progression of myocardial fibrosis, especially following myocardial infarction. Eplerenone binds to mineralocorticoid receptors competitively, antagonizing aldosterone. Eplerenone’s main mechanistic advantage relative to spironolactone is that it has a 100 to 1000-fold lower binding affinity to glucocorticoid, progesterone, and androgen receptors.
