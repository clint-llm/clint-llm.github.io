As mentioned, the CD4 count is used to evaluate the progression of HIV. CD4 counts should be done to all patients first diagnosed with HIV disease. The Public Health Service recommends that all HIV-positive patients be tested every 3 to 6 months. Results can offer insight into the possible diagnosis of AIDS and the risk of opportunistic infections. Additionally, the test is an indicator of treatment failure. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) should commence before CD4 levels are below 200 cells/mm^3, as complications are higher in this population of patients. Levels should be followed up every 3 to 6 months after starting ART to check for response to therapy. If the response is appropriate, the CD4 count can be rechecked every 6 to 12 months. Successful treatment is associated with an increase in CD4 count and adherence to therapy. With the use of ART, levels may increase 100 to 150 cells/mm3 at the one-year mark.
