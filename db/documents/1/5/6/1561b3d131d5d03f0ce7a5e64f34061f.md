Veins are the part of the circulatory system which returns deoxygenated blood to the heart. Peripheral veins offer relatively simple access to the circulatory system, given their superficial location to the skin. Scalp veins are easily accessed due to both this superficiality and their easy visualization. The three most common veins for scalp vein catheterization for peripheral IV access are the posterior auricular veins, superficial temporal veins, and frontal veins.

The frontal veins run up and down along the center of the forehead towards the midline.Â  Superficial temporal veins run along the side of the head and drain the skin and muscles in the temporal region. Posterior auricular veins also drain the skin and superficial muscles of the scalp and run posterior to the ear, also parallel to the cranial-caudal axis.
