The blood supply to the inner ear is via the labyrinthine artery (LA), also known as the internal auditory artery.

Vestibular and cochlear aqueducts are responsible for venous drainage of the inner ear. The anterior and posterior spiral modiolar veins drain blood from the cochlea. The anterior and posterior vestibular veins drain blood from the vestibule, connects with the vein of the round window (RW), and eventually empties into the inferior cochlear vein (ICV).Â The ICV then drains into the inferior petrosal sinus.

Lymphatic fluid in the inner ear plays a critical role, circulating inside the cells and transferring metabolites from the CSF.
