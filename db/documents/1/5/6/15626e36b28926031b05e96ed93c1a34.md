Alcohol is absorbed through the proximal GI tract. It is primarily metabolized in the liver by alcohol dehydrogenase to acetaldehyde. The primary site of action in acute toxicity is the central nervous system, where it increases central nervous system (CNS) inhibition and decreases excitation. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the primary CNS inhibitory neurotransmitter. GABA binds to receptors allowing chloride to enter the cell, which decreases cellular excitability. Alcohol binds strongly to GABA receptors, activating the inhibitory cascade, which results in sedation, cognitive dysfunction, and decreased coordination.

With chronic alcohol use, the number of GABA receptors is increased, requiring more and more alcohol to create the same level of inhibition. This is a phenomenon known as tolerance. This tolerance partly explains the alertness of chronic alcohol users at blood alcohol levels that in others would cause coma or death. Benzodiazepines also bind to the GABA receptor, making them useful in alcohol withdrawal. Alcohol also inhibits the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS, glutamate. Patients with alcohol use disorder have increased numbers of NMDA receptors and increased sensitivity of these receptors to glutamate. Due to the increased sensitivity of these receptors, patients with alcohol use disorder are at risk for seizures and hallucinations when alcohol is withdrawn.
