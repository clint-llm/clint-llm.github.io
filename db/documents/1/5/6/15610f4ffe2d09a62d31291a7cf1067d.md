The infratrochlear nerve is a branch of the nasociliary nerve, which forms part of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (V1). It provides sensory innervation to the medial upper and lower eyelids, the skin of the lateral part of the nose (external) above the medial canthus, medial conjunctiva, and lacrimal apparatus, including the caruncle.

This article outlines the anatomy of the trigeminal nerve leading up to and including the infratrochlear nerve as well as describing its clinical significance.

The trigeminal nerve is one of the most important cranial nerves,Â and thus, a thorough understanding of its anatomy is essential for all physicians and surgeons. In particular, the infratrochlear nerve has an impact clinically for ENT surgeons and anesthetists.
