The severity of tardive dystonia ranges on a spectrum from imperceptible to frank disability. Subtle impairments include muscle tightness and cramps, leading to mastication and speech discomfort. More intense complications include oculogyric crisis, dysphagia, dysarthria, as well as lethal respiratory stridor. In severe instances, dystonic reactions can induce apnea, leading to fatality. Less common complications include dystonic involvement of axial, limb, and truncal muscle groups leading to Pisa syndrome, camptocormia, and opisthotonus.
