The rarity of this disease explains the empiricism of therapeutic proposals and the absence of controlled studies. An effective medical treatment is not available at present. The proposed symptomatic treatments are simply intended to avoid or space recurrences, particularly in the edematous stage. The treatment aims to relieve these patients and to improve their quality of life, often very disturbed by the unsightly and distressing nature of macrocheilitis and oro-facial edema. The spontaneous disappearance of the disease is rare but has been reported.

Corticosteroid therapy is a classic treatment for CG. It may be administered locally, topically, or intralesionally, and at times systemic corticosteroid for short courses (prednisolone: 0.3 to 0.7 mg/kg/day; 25 to 50 mg/day) may be tried. Other treatments have also been tried for their anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory effects such as topical tacrolimus, or oral clofazimine, thalidomide, dapsone, and doxycycline, with inconsistent results.

Finally, immunosuppressive treatments such as mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine, as well as inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), have been tried, alone or in combination, in isolated cases and small series with inconsistently positive results.

Fumaric acid esters have given good results in 50 % of the cases (who were refractory to other modalities).

The cheiloplasty reduction is possible when the lesions are fixed and not evolving.
