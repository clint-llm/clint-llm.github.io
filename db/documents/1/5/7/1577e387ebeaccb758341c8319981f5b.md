The discovery of the ABO system has led to increased safety in the transfusion of blood products. Understanding the ABO blood group system is essential to ensure appropriate blood products are administered to patients. Practitioners should know the appropriate blood products to transfuse based on ABO typing and recognize typical presentations of ABO incompatibility. Knowledge of the ABO blood system, prevention of complications with appropriate blood product administration, and prompt identification of signs/symptoms of ABO incompatibility will improve patient care and decrease morbidity.

From the bedside to the blood bank, the medical team must collaborate to ensure that transfusions are administered safely to minimize complications. The blood bank team must determine the most appropriate blood product to release. Communication from the clinical team is necessary to provide clinical background and information regarding adverse transfusion-related events to the blood bank team. Administering a transfusion safely can only occur with the teamwork of physicians, advanced care practitioners, nurses, and technologists in the blood bank.
