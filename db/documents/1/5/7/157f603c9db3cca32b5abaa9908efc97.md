The effects of diseases that affect Purkinje cells are generally the same, although some disease processes have additional findings in other systems. Usually, such patients have ataxia depending on which areas of the cerebellum are affected.

Various insults are specifically harmful to Purkinje cells, often through excessive glutamatergic stimulation and neurotoxicity or changes in calcium metabolism. Global cerebral hypoxia is explicitly known to harm Purkinje cells early in the course. A variety of genetic conditions also affect Purkinje cells, notably the spinocerebellar ataxias, a family of trinucleotide repeat disorders that cause a buildup of proteins in the nucleus. Phenytoin, lithium, and PCP increase Purkinje cell death, and seizure disorders also increase Purkinje toxicity by glutamate excitotoxicity. Ethanol specifically causes anterior degeneration of Purkinje cells in the adult and apoptosis in the fetus. Many of these toxins take longer to kill cells positive for zebrin-II, the marker mentioned above, due to some combination of increased defenses against free radicals and expression of other proteins that decrease their metabolic effects.
