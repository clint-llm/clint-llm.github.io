The putamen receives its vascular supply from the perforating branches of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA), also known as the lenticulostriate arteries, with variations of the predominance of either ACA or MCA supply.

- Perivascular drainage pathways

- Glymphatic system

- Meningeal lymphatic vessels, olfactory/cervical lymphatic drainage route and their association with CSF circulation

- The connection among different components of the brain lymphatic drainage system

The putamen, as a portion of basal ganglia, has a similar drainage system as the whole brain with structural differences in perivascular spaces compared to the cerebral cortex.
