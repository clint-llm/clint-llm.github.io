The prognosis of a cherry-red spot at the macula varies according to the cause. Most cases of commotion retinae resolve with time, and visual recovery is usually good. CRAO and macular infarction, on the other hand, has a poor visual prognosis, and these eyes mayÂ become painful blind eyes due to neovascular glaucoma. Cases with progressive outer retinal necrosis (PORN) usually lose perception of light. Tay Sachs disease is usually fatal by five years of age.
