Treatment of body lice does not usually require the use of a pediculicide because improvements in hygiene, including showering and laundering clothing in hot water at least 50 C, will most often eradicate the infestation.

Itching can be treated with topical corticosteroids and systemic antihistamines. Secondary skin infections are managed with appropriate systemic antibiotics. While the use of pediculicides is not required for the eradication of body lice infections, they are often utilized, especially if body lice or nits are found on body hair or if there is co-infection with head lice, pubic lice, or scabies.
