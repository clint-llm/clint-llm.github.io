Unfortunately, due to the small number of cases of this rare malignancy, therapeutic guidelines have not been definitively established. Diagnosing hepatic angiosarcoma remains a challenge due to the nonspecificity of presenting symptoms such as weight loss and abdominal pain. Laboratory cancer markers are also non-specific to the diagnosis and diagnosing the tumor on radiological imaging is difficult. Biopsy of the lesion carries risks of bleeding due to the highly vascular nature of cancer. A collaborative effort must be made between an interprofessional team of primary care doctors, hepatologists, radiologists, and pathologists in making a diagnosis. Once a diagnosis of hepatic angiosarcoma is made, prognosis remains very poor, and treatment would include surgery versus palliative care. Surgeons, oncologists, and palliative care providers must get involved at this point to determine the best course of action based on the patientâ€™s wishes and prognosis [Level IV].
