Broca aphasia is often seen in patients with head trauma or a stroke. While the individual has preserved comprehension, they have trouble speaking fluently. These patients often undergo speech therapy but because of their other illnesses are often looked after by nurses. Hence, nurses need to be aware of this speech disorder. Individuals with this disorder may be able to read, but their writing ability may be limited. However, it is important to appreciate the fact that in Broca aphasia, there is a preservation of intellectual and cognitive functions.

Some patients may recover functionally and be able to lead an independent life as long as they do not have other comorbidities or neurological deficits. The recovery after Broca aphasia is often many months or even years, especially if the cause was a stroke. Most people see mild improvement within the first six months, but full recovery can take years. The key is to educate the family members of caregivers who will be looking after the patients.
