**Structure**

The medial knee has three soft tissue layers. The most superficial layer only has a minor role in patellar stability. This layer includes the medial retinaculum. The second layer contains the MPFL, medial collateral ligament, and the patellotibial ligament medially.

The MPFL originates on the femur in a space between the medial epicondyle and adductor tubercle and is superior to the superficial medial collateral ligament.

**Function**

The main function of the MPFL is to stabilize the patella; it is responsible for 50 to 80% of the stability required to prevent lateral patellar dislocation.
