Preparing the wound bed to promote reepithelialization of chronic wounds has been applied to wound management for over a decade. The four general steps to follow for better preparation are compassed in the acronym DIME.

- D: Debridement of nonviable tissue within the Wound.

- I: Management of Inflammation and Infection

- M: Moisture control

- E: Environmental and Epithelialization assessment

The DIME  approach to chronic wound management is a global concept approach from which a more detailed pathway can be initiated to bring about wound resolution.

The primary goal of debridement is to remove all the devitalized tissue from the wound bed to promote wound healing. Debridement is also used for the removal of biofilm, bioburden along with senescent cells, and it is suggested to be performed at each encounter.
