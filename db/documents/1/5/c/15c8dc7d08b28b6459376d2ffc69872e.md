Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is the central measure of left ventricular systolic function. LVEF is the fraction of chamber volume ejected in systole (stroke volume) in relation to the volume of the blood in the ventricle at the end of diastole (end-diastolic volume). Stroke volume is calculated as the difference between EDV and end-systolic volume (ESV). This activity reviews the calculation of LVEF, its clinical relevance and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with depressed LVEF.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the parameters required to calculate the left ventricular ejection fraction.
- Describe conditions associated with a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction.
- Recall the clinical relevance of knowing the pathophysiology of left ventricular ejection fraction.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance management of patients with a depressed LVEF and improve outcomes.
