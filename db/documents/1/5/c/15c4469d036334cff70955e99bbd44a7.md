Major basic protein (MBP) is an eosinophil granule protein. Eosinophil granules contain a crystalloid core comprised of MBP and a matrix consisting of other toxic and pro-inflammatory mediators. MBP is the predominant constituent in eosinophil granules. MBP derives its name from research in guinea pig eosinophils that showed MBP was the majority protein in secondary granules. Increased concentrations of MBP and other cationic proteins have shown correlations with atopic diseases, parasitic infections, and other eosinophil-associated inflammatory processes.
