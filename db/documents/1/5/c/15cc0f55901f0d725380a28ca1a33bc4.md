The most important part about performing an anesthetic on a hemifacial microsomia patient is the preparation. A discussion with the surgical staff before the day of surgery can be extremely helpful in conveying the anatomic variations and potential airway difficulties. The surgeons can give input on potential airway issues, what they are doing, the length of time and estimated blood loss, any potential surgical issues or considerations, their pre-operative assessment, anticipated post-operative care, and maxillomandibular fixation or elastics.

The anesthesia team can discuss their concerns and thoughts on the airway and plans for managing the difficult airway, labs, intraoperative anesthetic and drugs, and other considerations. The nursing staff and techs should be brought on board during a team steps huddle with verification of equipment and a comprehensive case review.
