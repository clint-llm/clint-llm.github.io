Asthma is a chronic disease characterized by airway narrowing (bronchoconstriction), mucous plugging, and inflammation. Symptoms may be chronic, but during exacerbations or flares, those symptoms worsen, and patients experience acute shortness of breath and difficulty with expiration or forced expiration.
