At the histopathological level, CKTR affects all parts of the kidneys, including the arteries, interstitium, glomeruli, and tubules. CAAMR leads to microvascular remodeling in both the glomerular or peritubular capillaries. Glomerular microvascular remodeling leads to TG, which is characterized by double contouring of glomerular capillary walls. Other histopathological features of antibody-mediated injury include peritubular capillary basement membrane multilayering and arterial intimal fibrosis.

CATMR involves mainly the renal interstitium and arteries, leading to tubulitis and chronic allograft arteriopathy, respectively. Tubular inflammation leads to IFTA. Chronic allograft arteriopathy manifests primarily as arterial intimal fibrosis. Since DSAs in CAAMR can stimulate fibrosis of the arterial intima, it is challenging to differentiate arteriopathy secondary to CAAMR and CATMR on the histological level.
