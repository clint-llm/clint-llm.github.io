Healthcare professionals should be knowledgeable about chemical burns from exposure to acids (pH less than 7), alkalis (pH greater than 7), and irritants to recognize, manage and care for these common types of injury. Chemical burns are the result of exposure to a variety of substances commonly found in the home, workplace, and surrounding environment. The burn may be obvious, for example, from a direct spill or other exposure, or more covert, especially in children. Chemical burns can cause short-term, long-term, and lifelong health problems, especially if undertreated. Occasionally, they can result in premature death, especially if ingested in an attempt to self-harm. This activity reviews the pathophysiology and presentation of chemical burns and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the various possible causes of chemical burns.
- Describe the physical exam of a patient with a suspected chemical burn.
- Review the management options available for patients presenting with chemical burns.
- Explain the importance of interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to aid in prompt diagnosis of chemical burns and improving outcomes in patients diagnosed with the condition.
