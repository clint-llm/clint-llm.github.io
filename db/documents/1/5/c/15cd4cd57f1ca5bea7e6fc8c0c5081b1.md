Laryngeal trauma is rare. The incidence of laryngeal trauma ranges between 1 in 14000 and 1 in 30000 of emergency visits.

The mortality rate is approximately 1% with a hospital stay of 13 days or longer if an injury is severe enough to warrant surgical intervention.

In literature, the average age of patients with laryngeal trauma is reportedly approximately 34 to 37 old, but the range is wide from 14 to 84.
