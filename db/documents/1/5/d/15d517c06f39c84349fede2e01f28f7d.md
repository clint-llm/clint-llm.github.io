Hamstring strains are common in both elite and recreational athletes. In addition to being highly prevalent, hamstring injuries are often slow to heal and tend to recur. Nearly one-third of those who suffer from a hamstring injury are estimated to reinjure themselves within one year of returning to their sport.

Typically, hamstring injuries are characterized by pain in the posterior thigh, which can be exacerbated by knee flexion and hip extension. In severe injuries, patients may also report hearing a popping sound. When evaluating a patient with a possible hamstring injury, it is important that clinicians also consider other diagnostic possibilities, such as lumbosacral radiculopathy, adductor strain, or a femoral stress fracture.

Hamstring strain injuries classify as mild (Grade I), moderate (Grade II), or severe (Grade III) based on the severity of patient symptoms.

In the acute phase, hamstring injuries are initially managed with protection, rest, ice, compression, and elevation to limit inflammation and swelling.

In patients who have healed to the point where they can begin therapeutic activities, exercise regimens that focus on eccentric contraction have been shown to shorten recovery time significantly.

Studies have also emphasized the importance of neuromuscular control of the lumbopelvic region. A 2004 prospective randomized study found that patients suffering from acute hamstring strain injury who were rehabilitated using a progressive agility and trunk stabilization program showed lower re-injury rates than those enrolled in a more standard progressive stretching and strengthening program.
