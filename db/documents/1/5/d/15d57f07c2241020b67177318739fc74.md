The differential diagnosis for a patient with PFS is quite broad and can be divided into 6 anatomic areas, as discussed earlier. These include patellofemoral OA, Osgood Schlatter's disease, plica, bursitis (prepatellar or Hoffa's), Saphenous neuritis, quadriceps tendinopathy, patellar tendinopathy, or referred pain from hip or back. Due to the broad differential, the clinician must perform a thorough history and physical exam to recognize certain risk factors and effectively treat the patient.
