AVAPS is a relatively newer modality of non-invasive ventilation and it necessitates good collaboration amongst the interprofessional team of medical professionals to ensure the appropriate selection of candidates for average volume-assured pressure support.

Operating a ventilator is occasionally considered difficult, and requires good experience and training to ensure successful therapy without causing any negative harm. The nurses have little knowledge of operating the ventilators. To avert the risks associated with it, effective communication, and teamwork between the critical care specialist, pulmonologist, internist, critical care nurse, and the healthcare workers in the ICU is essential to resuscitate the patient and improve patient outcomes.
