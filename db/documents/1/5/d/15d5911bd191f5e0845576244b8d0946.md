The infection-related mortality in SBP is very low with appropriate treatment. However,Â the mortality rate is quite high in those patients who develop sepsis. But with appropriate antibiotic therapy, better outcomes can be achieved. In hospital settings, the non-infection-related mortality in SBP patients can be as high as 20-40 percent, and one to two years of mortality rates are 70 and 80 percent, respectively.
