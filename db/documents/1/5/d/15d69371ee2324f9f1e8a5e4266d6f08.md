It begins with full history and examination. Then, routine investigations may be done. Serum levels of various tumor markers may not be raised in SCSTs as already described; hence imaging gathers a more significant role.

**Imaging**

Testicular ultrasound has been the primary imaging modality for the diagnosis of testicular tumors. It is safe, cost-efficient, and repeatable, with no risk of harmful radiation exposure. LCT shows an isolated hypoechoic infra-centric mass with clear demarcation from the adjacent stroma. Intrinsic hypervascularization is seen in association with a typical peripheral rim pattern. Other imaging modalities include contrast-enhanced CT of thorax, abdomen, and pelvis to catch any metastatic lesions, and an MRI brain may be done for suspected brain metastasis.

**Radical Inguinal Orchiectomy and Retroperitoneal Lymph Node Dissection (RPLND)**

Strong suggestion of testicular mass and/or ultrasound evidence should undergo radical inguinal orchiectomy. It allows for definitive histological diagnosis and also local tumor control. A biopsy is contraindicated in testicular tumors. RPLND is the gold standard in identifying nodal micrometastasis and providing the real pathologic staging of retroperitoneal disease. The number and size of lymph nodes have prognostic implications.
