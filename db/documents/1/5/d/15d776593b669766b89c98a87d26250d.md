Decortication must be performed by trained thoracic surgeons. The operating team consists of an anesthesiologist, surgical assistants, technical assistant, and the nursing staff. An experienced pulmonologist and radiologist must be engaged in the care of these patients as they play a vital role in the preoperative and postoperative management and decision-making. Patients undergoing decortication for chronic empyema might also require intensive monitoring in the intensive care unit (ICU) during the initial postoperative period.
