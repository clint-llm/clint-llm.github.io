Single-lung ventilation involves ventilating one lung and letting the other collapse to provide surgical exposure in the thoracic cavity or isolating ventilation to one lung. The protective role of single-lung ventilation involves protecting one lung from the ill effects of fluid from the other lung, which may be blood, lavage fluid, or malignant or purulent secretions. Thus, perfect placement of the tube is essential, as a misplaced tube defeats the goal of lung isolation or differential ventilation. Bronchoscopy after tube placement ensures proper placement. This activity reviews the technique, indications, and contraindications of single-lung ventilation. The role of the interprofessional team in the preoperative workup of patients undergoing lung resection is discussed.

**Objectives:**
- Implement best practices in the preoperative workup of patients needing lung surgery.

- Determine the appropriate indications for single-lung ventilation.
- Select the appropriate method for single-lung ventilation.
- Coordinate with the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients undergoing single-lung ventilation for pulmonary resection.
