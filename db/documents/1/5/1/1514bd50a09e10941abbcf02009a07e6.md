Inoculating the bursa with infections bacteria causes septic bursitis. This happens most often from micro-trauma or direct puncture of the overlying skin causing subsequent infection. Contiguous spread of overlying cellulitis of the skin is also a common cause of superficial septic bursitis. In 80% to 90% of cases, Staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism in acute septic bursitis and Streptococcus species being the next. Other organisms include Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Chronic, infectious bursitis is likely due to atypical mycobacteria and fungi and should warrant prompt evaluation for systemic infection.
