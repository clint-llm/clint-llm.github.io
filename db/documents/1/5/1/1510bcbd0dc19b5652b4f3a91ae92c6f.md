The diagnosis and management of medication overuse headaches are complex and best done with an interprofessional team that includes clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), possibly specialists, nursing staff, and pharmacists. Educating the patient and family on the importance of limiting acute medication use is vital in preventing medication overuse headaches. The underlying psychiatric condition must be addressed, and a referral to a mental health professional can be helpful. All interprofessional team members are responsible for contributing from their areas of expertise, documenting any change in patient status, and communicating their observations with other team members as appropriate so therapeutic interventions can occur if necessary.

Following successful weaning, about half of patients relapse after five years; thus, it is essential to have the patient follow-up regularly. Once the patient's medication overuse headaches have resolved, tapering them off the preventative medication may be considered. There are no specific guidelines, but some professionals suggest tapering prophylactic medication after one year.
