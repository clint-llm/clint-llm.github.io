It is difficult to determine the exact incidence of penetrating or blunt trauma, causing tracheobronchial tears since most victims would not survive to hospital admission. The overall incidence of tracheobronchial injury in post mortem series was 2% to 3%, which includes the victims who died at the spot.

In a 20 year study on airway structures published in 1992 identified transverse tears in 74% of the patients (of which 4% being in the cervical trachea, and 12% in the intrathoracic trachea with the remaining injuries in the right main bronchus, left main bronchus and lobar bronchus (25,17 and 16% in that order), vertical tears in 18% (6.5% in the cervical trachea,10% in the intrathoracic trachea and 1.5% main bronchi) with the remaining 8% being complex injuries involving trachea and right or both main bronchi.

Survival in blunt trauma is expected to be less than with penetrating injury since multiple severe associated injuries are much more common in the former. Study on 104 patients with tracheobronchial injury over 15 years showed an overall mortality of 23%, and the mortality in a blunt injury being twice more than penetrating tracheobronchial injury (36 versus 16%).

It is much difficult to determine the incidence of iatrogenic tracheobronchial tears since most often, they are under detected or under-reported. The incidence of tracheobronchial injury with a single-lumen endotracheal tube is aboutÂ  0.005 %, and the double-lumen tube is between 0.005% to 0.19%
