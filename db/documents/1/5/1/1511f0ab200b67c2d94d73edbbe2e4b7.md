Historically, myocardial protection was the cardiac anesthetist's duty/responsibility; however, nowadays, it is a joint responsibility of the surgeon, perfusionist, and anesthetist. To derive good outcomes, a complete picture of the heart must be reviewed beforehand by the surgeon regardless of the type of operation. Coronary anatomy must be reviewed even in valve operations. Cardiologists must perform an echo even in coronary artery bypass grafting surgeries.

Evidence-based guidelines regarding the best myocardial protection strategy are not available because of the heterogeneity in patients' characteristics.

Nevertheless, several questionnaires revealed that most surgeons favor blood cardioplegia over other USA and UK techniques.

In the postoperative period, the nursing staff must be aware of any inadvertent defect in myocardial protection during the surgery and other unexpected events. This sometimes reveals a few hours later after leaving the theatre, and the charge nurse should be extra vigilant in responding to this.

As an aside, the del Nido solution may be an alternative to Buckberg (method) solution. Del Nido may be superior in the reduction of calcium-induced cellular dysfunction, given its composition.  It also contains no glucose and hence may be advantageous in intraoperative glycemic control.
