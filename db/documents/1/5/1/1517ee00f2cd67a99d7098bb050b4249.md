Complications of tissue expanders and implants are similar to those seen in cosmetic breast implant augmentation. Care must be taken intraoperatively to achieve hemostasis. Hematomas have high rates of infections and can increase the chance of capsular contracture. Prompt evacuation of hematomas must be performed once recognized, as this represents a true surgical emergency owing to the risk of loss of the overlying skin and soft-tissue envelope. Tissue expander and implant infection can lead to multiple procedures; while rare, this is potentially devastating, requiring removal and ultimately repeat placement once the infection has resolved. Bleeding and infection are reported to occur at an incidence of 1% to 2%, respectively.

Skin flap necrosis resulting from overly-aggressive inflation of tissue expanders can be devastating, and care must be taken to ensure adequate blood flow and not be overly aggressive when performing tissue expansion. Patient education is paramount, and any complaint of persistent or unusually severe pain or patient-reported color change to the overlying skin warrants immediate examination and possible partial deflation of the expander. Long-term complications are the most frequently encountered and can be minor or very distressing, but typically do not jeopardize the ultimate success of the reconstruction. These include skin rippling, capsular contracture, infection, and implant rupture. Planned follow-up with patients should be routine to monitor the implants for such delayed complications.

Capsular contractures are a fibrotic scar that forms around the implant as an extreme example of a foreign body reaction. It causes tightening of the implant, may displace its location and may make the breast feel abnormally firm and painful. Contractures are graded based on the Baker scale. Baker Grade I is a normal, soft breast that appears to be in natural shape and size, and therefore no discernable capsule is noted. Baker II is a slightly firm feeling implant with a normal appearance. Baker III is where the contracture causes the breast to firm and appears abnormal. In Baker IV, the breast is hard, distorted, and painful. Surgical intervention should be considered for grade III and IV. Grade II to Grade I contractures may still evolve; therefore, special consideration should be given to these patients and their implants more frequently monitored.

Recently, there has been a link with implants to T-cell anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Although most studies have been anecdotal, there seems to be linked to the textured implants because of the "salt-loss" technique causing chronic inflammation, bacterial biofilm, or other unknown causes. This is an emerging indication for breast implant removal, and research into etiology, specific risk factors, and treatment is ongoing. The incidence is estimated at approximately 1 in 2,400 to 1 in 30,000 based on a series of over 3,000 patients published in 2020 from Memorial Sloan-Kettering.
