Stones can form in the urinary tract anywhere from kidneys to the urethra. They can form in the calyceal system (major or minor calyx), ureteropelvic junction, ureter, or bladder. The physiology of stone formation is complex, with many factors that come into play.

Most renal stones start as Randall plaque in the kidney. It is a calcium plaque that is deposited in the interstitial tissue of the renal papilla. In calcium oxalate stone formers, the calcification is invariably located in the basement membrane of the loops of Henle. This is where urinary stones are believed to be formed. These plaques initially start in membranes below the kidney urothelium and then progressively increase in size into the urinary system until regions of plaques are exposed to urine. Once they are in continuous contact with urine, crystal layers typically begin to organize on the nidus through aggregation and epitaxy. The supersaturation of urine with crystals is a common phenomenon occurring in all cases of renal calculi.

Calcium oxalate stones are the most common urolithiasis and tend to form when the urinary pH is under 7.2, as well as uric acid stones. Acidic urine (not hyperuricosuria) is the leading cause of uric acid stone formation. Calcium phosphate predominant stones tend to form in more alkaline urine. The most common renal calculi are calcium-containing, followed by urate crystals.
