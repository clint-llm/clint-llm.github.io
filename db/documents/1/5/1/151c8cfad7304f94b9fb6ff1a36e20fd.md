Patients with UDT are at increased risk of infertility, testicular cancer in both testes, and testicular torsion. There is a 40 times increased risk of testicular cancer in the UDT, and the contralateral testis, even if located in the scrotum, has about a 20% increased cancer risk compared to the general population.

Seminoma is the most common malignant tumor associated with undescended testicles. Orchiopexy should be performed after six months and before 18 months of age to reduce the risks of infertility and development of cancer.
