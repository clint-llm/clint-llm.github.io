The popliteal vein is responsible for much of the drainage from the lower leg. The vein drains into the femoral veins which flows into the inferior vena cava to return to the right atrium of the heart. The posterior tibial vein, peroneal vein, and the anterior tibial vein are all deep veins of the lower leg that converge to form the popliteal vein at the level of the popliteus muscle. The small saphenous vein is a superficial vessel that drains the posterior, lower leg, and empties into the popliteal vein.

The popliteal vein is found within the popliteal fossa. The popliteal fossa is defined by the biceps femoris proximolaterally; the semimembranosus and semitendinosus muscles proximomedially; and gastrocnemius distally. The tibial nerve, popliteal vein, and popliteal artery are all found within the fossa. The structures present from medial to laterally in the following order: popliteal artery, popliteal vein, and tibial nerve.Â After leaving the popliteal fossa, the vein passes through the adductor hiatus which is found in the adductor magnus muscle and is renamed to the femoral vein.

The superficial compartment of the thigh contains the subcutaneous tissues between the skin and muscle fascia while the deep compartment includes the tissues deep to the muscular fascia. The superficial compartment contains superficial and perforating veins. The deep compartment contains the deep veins. The communication between the compartments occurs with perforating veins.
