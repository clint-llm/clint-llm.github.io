**History**

The clinician should have high clinical suspicion for caput succedaneum when evaluating swelling present on a newbornsâ€™ scalp when the following risk factors are present:

- Protracted labor

- Maternal nulliparity

- Vacuum-assisted delivery

- Forceps assisted delivery

- Oligohydramnios

- Premature rupture of membranes

- Macrosomia

**Physical Exam**

Caput succedaneum can be reliably assessed as early as the first stage of labor with a digital vaginal examination of the mass on the scalp and ultrasound.
