Esophageal ulcers caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) occurs when excessive reflux of acid and pepsin results in necrosis of the surface layers of esophageal mucosa, causing erosions and ulcers. The prolonged period of gastric acid exposure and bile salts often determines the extent of an esophageal mucosal injury. Other contributing factors to ulcer formation include decreased contraction of the LES causing reduced gastric acid clearance from the esophagus. Furthermore, persistent chronic GERD with a decreased resting tone of the upper esophageal sphincter can precipitate laryngopharyngeal symptoms such as throat clearing, chronic cough, and sore throat.

Ingestion of alkalies such as ammonia or sodium hydroxide acutely results in a penetrating injury causing liquefactive necrosis. The acid-induced injury typically produces a superficial coagulation necrosis that thromboses the underlying mucosal blood vessels and consolidates the connective tissue causing a protective eschar.

Pill-induced esophageal ulceration occurs from local burns exerted by the pills on the esophageal mucosa. This occurs more with pills that have a low pH, causing a destruction of the cryoprotective barrier of the mucosa and forming an ulcer.
