The major functions of the abdominal wall include:

- Providing a durable and flexible covering to prevent the abdominal visceraÂ from leaving the abdominal cavity.

- Protecting internal abdominal organs from trauma/injury.

- Maintaining the anatomical position of the abdominal organs.

- Assisting expiration by pushing the abdominal organs towards the diaphragm.

- Assisting in coughing and vomiting by increasing intra-abdominal pressure.
