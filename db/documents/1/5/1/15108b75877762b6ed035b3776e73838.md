**Pathoanatomy of Specific Nerve Injuries**

High radial nerve injuries occur above the elbow and lead to deficits in:

- Wrist extension with denervation of the brachioradialis, extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL), extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB), and extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU)

- Finger MCP extension with denervation of the extensor digitorum communis (EDC), extensor indicis proprius (EIP), and extensor digit minimi (EDM)

- Thumb radial abduction and extension with denervation of the extensor pollicis longus (EPL)

- Sensation in the superficial radial nerve distribution.

Low radial nerve injuries occur distal to the elbow and affect muscles innervated by the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN). These injuries typically have no sensory deficits because they occur distal to where the superficial radial nerve branches off the radial nerve, but result in the following motor deficits:

- Weakness in wrist extension as the innervation to the ECU is lost, but the ECRL innervation is often maintained leading to radial deviation with wrist extension.

- Finger MCP extension weakness secondary to denervation of the EDC, EIP, and EDM

- Thumb radial abduction and extension weakness secondary to denervation of the EPL.

High median nerve injury occurs proximal to the elbow joint and leads to weakness of:

- Thumb opposition secondary to denervation of the superficial head of the flexor pollicis brevis (FPB), abductor pollicis brevis (APB), and the opponens pollicis

- Thumb interphalangeal (IP) flexion secondary to denervation of the flexor pollicis longus (FPL)

- Distal interphalangeal (DIP) flexion secondary to denervation of the index and long finger flexor digitorum profundus (FDP)

- Proximal interphalangeal (PIP) flexion secondary to denervation of the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS)

- Forearm pronation secondary to denervation of the pronator teres and pronator quadratus

- Wrist flexion secondary to denervation of the flexor carpi radialis (FCR), ulnar deviation occurs with wrist flexion since the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) is intact

- Sensory deficits in the thumb, index, long, and radial half of the ring fingers.

Low median nerve injuries occur distal to the elbow resulting in the following motor and sensory deficits:

- Thumb opposition secondary to denervation of the superficial head of the FPB, APB, and the opponens pollicis

- Sensory deficits in the thumb, index, long, and radial half of the ring fingers.

High ulnar nerve injuries occur proximal to the elbow leading to deficits in:

- Ring and small finger DIP flexion secondary to denervation of the FDP

- Ring and small finger MCP flexion secondary to denervation of the interossei and ring and small finger lumbricals

- Pinch strength secondary to denervation of the adductor pollicis (ADP), deep head of the flexor pollicis brevis (FPB), and 1st dorsal interosseus

- Sensory deficits both volarly and dorsally in small finger, ulnar half of the ring finger, and on the ulnar third of the palm.

Low ulnar nerve injuries occur at the level of the wrist leading to deficits in:

- Ring and small finger MCP flexion secondary to denervation of the interossei and ring and small finger lumbricals

- Pinch strength secondary to denervation of the ADP, deep head of FPB, and 1st dorsal interosseus

- Sensory deficits on the volar aspect of the small finger and ulnar half of the ring finger.
