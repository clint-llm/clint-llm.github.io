Radial tunnel syndrome can be differentiated from PIN compression syndrome by the chief complaint of isolated dorsoradial proximal forearm pain without weakness. Unfortunately, some patients may seem weak on physical examination secondary to pain, making the diagnosis difficult. Sotereanos et al. performed a retrospective review of 28 surgical radial tunnel releases and reported good results in 11 cases (39%). Poor satisfaction following surgical release was observed in patients with other nerve compression syndromes (carpal tunnel or cubital tunnel syndrome) and those involved in worker’s compensation claims.
