Disulfiram is one of three drugs approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) to treat alcohol dependence. It is a second-line option (acamprosate and naltrexone are first-line treatments) in patients with sufficient clinical supervision. Disulfiram is safe and efficient in supervised short-term and long-term treatment of individuals dependent on alcohol but motivated to discontinue alcohol use. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, pharmacology, monitoring, and relevant interactions of disulfiram, pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the treatment of patients with misuse syndromes that will respond to such therapy.

**Objectives:**
- Review the approved indications for disulfiram therapy.
- Identify the mechanism of action of disulfiram based on the indication for which it is used.
- Outline the adverse effects of disulfiram.
- Summarize the importance of interprofessional communication, improving care coordination among the interprofessional team when initiating disulfiram therapy.
