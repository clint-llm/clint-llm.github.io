Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a group of more than 60 different neoplasms that can originate from any location throughout the human body and affect individuals at the extremes of age. From skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, blood, and lymphatics to connective tissue and peripheral nerves, these neoplasms can span a range of clinical presentations from benign lipomas to aggressive metastatic angiosarcomas.
