Treatment of contrecoup brain injury depends on the severity of the injury. For those lesions that do not require immediate surgical decompression, close clinical monitoring with repeat head CT at 12 or 24 hours is indicated. Some patients with decreased neurological status with a Glasgow coma scale of 8 or lower should have intracranial pressure monitoring and are treated as per the trauma guidelines.
