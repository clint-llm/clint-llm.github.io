Genetic risk factors of phyllodes tumors are largely unknown, but the literature describes phyllodes tumors in Li-Fraumeni syndrome patients and a mother and daughter pair.

Researchers have postulated that stromal induction of phyllodes tumors can occur due to growth factors produced by the breast epithelium. Trauma, pregnancy, increased estrogen activity, and lactation are occasionally implicated as factors stimulating tumor growth. The nature of these factors is not well understood, but endothelin-1, a stimulator of breast fibroblast growth, might be a contributory factor.
