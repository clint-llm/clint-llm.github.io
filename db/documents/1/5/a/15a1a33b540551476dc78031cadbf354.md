This activity outlines the current scientific literature and knowledge of the risks and benefits of inhaling nicotine through proprietary devices. It discusses the largely unknown and unquantified risks, and a dramatic increase in the use of these devices, particularly in pediatric populations, as well as the role of the interprofessional team in recommending these devices.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the risks of inhaling nicotine through electronic devices. 
- Review the at-risk populations for electronic nicotine delivery systems. 
- Summarize the long term risks for inhaling nicotine through electronic devices.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients addicted to nicotine.
