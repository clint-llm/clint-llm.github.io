The most common type of epiretinal membranes is idiopathic and is common in patients over the age of 50. Approximately 20% of patients over the age of 75 have an epiretinal membrane with both sexes equally affected. Some reports show a slightly higher incidence in females.

In a multi-ethnic study of the United States population done in 2011 involving 5960 participants aged 45 to 84 years, it was shown that Chinese(39%) show significantly higher prevalence compared to Hispanics (29.3%), Whites (27.5%) and Blacks (26.2%).

In a multicentric meta-analysis of population-based studies involving 40,000 participants, it was shown that 9% had some form of ERM. Epiretinal membranes are classified into two groups: one with retinal folds called preretinal macular fibrosis (PMF) and second without retinal folds called cellophane macula reflex (CMR). Of the ERM patients, 6.5% had CMR, and 2.6% had an advanced form of PMF. Older and female participants showed a higher risk.

The Blue Mountains studyÂ was done over five years to study the incidence and progression of epiretinal membranes in the older Australian population.
