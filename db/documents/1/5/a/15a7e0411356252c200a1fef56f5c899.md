**Anterior Fontanelle**

The anterior fontanelle is the largest of the six fontanelles, and it resembles a diamond-shape ranging in size from 0.6 cm to 3.6 cm with a mean of 2.1 cm.

The average closure time of the anterior fontanelle ranges from 13 to 24 months.

In addition to being the largest, the anterior fontanelle is also the most important clinically.

**Posterior Fontanelle**

Unlike the anterior fontanelle, the posterior fontanelle is triangular and completely closes within about six to eight weeks after birth.

**Mastoid Fontanelle**

The mastoid fontanelle, a paired structure, can be found at the intersection of temporal, parietal, and occipital bones. Additionally, the mastoid fontanelle also has the name of the posterolateral fontanelle. These fontanelles may close anywhere from six to eighteen months of age.

**Sphenoid Fontanelle**

Similarly, the sphenoid fontanelle is also paired. Its location can be on either side of the skull at the convergence of the sphenoid, parietal, temporal, and frontal bone. It is also known as the anterolateral fontanelle; their closure occurs at approximately the sixth-month mark after birth.

**Third Fontanel**

Uniquely, a third fontanelle between the anterior and posterior fontanelles correlates with certain conditions like Down syndrome and congenital infectionsÂ such as rubella. The reported frequency of this third fontanelle has been 6.4% in an unselected population of 1020 newborns.
