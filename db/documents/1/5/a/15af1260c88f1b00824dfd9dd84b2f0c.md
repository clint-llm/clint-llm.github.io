Acute beryllium sensitivity and Berylliosis should be suspected in any patient presenting with respiratory complaints alongside known or suspected beryllium exposure. Acute beryllium toxicity will typically occur after exposure levels of 25 to 100 μg/m. It will typically manifest with inflammation of the upper and lower respiratory tract, similar to other cases of chemical pneumonitis.

People with acute beryllium toxicity may present with cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, hemoptysis, palpitations, decreased appetite, or fever. Beryllium sensitivity can develop after initial exposure, and those who are sensitized can be asymptomatic.

Skin manifestations of beryllium exposure include dermatitis, beryllium ulcers, and dermal granulomas. Chronic, non-healing ulcers may result from beryllium implantation into an abrasion or laceration in the skin, with excision required for treatment.

The most common complaints of patients presenting with chronic beryllium disease are dyspnea with exertion, dry cough, unintended weight loss, night sweats, and fatigue.
