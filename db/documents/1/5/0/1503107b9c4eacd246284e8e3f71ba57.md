The pathophysiology of cardiac disease in SSc involves repeated abnormal vasoreactivity with coronary microvascular ischemia, reperfusion injury, and myocardial inflammation. Microvascular changes are often seen in the endocardium, whereas lesions suggestive of macrovascular coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis do not appear to be increased in SSc. It appears that microcirculation changes similar to Raynaud changes in peripheral circulation occur in the myocardium. These Recurrent episodes of ischemia and reperfusion often result in contraction band necrosis and replacement fibrosis. The result is an increased myocardial stiffness with reduced compliance. This is thought to be the cause of diastolic dysfunction in SSc, which is known to be associated with increase mortality. The changes in coronary microcirculation are thought to be reversible in early disease, with irreversible structural changes occurring late with disease progression. Acute myocarditis can also occur in SSc and is often reported to be associated with skeletal myositis.
