Reporting of medical errors is the first step to improving medical care. It relies on the development of policies that address the root cause of medical errors and the provision of clear communication and training to all members of the healthcare team. Nurses, therapists, mid-level providers, and physicians all play an essential but unique role in delivering appropriate patient care. Therefore, representation of all members of the medical team should have representation on policy boards that review medical incident reports and develop policies to prevent future such errors. Once these policies are in place, members of medical regulatory boards need to communicate new policies clearly to all members of the healthcare team.
