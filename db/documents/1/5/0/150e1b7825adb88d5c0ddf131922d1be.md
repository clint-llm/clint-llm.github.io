Vitamin K toxicity is extremely rare. The only reported toxicity comes from menadione, which has no use in humans. Its toxicity is thought to be associated with its water-soluble properties. When toxicity does occur, it manifests with signs of jaundice, hyperbilirubinemia, hemolytic anemia, and kernicterus in infants.

The mechanism by which toxicity occurs with menadione is the increased oxygen uptake in the liver, leading to a significant increase in lipid peroxidation, which in turn causes cell damage and death. Hepatocyte damage leads to the associated signs of vitamin K toxicity.
