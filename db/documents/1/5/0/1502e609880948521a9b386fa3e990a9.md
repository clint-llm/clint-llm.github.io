The SC joint itself receives direct supply by the medial supraclavicular nerve (C3-C4) and the nerve to subclavius (C5-C6). It is also worth mentioning nerves involved in the various movements at the joint.

- Elevation: accomplished by the levator scapulae, upper trapezius, rhomboid major and minor muscles

- Innervation: dorsal scapular nerve, C5 ventral ramus, C3-C4 ventral rami

- Depression: pectoralis minor, lower trapezius, serratus anterior and inferior muscles

- innervation: medial pectoral nerve, spinal accessory nerve, long thoracic nerve

- Protraction: pectoralis minor, serratus anterior muscles

- Innervation: medial pectoral nerve, long thoracic nerve

- Retraction: middle trapezius, latissimus dorsi, rhomboid major and minor muscles

- innervation: spinal accessory nerve, thoracodorsal nerve, dorsal scapular nerve

- Rotation via elevation of the glenoid cavity: upper and lower trapezius, serratus anterior and inferior muscles

- Innervation: suprascapular nerve, axillary nerve, long thoracic nerve

- Rotation via depression of the glenoid cavity: levator scapulae, latissimus dorsi, pectoralis minor, rhomboid major and minor muscles

- Innervation: dorsal scapular nerve, thoracodorsal nerve, medial pectoral nerve, dorsal scapular nerve
