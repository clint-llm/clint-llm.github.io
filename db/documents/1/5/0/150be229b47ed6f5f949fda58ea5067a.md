An interprofessional team is needed in order to execute every successful procedure. Cardiac surgeons perform this procedure while general anesthesia from either an anesthesiologist or a certified registered nurse anesthetistÂ (CRNA) is provided pre and post cardiopulmonary bypass. The perfusion team maintains the patient's hemodynamics while on cardio-pulmonary bypass. The OR staff, including the nurses and scrub techs, are also very important as they assist the surgeon throughout the entire case.

Postoperatively, cardiac intensivists help aid in the management of the patient's care along with cardiologists. Echo techs are available to evaluate the effectiveness of the valve through either transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiogram. Postoperatively, rehab specialists and physical therapy teams play a pivotal role in preparing the patient for discharge home. It is clear that the Manougian procedure is one of great detail and requires precision. While there are various different roles that must be taken throughout the patients stay, interprofessional interventions and communication are vital to the success and outcomes of the patient.
