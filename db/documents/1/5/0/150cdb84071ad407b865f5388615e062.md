- **Coronary artery dissection**– This complication is related to percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Certain types of coronary artery dissections are associated with an increased incidence of vessel closure and myocardial infarction, which depends on the degree of dissection and the effect that it has on flow.

- **Intramural hematoma**– Coronary intramural hematoma develops when blood accumulates in the vessel media; this can be best identified with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), although it can also be seen on coronary angiography. These lesions can present as acute coronary syndromes following a previous PCI.

- **Perforation**– Perforation of coronary arteries can result from guidewires, atherectomy devices, and balloons. The degree of perforation affects prognosis. Class I perforations include an intramural crater without extravasation and carry a very low risk of myocardial infarction. Class II perforations are 1 mm or greater with cavity spilling. Class III lesions correlate with myocardial infarction in up to 50% of lesions.
