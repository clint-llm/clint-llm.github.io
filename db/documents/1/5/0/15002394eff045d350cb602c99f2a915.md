Isotretinoin is an orally administered systemic retinoid. At a pharmacologic strength of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg per day, isotretinoin is an effective acne therapy. While the exact mechanism of action is unknown, isotretinoin inhibits sebaceous gland function and keratinization at pharmacologic doses. The drug has been observed to reduce both the sebaceous gland size and sebum production.

In neuroblastoma (off-label use), isotretinoin has been shown to decrease cell proliferation and induce differentiation.
