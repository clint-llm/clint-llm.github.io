The appendiceal malignancy TNM staging has been comprehensively revised over the last 8 years and several modifications were added to the former seventh edition. While appendiceal cancers have been classified as a distinct spectrum and separated from colorectal cancers in the seventh edition, the following distinguished modifications are allocated to the eighth edition; 1)Â low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms were introduced as T in situ, 2) T4 tumors definitions have been expanded from the tumors with visceral peritoneal perforation indexes and include those with the presence of mucin on the serosal layer of the appendix and or mesoappendix, 3) Similar to the colorectal TNM classification, any evidence of tumor deposits, including the presence of satellite lesions in the subserosal layer, without any metastatic lymphadenopathy should be categorized as N1c, 4) Sub-category of M1c (non-peritoneal metastasis) has been added, and the specific category of pseudomyxoma peritonei was removed from M1a.

**Stage classification**

Appendiceal carcinomas are categorized into two main subtypes of mucinous and nonmucinous. Histological grading to include G1 to G3 grades as the poorly differentiated appendiceal carcinomas are specifically important in the grading of metastatic mucinous appendiceal carcinomas. Moreover, two subcategories of intraperitoneal acellular mucin and intraperitoneal grade 1 tumor were added to stage IVA.
