Empty sella syndrome is a rare entity that is usually found incidentally during the evaluation of headaches or other complaints leading to imaging of the brain/head. Although only a small fraction of these patients have associated hormone deficiencies, a full pituitary hormone workup is the indicated screening approach at diagnosis, and the patients should receive an endocrinologist referral. The optimal management approach is an interprofessional team of specialty-trained nurses and clinicians providing regular follow-up, education of the patient and family, coordination of care, and laboratory evaluation.
