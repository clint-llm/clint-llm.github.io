Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Six carcinogenicity bioassays were evaluated with permethrin. No tumorigenicity has been observed in the rat studies. However, the three mouse studies saw an increase in pulmonary adenomas. In one of these studies, there was a raised incidence of pulmonary alveolar-cell carcinomas and benign liver adenomas in female mice. Permethrin exhibited no mutagenic potential inÂ genetic toxicity studies(in vitro and in vivo). Permethrin did not have any adverse impact on the reproductive function when given orally at a dose of 180 mg/kg/day in a three-generation rat study. (Manufacturer's labeling).

In humans, permethrin's postulated lethal oral dose is 1 to 2 grams/kilogram of human body weight.
