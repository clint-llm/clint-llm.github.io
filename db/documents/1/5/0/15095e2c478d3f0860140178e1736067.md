Families who receive a prenatal diagnosis of 47,XYY syndrome should receive genetic counseling to aid in their understanding of the disease. Treatment of this syndrome is generally only supportive, with attention given to the comorbidities ofÂ the patient. Boys who are diagnosed with Jacobs syndrome may benefit from speech therapy and behavioral interventions from qualified professionals. Occupational therapy may be needed if hypotonia is present. Patients may benefit from supplemental or special educational resources if learning disabilities exist. Appropriate medical treatment for any comorbid condition such as asthma or seizure disorder should be elicited from a licensed clinician. Men with infertility should receive a comprehensive evaluation from a qualified reproductive endocrinologist. Hormonal imbalances, if found, may need to be corrected. Patients who are having difficulty achieving pregnancy due to low sperm counts may need to undergo in-vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection.
