Young syndrome is a rare disorder with a classic presentation. An interprofessional team, including a pulmonologist, urologist, internist, gynecologist, infectious disease expert, geneticist, and nurse practitioner, is ideal for managing these patients. Because of recurrent infections, these patients need long term follow-up.

It is important to diagnose the disorder to prevent complications promptly, and close follow-up of the patient is essential. It is also highly advisable to provide genetic counseling to other family members.
