Almost 40% of fetuses die during labor, and one-third of the surviving fetuses are delivered preterm. The median survival for Edwards syndrome ranges from 3 days to 14.5 days. The survival percentage is 60% to 75% at the first week, 20% to 40%  at one month, and  10% at one year. 5% to 10% of Edwards syndrome patients survive beyond the first year of life.

Female infants with Edwards syndrome have greater chances of survival than male infants. Few cases of Edwards syndrome of mosaicism type have more prolonged survival compared to the classic type. The most important causes of mortality are cardiac failure due to cardiac defects, respiratory failure due to obstructive apnea, pulmonary hypertension, hypoventilation, and central apnea.
