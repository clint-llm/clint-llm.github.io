Liver lesions have a broad spectrum of pathologies ranging from benign liver lesions such as hemangiomas to malignant lesions such as primary hepatocellular carcinoma and metastasis. Imaging is a crucial step in diagnosing these conditions as liver enzymes can be elevated in 9% of people in the U.S. This activity will review liver imaging for an interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Review the options of liver imaging with an emphasis on CT and MRI.
- Outline the indications for each liver imaging option.
- Summarize the complications of liver imaging.
- Describe the interprofessional strategies for improving liver imaging.
