Modafinil is a stimulant medication that is generally safe, well-tolerated, and carries a low potential for abuse and dependence. It is used to treat excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy, sleep work shift disorder, and obstructive sleep apnea. It is often used in conjunction with other medical and lifestyle treatments for these conditions. Most patients can safely receive modafinil, although it should be used cautiously in patients with structural cardiac disease, severe hepatic impairment, or a history of psychosis/mania. Although no specific monitoring is recommended for patients on modafinil, nurses, pharmacists, and physicians should be aware of the possible drug-drug interactions, including oral contraceptive pills. That is why the prescriber should consult with a pharmacist and conduct a thorough evaluation of all existing medications. Nursing should monitor patient results and also check for signs of adverse reactions at each visit. This interprofessional approach will optimize therapy with modafinil. [Level 5]
