There are various causes for cardiopulmonary arrest in adults which varies by age and population. However, patients diagnosed with cardiac disease are more susceptible to having a cardiac arrest. Furthermore, it can be classified into different categories, which include cardiac, respiratory, and traumatic causes. But 75% of cardiac arrest incidents are believed to be due to coronary artery diseases.

**Cardiac Causes**

**Coronary Artery Disease**

Coronary artery abnormalities:

- Anomalous coronary artery anatomy.

- Acute lesions (platelet aggregation, plaque fissuring, acute thrombosis).

- Chronic atherosclerosis.

- coronary artery spasm

Myocardial Infarction:

- Acute

- Healed

****Myocardial Hypertrophy****

- Secondary

- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

- Nonobstructive
- Obstructive

****Valvular Heart Disease****

********Infiltrative****and********Inflammatory********Disorders****

- Infiltrative diseases

- Noninfectious inflammatory diseases

- Myocarditis

**Dilated Cardiomyopathy**

**Electrophysiologic Abnormalities**

****Inherited Disorders****

- Early repolarization syndrome.

- Brugada syndrome

- Short QT syndrome.

- Long QT syndrome.

- Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia

**Heart Failure**

- Ejection fraction less than 35%

**Congenital disease**

- ****Tetralogy of Fallot

**Respiratory Causes**

- 
**Airway obstruction:**

- 
              
- Bronchospasm due to (pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage, and pneumonia)
              
              
- Severe asthma or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).

- 
**Pulmonary Embolism**

- **Respiratory Muscle Weakness:**due to spinal cord injury.

**Traumatic Causes**

Overall, the prevalence of cardiac causes is around 50% to 60%. Whilst, the second most common cause that is respiratory insufficiency is around 15% to 40%.
