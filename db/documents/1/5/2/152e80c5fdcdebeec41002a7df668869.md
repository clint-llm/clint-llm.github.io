A majority of patients with focal nodular hyperplastic lesions present with solitary lesions between 4 and 8 centimeters. Only 3% of cases reach a diameter greater than ten centimeters. The hallmark feature of focal nodular hyperplasia that is evident grossly is known as a "central scar."  Histologically, the central scar consists of mature collagen surrounded by aberrant arteries, draining veins, and fibrous septae forming a pseudocapsule which distinguishes it from hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatocellular adenomas, and fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma. Because of this, biopsy of the central scar is essential in determining diagnosis and ruling out malignant causes. Focal nodular hyperplastic lesions may also contain bile ducts and reticuloendothelial hepatic macrophages also known as Kuppfer cells. Additionally, these lesions lack the calcifications that are commonly seen in hepatic adenomas. Cytologically, these hepatocytes from focal nodular hyperplastic lesions are unremarkable reaffirming benign origin.

If a biopsy sample lacks a “central scar,” bile duct canals, or calcifications that would aid in the differentiation between hepatic adenomas and focal nodular hyperplasia, immunohistochemical stainings may aid in establishing a diagnosis. Focal nodular hyperplasia displays an increased expression of glutamine synthetase located in the periphery of the nodules, which may be stained and identified.
