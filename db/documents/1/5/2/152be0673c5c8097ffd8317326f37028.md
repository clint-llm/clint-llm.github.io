The median time of progression to MM is 2 to 3 years. SBP has a poor prognosis and an increased progression to MM as compared to EMP.

The causes of poor prognosis include local recurrence, incomplete resection with functional damage, local lymph node metastasis, progression to MM, or new bone lesions formation with MM. Anaplastic plasmacytomas with high histologic grade and increased vascularity are a poor prognostic factor. For SPB, the poor prognostic factors include:

-   Age more than 40 years

-   Tumour size of 5cm or more

-   Spine lesions

-   Neurologic symptoms associated with SPB

-   RT dose

-   Existence of light chains

-   High serum M protein levels

-   Persistence of M proteins after treatment

-   Bone marrow infiltration by clonal plasma cells

-   Osteopenia

The prognostic factors for EP are unclear due to fewer cases and changing biological behavior.
