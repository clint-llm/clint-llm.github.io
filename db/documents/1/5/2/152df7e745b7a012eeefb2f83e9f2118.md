Renin is an aspartyl protease released by the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidneysÂ in response to perceived low blood pressure and renal perfusion. It plays an essential role in the rate-limiting step of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), responsible for the homeostasis of blood volume and mean arterial blood pressure. Renin also acts as a hormone, binding to pro-renin receptors, causing an increase in the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I.
