The precise etiology is unknown. The original study by Rose postulated that extraordinarily deep fornices, probably caused by age-related levator aponeurosis degradation, provide a favorable environment for bacteria to reside. Mild conjunctivitis, possibly exacerbated by blocked lacrimal ducts, could cause an increased bioburden in the superior (and more rarely, inferior) conjunctival fornices. The toxicity of this bioburden leads to increased protein-based exudate from the inflamed conjunctiva. These events will create a positive feedback loop in which the exudate protects the bacteria, the bacterial bioburden increases and causes inflammation of the conjunctiva, which causes more protein exudation.
