Tibial plateau fractures account for 1 percent of all fractures and are typically sustained with high-energy mechanisms. Tibial plateau fractures may be associated with injury to nearby structures including vasculature, nerves, ligaments, menisci, and adjacent compartments. While minimal tibial plateau fractures with no associated injuries can be safely managed non-operatively, typically this injury requires orthopedic consultation and operative management. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients with tibial plateau fractures and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of tibial plateau fractures. 
- Describe the typical radiographic findings of tibial plateau fractures.
- List the treatment and management options available for tibial plateau fractures. 
- Employ interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of tibial plateau fractures and improve patient outcomes.
