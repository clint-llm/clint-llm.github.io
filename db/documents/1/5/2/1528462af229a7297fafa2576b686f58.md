The sternohyoid muscle has implications in pathologies affecting the neck region. It has classically been difficult for health care provides to differentiate the causes of anterior neck pain or swellings. Since the sternohyoid muscle is one of the structures located in the anterior neck region, it could be a possible etiology to neck pain or swelling. In sternohyoid muscle syndrome, there is a mass present in the lateral neck region that disappears with swallowing. Classically this condition is caused by omohyoid muscle syndrome, but research has found that the sternohyoid muscle can also be the cause of the swelling.
