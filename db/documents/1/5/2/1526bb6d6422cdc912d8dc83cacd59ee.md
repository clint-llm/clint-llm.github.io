An interprofessional healthcare team approach is essential for the successful insertion and maintenance of umbilical arterial catheterization. This team will include PHysicians (MDs and DOs), specialists, mid-level practitioners (NPs and PAs), nursing staff, and surgical assistants, all with specialized neonatal care training. As discussed earlier, communication and coordination between the clinicians/advanced practitioners and nurses are very important. The necessity of the catheter must be evaluated every day by the healthcare team, withÂ nursing staff reporting any findings they observe during care, and it must be removed when no longer necessary.
