Acute interstitial pneumonia is an uncommon disease that presents acutely and progresses rapidly with a high rate of mortality. Diagnosis is complex and requires an interprofessional team, including pulmonology, radiology, and pathology. Proper communication and coordination between members of the healthcare team can fasten the diagnosis process, and therefore initiate the management earlier. The primary team also should be aware of the possible complication that may arise during the acute illness. Generally, the medical community still needs a better understanding of the initial triggers and progression of the disease to improve the outcome.
