Hypertension is the most typical risk factor. Atherothrombosis of the vertebral artery is the most frequent underlying vascular cause. Vertebral artery dissection needs to be considered in younger patients, especially with a history of trauma, neck manipulation, or underlying collagen disorders such as Marfan syndrome. Head thrust (head impulse) test in the emergency department can differentiate peripheral vertigo due to acute labyrinthitis from central cause due to Wallenberg syndrome.

The outlook for patients with Wallenberg syndrome depends on the infarct size. Still, most patients generally have a better outcome than other ischemic stroke syndromes, except for some lacunar syndromes. Gait instability or ataxia is the most typical sequelae. Sometimes hiccups can be intractable.
