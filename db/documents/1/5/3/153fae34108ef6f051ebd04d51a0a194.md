There is no single 'gold standard' sign or symptom for the diagnosis of DED. Evaluation of both symptoms and signs of DED is recommended as signs may be present without symptoms, and vice-versa.

**Symptoms**

A verbal history allows the non-scripted elicitation of dry eye symptoms. In addition, many questionnaires have been developed to screen for symptoms of DED. The use of a validated questionnaire allows accurate quantification of symptoms as a screening tool as well as monitoring for progression and response to treatments. Several questionnaires exist, such as the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), Dry Eye Questionnaire (DEQ-5), and Symptoms Analysis in Dry Eye (SANDE), and others, which may be useful in assessing dry eye symptoms. Many questionnaires also include questions about subjective visual function or disturbances that may be attributable to dry eye.

**Tear Stability**

Tear Film Break-up Time (TBUT). This is the interval of time between a complete blink and the first break in the tear film. This is most often performed in the clinic using a slit lamp microscope after instilling sodium fluorescein stain to enhance the visibility of the tear film. A cutoff of fewer than ten seconds for the appearance of a patch in the tear film is often considered consistent with DED. Alternatively, a non-invasive tear breakup time can be measured without fluorescein using instrumentation that evaluates the reflections of patterns or rings from the tear film or the use of interferometry to assess for the appearance of discontinuity of the lipid layer after a blink.

**Tear Volume**

Tear meniscus assessment. Assessment of the tear meniscus is performed at the slit-lamp by judging the inferior tear film meniscus height. This technique is simple to perform but is subject to poor intervisit repeatability.

Schirmer test.****A Schirmer paper strip is folded at the notch with the shorter end hooked over the lateral lid margin to avoid irritation of the cornea while the patient rests with closed eyes. The Schirmer I test is performed without topical anesthetic to measure basic and reflex tearing with less than 5 to 10mm (depending on cutoff used) of wetting after 5 minutes of diagnostic of aqueous deficiency. Alternatively, a topical anesthetic can be administered. Then residual fluid blotted from the inferior fornix prior to performing testing to measure basic secretion with less than 5 to 10 mm of wetting is considered diagnostic for aqueous deficiency.

Phenol red test.****Similar to Schirmer testing, a cotton thread dyed with phenol red is hooked over the temporal eyelid into the sulcus for 15 seconds while the patient rests with closed eyes. When wet, the thread turns red with cutoff values ranging from less than 10 to 20mm used clinically.

**Ocular Surface Assessment**

Fluorescein staining. Fluorescein staining allows the assessment of corneal damage. A minimal volume of fluorescein is instilled into the tear film with optimal viewing 1 to 3 minutes later. Greater than five spots of staining are considered a positive result with various grading scales such as the Oxford grading scale used as well.

Lissamine green staining.  Lissamine allows the assessment of conjunctival and lid margin damage and, to a lesser extent, corneal damage. Greater than nine spots is a positive result.

Conjunctival redness.****Conjunctival redness, or hyperemia, is not specific to DED as this may result from any stimulus that results in conjunctivitis, including infective, allergic, chemical, or mechanical etiologies. Grading is generally determined subjectively by slit-lamp examination, although some devices with automated grading or digital photography can also be used.

**Tear Film Assays**

Tear film Osmolarity. Elevated osmolarity and increased variability of osmolarity of the tears are characteristics of DED. Osmolarity values typically increase with disease severity. Various cutoff values have been reported, with 308 mOsm/L used as a threshold to diagnose mild/moderate disease, while 316 mOsm/L has been used as a cutoff for more severe disease.

Matrix Metalloproteinases. These proteases are found in the tears of individuals with dry eyes. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) levels can be tested using a point-of-care test.

**Eyelid Evaluation**

Blepharitis. Evaluation of the eyelids is a crucial part of the evaluation to determine any factors contributing to DED. The evaluation includes assessment for anterior blepharitis and Demodex blepharitis, which are frequent comorbidities of DED.

Lid wiper epitheliopathy.****The portion of conjunctiva along the lid margin that contacts the ocular surface to spread tears has been termed the 'lid wiper.'

Meibomian gland evaluation. The evaluation of the meibomian gland structure can be performed with meibography. While the outline of meibomian glands can be seen at the slit lamp or with a penlight by transilluminating the everted eyelid, enhanced visualization is obtained using infrared imaging systems to perform meibography. Inspection of the meibomian gland orifices along the eyelid margin can be performed to detect external obstructions of orifices. Meibomian gland function can be assessed by evaluating meibum quantity, quality, and expressibility.

Eyelid blink and closure. Incomplete blinking and nocturnal lagophthalmos can result in DED. Assessment of the blink can be performed with or without a microscope or video recording equipment. Lagophthalmos can be estimated by having the patient gently close their eyes and assessing for incomplete closure.

**Evaluation for systemic disease**

Numerous systemic diseases may cause DED, particularly primary Sjogren syndrome and secondary Sjogren syndrome caused by other autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, progressive systemic sclerosis, and dermatomyositis. Other systemic abnormalities such as Parkinson's disease, androgen deficiency, thyroid disease, and diabetes have also been associated with DED. Evaluation for systemic disease causing secondary dry eye may be warranted if an underlying condition is suspected. A review of systems is indicated to screen for underlying systemic diseases. Sjogren syndrome may also involve the salivary glands leading to dry mouth and predisposing to periodontal disease, and other mucous membranes may be affected, such as vaginal, gastric, and respiratory mucosae. Laboratory testing for Sjogren syndrome (antibodies to Ro/SS-A or La/SS-B), rheumatoid factor, and antinuclear antibodies. Referral to a rheumatologist may be indicated, and some cases of Sjogren syndrome may require a salivary gland biopsy by an oral surgeon.
