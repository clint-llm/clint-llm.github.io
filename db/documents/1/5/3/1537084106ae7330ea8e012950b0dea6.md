Differentiating the mechanisms arrhythmogenesis may be difficult. Micro reentry circuits, left atrial reentry spreading via Bachmann bundle to the right atrium where single spread is detected, slow conduction zone, and cul-du-ac activity of the pulmonary veins may appear as a focal activity on electrophysiologic studies. When equal PPI-TCL values are obtained for widespread points, a large macro-reentrant circuit should be suspected. Then a reentry circuit spanning left and right atrium via Bachmann bundle and Marshall ligament is possible.

An important differential diagnosis for atrial fibrillation is multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT). The correct diagnosis was made in only 22% of cases in one retrospective study. MAT is characterized by at least three different non-sinus p waves in the same lead, an atrial rate of over 100 beats per minute, and isoelectricity between p waves. Triggered activity is the pathomechanism of MAT. Since electrical cardioversion is effective only in reentrant tachycardias, cardioversion would not be helpful in this case. Treatment consists of beta-blocker, calcium channel blockade, and magnesium. This emphasizes the importance of the underlying pathomechanism for effective treatment.
