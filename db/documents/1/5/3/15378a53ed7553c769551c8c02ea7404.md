Ruxolitinib falls under the drug class known as janus kinase inhibitors (JAK Inhibitors). It is an inhibitor of the JAK1 and JAK2 protein kinases and works by competitively inhibiting the ATP-binding catalytic site on JAK1 and JAK2.

Due to its anti-JAK activity, ruxolitinib has been reported to improve splenomegaly seen in myelofibrosis and other constitutional symptoms such as fevers, pruritus, and night sweats. However, ruxolitinib is not known to alter the actual bone marrow or cause prolonged survival in myelofibrosis.

The drug has a half-life of 3 hours for the parent drug and approximately 6 hours for its active metabolites. It is hepatically metabolized via the CYP450 enzymatic pathway, specifically CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. It is mostly excreted in the urine (75%) andÂ to a lesser extent in the feces (approximately 20%.)
