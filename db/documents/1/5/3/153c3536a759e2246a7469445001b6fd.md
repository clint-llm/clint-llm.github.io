Modern radionuclide PET scan imaging and targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy can significantly change management decisions in over 50% of prostate cancer patients tested and offer substantially improved survival in those with advanced disease.

PSMA PET imaging is superior to CT imaging and standard bone scans for the staging of prostate cancer.

PSMA-based imaging should be performed before antiandrogen hormonal therapy is started (NCCN recommendation.)

Ga-68-PSMA-11 and F-18-piflufolastat (DCFPyL) PET imaging have each demonstrated higher sensitivity than C-11 choline or F-18 fluciclovine PET imaging, especially at very low PSA levels.

No separate bone scan is necessary when performing a Ga-68-PSMA-11 or F-18 piflufolastat (DCFPyL) PSMA PET/CT scan.

Tc-99m-PSMA single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) can be a cost-effective alternative to more expensive PET scans.

Various new imaging techniques are now available to evaluate better each patient's prostate cancer staging, course, and progress.

Nuclear medicine-based diagnostic imaging and therapeutics can significantly affect treatment planning, therapeutic decisions, quality of life, and overall survival.
