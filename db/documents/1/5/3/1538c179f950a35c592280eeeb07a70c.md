This activity reviews the indications, action, and possible contraindications for cobalamin as a valuable agent. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the interprofessional team of patients with pernicious anemia, ileal resections, spinal cord lesions, and other related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of cobalamin.
- Outline the advantages of cobalamin therapy.
- Summarize the monitoring required during cobalamin therapy.
