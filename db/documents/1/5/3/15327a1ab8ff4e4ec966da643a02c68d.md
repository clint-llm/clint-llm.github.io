ON is a result of GON pathophysiology in 90% of cases. Ten percent of cases are due to LON causes, and rarely is the TON thought to be involved. ON almost always results from the compression of one of these nerves at one of several anatomic points. In fact, for the various neuralgias described in the International Classification of Headache Disorders, Third Edition (ICHD-3), in the majority of cases, many of the traditional neuralgias are no longer considered to result from primary nerve pathophysiology (e.g., herpes zoster, other infections, demyelinating lesions).

Rarely, other sensory cutaneous nerves may overlap the typical distribution area of the occipital nerves. In one case report, the suboccipital nerve supplied a cutaneous branch in the normal distribution of the greater occipital nerve.
