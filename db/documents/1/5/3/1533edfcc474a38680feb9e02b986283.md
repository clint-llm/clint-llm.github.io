The differential diagnosis of other solid renal tumors includes the following: renal oncocytoma, lipid-poor renal angiomyolipoma, renal metastases, renal lymphoma, solitary fibrous tumor (very rare), and multilocular cystic nephroma.

Other renal abnormalities that can mimic RCC include the following: a prominent column of Bertin, renal abscess, renal infarct, and complex renal cyst.

The finding of a prominent column of Bertin is typically a questionable ultrasound finding which requires cross-sectional imaging CT scan or MRI to confirm.

The finding of renal access typically has other clinical findings to support such as pyelonephritis, high white blood cell (WBC) count, fever, and chills.

The finding of renal infarct is usually associated with vascular abnormalities such as renal vein thrombosis or trauma related.

To differentiate a complex renal cyst from renal cell cancer, radiologists use the Bosniak classification.
