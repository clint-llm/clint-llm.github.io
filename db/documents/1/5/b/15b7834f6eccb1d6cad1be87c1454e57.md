Empyema is a common diagnosis in hospitals. Most empyemas follow bacterial pneumonia or unevacuated hemothorax following trauma. Because the condition can be debilitating, it is best managed by an interprofessional team. The key is early treatment before the onset of trapped lung. Thrombolytic therapy only works for early empyema but even when it works, a complete resolution is not always possible. A thoracic surgery consult should be made early; if the pleural cavity is emptied of all the fluid/blood, the risk of an empyema are low. However, if there is a delay in treatment, the patient may end up needing VATs or a thoracotomy. Patients with empyema usually have a chest tube and are monitored by nurses on the surgical floor. The prognosis for most patients with early empyema is excellent. However, complete resolution of the X-ray findings may take months. The pulmonary function usually improves rapidly once empyema is surgically managed.
