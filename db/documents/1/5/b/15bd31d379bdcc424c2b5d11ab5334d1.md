Few patients affected with adrenal cortical hyperplasia might present with clinical and laboratory evidence of an increased level of aldosterone, including elevated blood pressure, decreased level of potassium, and disturbed arterial blood gas demonstrating metabolic alkalosis.

Further confirmatory tests, including serum aldosterone, and metanephrines, are highly recommended for those who are undiagnosed despite previously mentioned studies. In the majority of patients affected with Cushing syndrome, including pituitary adenoma, and ACTH hypersecretion due to ectopic causalities, the hypercortisolism is dependent on ACTH hypersecretion.
