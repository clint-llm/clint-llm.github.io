Taking a patient history to help diagnose voice disorders requires determining the frequency, duration, and severity of symptoms as well as any exacerbating or alleviating factors. Environmental factors are important to elicit as well, and these may include low humidity, alcohol use, cigarette smoke, and other airborne particulates like dust or chemical agents. Achieving an understanding of a patient's vocal habits and needs is likewise crucial to developing a working diagnosis and an individualized treatment plan. Including an evaluation of the patient's medical, surgical, psychological, traumatic, and pharmaceutical history can also be very informative in many cases.

The physical examination should include a standard head and neck evaluation as well as palpation of the larynx and trachea and videostroboscopic evaluation of phonation.
