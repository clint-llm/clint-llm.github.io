The main complications of endometriosis include infertility or subfertility, chronic pain, and other debilitating persistent symptoms. These are entailed in a wide range, including dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dyschezia but endometriosis can also cause a decrease in quality of life of patients, complications of surgical procedures, anatomical abnormalities due to possible adhesions, bowel or/and bladder dysfunction, but in the case of ovarian endometriomas could even lead to the development of cancer. The role of endometriosis in infertile women has been debated for a long time, with literature research showing that infertile women are 6 up to 8-fold more likely to suffer from endometriosis than fertile females.

Chronic pelvic pain is closely associated with endometriosis since endometriosis has been the cause in 71% to 87% of women suffering from chronic pelvic pain.
