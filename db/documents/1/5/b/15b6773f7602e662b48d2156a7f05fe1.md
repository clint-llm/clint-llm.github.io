Alport syndrome affects about 1 in 50,000 newborns, and males are more likely to be symptomatic than females. It is estimated that approximately 30,000 to 60,000 people in the United States (US) have this disorder. In the US, the overall incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in children is about 3% and 0.2% in the adult population.

Alport syndrome accounts for approximately 2.2% of children and 0.2% of adults with ESRD in the United States. In Europe, Alport syndrome accounts for 0.6% of patients with ESRD.

The common X-linked type of Alport syndrome resulting in ESRD predominantly affects males. However, the X-linked form of Alport syndrome affects almost as many females. Affected women are generally undiagnosed, but 15%–30% end up having renal failure by 60 years and hearing loss by middle age.

Alport syndrome is a significant cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD), leading to ESRD in adolescents and young adults, accounting for 1.5% to 3.0% of children on renal replacement therapies in Europe and the US.
