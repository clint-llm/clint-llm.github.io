According to studies, the incidence of brain abscess is approximately 8% of intracranial masses in developing countries and 1% to 2% in the Western countries with approximately four cases occurring per million. The prevalence of brain abscess in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is higher. Therefore, the prevalence rate has increased with the emanation of the AIDS pandemic. Approximately 1500 to 2500 cases are diagnosed annually in the United States. The incidence of fungal brain abscesses also has increased because of the higher usage of broad-spectrum antibiotics and immunosuppressive agents like steroids. Prevalence is highest in adult men younger than 30 years while pediatric disease occurs most frequently in children ages 4 to 7 years. Neonates are third in high-risk groups. Vaccination has reduced the prevalence in young children. Data suggests that brain abscesses are more predominant in males than in females with a male-to-female ratio varying between 2:1 and 3:1. Geographical and seasonal differences have no significant impact. In developing countries with poor living standards, brain abscess accounts for a disproportionate percentage of space-occupying intracranial lesions compared to developed nations.
