The diagnosis of liposarcoma is challenging, and to differentiate it from other tumors is difficult. The appearance of well-differentiated liposarcoma on CT scan and MRI is similar to fat and other abdominal tumors.

The pre-operative diagnosis of primary leiomyosarcoma of omentum is difficult, and the diagnosis is usually made postoperatively. Accurate diagnosis is only obtained by histopathological examination of the tumor.

Intravenous CECT of the abdomen and pelvis and MRI are the best imaging methods for diagnosing leiomyosarcoma of omentum. It can give accurate information about the origin of the tumor. These lesions have similar imaging features in most cases, presenting as a solid-cystic and multilobulated tumor.

The radiological features of omental EGISTs which don't have myogenic and neurogenic differentiation is not established. They may be similar to omental leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma. Most GISTs with the myogenic feature appears to be hypervascular and have a clear margin on CT scan and angiography.

According to Ishida (1998), a CT scan is the imaging of choice for greater omental tumors. CT appearance of such tumors is usually multilobulated, flat, pancake-like, with enhancing solid and multicystic densities. Angiography is a useful investigation in the diagnosis of omental tumors. A diagnosis of an omental tumor is made when a feeding artery to the tumor arises from the omental blood supply. A highly vascular lesion having neovascularity more likely means a malignant tumor.

A definitive diagnosis can be achieved by laparoscopy or open surgery with biopsy. Histology and immunohistochemistry are used to diagnose and differentiate mesothelioma from adenocarcinomas and sarcomas.

Ultrasound and CT-scan can be used to follow up for recurrences.

CT-scan and MRI are the best diagnostic modalities for the diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumors of omentum. They help show the proliferation of fibrous tissue in the abdominal cavity, assess the relationship between the tumor and surrounding structures, and help to decide the excision of the tumor. However, CT-scan and MRI cannot differentiate between SFT and mesenchymal tumors. Therefore it can be misdiagnosed as stromal tumors. Needle aspiration does not help in the diagnosis because the tumor is made up of acellular and hypercellular portions, and it doesn't provide enough tissue for cytological analysis. Apple et al. reported accurate diagnosis could be achieved through fine needle aspiration, but it needs investigation in many patients. Tumor samples can be collected through the Ryle tube for small tumors and exploratory laparotomy in large tumors.

Diagnosis of SFT of omentum is difficult as it resembles other tumors like leiomyoma and mesothelioma. Moreover, if a pedunculated tumor is arising from omentum, it can be mistaken as other pelvic tumors. Immunohistochemistry helps to establish the diagnosis. These tumors are positive for CD34, CD99, and BCL-2 and occasionally SMA, but they are usually negative for S-100, desmin, and cytokeratins. SFT appears as highly vascularized solid tumors with well-defined margins on ultrasound imaging, and CT-scan may show the same findings. However, imaging is not a specific investigation, and pre-op diagnosis becomes impossible.
