Nitrates exert their pharmacological effect by being activated by mitochondrial or cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) into nitric oxide (NO), an endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF).

The venodilation increases the venous capacitance and lowers the preload; this subsequently lowers the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, resulting in a reduction in myocardium workload, which decreases the oxygen demand of the heart.
