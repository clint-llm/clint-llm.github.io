The brachial plexus is the principal nervous structure in the axillary area. It innervates the muscles around the axilla, the shoulder, and upper limbs. It originates from the spinal nerve roots of C5-T1. It consists of 5 roots, three trunks, six divisions, three cords, and five branches. The five roots merge into three trunks, which are the superior, middle, and inferior trunks. The three trunks connect to form six divisions which merge into three cords. The three cords are the lateral, posterior, and medial cords, which are named with reference to their relationship to the axillary artery. The three cords then divide into five branches, which are the musculocutaneous, axillary, radial, median, and ulnar nerves.
