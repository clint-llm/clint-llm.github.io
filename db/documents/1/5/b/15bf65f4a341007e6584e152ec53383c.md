The diagnosis of trachoma relies chiefly on history and the clinical signs, as seen on slit-lamp examination. While many diagnostic tests have been developed to detect the organism, there exists no 'gold standard' investigation.

- Giemsa staining of smears of conjunctival cells to demonstrate the chlamydial inclusion body.

- Cell cultures and microscopy.

- Enzyme-linked immunoassays to detect chlamydial antigens.

- Nucleic acid amplification tests, such as PCR are becoming increasingly popular. These tests, in contrast to other investigations, are highly specific as well as sensitive. However, they are not appropriate for non-research use due to expense and complexity.
