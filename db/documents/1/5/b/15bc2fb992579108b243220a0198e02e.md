Patients under the influence of LSD will most likely present to a clinical setting after experiencing what is colloquially referred to as a “bad trip.” Others may present after ingesting the substance unknowingly or perhaps in exceedingly large doses.

Obtaining a quality history and physical will be dependent on the alertness and orientation of the presenting patient, which will vary based on just how altered the patient’s perception appears. If the patient is unable to provide a thorough history, clinical staff should contact any friends or family to assist in history taking. Clinicians should focus history taking on the following: chief complaint(s); dosage of substance; timing and place of dosage; patient’s knowledge of the substance; prior experience with substance; associated symptoms or concomitant substance use; and standard review of systems.

The following may appear on the physical exam:

- Vitals: temperature, which may be normal; blood pressure, can be increased; heart rate, often high; respiratory rate, can be elevated; oxygen saturation, normal in most cases.

- General: alertness and orientation may be off from baseline; patients can be diaphoretic and appear disheveled in appearance; loss of appetite

- HEENT: mydriasis, xerostomia, nystagmus

- Respiratory: increased respiratory rate

- Cardiovascular: increased heart rate and blood pressure

- Skin: hyperhidrosis

- Neurologic: impaired coordination

- Psychiatric: auditory and visual hallucinations, panic, psychosis, paranoia, synesthesia, time perturbations, emotional lability, aggression, depersonalization, suicidal ideation, religiosity, depression
