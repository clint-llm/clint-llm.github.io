Treatment of osteitis fibrosa cystica starts with the management of hyperparathyroidism, which is usually parathyroidectomy and should take place after fixing the underlying metabolic issues. After parathyroidectomy, the majority of bone disorders resulting from OFC will resolve. If surgery is not the treatment option, medical treatment may be an option to manage hypercalcemia, vitamin D deficiency, and hyperphosphatemia. Serial evaluation of serum calcium, phosphate, PTH, and vitamin D determines the necessity of treatment.
