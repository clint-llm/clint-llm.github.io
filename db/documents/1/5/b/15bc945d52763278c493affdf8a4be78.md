In normal eye development, the neuroectoderm approaches the surface ectoderm and forms the optic vesicle. The optic vesicle invaginates to form an optic cup dorsally and proximally and the optic fissure ventrally and distally. The most proximal portion of the vesicle forms the optic stalk. The margins of the optic fissure grow toward each other until they fuse, leaving a small opening, the optic disc, for the hyaloid artery. The optic fissure begins to close in the fifth week of fetal development and is completed by about the seventh week. Partial or complete failure of closure of the optic fissure results in colobomas. Since the optic fissure closes ventrally last, the location of the colobomas is usually ventral. The extent of visual impairment caused by a coloboma ranges from asymptomatic to complete loss of vision, depending on the size and location of the defect. The inheritance pattern can be a defect in any of the 39 genes associated with colobomas or more commonly sporadic.
