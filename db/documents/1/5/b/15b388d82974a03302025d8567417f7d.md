Tests for potential vision are performed to predict the visual outcome of an anterior segment surgery or a procedure. These tests can be subjective or objective. They can assess the posterior segment of the eye and the neural integrity of the visual system to provide information regarding prognosis after the procedure. Tests for potential vision evaluate whether patients with anterior segment diseases such as cataracts can benefit from surgery. Tests for potential vision also assess the integrity of the retina and neural integrity of the visual system. Macular function tests are an essential part of evaluating potential vision. This activity describes tests for potential vision and highlights the indication, interpretation, advantages, and disadvantages of the subjective and objective tests for potential vision.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the definition of tests for potential vision.
- Outline the indications for tests for potential vision.
- Explain the subjective tests for potential vision with the advantages and disadvantages of each.
- Review the objective tests for potential vision.
