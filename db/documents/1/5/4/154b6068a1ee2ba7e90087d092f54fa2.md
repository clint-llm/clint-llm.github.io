Endoscopic arytenoidectomy with or without cordectomy became the most accepted intervention for the permanent bilateral vocal cord paralysis at the end of the 20th Century to enlarge the stenotic airway and practically replaced the external surgical methods. Removal of arytenoid cartilage (i.e., arytenoidectomy) is a permanent and irreversible surgical procedure, by which the glottal inlet is expanded in its transverse axis, providing a larger airway for respiration.

Laterofixation of the arytenoid and/or the attached vocal fold has emerged as an alternative surgical approach for permanent bilateral vocal cord paralysis with good success rates. Due to its reversible nature, laterofixation hasÂ greater success than other conventional surgical options based on the fact that it enlarges the airway avoiding damage to the voicing mechanism of the larynx, thus preserving the physiologic adductor functions (vocalization and deglutition) by reversal of the procedure.

Arytenoid cartilage mounted on the cricoid ring, with a functioning recurrent laryngeal nerve and lateral and posterior cricoarytenoid muscles form the cricoarytenoid unit a basic functional unit critical to phonatory and sphincteric functions of the larynx. According to this concept, surgeons should pay attention to the management of laryngeal cancer for the organ preservation; they should be able to maintain physiological functions of the larynx, namely speech, respiration, and swallowing, without compromising the loco-regional control of cancer.
