If ACS is caught and treated early with a decompressive fasciotomy, the outcomes are favorable. One study in 1976 found a fasciotomy done within 12 hours of the onset of clinical symptoms (motor weakness, stretch pain, etc.) resulted in the normal function of 68% of patients. If the fasciotomy was delayed beyond 12 hours, only 8% of patients had normal function. Fasciotomies have complications, including additional surgeries for delayed wound closure, skin grafting, pain, cosmetic deformity, nerve injury, muscle weakness, and chronic venous insufficiency.
