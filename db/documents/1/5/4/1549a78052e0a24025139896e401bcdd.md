The pericardium is a fibro-serous membrane that covers the heart. The fibrous pericardium is composed of connective tissue cells, microvasculature, collagen fibers and, small elastic fibers. The serosal layer is composed of a surface layer of flattened mesothelial cells. The luminal surface of the serosal layer is lined with surface microvilli and few cilia to help increase the area for fluid transport.
