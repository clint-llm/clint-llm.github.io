Treatment depends heavily on the type of exposure and concentration of the solution. There is no antidote for hydrogen peroxide, and dialysis is ineffective. Dilute hydrogen peroxide is much less likely to cause significant symptoms, and many of these exposures may be safely observed at home. Ingestion of large amounts of dilute hydrogen peroxide may cause significant symptoms to bring patients to the emergency department. These may also be generally managed with symptomatic management.

Caregivers can consider a nasogastric tube to drain the stomach if the patient presents early enough. This may also help decompress the GI tract and make the patient more comfortable. Nausea and vomiting are the most common presenting symptoms with these types of exposures, and emesis will often be foamy.

As with other topical exposures, the first treatment will be decontamination. Remove any clothing soaked with hydrogen peroxide. Rinse the area with copious amounts of water or normal saline. If a patient presents after ophthalmic exposure, be sure to remove contact lenses if present. Proceed with irrigation with copious amounts of normal saline.

If exposure involves more concentrated solutions, initial treatment remains decontamination -- if possible. However, symptoms are more likely to be more severe, and patients may require more significant interventions. Early intubation is necessary if there is any concern for airway compromise, as tissue damage is likely to progress and progress rapidly.

Patients with signs or symptoms of significant air emboli need to obtain relevant imaging quickly. If there is air in the mediastinum or heart, or the patient is hypotensive, and there is suspicion oÂ significant air emboli, place patients in the Trendelenburg position to help prevent blockage of the right ventricular outflow tract by intravascular gas.

Clinicians should consider hyperbaric therapy in symptomatic patients with evidence of air emboli.
