Although seatbelts have prevented numerous deaths by reducing head injuries, they can cause damage via the transmission of force upon impact associated with the restraint of a passenger. Seatbelt injury, also called seatbelt syndrome, is a group of common injury profiles associated with the use of seatbelts. These range from bruising and abrasions following the distribution of the seatbelt, also known as seatbelt signs, to intra-abdominal injuries and vertebral fractures. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of seat belt injuries and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe how to properly evaluate a patient after a motor vehicle accident during which a seatbelt was worn.
- Identify common injury profiles for patients involved in motor vehicle accidents during which seatbelts were worn.
- Explain the principles of management of patients who were involved in motor vehicle accidents during which seatbelts were worn.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to promptly recognize seatbelt signs and provide treatment that will improve outcomes for patients with these injuries.
