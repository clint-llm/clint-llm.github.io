Congenital aural atresia is most often sporadic without an identifiable genetic mutation. Thus the parents of patients should be counseled that the risk of malformation in a subsequent pregnancy is no greater than the general population. Also, the implications of impaired hearing and the importance of appropriate medical management should be emphasized. Postoperative compliance of the patient and the family is associated with better outcomes.
