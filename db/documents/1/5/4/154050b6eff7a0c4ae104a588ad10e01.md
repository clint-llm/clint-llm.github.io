In Fuchs uveitis syndrome, a short course of corticosteroids can be used to treat symptomatic exacerbation of the patient’s uveitis. Topical corticosteroids are typically preferred in patients with anterior uveitis exacerbation because the steroids can only penetrate the anterior segment of the patient’s eyes.

However, long-term use of anti-inflammatory therapy is not indicated. Patients still experience flares even with chronic corticosteroids, which can lead to cataract formation and glaucoma. Occasionally, since FUS has a similar clinical presentation to other uveitides of other etiologies, a trial of short-course topical corticosteroid therapy may be used to help differentiate the other inflammatory pathologies. The patient requires treatment for secondary complications such as cataracts or glaucoma, which occur in most patients leading to visual deterioration in this disease.
