As previously mentioned, deviant physiological states precipitating from organic etiologies can mimic symptoms of cyclothymia. Common abnormalities that can incite such symptomatology include endocrine diseases, autoimmune disorders, vitamin deficiencies, electrolyte abnormalities, infections, and traumatic brain injuries. Furthermore, iatrogenic causes can also induce manic and depressive-like symptoms, most notably steroids, levodopa, and antibiotics.

Once the primacy has been established, the clinician must then distinguish between psychiatric differentials. Cyclothymia shares many overlapping features with several psychiatric diagnoses. These include major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder type II, generalized anxiety disorder, neurodevelopmental disorders, and personality disorders.

A detailed psychiatric evaluation will help the clinicianÂ to decipher between ambiguous presentations. Additionally, providers can administer psychiatric batteries for adjunctive and more objective assessments. Examples of assessment batteries include the Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Bipolar Spectrum Diagnostic Scale, and the My Mood Monitor (M-3) checklist.
