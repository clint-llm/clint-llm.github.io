Peri-operative mortality rates of open surgery approach 20% and postoperative complications (seen in 60%) are distal ischemia and amputation, renal failure, respiratory failure requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation, and multiorgan failure.

Complications of extra-anatomic bypass procedures are aortic stump disruption, amputation, reinfection.

Rehabilitation care: Many studies report prolonged hospitalization (median approximately 58 days) after surgery. Many patient require prolonged physical and occupational therapy and a gradual return to baseline activity.
