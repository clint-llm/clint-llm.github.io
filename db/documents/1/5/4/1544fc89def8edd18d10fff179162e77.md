A broad array of infectious, inflammatory, neoplastic, and mechanical etiologies should be considered when evaluating for infectious endocarditis. Much will depend upon the presenting symptomatology with an appropriately broad differential for chest pain to include evaluation for acute coronary syndrome, acute heart failure, aortic dissection, myopericarditis, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, and empyema. In patients with previous prosthetic valve replacement, clinicians should consider the possibility of perivalvular thrombosis (especially if there has been an interruption in recommended anticoagulation) or suture dehiscence. Recurrent arterial embolic events following recent myocardial infarction should raise concern for a ventricular mural thrombus. In an otherwise healthy young patient presenting with a new murmur, atrial myxoma should be considered. Although rare, non-bacterial endocarditis associated with sterile valvular thrombi can occur in patients with underlying malignancy (marantic endocarditis) or those with systemic lupus erythematosus (Libman-Sacks endocarditis).
