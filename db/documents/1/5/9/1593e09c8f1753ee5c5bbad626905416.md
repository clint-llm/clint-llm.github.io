When a gastric ulcer is suspected, evaluation for hemodynamic stability is critical as they often present with upper GI bleeding and may have hemorrhagic shock. Necessary labs include BMP, CBC, PT/INR, and lipase. A chest X-ray should be obtained to test for other causes of epigastric pain. Many times patients are evaluated for pancreatitis with an abdominal CT scan.

During endoscopy, gastric ulcers are graded using the Forrest classification scheme; this provides the estimated risk of ulcer bleeding and helps to distinguish which ulcers need endoscopic management, such as injection therapy, cautery, or metal or absorbable clip placement. Below is a representation of the grading system.

Forrest classification:

- Ia- jet arterial bleeding, 90% rebleeding risk

- Ib- oozing, 50% rebleeding risk

- IIa-visible vessel, 25 to 30% rebleeding risk

- IIb- adherent clot, 10 to 20% rebleeding risk

- IIc- black spot in the ulcer, 7 to 10% rebleeding risk

- III- clean based, 3 to 5% rebleeding risk
