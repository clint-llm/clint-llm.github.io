Though loratadine is a relatively safe and effective medication for treating allergic rhinitis, its primary adverse effects include headaches, dizziness, and GI distress (diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting). Loratadine may also cause sedation (rare side effect), mydriasis, and xerostomia. These effects are primarily due to the drug's anticholinergic effects.

Patients should not take loratadine with other CNS depressants such as diphenhydramine, dextromethorphan, or pseudoephedrine as it may cause dose-related sedation. There is no evidence for increased adverse events when combining loratadine and oral contraceptives.
