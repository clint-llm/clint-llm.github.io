Due to its self-limiting nature, the prognosis of LS is excellent with a complete recovery expected. It typically completely resolves spontaneously within a year, though it can do so within 4 weeks to 3 years. Relapses are uncommon. The nail component of this condition usually resolves itself and can last from 6 months to 5 years. When it resolves, it does so without any remaining deformity.
