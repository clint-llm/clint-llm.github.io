Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAAs) are a relatively common pathology. Ruptured aneurysms have an exceptionally high mortality rate. Early diagnosis and intervention is paramount to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with this emergent vascular condition. However, traditional physical exam is unreliable in detecting AAAs. This activity reviews the use of point of care ultrasound in diagnosing abdominal aortic aneurysms and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients who have abdominal aortic aneurysms.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the routine and emergent indications for the point of care ultrasound evaluation of abdominal aortic aneurysms.
- Review the technique for sonographic evaluation of abdominal aortic aneurysms.
- Identify the limitations of bedside ultrasound evaluation of abdominal aortic aneurysms.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies to diagnose and treat abdominal aortic aneurysms to improve outcomes.
