The herald patch and pityriasis rosea are thought to be caused by infection with human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7), but this is still a topic of debate. Evidence supporting an infectious etiology include outbreaks occurring in clusters, the prodromal symptoms that occur in most patients before the herald patch or eruption of pityriasis rosea occurs, and the rare instance of recurrence which suggests immunity. In one retrospective cohort study, pityriasis rosea only recurred in 3.7% of patients, but none of these recurrences manifested with a herald patch. Interactions between Langerhans cells, unknown components of the epidermis, and dermal dendritic cells have also been postulated, but whether these interactions are due to a viral etiology is still uncertain.
