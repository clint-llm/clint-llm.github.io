Obstruction of the duodenum causes duodenal atresia, usually distal to the ampulla of Vater in the second portion of the duodenum. During the eighth to the tenth week of embryological development, errors of duodenal re-canalization are the main cause of duodenal atresia. In duodenal atresia, there is complete obstruction of the duodenal lumen. Duodenal stenosis is the term used for narrowing, resulting in an incomplete obstruction of the duodenum lumen. A duodenal web is a more rare cause of duodenal obstruction, which tends to cause a windsock deformity of the duodenal lumen.
