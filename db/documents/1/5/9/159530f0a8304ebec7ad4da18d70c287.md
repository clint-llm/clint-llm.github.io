The Apley grind test should not be performed on patients with gross knee deformities. In significant trauma with knee deformation and obvious fracture or dislocation, all provocative tests, including the Apley grind and distraction tests, should be deferred until imaging results are available. Additionally, special consideration and technique adjustments should occur for patients with previous amputations.
