The natural history of cervical spondylosis is highly variable, as well as challenging to prevent, given that it is part of the normal aging process. However, individuals can receive training on ways to deter early onset of cervical spondylosis, including maintaining good neck strength and flexibility, leading an active and healthy lifestyle, and preventing neck injuries (e.g., good ergonomics, avoiding prolonged neck extension, proper equipment for contact sports, safe tackling technique, and seatbelt use in automobiles). Patients should also understand the risks and benefits of surgical and non-surgical treatment options.
