LH is one of the two regulating hormones of the HPG axis, and its deficiency will result in its dysregulation. Thus its timely diagnosis and management are essential for proper reproductive health and preventing mental health issues related to these conditions. This condition requires management by an interprofessional team that includes an endocrinologist, gynecologist, nurse, mental health counselor, geneticist, and a reproductive endocrinologist if the patient is desirous of fertility.

AnyÂ hormone therapy initiated by the endocrinologist must outweigh the risks, for example, the risk of cardiovascular events, prostate cancer, and polycythemia in men with testosterone therapy, breast cancer, thromboembolic events, hypertension, and weight gain in women with hormone replacement therapy. Infertility has serious mental health effects and requires counseling with a mental health counselor. The adherence to drug therapy is achievable with the help of a nurse and pharmacist. A close follow-up is necessary because the result of hormone therapy is not immediate. Through the coordination of a healthcare team and education of the patient and their family, the reproductive and mental health of these patients can improve.
