Nipple discharge is best managed by an interprofessional team, including nurse practitioners. However, it is important to be aware that not all nipple discharge is benign. In some cases, a mass may be present, and further workup to rule out malignancy is recommended. The nurse has a crucial role in addressing the concerns of patients with women discharge, as this diagnosis could carry a tremendous negative emotional impact on patients and their families. The nurse assists the clinician in counseling these women and responding to their concerns throughout the journey of their management. The nurse carefully observes the characteristics of the nipple discharge and makes sure to document the findings in the patient's medical records. Breast care and radiologic specialty trained nurses are often involved in the coordination of care. The nurse should report any untoward changes in the vital signs of the patient to the clinician. The nurse should communicate with other members of the interprofessional team to ensure the optimal standard of care to their patients.Â [Level 5]
