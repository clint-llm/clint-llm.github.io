Complications of basophilia are not so much as in the increase in basophils but rather related to the underlying condition. Basophils themselves can degranulate in nascent tissue causing local damage, and it is important to prevent such damage by early intervention. Other complications of basophilia related to CML, PV, or ET include thrombosis both arterial and venous in which patient should have adequate screening and preventative measures.
