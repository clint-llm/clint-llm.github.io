**Portacaval Shunt**

The management of portal hypertension and variceal hemorrhage is challenging and complex. While once the domain of the general surgeon, today it is realized that the family practitioner, anesthesiologist, and allied healthcare practitioners play a vital role. To derive good outcomes, the goals and objectives of the portacaval shunt have to be defined prior to taking the patient to surgery. A recognition of symptomatology of the patient, typically seen in a primary care setting with a proper referral is of large importance. As with any other complex procedure, the preoperative workup must be thorough and the patient should be seen by a pulmonologist and cardiologist to optimize lung and cardiac function. Because of the potential risk of injury to the vascular system, caution during dissection should be undertaken and if an inadvertent injury occurs to these structures, prompt consultation from a vascular surgeon is warranted.

During the early postoperative period, close interdisciplinary management by the surgical team, anesthesiologists, and nursing staff is warranted for the optimized stabilization of these critical patients and for early identification of appropriate management of complications.

**Evidence-based Approach**

By utilization of an interprofessional team, thus providing a holistic and integrated approach to postoperative care, the best possible outcomes for the patient can be achieved.

Level 5 evidence-Patients with portal hypertension tend to have a syndrome of multiorgan dysfunction. These patients are thus at an increased risk for perioperative morbidity and mortality. The preoperative assessment should seek to distinguish between a patient who has compensated versus decompensated cirrhosis and identify factors that increase surgical risk, including malnutrition, coagulopathy, and renal dysfunction.

The Child-Turcotte-Pugh and Model for End-stage Liver Disease scores are some of the most commonly used tools for surgical risk stratification. Perioperative risk in patients with portal hypertension and cirrhosis may be mitigated by referral to the proper specialist providers, nutritional optimization, as well as avoidance of surgery when imprudent. Referral to proper specialists can better identify patients who are candidates for surgery and whom surgery will prove beneficial for. In the circumstance of portacaval shunt procedures, this includes, but is not limited to a nephrologist, gastroenterologist, hematologist, and in severe cases, a transplant surgeon. Nutritionists aid in the optimization of a patient's nutritional status prior to surgical intervention. Medicinal recommendations via the specialist and pharmacist are critical to the positive outcomes for the patient. The approach to the patient is holistic and an integrative process that utilizes an entire team of medical professionals.
