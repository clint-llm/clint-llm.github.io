Modes of Transmission:

- Direct Contact (touch, scratch, licking)

- Indirect Contact (fomites, soil, water)

- Animal Bites cause >4.7 million cases, 0.3 million ED visits, 10,000 hospitalizations, and 20 deaths in the U.S. per year, most commonly from dogs (80-90%) and cats (5% to 15%).

- Vector-borne (ticks, mosquitoes, lice, fleas, mites)

- Inhalation (droplet, aerosols from products of animal conception and feces)

- Ingestion (vegetables, meats, eggs, milk, water)

According to ND Wolfe’s paper in Nature 2007, pathogens go through five stages to transmit infections from animals to man:

- Stage 1: pathogens existing among animals only

- Stage 2: limited infections from animals to some humans

- Stage 3: limited outbreak level

- Stage 4: long outbreak level where human to human transmission can occur

- Stage 5: the pathogen can become an exclusively human pathogen with free transmission potential
