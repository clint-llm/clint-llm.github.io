While transfusion of blood products can be life-saving, it comes with its own risks. With time and experience, many practices have been developed to decrease transfusion-associated complications. Current practices focus on restricting unnecessary blood transfusions. All blood products are extensively tested pretransfusion to ensure safe and compatible transfusions.

ABO typing of blood products is among the first and basic tests in that process. ABO typing discrepancies pose a significant challenge to safe transfusion practices as they make the determination of the patient's blood group uncertain.
