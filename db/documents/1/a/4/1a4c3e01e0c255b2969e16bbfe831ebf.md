A double orifice mitral valve (DOMV) is a rare, congenital, or acquired anomaly that is typically asymptomatic. With time, however, it may lead to mitral valve dysfunction with resultant pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure, and atrial arrhythmias. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of a double orifice mitral valve and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the etiology of a double orifice mitral valve.
- Summarize the evaluation of the double orifice mitral valve.
- Review the treatment considerations for patients with a double orifice mitral valve.
- Describe the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by a double orifice mitral valve.
