Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome commonly gets misdiagnosed for more common conditions such as ischemic stroke or migraine, which may be associated with vasospasm, which could be a factor as to why RCVS is under-recognized. Also contributing to misdiagnosis and under-recognition can be due to indistinguishable clinical and imaging manifestations, mimicking that of CNS arteritis and other disorders.
