The pathophysiology of posttraumatic stress disorder involves alterations in the neurotransmitter and neurohormonal functioning. Individuals with PTSD have shown to have normal to low levels of cortisol and elevated levels of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) despite their ongoing stress. CRF stimulates the release of norepinephrine by the anterior cingulate cortex, which leads to an increased sympathetic response, which manifests as increased heart rate, blood pressure, increased arousal, and startle response. Also, some studies have shown altered functioning of other neurotransmitter systems such as GABA, glutamate, serotonin, neuropeptide Y, and other endogenous opioids in patients with PTSD. There is a decrease in GABA activity and an increase in the glutamate, which fosters dissociation and derealization. Serotonin concentration is also decreased in dorsal/median raphe, which likely changes the dynamic between the amygdala and the hippocampus. Plasma neuropeptide Y concentration is also reduced.

Also, PTSD is associated with the change in the neurophysiology and anatomy of the brain. The size of the hippocampus is reduced, and the amygdala(processing emotions and modulating fear response) is overly reactive in individuals with PTSD. The medial prefrontal cortex (inhibitory control over the emotional reactivity of amygdala) appears to be smaller and less responsive in patients with PTSD.
