Schwartz-Matsuo syndrome is a rare ocular condition characterized by a triad of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, aqueous cells in the anterior chamber, and elevated intraocular pressure. Schwartz-Matsuo syndrome presents with signs and symptoms related to retinal detachment and increased intraocular pressure, including unilateral eye pain, blurry vision, floaters, and decreased visual acuity that can lead to vision loss unless promptly evaluated and treated. This activity reviews the etiology, evaluation, and management of patients with Schwartz-Matsuo syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of Schwartz-Matsuo syndrome.
- Review the workup needed for the diagnosis of Schwartz-Matsuo syndrome.
- Outline treatment options for patients with Schwartz-Matsuo syndrome.
- Explain the importance of care coordination among subspecialists for an improved outcome for patients with Schwartz-Matsuo syndrome.
