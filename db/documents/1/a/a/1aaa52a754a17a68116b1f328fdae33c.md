Intramural hematoma of the esophagus usually presents as a sudden onset of chest or retrosternal pain. Most patients present with at least two of the classical triad of symptoms which are retrosternal chest pain, hematemesis, and dysphagia or odynophagia. History of Bleeding diathesis or anticoagulation medication should be included in the evaluation. There may be an associated history of violent retching, vomiting, or instrumentation of the esophagus. Rarely a history of foreign body ingestion may be present. Physical examination may not reveal any specific findings except tachycardia and pallor. It is essential to differentiate this condition from any cause of acute cardiac pain, as any anticoagulant therapy will worsen the situation. The presence of dysphagia or odynophagia can help to exclude significant cardiac reasons for the retrosternal pain.
