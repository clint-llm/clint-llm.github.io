The development of osteoprogenitor cells has been studied by several research groups. A study suggests that the perichondrial Thy-1–positive cells demonstrate potential osteogenic activity and participate in osteoblast formation during endochondral ossification. Another study shows intense alkaline phosphatase activity two weeks after osteogenic induction and the presence of mineralized nodules. The expression of bone sialoprotein, dentin matrix protein-1, and osteocalcin increases due to ALP proliferation. 55 to 65% of cells, as confirmed by flow cytometry, display the cell-surface markers Sca1+ and Thy1+ in vitro expansion for an alpha-SMA-GFP positive population. The alpha-SMA–GFP-positive population also exhibits high proliferative and osteogenic probabilities when compared to an alpha-SMA–GFP-negative population.
