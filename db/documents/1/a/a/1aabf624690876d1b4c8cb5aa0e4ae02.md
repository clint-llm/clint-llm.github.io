Vernix caseosa is a physiological, viscous biofilm that is produced by desquamated fetal skin and sebaceous glands covering the fetus at the third trimester in-utero. The substance's gross morphology in post-partum is described by the etymology, as vernix means varnish, and caseosa means cheesy-like matter. Although an observer would think of it as an unfunctional byproduct of parturition, it has shown developmental effects on the fetal skin and other visceral systems' biochemical adaptation to the extrauterine environment. Also, it forms a mechanical barrier and vaginal lubrication, facilitating parturition, and protecting the fetus from vertical transmission of any microbes.
