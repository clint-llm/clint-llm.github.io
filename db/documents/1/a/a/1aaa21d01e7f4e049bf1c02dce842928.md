All healthcare professionals should be thorough in their approach when assessing the patient. Interprofessional communication should be clear to ensure that the patient is treated swiftly and promptly, especially in trauma situations. All clinicians, not just ophthalmologists but also family practitioners and optometrists who have a role in front-line healthcare as the initial point of medical contact after a traumatic event or within eye emergency departments, should have a good understanding of the pathology, its pathophysiology, investigations required, and treatment options to allow smooth discussion and handoff between teams.
