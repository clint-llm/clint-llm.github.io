The spinal cord is composed of three layers: ventricular zone, intermediate zone, and marginal zone. The ventricular zone develops into two collections of cells forming the alar plate and basal plate. The alar plate cells become the afferent (sensory) neurons and form the posterior (dorsal) column of the spinal cord. The basal plate cells become the efferent (motor) neurons of the anterior (ventral) spinal cord.
