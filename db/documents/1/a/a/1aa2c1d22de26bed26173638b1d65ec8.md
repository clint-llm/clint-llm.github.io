Pyogenic or suppurative flexor tenosynovitis (PFT) is a severe bacterial infection within the closed space of the digital flexor tendon sheaths.

The detection of the four Kanavel signs on physical assessment has high sensitivity (91.4 to 97.1%) to diagnose pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis.

**Anatomy of Flexor Tendon Sheaths**

The knowledge of the anatomy of hand flexor tendon sheaths is crucial for better understanding and management of PFT.  Each flexor tendon sheath comprises two layers; an inner visceral layer and an outer parietal layer. The visceral layer closely covers the flexor tendon forming the epitenon.

As the PFT develops, pus accumulates within the flexor sheath synovial space, causing high pressures up to 30 mm Hg within the flexor sheath closed space.

The flexor tendon sheaths for the index, middle, ring, and little fingers terminate at the level of flexor digitorum superficialis tendon insertion in the distal phalanx.  In the thumb, the flexor tendon sheath ends at the level of flexor pollicis longus tendon insertion. Proximally, the flexor sheaths of the index, middle, and ring fingers extend to the A1 pulley at the level of the neck of the metacarpal bone. The sheath of the flexor pollicis longus tendon communicates with the radial bursa proximally. The little finger flexor sheath communicates with the ulnar bursa in about 80 % of the population.
