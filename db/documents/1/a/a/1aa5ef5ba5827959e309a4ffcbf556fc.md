Most patients diagnosed with HIV will develop AIDS within ten years if left untreated.  An asymptomatic phase can last approximately eight years, followed by a rapid decline once CD4 levels drop to a level of around 200 cells/µL.  If antiretroviral therapy is initiated even after an initial AIDS diagnosis (severe immunosuppression on the first presentation), the patient may live for greater than ten years.  Once patients have been diagnosed with AIDS, if they do not receive antiretroviral therapy, they will probably die within two years.
