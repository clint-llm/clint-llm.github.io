A comprehensive history and thorough physical exam are essential, as the presentation is often vague and variable amongst patients. Inquiring about recent surgical history or comorbidities may provide the insight needed to recognize this condition. Although it can be challenging to identify, listed below are the symptoms most commonly associated with BLS:

**Megaloblastic Anemia**

It typically results from vitamin B12 deficiency; sometimes multifactorial, seen in conjunction with low folate levels.

**Diarrhea/Steatorrhea**

The specific presentation depends on the etiology, region, and extent of bowel involvement; diarrhea/steatorrhea also contributes to weight loss.

**Malnutrition**

Patients can develop multiple micronutrient deficiencies due to intestinal damage and impaired fat absorption.

- Vitamin A deficiency: xeropthalmia, night blindness, hyperkeratosis

- Vitamin D deficiency: secondary hyperparathyroidism, muscle weakness, fractures

- Vitamin K deficiency: bruising, melena, hematuria, menorrhagia

- Vitamin E deficiency: neuropathy, nystagmus, skeletal myopathy

- Calcium deficiency: brittle bones, seizures, prolonged QT interval

**Protein Loss**

It can be seen as cachexia or edema on physical exam.

**Other non-specific symptoms**include diffuse, crampy, and colicky abdominal pain, nausea, belching, bloating, and flatulence.
