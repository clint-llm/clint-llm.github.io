Premenstrual symptoms can affect all women of reproductive age, ranging from menarche to menopause.****Premenstrual symptoms are a common problem for women in the reproductive age group. In the United States, approximately 70 to 90% of women in the reproductive age group report at least some premenstrual discomfort. Approximately one-third of these women have symptoms that are bothersome enough to qualify for the diagnosis of PMS. The most severe form of premenstrual symptom complex, PMDD, has been noted in 3 to 8% of these PMS cases. Transgender individuals can have premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Anyone with ovaries can have symptoms.

In a study by Halbreich et al., women in the U.S. have about 481 menstrual cycles during this lifespan. Taking into account the 22 months for two pregnancies and postpartum periods, many women roughly experience 459 cycles during their childbearing years. Also, US women with PMDD experience an average of 6.4 days of severe symptoms per menstrual cycle
