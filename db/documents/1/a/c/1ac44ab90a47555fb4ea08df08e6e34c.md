Treatment usually consists of treating the underlying disorder.

**Noninvasive techniques:**Include gait rehabilitation, visually guided techniques, tendon vibration, weighting extremities, positioning techniques, and manual techniques, all of which can be useful for the recovery of functional activities.

**Pharmacological treatment:**There is no specific recommended treatment for intention tremor. Isoniazid is the most commonly used for patients with MS with results in about half of the patients, but others like botulinum toxin A, levetiracetam, 4-amino-pyridine, cannabis had been used.

**Invasive techniques:**Thalamic deep brain stimulation can alleviate the tremor in MS, providing better functional performance.
