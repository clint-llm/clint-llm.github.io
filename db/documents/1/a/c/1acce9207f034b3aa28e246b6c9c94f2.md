RAIU with I-123 is used to measure overall thyroid function in hyperthyroidism, to help differentiate among differential causes, including productive thyrotoxicosis, destructive thyrotoxicosis, and factitious thyrotoxicosis. It can also be used to help calculate the dose for I-131 therapy. I-123 RAIU and scan may be helpful in the evaluation of thyroid nodules if the TSH is subnormal to low. I-123 RAIUâ€™s value is limited in evaluating hypothyroidism but can be used as part of the perchlorate discharge test to identify an iodine organification defect in neonatal hypothyroidism.
