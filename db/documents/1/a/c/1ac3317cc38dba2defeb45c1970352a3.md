Patients with inflammatory breast cancer typically present with pain or a rapidly growing breast lump associated with itching and enlargement of the breast. Almost all have lymph node involvement at the time of presentation, and about one-third will have distant metastasis. Therefore, some may present with swollen lymph nodes or localizing pain depending on the location and extent of the disease.

The onset of symptoms is rapid, ranging from weeks to months. Most patients are initially treated with antibiotics for presumed mastitis or abscess and seek expert advice after no clinical improvement. Unfortunately, an abnormal screening mammogram constitutes about 10% of cases at presentation.

On examination, the breast shape might be distorted or enlarged, and the skin appears like the skin of an orange (Peau d'orange), warm and thick to touch. Nipple involvement is seen as crusting, erythema, flattening, blisters, or retraction of the nipple. A discrete palpable mass may or may not be present. A detailed examination of both breasts and axilla should be performed for local lymph node involvement.
