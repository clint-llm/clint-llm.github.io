The diagnostic criteria for small-duct primary sclerosing cholangitis (SDPSC) included biochemical features of chronic cholestasis with unknown etiology, normal cholangiogram, liver histology compatible with PSC. SDPSC is more common in males with an average age of 38 years old. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of SDPSC and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the small duct primary sclerosing cholangitis in the etiology of chronic cholestasis.
- Describe the pathophysiology of small duct primary sclerosing cholangitis.
- Summarize the prognosis of small duct primary sclerosing cholangitis compares to large duct primary sclerosing cholangitis.
- Explain the importance of SDPSC diagnosis and how it affects to improving care coordination among the interprofessional team when distinguishing SDPSC from large duct primary sclerosing cholangitis (LDPSC).
