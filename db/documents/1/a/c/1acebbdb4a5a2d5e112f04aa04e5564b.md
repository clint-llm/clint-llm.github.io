Patients experiencing acute traumatic knee pain should consult their PCP or present to an urgent care. Rest, ice, compression, and elevation can be useful early on. Depending on the history of injury and physical exam, your physician may want to order an MRI of the knee. Depending on the severity of the injury, patients may need to be immobile for several weeks. In severe cases, LCL reconstruction surgery is advised, with approximately a 6-month rehabilitation process.
