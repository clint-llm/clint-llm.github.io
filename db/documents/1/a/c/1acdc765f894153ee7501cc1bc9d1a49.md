Sometimes, it is difficult to distinguish radial neuropathies from central nervous system (CNS) lesions, as they can both cause wrist extension weakness (wrist drop). To differentiate between a peripheral radial neuropathy from a central pathology, test the brachioradialis muscle. It is always weak in a peripheral radial nerve injury and less affected with a CNS disorder.
