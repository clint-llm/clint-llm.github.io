While sinuplasty is done by the surgeon, a nurse is often needed to assist during the procedure. First, the nurse has to confirm which side of the nose is being treated and document it. If any sedation is to be used, the nurse has to monitor the vital signs regularly. The patient's pain level has to be monitored. After the procedure, the patient needs to be monitored for 1-2 hours before discharge.
