Cardioversion is the process of converting an abnormal and potentially dangerous heart rhythm into a normal sinus rhythm. The normal heart rate comes from the sinoatrial node and progresses through the right atrium to the atrioventricular (AV) node and then through the conduction system to the ventricles. For a variety of reasons, including structural changes to the heart, medications, and tissue damage, the heart can go into a rhythm that does not follow the normal process and can lead to either unorganized contraction of the different chambers of the heart or abnormality in the heart rates - fast, slow, or irregular. This activity describes the indications, contraindications, complications and potential benefits of pharmacological cardioversion.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the technique of pharmacological cardioversion.
- Review the indications for pharmacological cardioversion.
- Summarize the potential complications of pharmacological cardioversion.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients undergoing pharmacological cardioversion.
