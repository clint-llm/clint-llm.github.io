The maxillary sinus is irrigated by branches of the maxillary artery: the infraorbital artery, the posterior superior alveolar artery (PSAA), and the posterior lateral nasal artery.

The infraorbital artery travels through the infraorbital groove and canal and then through the infraorbital foramen.

The maxillary sinusâ€™ innervation is provided by branches of the maxillary nerve: middle, anterior, and posterior superior alveolar nerves, and infraorbital nerve.

The frontal sinus vasculature consists of the supraorbital and supratrochlear arteries and ophthalmic and supraorbital veins.

The sphenopalatine artery supplies the sphenoid sinus, and venous drainage is via the maxillary vein.

The ethmoid sinuses are supplied by the anterior and posterior ethmoid arteries, respectively. These arteries are branches of the ophthalmic artery, a branch of the internal carotid artery. Ethmoid sinus venous drainage is done by the maxillary and ethmoid veins.
