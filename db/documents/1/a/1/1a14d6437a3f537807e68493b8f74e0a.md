Jaundice is evident when the serum bilirubin level exceeds 3mg/dL. Gilbert syndrome and Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I and II, are hereditary non-hemolytic unconjugated hyperbilirubinemias that result from the mutations in the UGT1A1 gene and impair bilirubin conjugation. In Gilbert syndrome, UGT1A1 enzyme activity is 10 to 30% of normal, which results in mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with bilirubin levels below 5 mg/dL.

Individuals with Crigler-Najjar type II (CNS2) have less than 10% of the normal UGT1A1 activity, resulting in bilirubin levels of 5Â to 25 mg/dL. Kernicterus is rare in Crigler-Najjar type II, but patients with increased bilirubin levels (greater than 15 mg/dL) have high chances of its occurrence.
