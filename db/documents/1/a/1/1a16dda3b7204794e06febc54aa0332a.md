Rhinitis medicamentosia is a preventable condition, and therefore awareness about the complication of overuse among both healthcare professionals and patients is essential. All members of the interprofessional team should help manage the condition, from the clinician, who may prescribe the agents that cause it or treat it, to the pharmacist who can detect a trend in medication use that leads to it, and should report their findings to the patient's clinician, to the nurse who can work directly with the clinician and counsel and help the patient use medication correctly. Interprofessional collaboration can alleviate patient suffering in this condition. [Level 5]
