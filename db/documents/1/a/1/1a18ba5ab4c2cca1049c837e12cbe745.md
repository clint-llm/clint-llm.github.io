Initial management consists of anticoagulation. Heparin can be started in the emergency department with the goal of bridging to warfarin or a newer generation anticoagulant. Additional treatment options depend on the acuity of the thrombus. There may be a benefit to catheter-directed thrombolysis or thrombectomy if the IVC thrombus is acute (<14 days), subacute (15 to 28 days), and for a patient who is not at high risk of bleeding. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stenting is also a consideration. However, chronic (more than 28 days) IVC thrombosis may benefit more from stenting than catheter-directed thrombolysis. Ultimately, when evaluating the patient in the emergency department, starting heparin is crucial. Consulting vascular surgery is necessary for other potential treatment options.  If the IVC thrombus is due to an extrinsic cause, such as a tumor, then further diagnostic testing will be needed.
