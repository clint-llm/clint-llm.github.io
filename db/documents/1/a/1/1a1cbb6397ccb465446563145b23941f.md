Myopic foveoschisis is a cause of gradual progressive loss of vision in high myopic eyes. Other causes of such diminution of vision in myopic eyes need to be ruled out. Such causes include:

- Myopic choroidal neovascularization

- Retinal detachment

- Lamellar/full-thickness macular hole

- Forster-Fuch spots at the fovea

Elaborate history taking, detailed clinical examination, and judicious use of investigative modalities usually help to make the correct diagnosis.
