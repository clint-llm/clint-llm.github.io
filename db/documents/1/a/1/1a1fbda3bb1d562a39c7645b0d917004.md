The prognosis of isolated mandibular dislocation is good but differs on the type of dislocation. Anterior dislocations have an excellent prognosis while lateral dislocations are mostly associated with fractures and require open reduction. Long-term complications are rare following appropriate management of acute dislocation. Despite proper treatment, some acute dislocations will have an increased risk of recurrence.
