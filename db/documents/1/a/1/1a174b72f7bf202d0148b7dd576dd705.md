The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved indications for oral risperidone (tablets, oral solution, and M-TABs) include the treatment of schizophrenia (in adults and children aged 13 and up), bipolar I acute manic or mixed episodes as monotherapy (in adults and children aged 10 and up), bipolar I acute manic or mixed episodes adjunctive with lithium or valproate (in adults), and autism-associated irritability (in children aged 5 and up). Also, the long-acting risperidone injection has been approved for the use of schizophrenia and maintenance of bipolar disorder (as monotherapy or adjunctive to valproate or lithium) in adults. There are also many varied non-FDA-approved uses for risperidone. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, administration methods, significant adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring, of risperidone, so providers can direct patient therapy in treating conditions for which it is indicated as part of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action for risperidone.
- Summarize the indications for initiating therapy with risperidone.
- Review the contraindications and adverse event profile for risperidone.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients who can benefit from therapy with risperidone.
