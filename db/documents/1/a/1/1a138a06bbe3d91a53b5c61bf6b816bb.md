The degeneration of articular cartilage on the surfaces of hinge joints is the source of much pain and dysfunction. This has fueled research in the area of cartilage replacement and regeneration. Adipose-derived stem cells are now being injected into joints to help decrease inflammation and promote regeneration of cartilage. Hyaluronic acid is a glycosaminoglycan that occurs naturally throughout the body and specifically in synovial fluid. It is now synthetically produced and injected into joints as viscosupplementation to help decrease friction and pain between articular surfaces. The mechanisms behind these treatment modalities are notÂ completely understood, and both lack substantial studies, and more research is needed.
