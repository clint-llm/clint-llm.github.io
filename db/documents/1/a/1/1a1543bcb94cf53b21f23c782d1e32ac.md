**Visual field testing:**Typically shows normal acuity and fundi. But can also show hemifield impairments or constrictions and variable field deficits that may not be typical of classical cortical lesions.

**Neuropsychological testing**will demonstrate preservation of orientation, repetition, and recall, with difficulties in calculation, spelling, copying figures, and clock drawing dependent on parietal lobe functioning. Right parietal dysfunction is also evidenced through difficulties in dot counting, line bisection, or clock drawing. Neuropsychological research criteria for PCA require fulfillment of clinical criteria with an impaired performance below the 5th percentile in at least two of the following four parietal tests object perception, space perception, calculation, spelling, AND evidence of performance above the 5th percentile in recognition memory.

**Structural neuroimaging:**The distribution of amyloid deposition as noted in amyloid PET is typically widespread and is very similar to that of patients with typical Alzheimer's disease.

**Functional Neuroimaging:**Fludeoxyglucose PET scan is likely to demonstrate hypometabolism in parietooccipital cortices. However, when there is a typical history of PCA, an absence of marked parietooccipital atrophy should not exclude the diagnosis.

**Genetic testing:**Testing for autosomal dominant forms of the disease and APOE testing is typically not indicated. RegardingAPOE ε4 testing, the presence of the APOE ε4 allele may be less likely when compared to the typical cases and hence not recommended.

**CSF testing:**CSF amyloid-β (Aβ) is typically decreased, and both total and phosphorylated tau increase. This is reflective of the underlying AD pathophysiology. However, some studies suggest that the degree of total and phosphorylated tau elevation is not as high as in typical AD. Hence, the tau to Aβ ratios may be lower than typical AD.

**Recent advances:**

- Tau-PET is more specific since it is a tauopathy, thereby mirrors the regions of hypometabolism and atrophy compared to PET-amyloid scan.

- 11C-PBR28-PET, microglia-specific imaging, shows higher binding in the occipital cortex bilaterally.

- The visual evoked potential (VEP) may be a good adjunct in the diagnosis.

**The proposed algorithmic steps suggested during the evaluation of PCA include:**

- Is it neurodegenerative pathology?

- Is it a posteriorly based cortical entity?

- Is it pure PCA or PCA plus Alzheimer disease (AD), Lewi body dementia (LBD), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), or prion lesion?

- Does it have positivity to any pertinent biomarkers such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Ab 1-42, Tau, p-Tau for AD, and 14-3-3 protein for prion disease?
