Krukenberg tumors have a highly variable presentation. Their symptoms can be non-specific, and their signs obscure. One recent meta-analysis revealed that almost half of Krukenberg tumors were synchronous with the primary tumor, about two-thirds were bilateral, about forty percent had a diameter greater than 10 cm, and half had peritoneal involvement, oft with ascites.

Ascites, typically a late feature of peritoneal metastases, can occur alongside intestinal obstruction and cachexia and heralds a sharp decline in the patient's quality of life. Krukenberg tumors with benign ascites and right hydrothorax that contain no malignant cells are known as Pseudo-Meig syndrome.

Krukenberg tumors can cause a reaction of the ovarian stroma and thus provoke hormone production, resulting in vaginal bleeding, menstrual changes, hirsutism, and virilization. These signs can cause a delay in diagnosis leading to significant patient infirmity.
