Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is a rare X-linked disorder which classically includes the characteristic triad of immunodeficiency, thrombocytopenia, and eczema. It results from a genetic mutation in the gene encoding Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp). The disease has variable presentation ranging from the severe phenotype (classic WAS) to milder ones (X-linked thrombocytopenia and X-linked neutropenia). This activity describes the pathophysiology, etiology, presentation, and evaluation of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.
- Review the pathophysiology of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.
- Summarize the treatment options for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to enhance outcomes for patients affected by Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.
