The human immunodeficiency virus is a ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral pathogen that has two subtypes: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the most common type worldwide and more transmissible and progresses faster than HIV-2. Presumably, this Retroviridae family originated from wild chimpanzees in Central Africa.
