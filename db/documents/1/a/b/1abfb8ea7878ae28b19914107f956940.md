Thorough patient evaluation is indispensable with special care given to vaccination, exposure, travel, and occupational histories. Red flags are when the patient has been in contact with the virus either for scientific or military research or disclosed any proximity to known zoonotic sources (bushmeat, hunting, etc.).

A complete physical exam is vital; however, as many poxvirus lesions, especially those of molluscum, are almost pathognomonic (dome and crater) in appearance. Assessing hyperpyrexia, lymphadenopathy, and oral and ocular exams could also show plausible evidence in determining a full clinical picture, specifically looking for evidence of pneumonitis.
