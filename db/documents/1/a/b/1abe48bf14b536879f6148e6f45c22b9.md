A National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) data brief reported the prevalence of low HDL cholesterol among U.S. adults aged ≥20. This report defined low HDL cholesterol levels as serum HDL levels less than 40 mg/dL. The report showed the differences in HDL levels in populations based on if adults fulfilled the 2008 physical activity guidelines from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Fulfilling physical activity guidelines was described as engaging in either ≥150 minutes per week of intermediate-intensity aerobic activity, ≥75 minutes per week of high-intensity aerobic exercise, or an equivalent combination. The prevalence of low HDL cholesterol was higher in adults who did not fulfill the physical activity guidelines (21.0%) than in those who did (17.7%).

The prevalence of low HDL cholesterol levels in all U.S. adults was 19%. For those who did not meet the physical activity guidelines, the prevalence of low HDL was 35.4% for men and 11.8% for women. For those who did meet the guidelines, the prevalence of low HDL was 25.0% for men and 9.1% for women.

The report showed substantial differences by race and ethnicity for those who met the physical activity guidelines. The prevalence was 20.7% of Hispanic adults, 18.1% of White adults, 14.4% of Asian adults, and 12.4% of Black adults.
