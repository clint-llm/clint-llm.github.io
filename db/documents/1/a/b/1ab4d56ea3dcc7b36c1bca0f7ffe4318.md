Treatment of femoral shaft fractures can be operative or non-operative. Operative fixation with intramedullary nailing is the gold standard of treatment in high-income countries. Other operative techniques include plate osteosynthesis and external fixation. Closed treatment with traction, splinting, and casting may be temporary treatment or definitive treatment in some third-world countries.

**Intramedullary Nailing**

Intramedullary nailing (IMN) is the gold standard of treatment for femoral shaft fractures. Early definitive treatment in systemically stable patients within 24 to 48 hours reduces the incidence of pulmonary complications, infection rates, and mortality. Hemodynamically stable patients with multiple injuries received the most benefit from early fixation. Delayed treatment increases pulmonary complications in up to 56% of patients compared to only 16% of patients treated early.

The insertion site of an IMN is outside the zone of injury, preserving the surrounding blood flow and retains the hematoma that contains beneficial bone growth factors. Intramedullary nailing also has the benefits of early weight-bearing that helps maintain muscle mass, function, strength, and mobility.

**Antegrade Nailing**

In the 1940s, Dr. Gerhard Küntscher developed the first intramedullary nail. With improved designs, nailing techniques, and locking screws, more complex injuries have been treated with intramedullary nailing. Approaches to nail fixation depend on the patient’s age, body habitus, comorbidities, nail design, and physician preferences.

Antegrade nailing is the gold standard treatment of femoral shaft fractures with excellent outcomes if patients are treated within the first 24 hours. Early fixation decreases pulmonary complications, improved rehabilitation, reduced length of stay, and lower healthcare costs.

There is debate about the benefits of early fixation in patients with closed head injuries. Some studies demonstrate an increased incidence of pulmonary complications and CNS function with early treatment secondary to a second hit phenomenon of hypoxia and hypotension. Other studies have shown that early fixation does not increase CNS complications; rather, it is the head injury that increased the risk of both CNS and pulmonary complications. However, it is advised to avoid hypoxia and hypotension in these individuals and to consider less invasive treatments in the acute phase of treatment.

Approaches include the piriformis, trochanteric, and lateral entry. In the piriformis entry approach, the nail trajectory is along the long axis of the femur, and a straight design nail is used. Disadvantages of this approach include injury to the abductor muscles with resultant Trendelenburg gait and damage to the blood supply to the femoral head. The trochanteric entry technique spares the abductors to a greater degree, and it is easier to establish the starting point. The anterior and lateral bow of the nail accommodates the curvature of the femur. Using a straight nail in this approach risks perforation of the anterior cortex or when the starting point on the greater trochanter is too posterior. The trochanteric entry technique has a reduced operative and fluoroscopic time compared to the piriformis entry technique. Long term functional outcomes are equivalent between the approaches.

**Retrograde Nailing**

Retrograde nailing has recently become more popular. Indications for this technique include the ipsilateral femoral neck, acetabular, tibia fractures (floating knee injuries), bilateral femur fractures, pregnancy, and morbidly obese individuals. Studies have demonstrated comparable outcomes for antegrade nailing. Union (100% vs 99%), malunion (11% vs 13%), and nonunion rates (6% vs 6%) are similar for retrograde and antegrade approaches. A common complaint of retrograde nailing is knee pain, while for anterograde nailing, it is hip pain and stiffness.

The starting point in this approach is in the middle of the intercondylar notch and 2 to 4 mm anterior to the distal tip of Blumensaat’s line. Despite entering the knee joint, there is no increase in septic knees. Long term, patients may report anterior knee pain or screw irritation distally. Iatrogenic injury to the cartilage and ligaments of the knee is possible.

**Reaming**

Reaming techniques of the medullary canal provide both mechanical as well as biological benefits to intramedullary nailing. In rat models, reaming did affect the endosteal blood supply, which regenerated in about 12 weeks.

**Plate Osteosynthesis**

Open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) techniques developed in the 1960s were the first operative techniques utilized for fracture fixation. Over time, a better understanding of biological and mechanical processes in fracture fixation was established. ORIF is typically not the primary treatment of femoral shaft fractures unless there is extension to the proximal or distal femur, which may be a contraindication to intramedullary nail fixation. Plates are used in recalcitrant nonunions, periprosthetic and peri-implant fractures, narrow femoral canals, and open fractures with vascular injury. Open plating techniques require fracture site visualization and significant soft tissue stripping around the fracture site, resulting in interruption of blood flow to the bone, especially the periosteum.

**External Fixation**

External fixation is indicated for patients with open fractures, vascular injuries, polytrauma, stabilization for transfer, and those unstable for early definitive care. External fixators can be applied with minimal effect on the trauma patient’s disease burden. Fixator constructs can vary from surgeon to surgeon, but the governing principles are stable fixation with the relative restoration of length, alignment, and rotation. Neurovascular structures can be avoided by placing pins laterally into the femur rather than from anterior to posterior. Proximal pins can be placed into the femoral neck and head, while distal pins may be placed in the distal femur or proximal tibia. Infrequently external fixators can be used as definitive treatment if conversion to internal fixation is contraindicated because of medical or other orthopedic problems. Definitive treatment with external fixation has a relatively high complication rate, such as loss of reduction, malunion, pin site infections, osteomyelitis, nonunion, and joint stiffness.

**Traction**

First responders at the scene of an accident must quickly assess for any potentially life-threatening injuries. Special attention must be placed on the lower extremities where significant pooling of blood is possible, as discussed earlier. Temporary traction devices such as the Thomas, Hare, Sager, Kendrick, CT-6, Donway, and Slishman splints may be utilized to stabilize apparent femoral injuries. Longitudinal traction applied to the extremity stabilizes the fracture site, restoring the gross length, alignment, and rotation. Traction may also relieve pressure on neurovascular structures and tamponade bleeding by stabilizing the surrounding clot. These devices should be promptly exchanged for fiberglass vs. plaster splint or skin vs. skeletal traction in the hospital because prolonged use may cause pressure sores or compress neurovascular structures distally.

More tolerable and effective traction systems include skin and skeletal traction that provide better distraction of the affected extremity. Skin traction, also called Bucks traction, is applied through a boot attached to the distal extremity with a counterweight. The problem specific to this technique is a shear injury to the underlying dermal tissue.

In skeletal traction, a pin is placed through the bone distal to the injury preventing the soft tissues from bearing the traction forces. Common sites of pin placement include the distal femur, proximal tibia, and calcaneus, with the distal femur as the preferred placement because of the superior force vector, better control, and ability to range the knee. In rare cases, skeletal traction may serve as a prolonged treatment in medically unstable patients or as definitive treatment in certain parts of the world. Complications of skeletal traction include pin site infections, iatrogenic neurovascular injury, muscle wasting, immobility, malunion, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism.

**Other Considerations**

An aging population that aspires to stay active for longer will continue to seek hip and knee replacements, and a growing elderly population will undergo hemi or total hip arthroplasty for femoral neck fractures and cephalomedullary nailing for other proximal femoral fractures. It is projected that by 2040 there will be 1.4 million THA (284% increase) and 3.4 million TKA (401% increase) replacements performed each year.
