Stroke prevention, either primary or secondary is the primary goal of treatment. Patients at the highest risk should be identified early and counseled on lifestyle changes as well as control of comorbid conditions to prevent this devastating outcome. Conditions that increase a patient's risk for cerebrovascular accidents include uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled hypertension, nicotine abuse, and atrial fibrillation. These are the most common and high prevalence diseases, however, other conditions are also linked to vascular pathologies such as vasculitis and certain autoimmune diseases. Primary care and specialty providers must diligently identify these patients and provide focused counseling as well as aggressive therapy for underlying diseases to prevent this outcome.

The American Stroke Association has suggested the acronym ACT FAST to recognize the early symptoms of a stroke. They include:

- F (Face) - A droop or an uneven smile on a person’s face.

- A (Arms) - Arm numbness or weakness - Elicited by asking the patient to lift the arms

- S (Speech difficulty) - Slurred speech or difficulty in understanding speech

- T (Time) - If any of the above features are present, even if transient, it is time to call the emergency helpline (911).

The additional symptoms of stroke to be watched for are:

- Sudden Numbness

- Sudden Confusion

- Sudden Trouble Seeing

- Sudden Trouble Walking

- Sudden Severe Headache
