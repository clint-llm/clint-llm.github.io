The majority of cases respond well to silver nitrate resulting in a return of baseline vision, although rarely, patients may experience mild permanent vision loss. In some cases, small patches of irregular epithelium remain after treatment; however, remnants are almost exclusively at the corneal periphery, leaving the visual axis clear. Recurrence is rare and usually less severe, tending to occur outside the visual axis without requiring repeated treatment.
