Phacoemulsification has evolved ever since its inception from anterior segment phaco to pupillary plane to posterior chamber phacoemulsification to safeguard the corneal endothelium, minimize complications and give a perfect postoperative visual outcome.Â The ophthalmic cataract surgeons and researchers have a crucial role in determining the ideal outcome.

The nursing team plays a crucial role in preoperative investigations, counseling, intraoperative patient preparation, surgeon's assistance, postoperative patient counseling, and follow-up. The pharmacists also play a vital role in supplying the essential topical medications and guidance of the patients. In case of any complications, the vitreoretinal surgeon also plays an essential role in assessing the retinal status and need for retinal surgery like pars plana vitrectomy and lensectomy. In a nutshell, a multidisciplinary, coordinated effort is required for a perfect outcome after phacoemulsification.
