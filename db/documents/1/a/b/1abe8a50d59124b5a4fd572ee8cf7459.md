The development of subcutaneous emphysema is thought to be caused by the following mechanisms

- Injury to the parietal pleura that allows for the passage of air into the pleural and subcutaneous tissues

- Air from the alveolus spreading into the endovascular sheath and lung hilum into the endothoracic fascia

- The air in the mediastinum spreading into the cervicalÂ viscera and other connected tissue planes

- Air originating from external sources

- Gas generation locally by infections, specifically, necrotizing infections
