The patients suffering trauma to their forearm should promptly get their injuries evaluated and adequately treated, as such fractures can lead to significant long-term disability when neglected. Furthermore, as the forearm is considered a special joint contributing to pronation and supination movements, suboptimal management can substantially limit the rotational movements of the forearm and thereby cause limitations in activities of daily living. Also, proper rehabilitation and physical therapy are paramount in getting the best functional outcomes after surgical and conservative management of forearm fractures.
