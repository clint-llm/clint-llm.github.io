As discussed in the history and physical section, a thorough examination of the HZO patient may reveal an array of complications, including blepharitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis, uveitis, and secondary glaucoma. Prolonged inflammation and corneal scarring can lead to serious complications, including permanent vision loss. Neurotrophic keratopathy, resulting from dysfunctional corneal innervation, leaves patients more susceptible to corneal abrasions, corneal ulcers, and persistent corneal epithelial defects, even in the absence of replicating viruses or active inflammation. Necrotizing retinitis is an uncommon complication of HZO that can lead to retinal tears, retinal detachment, and subsequent permanent vision changes. Additionally, patients with HZO commonly develop postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) as a result of a peripheral nerve injury. PHN is a chronic painful condition in which herpes zoster pain persists for more than 90 days after the initial rash outbreak. Older age and severe disease are risk factors for PHN, while prior zoster vaccination appears to be protective. In addition to complications directly related to HZO, patients are alsoÂ prone to secondary bacterial infections.
