The sural nerve block is typically performed at the level of the ankle. In the ultrasound-guided approach, the provider first locates the key anatomical areas including the posterior border of the lateral malleolus and the Achilles tendon. The site lateral to the Achilles tendon and posteromedial to the lateral malleolus is marked. The linear high frequency (10-18 MHz) ultrasound probe is placed in this marked area in a transverse orientation, and the small saphenous vein is subsequently identified (Figure 2). An out-of-plane approach can be performed, ensuring the local anesthetic (typically 5 mL) is injected circumferentially around the lesser saphenous vein.

While ultrasound-guidance may lower total local anesthetic volume and minimize the risk of neural or intravascular injection, a standard landmark-based technique is still commonly performed. In this traditional approach, the Achilles tendon and the lateral malleolus are visually identified by palpation. At the level of the superior border of the lateral malleolus and lateral to the Achilles tendon, the needle is inserted with a trajectory aimed toward the lateral malleolus. If a paresthesia is generated, needle advancement is stopped, and a local anesthetic (about 3-5 mL) is injected after a negative aspiration. If no paresthesia is detected, the needle is advanced until it contacts the lateral malleolus bone, and a local anesthetic is subsequently injected as the needle is withdrawn.
