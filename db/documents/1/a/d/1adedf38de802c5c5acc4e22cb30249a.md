Thyroid cancer staging is done using American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)â€™s TNM system presently in the 8th edition as of 2017. It uses tumor size and extrathyroidal extension (T), regional cervical, mediastinal, and retropharyngeal lymph node involvement status (N), and distant metastases (M) into account. All different types of thyroid cancers are classified using the same system with a few noteworthy characteristics-

- All patients with differentiated thyroid carcinomas under 55 are considered to have a good prognosis, and even the most widely metastatic tumors get a maximum stage II.

- All anaplastic thyroid tumors are considered to have a poor prognosis and start at a minimum stage of IVA.

- Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid has some differences in tumor (T) definitions for its staging compared to Hurthle cell and follicular carcinomas.
