The distal radius is the most common fracture site in the upper extremity. With over 600000 cases annually in the United States alone, distal radial fractures account for more than 16% of all adult fractures and 75% of forearm fractures.

In the elderly population, distal radial fractures are the second most common fracture, second only to hip fractures.
