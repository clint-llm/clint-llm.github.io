The navicular is a wedge-shaped bone that articulates with five tarsal bones (talus, cuboid, and three cuneiform bones) forming syndesmotic joints. It is located in the midfoot together with the cuboid and three cuneiform bones. Although the navicular bone is considered a small bone, it serves an essential role in building up acetabulum pedis. This bone frequently gets overlooked, but the existence of pathologies would give rise to exasperating problems. While fractures of the midfoot are an uncommon injury, one-third of human stress fractures are represented by navicular stress fractures that have a high risk of nonunion and osteonecrosis. The tibialisÂ posterior tendon is the only tendinous insertion attached to the navicular bone and acts as the primary dynamic stabilizer of the rearfoot by preserving the medial longitudinal arch of the foot. Several ligaments also attach to the navicular bone and perform a significant function in maintaining human bipedal biomechanics.
