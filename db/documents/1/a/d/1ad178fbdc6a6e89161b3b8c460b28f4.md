The absolute contraindications to using mexiletine include untreated second or third-degree heart block, cardiogenic shock, and hypersensitivity to the drug or drug class. It should be used cautiously in a patient with conduction abnormalities that are not second or third-degree heart blocks or heart failure.

Mexiletine metabolism is affected byÂ CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 enzymes. Drugs affecting these enzyme levels can potentially affect mexiletine levels, for example, phenytoin, rifampin, or phenobarbital can decrease mexiletine levels whereas cimetidine can increase the levels. Close monitoring for drug interaction is essential.
