Sacroiliitis is best managed by an interprofessional team that consists of a physical therapist, physician rheumatologist, and dietitian. Patient education is the key to good outcomes. All patients should be informed that the condition is benign and will improve with conservative measures. The patient should be encouraged to participate in a regular exercise program, lose weight and eat healthily. Home exercises can help prevent deconditioning. The patient should also be asked to quit smoking and abstain from alcohol. There is ample evidence indicating that patients who remain physically active have an excellent quality of life.

**Outcomes**

The majority of patients with sacroiliitis have an excellent outcome. However, the recovery may take 2-4weeks. Recurrences are common if patients do not change their lifestyle. Some series report a recurrence rate of over 30%.
