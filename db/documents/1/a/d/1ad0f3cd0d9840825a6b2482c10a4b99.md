If PPROM is suspected, diagnosis involves a speculum examination to visualize amniotic fluid passing from the cervical canal and pooling in the vagina. Fern and pH testing of the pooled vaginal secretions can indicate rupture of membranes. The PH of amniotic fluid is 7.1 to 7.3.

Fetal fibronectin gets released as a result of the breakdown of the cervical extracellular matrix is also an indicator of preterm labor though, it is a specific but not a sensitive test. If the result is negative, it is strongly indicative of an intact membrane, but if positive, it does not necessarilyÂ indicate premature rupture of membranes.

Finally, laboratory evaluation can assist in eliciting the etiology of preterm labor and guide management. These include a rectovaginal group B streptococcal culture. If not performed within the previous 5 weeks, then antibiotic prophylaxis would be required. A urine culture, since asymptomatic bacteriuria has associations with an increased risk of preterm labor and birth. In patients with substance abuse, a urine drug screen would be beneficial as there is a link between cocaine use and placental abruption. Fetal fibronectin testing is necessary for women <34 weeks gestation, cervical dilation of <3 cm and with a cervical length of 20-30mm on transvaginal ultrasound. Testing for sexually transmitted infections as they can contribute to preterm labor etiology.
