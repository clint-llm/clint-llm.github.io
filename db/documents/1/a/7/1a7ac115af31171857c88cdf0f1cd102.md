A detailed medical and family history can help diagnose medullary sponge kidney as it should be suspected when a patient has repeated urinary tract infections or kidney stones.

A patient with medullary sponge kidney does not usually have physical signs, except for occasional hematuria.

Several imaging modalities can diagnose medullary sponge kidney. A plain film KUB may show calcifications, but this is the least sensitive and least specific imaging test.

Renal ultrasound will show characteristic echogenic medullary pyramids, but ultrasound is a very technologist dependent modality which can easily miss the diagnosis if performed by inexperienced personnel.

At intravenous urography (IVU), a classic paintbrush-like appearance within the dilated medullary collecting ducts is characteristic, but this test is no longer used in most clinical practices.

Multidetector contrast CT urography will show a distinctive papillary blush. On delayed imaging from a CT urogram, the characteristic finding of medullary sponge kidney is parallel striations from contrast which extend from the papilla to the medulla and persist on delayed imaging.

CT can also detect related complications such as hydronephrosis, calculi, and pyelonephritis.
