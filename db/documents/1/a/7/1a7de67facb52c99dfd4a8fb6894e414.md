The term coloboma derives from the Greek word “koloboma,” which means a hole or a tissue defect. An eyelid coloboma is a congenital full-thickness defect of the eyelid margin and may also involve different structures of the eye: eyelids, iris, lens, ciliary body, choroid, retina, or optic nerve.

Congenital eyelid coloboma can be unilateral or bilateral, involving one or all four lids. The defect may vary from a small marginal notch to a full-thickness absence of the entire eyelid margin involving one-third to half of the eyelid. Usually, the upper eyelid is commonly affected, and the most common site is the junction between the medial and middle third of the upper eyelid. Eyelid colobomas represent an incomplete form of cryptophthalmos. Cryptophthalmos is a congenital condition in which there is a failure of differentiation of eyelid structures.
