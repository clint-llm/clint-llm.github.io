Orthotopic liver transplantation remains the only definitive therapy for patients with irreversible liver injury, with a 5-year survival of more than 70%. The majority of deaths are secondary to neurological complications or sepsis and occur in the first 3 months after transplantation. In Asia, living-related liver transplant (LDLT) is common, with reduced waiting time, and offering better outcomes compared to transplant from a deceased donor. Data from Asia have shown right lobe LDLT improves survival in ALF patients. More frequently, in acute cases, ABO-incompatible grafts are being used. However, in these patients, the graft survival is low (30 to 60% 1-year survival). Auxiliary liver transplant retains the recipient's liver and uses a partial lobe of the donor's liver as temporary liver support. Auxiliary liver transplant has a survival of 60 to 65%.
