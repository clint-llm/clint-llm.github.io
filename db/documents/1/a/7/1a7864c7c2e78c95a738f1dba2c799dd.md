The patient should be in a fasting state, usually 4Â to 6 hours, before imaging. During the exam, the patient should ideally be placed in the supine position. If the sonographer cannot obtain adequate images, the patient can be repositioned in the right or left lateral decubitus position. The exam should be performed in a darkened room.
