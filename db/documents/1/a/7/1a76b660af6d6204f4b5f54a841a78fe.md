A high degree of suspicion based on historical features and the presence of a clinical toxidrome is important to detect carbamate toxicity. Patients with CNS toxicity can present with altered mental status and may be unable to provide a detailed history on presentation. Initially, treatment for carbamate and OP toxicity is going to be the same, as the manifestations of acute poisoning are similar. If additional historians are available, identification of what compounds were either intentionally ingested or were involved in the unintentional exposures by checking a Material Safety and Data Sheet may help identify to which class of insecticide the patient was exposed. This will help guide decisions for pralidoxime therapy, as discussed in later sections.

Evidence of hypersalivation, lacrimation, GI distress, bronchorrhea, and diaphoresis on examination support the diagnosis. Patients may be bradycardic or tachycardic**,**and their pupil exam may show miosis or mydriasis due to the mixed stimulation of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems. OP and carbamate toxicity should be considered for the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with pinpoint pupils, excessive sweating, and difficulty breathing. Chronic neuropathy may develop.
