Neonatal ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) and hydronephrosis gradually resolve without any surgical intervention in most of the patients. There has been shown a strong correlation between the grade of hydronephrosis and the chance of spontaneous resolution. The Society for Fetal Urology suggested a grading system for hydronephrosis into four grades, grade I resolves in approximately 50% of patients, and grades II, III, IV hydronephrosis resolve in 36%, 16%, and 3% of cases, respectively.
