An experienced ultrasonographer should evaluate gestational age in a pregnant patient. Experience can include specific bedside hands-on training with an ultrasound-credentialed instructor, continuous medical education courses or seminars, or other ultrasound education. The healthcare provider performing the bedside ultrasound evaluation should have specific training for estimating gestational age and feel comfortable making a gestational age estimate based on their previous experience and own-assessment of their capabilities and skill level. For a more accurate assessment of gestational age, a pregnant patient should undergo an evaluation by a certified ultrasound technician.
