An accurate diagnosis of XLA is important, not just for the sake of treatment but also to ensure proper genetic counseling for the individual and the family.

The diagnosis of XLA comprises clinical suspicion by history, especially family history, and physical examination followed by laboratory and genetic tests.

These results point towards a probable diagnosis of XLA; however, to confirm the diagnosis, genetic testing to look for a mutation in BTK gene can be performed. A confirmed family history of XLA can serve as a surrogate for genetic testing.
