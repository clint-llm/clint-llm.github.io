Despite having been first described in 1941 by Kohlmeier, the etiopathogenesis of atrophic papulosis remains elusive. There are theories of a genetic predisposition due to reports of atrophic papulosis among family members, including multiple generations. First-degree family members are more often affected, suggesting an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.

Aside from a genetic predisposition, there are three main hypotheses suggested as the etiology of the disease: vasculitis, coagulopathy, and a primary dysfunction of the endothelial cells. These previously mentioned postulations are likely not mutually exclusive and occur in the setting of environmental factors creating the appropriate condition.
