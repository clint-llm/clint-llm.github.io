A thorough history and physical examination are necessary to identify the injury mechanism and other potential injuries. Patients who sustain high-energy dashboard injuries may also present with fractures to the ipsilateral acetabulum and lower extremity. Initial inspection of the injured knee is aimed at assessing soft tissue trauma. A saline load test using 155 to 175 mL of sterile saline may be warranted if there is suspicion for open injury to the knee joint.

Periprosthetic fractures of the patella may not present the same as native patella fractures. Trauma is a significant cause of periprosthetic patellar fractures; however, some patients may not recall a single episode that is responsible for a fracture. At the time of diagnosis, forty-four percent of patients with atraumatic periprosthetic patellar fractures complained of minimal or no symptoms.
