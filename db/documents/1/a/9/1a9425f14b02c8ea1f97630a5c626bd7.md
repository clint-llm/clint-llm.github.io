Surgical considerations are limited due to the sustainability of quality of life if the trapezius is injured. If dissection of the accessory nerve occurs, attempts at repair have been attempted, but success rates are low. This procedure is often forgone because of these poor outcomes. One of the most common surgical interventions involving the trapezius region includes a trapezius flap for patients with congenital or acquired lateral craniofacial or lateral basilar skull defects. Flaps of the trapezius also are used for oral or pharyngeal defects.

Injury to the spinal accessory nerve can occur when exploring the posterior triangle of the neck during lymphadenectomy for cancer staging. Lymph nodes in this anatomical location are part of the deep cervical lymphatic lymph node chain. Sampling these nodes is important in staging many cancers of the head. For example, a cancer of the tongue may require sampling of these nodes to determine the presence or absence of nodal metastases.
