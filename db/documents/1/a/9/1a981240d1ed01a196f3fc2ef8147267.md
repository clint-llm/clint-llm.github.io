Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (AFND), also known as Sweet syndrome or Gomm Button disease, consists of erythematous plaques and papules along with constitutional symptoms such as fever and malaise. The average age of onset is 30 to 60 years and there is a female predominance. The disease is characterized histologically by a dense neutrophilic infiltrate. It is associated with several underlying diseases, including infections, malignancies, inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune disorders, pregnancy, and drugs. Clinically the cutaneous lesions present as tender, edematous, erythematous plaques and papules, which may occasionally be bullous. The most effective treatment is prednisone. Other potential treatments include dapsone, colchicine, and potassium iodide.
