Glycol ethers (GE) can be absorbed by ingestion via the gastrointestinal tract, inhalation, and transdermally.

Similarly, GEs are also excreted in the same fashion. This is in comparison to methanol which is hepatically eliminated.

Note that the half-life of the GE and its respective organic acid may vary. For example, the half-life of ethylene glycol monobutyl ether (EGBE) is about 1 hour, but the half-life for the resulting organic acid, butoxyacetic acid, is about 4 hours.
