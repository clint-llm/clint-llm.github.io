In order to effectively manage an epiphrenic diverticulum, patients must be aware of the signs and symptoms associated with the disease process. Not only patients must know them, but they also should understand red flags that may allude to more worrisome pathology such as perforation or malignancy. Asymptomatic patients should relay the presence of the diverticulum to health care workers and be on the lookout for possible symptoms. Blind esophageal intubation should be avoided to help prevent an iatrogenic injury such as perforation of the diverticulum.
