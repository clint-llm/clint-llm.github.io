An emergency room thoracotomy is performed in selected cases of direct thoracic injury concurrently with ACLS/ATLS resuscitation. Survival rates are low; however, this is because it is a life-saving measure aimed at temporizing a critical patient until a definitive repair can be achieved in the operating room. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients who undergo emergency room thoracotomy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving the care of such patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the indications for emergency room thoracotomy.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to emergency room thoracotomy.
- Summarize the expected outcomes of emergency room thoracotomy.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies among emergency room providers, personnel, and surgical teams, to improve care coordination and communication to advance emergency room thoracotomy and improve outcomes.
