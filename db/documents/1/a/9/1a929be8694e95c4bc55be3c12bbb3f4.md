**Superficial Infection**

Patients with white piedra are usually asymptomatic and only seek medical attention because of the grossly visible nodules on the affected hair. Occasionally, the patient complains of pruritus or pain at the involved site. The nodules are usually soft, pasty, and ivory-colored. They are about 0.5 millimeters in size but can coalesce to blanket several millimeters of the hair shaft. Genital and facial hair is more often involved than the scalp and torso hair.

**Invasive Infection**

Typically, the patient has an acute febrile illness, not responding to empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics or even to empirical antifungal agents that becomes septic and progresses rapidly to multiorgan failure. In the vast majority of cases, fungemia is present (more than 70%). The crude mortality rate can vary from 30% to as high as 77% in published cases.

The cutaneous manifestations of disseminated trichosporonosis include erythematous papules on the trunk and extremities that can sometimes form bullae. In cases of central nervous system infection, the predominant symptoms are headache, nausea, vomiting, and fever. A patient with dyspnea could suggest that pulmonary involvement is present and can include a productive cough and even bloody sputum. Diffuse infiltrates are seen in the chest x-ray with an alveolar pattern. Other findings, such as reticulonodular infiltrates, lobar infiltrates, and cavitation, also can be detected. Patients that have disseminated trichosporonosis with the involvement of the kidneys may have proteinuria, microscopic hematuria, and renal failure.

Trichosporonosis has also been documented to cause peritonitis, pacemaker lead endocarditis, and pneumonia. Other rare manifestations include sinusitis in an immunocompetent patient, fungemia, and urinary tract infection in patients with diabetes mellitus, and nosocomial infection in patients with severe burns.
