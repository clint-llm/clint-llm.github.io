Clinicians should be aware of this complication and discuss the possibility during pre-surgery counseling. Patients should meet with a clinical nutritionist before the procedure and determine whether the dietary changes required pre and post-procedure are feasible.

If a patient develops this complication, an interprofessional team comprising primary care providers, surgeons, endocrinologists, nutritionists, and pharmacists may help develop strategies to manage this condition.

In patients who have failed conservative measures, surgical therapies may be considered.
