The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) is a significant structure in the ulnar side of the wrist. Serving as the primary stabilizer of the distal radius ulnar joint (DRUJ), it also acts as a load-bearing structure. It divides into two parts, a relatively avascular central cartilaginous portion, and a peripheral highly vascular ligamentous part. It arises from the radius and inserts on the distal ulna and ulnar carpus. It can often be a cause of ulnar sided wrist pain, with injury classified as traumatic or degenerative.
