The only absolute contraindication to glucagon administration is known hypersensitivity to the medication.Â Most hypersensitivity reactions occur in GI imaging patients.

Relative contraindications include use in neonates or children, which may not have sufficient glycogen stores, patients with known insulinoma, pheochromocytoma, or glucagon secreting tumor, and known lactose allergy (some formulations contain lactose).
