Shrinking lung syndrome (SLS) is a rare complication of systemic autoimmune disease. It occurs most commonly in systemic lupus erythematosus but there are rare reports of it developing in systemic sclerosis, Sjogren's syndrome, and rheumatoid arthritis.

Reduced lung volumes and a restrictive deficit on lung function testing are typical. It is a diagnosis of exclusion and therefore other investigations such as computed tomography of the chest are undertaken to exclude competing diagnoses.
