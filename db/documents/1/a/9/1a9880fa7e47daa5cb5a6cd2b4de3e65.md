A urinalysis and urine culture should be done. Urinalysis will typically show an alkaline pH (>7.2) and crystals with a ''coffin-lid'' morphology. Urine culture usually reveals the growth of urease-forming organisms. Non-contrast Computed Tomography (CT) scan is the gold standard for the diagnosis of any renal stone and is particularly useful for staghorn stones. A contrast-enhanced CT can be added to better evaluate the internal renal anatomy, such as the calyces and infundibulae. When a CT scan is not available, ultrasonography with a plain radiograph of the abdomen and pelvis can be used. Struvite stones are usually radio-opaque due to their calcium content. A typical struvite stone will demonstrate a density reading on CT of 900 Hounsfield units or less.

A large struvite stone may be seen as a staghorn or branched calculus filling the collecting system in the plain radiograph. Intravenous pyelography is less commonly used for diagnosis, while magnetic resonance imaging does provide much assistance in visualizing staghorn stones and is usually not recommended. Spontaneous passage of a struvite stone is rare, but occasionally, a small piece may break off and be passed or found in the bladder. Analysis of any passed or removed stone material is routinely performed as a part of good medical management.
