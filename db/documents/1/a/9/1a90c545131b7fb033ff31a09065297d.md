When it comes to preoperative cardiac risk assessment, the essential anatomical considerations present on the patientâ€™s physical exam. A thorough exam, along with non-invasive testing can provide information on three cardiac risk markers: LV dysfunction, myocardial ischemia, and heart valve abnormalities, all of which, are significant determinants of adverse postoperative outcome.

Objective examination includes the evaluation of vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature and oxygen saturation, as well as height, weight, and body mass index (BMI).

The physical examination focuses on the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems and includes auscultation of the heart and lungs, inspection of arterial pulses and veins, abdominal palpation and examination of the extremities for edema and vascular integrity.

Critical physical findings include third or fourth heart sounds, rales, jugular venous distention, ascites, hepatomegaly, and dependent edema, which could be evidence of heart failure or a murmur suspicious for hemodynamically significant valvular heart disease.
