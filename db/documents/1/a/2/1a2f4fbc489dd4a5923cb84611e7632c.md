Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is one of the less known drug-resistant bacteria that can cause challenging infections. This activity reviews the epidemiology of this organism as well as the risk factors of developing these infections. It also illustrates the pathophysiology and virulence factors of this pathogen and its relation with the clinical picture. It describes the modern evaluation and up-to-date treatment for the infections caused by this organism, as well as their estimated prognosis. Further, it highlights the role of the interprofessional team in case management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the risk factors for developing Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infections.
- Describe the epidemiology and statistical data of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infections.
- Outline the evaluation of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infection cases and the challenges encountered.
- Summarize the recommended treatment by interprofessional team and prevention modalities for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infections.
