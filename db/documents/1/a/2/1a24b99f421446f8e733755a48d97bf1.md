Primary immunodeficiencies (PID) are a heterogeneous group of diseases, mostly inherited, caused by more than 400 intrinsic disorders of the immune system. Seven different immune deficiency states, which are transmitted with the X chromosome, have been described. Those are X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (X-CGD), X-linked immunodeficiency with Hyper-IgM, X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID), X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), and IPEX. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of X-linked immunodeficiency and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of X linked immunodeficiencies.
- Outline the evaluation of X linked immunodeficiencies.
- Review the management of X linked immunodeficiencies.
