**CD**

The disease is a chronic life-long issue, but today, there are more diagnostic possibilities and treatment options available, and living with the disease is much easier than a few decades ago. The majority of cases do respond favorably to gluten-free diets.

**DH**

DH is frequently a chronic, life-long issue and requires continuous a gluten-free diet and dapsone. Infrequently, patients can discontinue these permanently. DH is not associated with increased mortality like CD, again presumably since the site of injury is skin and not the gut. Some studies have mentioned reduced mortality in DH.
