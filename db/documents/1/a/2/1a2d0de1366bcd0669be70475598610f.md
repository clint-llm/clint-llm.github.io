Left bundle branch block (LBBB) is a common electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormality seen in patients whose normal cardiac conduction down both anterior and posterior left fascicles of the His-Purkinje system is compromised. Although LBBB is often associated with significant heart disease and is often the result of myocardial injury, strain or hypertrophy, it can also be seen in patients without any particular clinical disease. This activity reviews the cause and presentation of LBBB and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with LBBB.
- Outline the treatment for LBBB.
- Review the prognosis of patients with LBBB.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by LBBB.
