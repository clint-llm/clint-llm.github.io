Pheochromocytoma can induce Takotsubo syndrome.

Pheochromocytoma crisis (severe acute presentation of a catecholamine-induced hemodynamic instability causing end-organ damage). There are two types:

- Type A: End organ damage but in the absence of shock

- Type B: End organ damage with shock

Pheochromocytoma crisis though rare, can be a potentially life-threatening emergency. Crisis can occur spontaneously or precipitated by the administration of pharmacological agents, such as glucagon, ergotamine, and caffeine, tumor manipulation, micturition (urinary bladder pheochromocytoma), or foods that aggravate the release of catecholamines by the tumor.
