M. furfur is unable to synthesize fatty acids independently and, therefore, depends on the oils produced in areas of the skin rich in sebaceous glands, especially the trunk, face, and scalp. Although it is a commensal microorganism that is a typical component present on the stratum corneum of human skin, infection results when the dimorphic yeast changes to its mycelial form.
