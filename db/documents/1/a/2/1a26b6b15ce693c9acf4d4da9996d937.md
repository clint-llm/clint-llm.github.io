Most of the patients with transfusion iron overload typically suffer from the underlying symptoms of anemia (e,g., fatigue, breathlessness, pale skin). The physical presentation of transfusion iron overload varies according to the extent and duration of iron overload. Patients with transfusion iron overload usually present with liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis, hepatic failure), cardiac disease (e.g., dilated cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure), endocrinopathy (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypogonadism, hypothyroidism, hypopituitarism), skin pigmentation, and arthropathy.
