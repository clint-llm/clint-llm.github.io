Serotonin toxicity is a clinical diagnosis initially defined by the Sternbach criteria. Generally, these symptoms include neuromuscular excitation, autonomic stimulation and altered level of consciousness. The presence of generalized clonus indicates serotonin toxicity.

Due to the nonspecific nature of the Sternbach criteria, the Hunt serotonin toxicity criteria were developed. The Hunt serotonin toxicity criteria decision rule describes 5 constellations of symptoms that define serotonin toxicity

- Spontaneous clonus

- Inducible clonus and agitation or diaphoresis

- Ocular clonus with agitation or diaphoresis

- Tremor and hyperreflexia

- Ocular clonus, hypertonicity, and temperature greater than 38 C

Besides signs and symptoms, a history suggestive of serotonin exposure or overdose is required to diagnose serotonin toxicity.

Minor symptoms of serotonin toxicity include vomiting, somnolence, mydriasis, or diaphoresis. Someone can see severe symptoms (decreased level of consciousness, ECG changes, and seizures with overdoses greater than 75 times the recommended daily dose.
