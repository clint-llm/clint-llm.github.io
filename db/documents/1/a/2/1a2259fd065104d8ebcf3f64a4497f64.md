Endotracheal intubation is an essential skill for emergency medicine and critical care providers. Understanding the risks and complications of endotracheal intubation is as important as identifying appropriate candidates as early as possible. When preparing for endotracheal intubation, providers should optimize positioning, pre-oxygenation, equipment, and team preparation. They should also be ready to perform other methods of intubation if the initial attempt is unsuccessful. If starting with direct laryngoscopy, providers should have backup strategies such as video laryngoscopy, bougie, laryngeal mask airway (LMA), and cricothyrotomy tools immediately available. Preparation and practice are key to leading the team to successful intubation in the emergency setting.
