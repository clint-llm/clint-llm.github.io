Intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) therapy (also known as lipid resuscitation therapy, LRT) is the current recommended treatment for local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) by professional societies such as the American Society of Regional Anesthesia (ASRA).

ILE therapy also extrapolates to other lipophilic agents. It has been emerging in emergency rooms and critical care units as potential rescue therapy for many other acute toxicities and poisonings. Researchers have investigated drug classes, including tricyclic antidepressants, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, antipsychotics, insecticides, and organophosphates.Â Specific drugs also studied include bupropion, lamotrigine, cocaine, and diphenhydramine.
