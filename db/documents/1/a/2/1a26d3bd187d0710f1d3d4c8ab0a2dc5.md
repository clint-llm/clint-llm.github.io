Mucocutaneous eruptions are rashes that have both mucous membrane and cutaneous distribution. Differences between the history and physical exam patterns of these rashes and associated inciting etiologies have led to the development of separate names for these mucocutaneous eruptions, such as erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). Recently, a separate pattern of the mucocutaneous rash pattern in association with Mycoplasma pneumoniae respiratory infections has prompted the proposal for an additional mucocutaneous eruption entity, mycoplasma-induced rash and mucositis (MIRM). This activity reviews the cause and pathophysiology of mycoplasma mucositis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the presentation of mycoplasma mucositis.
- Summarize the treatment of mycoplasma mucositis.
- Describe the differential diagnosis of mycoplasma mucositis.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by mycoplasma mucositis.
