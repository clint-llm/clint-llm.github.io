Hypogonadism occurs in 19% of men in their 60s, 28% of men in their 70s, and 49% of men in their 80s.

- Testosterone is FDA-approved as replacement therapy in men who have low testosterone levels and those with symptoms of hypogonadism.

- Testosterone is also FDA-approved for use in congenital or acquired hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (when there is a pituitary-hypothalamic injury, LHRH deficiency, or gonadotropin deficiency) resulting from tumors, trauma, or radiation.

It is essential to distinguish between primary (testicular) and secondary (pituitary-hypothalamic) hypogonadism. Symptoms highly suggestive of hypogonadism include decreased spontaneous erections, decreased nocturnal penile tumescence, decreased libido, decreased beard growth, and shrinking testicles. In males, the normal range for early morning testosterone is between 300 ng/dL to 1000 ng/dL.

Hypogonadism is diagnosed when the morning serum testosterone level is less than 300 ng/dL. However, clinical judgment is required when diagnosing hypogonadism in a patient with testosterone levels in the normal range but persistent testosterone deficiency symptoms.

Initial laboratory testing should include two early mornings (8 AM to 10 AM) serum testosterone measurements. In addition, certain studies should be ordered to rule out secondary hypogonadism if both measurements are low. Further testing includes FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone), LH (luteinizing hormone), prolactin, TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), complete blood count (CBC), and comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP). In cases of low normal testosterone with clinical symptoms, further testing to assess free or bioavailable testosterone is necessary. These tests include sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin to calculate the bioavailable testosterone, which can be affected by obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypothyroidism, and liver disease. Furthermore, semen analysis, pituitary MRI, testicular ultrasound and biopsy, and genetic studies are options if there is clinical suspicion of a secondary cause. Testosterone therapy is not FDA-approved to treat low libido in women.
