Infantile cortical hyperostosis (ICH), also known as Caffey disease, was first reported by Roske in 1930 and described by Caffey and Silverman in 1945. ICH is a disorder affecting the skeletal system of infants. ICH most commonly affects the mandible (70% to 90% of cases) and has the appearance of periosteal reaction. The most frequent locations impacted are the ascending ramus and angle of the mandible. This activity reviews the workup of Infantile cortical hyperostosis and describes health professionals' role in managing this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the presentation of Infantile cortical hyperostosis.
- Describe the evaluation of Infantile cortical hyperostosis.
- Summarize the treatment of Infantile cortical hyperostosis.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in managing infantile cortical hyperostosis to improve patients' outcomes.
