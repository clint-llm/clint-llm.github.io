Anaerobic bacteria are part of the normal flora of human skin and mucosal membranes. The site of anaerobic infection is commonly the site of normal colonization. The spectrum of infections ranges from local abscesses to life-threatening infections. Anaerobic bacteria differ from aerobic bacteria in their oxygen requirement. Oxygen is toxic to anaerobes, which can be explained by the absence of enzymes in the anaerobes of catalase, superoxide dismutase, and peroxidase enzymes. The diagnosis requires clinical suspicion and proper microbiological identification. This activity examines when this condition should be considered on differential diagnosis and how to evaluate for it properly. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of anaerobic infections.
- Review the various clinical manifestations of anaerobic infections,
- Describe the management options available for anaerobic infections.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to achieve better clinical outcomes in patients having anaerobic infections.
