The annual incidence of spinal cord injury is approximately 40 cases per million population. Adolescent boys are at highest risk for injuries. The non-accidental injury is an underreported mechanism; therefore, the true incidence of spinal injuries is underestimated. Amongst the various levels of injuries, cervical spine injuries are rare in children and occur in less than 1% of these patients due to underlying anatomical differences compared to adults.
