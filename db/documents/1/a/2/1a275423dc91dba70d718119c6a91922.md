Due to the nature of interstitial cystitis, it is very difficult to formulate a clear diagnosis easily, and there exists no screening tool for it. Hence, the data surrounding its prevalence remains limited. However, some studies have looked into the epidemiology of interstitial cystitis. There are two main study designs, one based on physician/urologist-based diagnosis and the other by a questionnaire around symptomatology. Based on a large population, questionnaire-based prevalence study in the US, 2.7% of women meet the specified criteria, with 1.9% of men meeting the criteria.

However, a lower prevalence is seen when physician-completed questionnaires and histological samples were employed to establish a diagnosis. A study in the Netherlands quoted as low as between 8-16 out of 100,000 individuals.

Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) is a chronic bladder disorder with an estimated US prevalence of 3–8 million women and 1–4 million men.

It is estimated that it affects up to 400,000 patients in the UK, with almost 90% of the patients being women between 50 and 69 years of age.

The data for children affected by interstitial cystitis is poor, but the consensus opinion is that the prevalence is very low in the pediatric population.
