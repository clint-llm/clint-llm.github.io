RNAP is a multisubunit enzyme that contains both protein-protein as well as protein-DNA interactions. The specificity factors of bacterial RNAP, sigma, contain four distinct regions: region 1, region 2, region 3, and region 4. Except for sigma factors belonging to the sigma54 family, all sigma factors contain a highly conserved region 2 and region 4 while some also additionally contain a conserved region 3.

Along with sigma-DNA interactions, sigma also makes various extensive protein contacts with core RNAP. Important interactions include residues within Regions 2.1 and 2.2 with the beta prime subunit as well as residues with region 3.2 threading through a channel comprised of beta and beta prime.

The overall structure of RNAP resembles that of a crab claw. The beta and beta prime subunits form two opposing pincer-like structures, bordering the main channel.
