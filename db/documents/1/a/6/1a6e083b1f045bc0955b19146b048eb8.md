Rapid detection methods include the detection of yellow fever antigen using monoclonal enzyme immunoassay in serum specimens and detection of viral genome sequences using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Yellow fever can be diagnosed using ELISA and serology titers of antibodies. Other investigations depend on what organ is involved. If there is evidence of altered mentation, a lumbar puncture and a CT scan are performed. Blood work may reveal leukopenia with elevated transaminase levels. Neutropenia is common during the first week of the infection.

If the liver is involved, the coagulation profile may be abnormal. Elevation in creatinine, hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis are strongly associated with a very poor prognosis.

Most yellow fever specific testing canÂ be done at the CDC, but reports will be sent to the state health department. When sending blood samples directly to the CDC, the health department should be informed.

A chest x-ray is done in patients with respiratory distress because of the pulmonary edema. ECG may identify prolonged QT and PR intervals. Arrhythmias are common when the myocardium is affected.
