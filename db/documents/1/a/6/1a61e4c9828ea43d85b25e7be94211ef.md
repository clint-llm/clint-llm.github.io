Regarding prognosis, patients are divided into 2 groups: steroid responders and non-steroid responders.

Steroid responder patients have a good prognosis, and non-steroid responders have a poor prognosis.

Due to genetic mutation, patients with Loeffler syndrome also have a good prognosis after treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

Due to its rarity, clear-cut mortality has not been defined.
