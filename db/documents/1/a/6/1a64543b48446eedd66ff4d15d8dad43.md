Tethered cord syndrome is a well-recognized cause of deterioration in the myelomeningocele population, with an estimated one-third of patients requiring spinal cord untethering in childhood.

Tethered cord syndrome can have multiple systemic manifestations, including neurologic, urologic, dermatologic, and orthopedic. Long-term outcomes following tethered spinal cord release are favorable, with improvements in pain, weakness, gait, spasticity, and bladder function observed.

Surgical complications are uncommon but can occur, with neurologic or urologic worsening occurring in around 3 to 5% of patients.
