The papillary muscles are integral to proper valvular coordination and alignment. Papillary muscle dysfunction can occur due to congenital abnormalities resulting in left ventricular outflow tract obstruction as well as from injury to the papillary muscles from ischemia or ventricular remodeling. Given the integral role of the papillary muscles in valvular coaptation, clinically significant valvular abnormalities correlate with these derangements.

Congenital abnormalities of the papillary muscles include pathological insertion of the papillary muscles and abnormal chordae tendinae attachment. Direct papillary muscle leaflet insertion has been described in case reports and is associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.

Left ventricular remodeling due to cardiomyopathy or cardiac ischemia can lead to secondary (functional) mitral regurgitation. In contrast to primary mitral regurgitation, in which intrinsic defects of the mitral valve apparatus lead to insufficiency, secondary mitral regurgitation results from disease of the atrium or ventricle without the mitral valvular disease.
