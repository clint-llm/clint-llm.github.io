Clinical manifestations that suggest the likelihood of renovascular disease as a cause of hypertension include:

- Severe hypertension that may be treatment resistant, refractory to therapy with three or more drugs. A few patients with ischemic nephropathy may be normotensive, which may be due in part to a reduced cardiac output

- Young-onset hypertension with a negative family history

- Abrupt onset before age 50, likely fibromuscular dysplasia as the underlying cause while abrupt onset after age 50,  more likely atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis as the cause

- An acute and sustained rise in serum creatinine of more than 30% following the administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)

- Significant variability of serum creatinine concentration that may be due to changes in volume status

- Recurrent episodes of flash pulmonary edema and/or refractory heart failure

- Renal asymmetry, unilateral small kidney

- Unexplained hypokalemia

- Deterioration of renal function after placement of an endovascular aortic stent graft

- Patients with ischemic nephropathy may also manifest a persistent and progressive reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR)

- Unexplained rise in BUN

- Lack of evidence supporting an alternative cause of renal disease, for instance, an abnormal urinalysis, proteinuria, a paraprotein, or use of a nephrotoxic drug.

Other findings include abdominal bruit and flank bruit. Patients with renovascular disease frequently have severe retinopathy, peripheral or coronary vascular disease.
