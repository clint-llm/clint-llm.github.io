Possible reported adverse effects of Thallium-201, when used for scintigraphy, include severe allergic reactions and gastrointestinal disturbances.

Tc-based radiopharmaceuticals have largely replaced thallium-201 in myocardial perfusion imaging studies because of its longer half-life of 73 hrs (compared to Tc of 6 hrs) and its low-energy emission, which consequently needs a greater radiation dose but yields images of inferior quality than Tc scans.
