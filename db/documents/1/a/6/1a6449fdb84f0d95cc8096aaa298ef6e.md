During the third trimester, ultrasound can be performed transvaginally or trans-abdominally, with preference given to the latter approach due to the theoretical risk of precipitating clinically significant hemorrhage if placenta preview is present and undiagnosed.

The uterus is typically found wedged between the more anterior bladder and the more posterior colon. In a cephalad to caudal direction, the fundus, body, and cervix of the uterus can be appreciated in that particular order. During the third trimester, the fetal anatomy and cardiac activity should be well defined and evident.

The amniotic fluid should be seen as an anechoic space surrounded by the isoechoic walls of the uterus. The location of the placenta is variable, and it can be identified as a heterogeneous structure connected to the wall of the uterus and attached to the umbilical cord leading to the abdomen of the fetus.
