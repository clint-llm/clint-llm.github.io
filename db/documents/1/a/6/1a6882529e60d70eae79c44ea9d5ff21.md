Invasive mechanical ventilation can be prevented in patients who demonstrate a good response to non-invasive respiratory support with HFNC or NIPV. In addition, care should be tailored to the patient’s preference and goals of care. A compassionate and informative discussion with the patient and their family members should be considered if the need for endotracheal intubation is anticipated shortly. All benefits and risks should be discussed and assessed.

Endotracheal intubation is contraindicated in patients who have clearly expressed their wishes not to be intubated or resuscitated in case of clinical deterioration (do not intubate/DNI or do not resuscitate/DNR) it may not align with the patient’s goals of care.

For ECMO, there are a few absolute contraindications and some relative ones. The relative contraindications can change according to the hospital policies and could also reflect ongoing surges. Figure 4 depicts the absolute and relative contraindications of ECMO.
