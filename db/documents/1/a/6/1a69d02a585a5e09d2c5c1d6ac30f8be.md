Topical mucolytic agents like acetylcysteine 10-20% one to 4 times a day topically dissolve the mucus and loosen the plaque. The plaques can recur after discontinuation of mucolytic drops. N-acetyl-L-cysteine is an amino-acid L-cysteine derivative and is used to reduce the viscosity of mucus in a variety of disorders. It reduces the action of the free sulphydryl group in the disulfide bonds of the mucoproteins, thereby reducing the viscosity.

Artificial tear substitutes, preferably hypotonic type, are indicated along with topical mucolytics, especially in cases associated with dry eye states. Preservative-free tear substitutes are preferable as preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride are epitheliotoxic and can exacerbate the problem.

Topical cyclosporine A and soft corticosteroids such as fluorometholone and loteprednol etabonate are indicated when there is associated inflammation as in keratoconjunctivitis sicca.

Staphylococcal blepharitis is frequently associated with corneal mucus plaques and should be treated with warm compresses, lid hygiene, and antibiotic ointment.

Highly symptomatic plaques can be removed by debridement (scraping or with a cotton bud). After debridement, a soft bandage contact lens can be applied to the cornea.

Excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) can be useful for the removal of larger plaques, especially those associated with vernal keratoconjunctivitis. PTK uses an excimer laser (193 nm) and works on the principle of photoablation, i.e., it breaks the bonds between molecules. One pulse of laser affects approximately 0.25 microns of the corneal surface so that the underlying normal tissue remains unaffected.
