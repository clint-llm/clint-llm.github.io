This activity reviews the optics (mainly refractivity) of the human eye. The functional principles of refractive correction and emmetropization are also discussed. For conditions that can cause variability or unspecificity of cylindrical (chiefly axis) refinement or in patients that do not tolerate toric corrections, spherical equivalent prescriptions can provide an adequate alternative when dispensing corrective lenses. The indications, contraindications, and methods of determining the spherical equivalent prescription for patients are outlined. The role of the interprofessional team in caring for such patients with underlying systemic etiologies, as well as those with specific special needs.

**Objectives:**
- Define spherical equivalent.
- Describe the optical systems of the human eye.
- Identify when to use the spherical equivalent when refracting a patient.
- Summarize the formula for converting a full spherical prescription to the spherical equivalent.
