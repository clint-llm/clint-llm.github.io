Healthcare simulation takes many forms. Simulation training may occur in a designated center during protected education time, in actual patient care areas (in-situ), use technology-enhanced programs such as computer-based or virtual reality, involve standardized patients, or use procedural task-trainers. Any of these modalities may serve as a tool for quality improvement.

Simulation provides a unique “safe sandbox” opportunity to highlight communication issues. Many of the events leading to patient harm are related to communication failures.
