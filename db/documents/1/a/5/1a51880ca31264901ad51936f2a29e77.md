Current recommendations are that children should use appropriate size baseball and use chest wall protectors. All sporting arenas should have an automated external defibrillator within access.

All survivors should undergo thorough cardiac monitoring to determine the cause and prevent the event from occurring again.

The decision to return to sports should only be made after a thorough evaluation has been performed. The patient and parent or legal guardian should be asked to sign a consent that they do understand the risk of a recurrent episode.
