Originally, the Ann Arbor staging system was introduced for Hodgkin's lymphoma in 1974 and later modified in 1988. The current staging system Lugano classification is based on the Ann Arbor classification.

- Stage I - NHL involving one lymph node region or extra lymphatic site

- Stage IE - Involvement of single extra lymphatic site involvement. "E" stands for limited extranodal involvement.

- Stage II - Involving two or more lymph nodes on the same side of the diaphragm

- Stage III - Involving lymph nodes on both the sides of the diaphragm

- Stage IV - Spreads into one or more extra-lymphatic organs (bone marrow, liver, lung) with or without the involvement of the lymph node.
