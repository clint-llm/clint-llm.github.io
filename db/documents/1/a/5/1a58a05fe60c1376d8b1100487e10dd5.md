Endogenous calcitonin is produced in the parafollicular C cells of the thyroid gland, while exogenously administered calcitonin extract derives from the ultimobranchial gland of salmon. Salmon calcitonin is a 32 amino acid, alpha-helical polypeptide that differs significantly from human calcitonin along amino acids 10Â to 27. These differences in amino acid sequence explain the increased potency of salmon-derived calcitonin.
