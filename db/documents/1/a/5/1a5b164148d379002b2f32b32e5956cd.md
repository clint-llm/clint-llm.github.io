Multiple treatments have been attempted for granular parakeratosis; however, responses to these treatments have been inconsistent amongst reported cases. Given previous thoughts that granular parakeratosis may be an abnormal reaction to personal hygiene products or other topical preparations, discontinuing these topicals as well as prescribing a topical steroid is typically the first attempted management strategy. Topical steroids may decrease pruritus in symptomatic patients; however, reported cases have rarely resolved with topical steroids as monotherapy.
