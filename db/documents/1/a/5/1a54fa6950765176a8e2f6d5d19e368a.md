Several studies postulate that the development of schizophrenia results from abnormalities in multiple neurotransmitters, such as dopaminergic, serotonergic, and alpha-adrenergic hyperactivity or glutaminergic and GABA hypoactivity. Genetics also plays a fundamental role - there is a 46% concordance rate in monozygotic twins and a 40% risk of developing schizophrenia if both parents are affected. The gene neuregulin (NGR1), which is involved in glutamate signaling and brain development, has been implicated, alongside dysbindin (DTNBP1), which helps glutamate release, and catecholamine O-methyl transferase (COMT) polymorphism, which regulates dopamine function.

As aforementioned, there are also several environmental factors associated with an enhanced risk of developing the disease:

- Abnormal fetal development and low birth weight

- Gestational diabetes

- Preeclampsia

- Emergency cesarean section and other birthing complications

- Maternal malnutrition and vitamin D deficiency

- Winter births - associated with a 10% higher relative risk

- Urban residence - increases the risk of developing schizophrenia by 2 to 4%

The incidence is also up to ten times greater in children of African and Caribbean migrants compared to whites, according to a study conducted in Britain.
