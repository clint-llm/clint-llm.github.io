Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome that results from either functional or structural impairment of ventricles resulting in symptomatic left ventricle (LV) dysfunction. The symptoms come from an inadequate cardiac output, failing to keep up with the metabolic demands of the body. It is a leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide despite the advances in therapies and prevention. It can result from disorders of the pericardium, myocardium, endocardium, heart valves, great vessels, or some metabolic abnormalities.

**Definition**

Three main phenotypes describe HF according to the measurement of the left ventricle ejection fraction (EF), and the differentiation between these types is important due to different demographics, comorbidities, and responses to therapies:

- Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF): EF less than or equal to 40%

- Heart failure with preserved EF (HFpEF): EF is greater than or equal to 50%

- Heart failure with mid-range EF (HFmrEF) (other names are: HFpEF-borderline and HFpEF-improved when EF in HFrEF improves to greater than 40%): EF is 41% to 49% per European guidelines and 40 to 49% per the US guidelines.

All patients with HFrEF have concomitant diastolic dysfunction; in contrast, diastolic dysfunction may occur in the absence of systolic dysfunction.
