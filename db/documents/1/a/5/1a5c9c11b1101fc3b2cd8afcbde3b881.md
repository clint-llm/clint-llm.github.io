Untreated precocious puberty usually leads to short stature and can also cause significant emotional and behavioral issues. Few studies have shown that children experiencing precocious puberty are at high risk of engaging in high-risk behaviors such as substance abuse, conduct issues, social isolation, truancy, and multiple sexual partners. They also have a lot of peer pressure and self-image concerns. However, most of these problems resolved by early adulthood.
