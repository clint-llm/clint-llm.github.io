A corneal abrasion (also called scratched eye or scratched cornea) is an eye injury that causes significant discomfort, photophobia, and erythema. This occurs when there is a disruption of the corneal epithelium caused by contact lens or foreign bodies trauma, or spontaneously. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of corneal abrasions and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of corneal abrasions.
- Identify the use of fluorescein staining in the clinical evaluation of patients with corneal abrasions.
- Summarize the use of topical antibiotics and cycloplegics in the treatment of corneal abrasions.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members to provide urgent follow-up and care to improve outcomes for patients affected by corneal abrasions.
