Methyldopa is generically available as a single ingredient in 125, 250, or 500 mg tablets.

IV infusion in the form of methyldopa hydrochloride is available. The drug gets diluted in 5% dextrose, and the required dose is added to 100 mL of 5% dextrose in water injection and administered slowly over 30Â to 60 minutes. IM or subcutaneous administration is not a recommendation due to unpredictable absorption.

Despite its popularity during the 70s, other alternatives have replaced methyldopa as a mainstay for the treatment of hypertension. Methyldopa remains a second-line treatment to be used safely during pregnancy.
