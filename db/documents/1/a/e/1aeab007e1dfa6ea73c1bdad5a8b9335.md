Menstrual-related headaches have a broad differential diagnosis, including other primary headaches such as tension and cluster headaches. Treatment of MRH and other primary headaches overlap so that diagnosis can be distinguished from features of the history and physical exam of the patient. Some can experience cutaneous allodynia, which is the perception of pain produced by a small stimulus, such as brushing hair, touching the scalp, shaving, or wearing contact lenses resulting in sensitization of central pain pathways in migraine. These episodes typically last seconds to minutes, but when they increase in intensity and frequency over time, they indicate trigeminal neuralgia, which responds well to a different therapy.

Secondary headaches from trauma, vascular-related injury, metastasis, or infection can also be considered. Cerebral aneurysms, cerebral venous thrombosis, dissection syndromes, encephalitis, meningitis, intracranial hemorrhage, and temporal arteritis will all have different features that can usually be either ruled out or diagnosed with laboratory testing, additional head imaging, or CSF sampling.Â Since MRH rarely has an association with aura, it is less common to be mistaken for a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Useful features for distinguishing MRH include the duration, timing, quality, comparison to previous headaches, neurological exam, and other associated symptoms during and after the attacks.
