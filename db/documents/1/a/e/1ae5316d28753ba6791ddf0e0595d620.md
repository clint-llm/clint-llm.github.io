The fusion oncoprotein BCR-ABL1 defines CML. 90% to 95% of patients with CML have a shortened chromosome 22 because of a reciprocal translocation t(9;22) (q34;q11.2) called the Philadelphia chromosome. The ABL1 gene encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase on chromosome 9, and BCR is a breakpoint cluster region on chromosome 22. The translated oncoprotein, in most cases, is 210-kd and called p210 BCR-ABL1. Alternative splicing results in p190 and p230 BCR-ABL1, which may show different presentations. This oncoprotein acts as a constitutively expressed defective tyrosine kinase. The downstream pathways affected include JAK/STAT, PI3K/AKT, and RAS/MEK; they involve cell growth, cell survival, inhibition of apoptosis, and activation of transcription factors.

The remainder of patients has variant or complex translocations involving additional chromosomes detected by routine cytogenetics or a cryptic BCR-ABL1 translocation detected with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
