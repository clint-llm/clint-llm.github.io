The blood supply to the insula and the frontoparietal and temporal opercula comes from the branches of the middle cerebral artery.

**Insula - Blood Supply**

The insula receives the blood supply mainly from short M2-segment perforating arteries. Some short perforating arteries from the M1 and M3 segments give blood supply to the limen insulae and the circular sulcus of the insula, respectively. Medium and long perforating arteries penetrate the insular cortex to give blood supply to deeper structures, including the extreme capsule, the claustrum, the external capsule, and the corona radiata. Of particular interest during surgical procedures in insular lesions are the long perforating insular arteries. They penetrate the posterosuperior region of the insula to give blood supply to the corona radiata. These arteries must be preserved to avoid infarction of the corona radiata resulting in hemiparesis.

**Frontoparietal and Temporal Opercula - Blood Supply**

The branches of the M4 segment (cortical) of the middle cerebral artery give the blood supply to the perisylvian cortex. The cortical areas supplied by the middle cerebral artery follow a pattern of 12 areas. The inferior part of the pars orbitalis is in the orbitofrontal area. The superior region of the pars orbitalis, the pars triangularis, and the anterior part of the pars opercularis are in the prefrontal area. The posterior part of the pars opercularis and the lower end of the precentral gyrus is in the precentral area. The inferior region of the postcentral gyrus is in the central area. All these areas receive the orbitofrontal, prefrontal, precentral, and central arteries.

The anterior region of the inferior parietal lobule is in the anterior parietal area. The posterior part of the inferior parietal lobule, including the supramarginal gyrus, is in the posterior parietal area. The posterior region of the superior temporal gyrus and part of the supramarginal gyrus is in the angular area. These areas receive the blood supply from the anterior and posterior parietal arteries and the angular artery. The posterior half of the superior temporal gyrus is in the termporo-occipital area. The middle region of the superior temporal gyrus is in the posterior temporal area. The superior temporal gyrus at the level of the pars triangularis and pars opercularis is in the middle temporal area. The anterior region of the superior temporal gyrus is in the anterior temporal area. These areas of the temporal lobe receive 4 or 5 main stem arteries.
