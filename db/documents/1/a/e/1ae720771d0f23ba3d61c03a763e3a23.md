The successful treatment of skin abscesses is not limited to clinician proficiency in performing incision and drainage. Often patients will understandably have questions regarding disease recurrence and prevention, and there is a significant amount of research to address these topics.

Although bacterial etiology was not discussed in this article, skin and soft tissue infections are many times caused by Staphylococcus aureus, with the prevalence of MRSA increasing. IDSA (Infectious Diseases Society of America) guidelines on the management of skin and soft tissue infections due to MRSA discuss measures to prevent recurrence. These guidelines are derived from important research performed by not only physicians but other integral members of the healthcare team as well. There have been multiple publications by nursing on the subject of recurrence prevention.
