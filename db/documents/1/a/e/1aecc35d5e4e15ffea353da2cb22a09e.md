The spectrum of acute symptoms in EPS is distressing, especially with painful torticollis, oculogyric crisis, and bulbar type of speech. If left untreated, it may cause dehydration, infection, pulmonary embolism, rhabdomyolysis, respiratory stridor, and obstruction.

While typical, first-generation antipsychotics are used less frequently today, the provider must also be cognizant that even second-generation atypical antipsychotics may lead to EPS, although at a lower incidence. Abouzaid and colleagues recently assessed the economic burden of EPS due to atypical antipsychotics in schizophrenia patients. During a 12-month follow-up period, 12.6% of patients experienced EPS. Compared to those without EPS, patients who did experience EPS had more schizophrenia-related and all-cause hospitalizations, schizophrenia-related emergency room visits, and higher schizophrenia-related and all-cause total healthcare, inpatient, and prescription medication costs.

Psychiatric nurses and pharmacists should educate patients about EPS. Nurses monitor patients and consult with the team if issues persist. Pharmacists review acute and chronic medications for doses and interactions. [Level 5]
