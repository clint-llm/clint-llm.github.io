Breast reconstruction is indicated for any women who undergoes a breast surgery for oncological reasons. Some women try external prosthesis, but often they feel this restricts their lifestyle and can negatively affect their self-image. A transverse rectus abdominis (TRAM) flap provides an excellent breast reconstruction for women in good health who want to avoid breast implants. Discussion about the compliance with the postoperative recovery and an understanding of the abdominal scars are important.
