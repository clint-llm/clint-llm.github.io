Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without contrast is the best diagnostic study to evaluate a patient with suspected DIPG. Usually, more than half of the enlarged ventral pons will show an increased signal on the T2 FLAIR MRI sequence. The tumor will not show contrast enhancement, but occasionally, small areas of necrosis can enhance. Higher values on the apparent diffuse coefficient derived from diffusion-weighted MRI images correlates with better median survival.
