The ultimate goal of treatment is to limit the progression of the AAA by modifying risk factors like controlling blood pressure, discontinuing smoking, and lowering levels of lipids. When the patient is admitted, the following assessments are necessary:

- Check by palpation for a pulsating mass in the abdomen, at or above the umbilicus.

- Auscultate for a bruit over the abdominal aorta.

- Determine if there is tenderness on palpation (do not palpate too deep as there is a risk of rupture).

- Ask if the patient has abdominal or lower back pain.

- Check blood pressure to determine if a rupture has occurred.

- Check distal leg pulses to ensure tissue perfusion.

- Strict blood pressure control if high (may need oral or IV medications).

- Ensure that the patient has been seen by anesthesia and the vascular surgeon.
