Various options are available for the management of CCFs depending on the flow rate. The goal is to achieve complete occlusion of the fistula while preserving normal ICA flow.

- Spontaneous closure: In indirect low flow fistulas, spontaneous closure can be expected in 20% to 60% of the cases.

- Compression treatment: For low flow fistulas, this conservative therapy is the least invasive alternative that involves compression of the cervical carotidÂ multiple times a day for 4 to 6 weeks to promote thrombosis of the fistula. This is done by applying pressure to the neck by the opposite hand since any cortical ischemia resulting from the compression would cause the hand to fall away from the neck. Closure with conservative management can be expected in only 30% of all cases.

- Surgical intervention is the most invasive, but a definitive option available. With a success rate of 31% to 79%, surgical options include suturing or clipping the fistula, packing the cavernous sinus, or ligating the ICA.

- Endovascular intervention is the first-line treatment of CCFs with a cure rate of greater than 80%.
