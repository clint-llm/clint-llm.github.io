Porphyrins are the major precursors of heme, an important component of hemoglobin, myoglobin, catalase, peroxidase, and P450 liver cytochromes. In porphyrias, there is an absence of enzymes of the porphyrin pathway, causing abnormally elevated concentrations of these heme precursors, which are toxic to tissues at high levels.
