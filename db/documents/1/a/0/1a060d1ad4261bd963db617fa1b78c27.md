The autonomic nervous system (ANS) of mammals has not completed development at birth, resulting in a dysfunctional ANS. While there is an ANS framework is present in the early embryo, there is a delay in the development of the area postrema. For example, a study on ANS development in mice revealed that during postnatal days 0 to 7, there was no significant change in the AP volume or synaptic input from PHOX2B-derived neurons, but by day 7 to 20, there was an increase in volume and synaptic input from these same neurons. The study concluded that crucial ANS structures undergo dynamic developmental changes in the postnatal period. This finding can provide a basis for the future understanding of ANS dysfunction and disease predisposition in premature and term humans.
