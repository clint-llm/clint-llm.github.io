Most muscle tissue in the human body derives from the mesenchymal tissue of the mesodermal germ layer. The mesenchymal tissue will differentiate into muscles, blood vessels, and connective tissue. The sternohyoid muscle will form from the mesenchymal tissue in the neck region during fetal development.

Muscle embryology is a process called myogenesis. This process involves the myoblast cells derived from the mesodermal germ layer. These myoblast cells will elongate and fuse to form muscle fibers called myotubes. This induction of this process occurs via fibroblast growth factor (FGF). The myotubes will grow and proliferate until they terminally differentiate into myocytes. The myocytes will be the muscle cell that is present in all types of muscles.
