Congenital smooth muscle hamartoma is a benign proliferation of mature smooth muscle that was first described by Sourreil in 1969. It can arise from the arrector pili muscle attached to hair follicles, the dartos muscle in the scrotum, the vascular smooth muscle, the muscularis mammillae of the areolae. It predominately occurs in the lumbosacral area. It is a sporadic condition that usually presents as a solitary lesion. There is no risk of malignant transformation of the congenital smooth cell hamartoma; therefore, no treatment is necessary in most cases.
