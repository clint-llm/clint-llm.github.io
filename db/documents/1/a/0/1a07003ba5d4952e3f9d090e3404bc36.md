Below is the ACGME document regarding Emergency Medicine Skills requirements that residents must meet upon graduation. This text was adapted from the ACGME website:

"Emergency Medicine Defined Key Index Procedure Minimums Review Committee for Emergency Medicine The following are key index procedures identified by the Review Committee as essential to the independent practice of emergency medicine (based on the Program Requirements, the Emergency Medicine Milestones, and the Model of the Clinical Practice for Emergency Medicine). Residents are required to perform the minimum numbers indicated for each key index procedure below by the time of graduation from the program. Procedure Minimum

- Adult Medical Resuscitation 45

- Adult Trauma Resuscitation 35

- Cardiac Pacing 6

- Central Venous Access 20

- Chest Tubes 10

- Cricothyrotomy 3

- Dislocation Reduction 10

- ED Bedside Ultrasound 150

- Intubations 35

- Lumbar Puncture 15

- Pediatric Medical Resuscitation 15

- Pediatric Trauma Resuscitation 10

- Pericardiocentesis 3

- Procedural Sedation 15

- Vaginal Delivery 10

No more than 30 percent of required logged procedures performed in simulated settings can count toward the required minimum, with the exception of rare procedures, namely pericardiocentesis, cardiac pacing, and cricothyrotomy. One hundred percent of these rare procedures may be performed in the lab."

Procedural skills have traditionally been assessed through observation and teaching as the learner is performing the skill.

With simulated skill training, the learner may be evaluated in a formative manner, with a checklist addressing each step of the procedure as well as the associated cognitive steps.
