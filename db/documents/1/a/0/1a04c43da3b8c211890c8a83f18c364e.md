The prompt identification and management of AVPD are paramount if the patient is to lead a fruitful and satisfying life. This goal can only be accomplished with a quality dynamic between the interprofessional team. Most likely, this disorder will require not only pharmacological intervention but also intense psychotherapy and unconditional support. Staff will need to be available around the clock in the event of emergent decompensation. A well functioning team will consist of a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, nurses, and medical assistants.
