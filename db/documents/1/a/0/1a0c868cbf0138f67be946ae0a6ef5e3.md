Cardiac cirrhosis is a term used to include the spectrum of hepatic disorders that occur secondary to hepatic congestion due to cardiac dysfunction, especially the right heart chambers. This condition may present with symptoms such as shortness of breath, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, and leg swelling. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of cardiac cirrhosis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of cardiac cirrhosis.
- Describe the pathophysiology of cardiac cirrhosis.
- Explain the steps used in the management of cardiac cirrhosis.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team in correcting the hemodynamic imbalance that will improve outcomes in patients with cardiac cirrhosis.
