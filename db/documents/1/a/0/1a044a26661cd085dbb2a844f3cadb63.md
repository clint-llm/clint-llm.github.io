Conservative treatment should be adopted for patients with deformational plagiocephaly and mild unilateral synostosis.

Surgical treatment is indicated in nonsyndromic craniosynostosis to reduce the morphologic abnormality, prevent increased ICP, and prevent psychosocial issues. Surgical aims are to achieve sufficient intracranial volume for brain growth and correct the skull's shape.

The surgical options are open craniotomy with reconstruction or endoscopic suturectomy. The procedures are fronto-orbital remodeling for anterior plagiocephaly and occipital advancement for posterior plagiocephaly.

The cranial bones are flexible until the age of six months and can be easily manipulated by the endoscopic approach.
