Only two-thirds of children with HLHS survive to 5 years of age, and approximately 1% of Fontan patients die every year.

One-third of neonates with HLHS die before any palliative surgical intervention can take place.

Neonates with a single ventricle are at increased risk for cardiac arrest (12.7%) and mortality (62.3%)

Some centers are reporting a Stage 1 Norwood palliation survival rate of 90%.

The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database (STS CHSD) reported in 2019 procedure mortality rates of stage I palliation 15%, Hemi-Fontan/Glenn 1.8%, and Fontan 1.0%.

The  Aristotle score (range 1.5 to 25) was recently created through the collaboration of pediatric cardiac surgeons to better predict the potential for mortality, surgical complexity, potential morbidity, and quality of care. The score considers the complexity of the procedure and adds points due to the patient's current condition. Patient adjusted points are frequently added for anatomic variants, respiratory failure, shock, prematurity, and low weight. An Aristotle score greater than 20 has correlated with a high procedure mortality rate. A score greater than 20 is often seen with the Norwood procedure. The Aristotle score should be calculated preoperatively and may be used to counsel parents and give them realistic expectations.
