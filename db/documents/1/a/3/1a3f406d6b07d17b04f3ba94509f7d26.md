# Continuing Education Activity

Sugammadex is a modified gamma-cyclodextrin that is used to reverse steroidal non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs rocuronium and vecuronium. Residual neuromuscular blockade is common after surgery, with an estimated 30 to 60% incidence in the recovery room. The low-level neuromuscular blockade, lower than what can be observed with the naked eye, has been linked to hypoxia, supralaryngeal muscle weakness that predisposes to upper airway obstruction, impaired swallowing, and an increased risk for aspiration. Sugammadex increases the speed of neuromuscular blockade reversal and greatly reduces the risk for residual neuromuscular paralysis. It does not inhibit acetylcholinesterase-like traditional reversal agents, such as neostigmine; therefore, using an antimuscarinic agent such as glycopyrrolate is unnecessary. This activity outlines the indications, mechanisms of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring, of sugammadex, so providers can direct patient therapy in treating indicated disorders as part of the interprofessional team with a basis on the current knowledge for optimal utilization.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of sugammadex.
- Review the indicated uses for sugammadex.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of sugammadex.
- Summarize how interprofessional coordination can improve surgical outcomes with sugammadex use.

# Indications

Sugammadex is a modified gamma-cyclodextrin designed for optimal encapsulation of the neuromuscular blocking drug rocuronium, preventing rocuronium from acting at the acetylcholine receptor.

# Mechanism of Action

Sugammadex contains eight identical hydroxyl chains bound together to create a ring with a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic outer surface.

The sugammadex-rocuronium inclusion complex has a very high association constant (1.79 x 10 mol/L).

Sugammadex reverses neuromuscular blockade by encapsulating free NMBD in plasma. This decreases the plasma concentration of free NMBD, which creates a concentration gradient between the muscle tissue compartment and plasma. Consequently, free NMBD moves from the muscle tissue compartment to plasma; these NMBD are encapsulated by plasma sugammadex, which maintains the lower concentration of free NMBD in plasma and fuels the cycle. Consequently, there is a rapid decrease in the concentration of NMBD at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor within the neuromuscular junction. This allows neuromuscular activity to resume.

# Administration

Administration of sugammadex from 2 mg/kg to 16 mg/kg demonstrates a linear and dose-dependent pharmacokinetic relationship, with an elimination half-life of 100 to 150 minutes and near 100% renal clearance.

While vecuronium and rocuronium should be dosed according to ideal body weight, sugammadex should be dosed according to actual body weight. For obese patients, the use of ideal body weight is likely not enough to achieve full reversal from rocuronium.

A few options for reinitiating neuromuscular blockade after administering sugammadex include redosing rocuronium or vecuronium, succinylcholine, or administering a neuromuscular blocking drug from the benzylisoquinoline class. The company that manufactures sugammadex recommends a minimum waiting period of 5 minutes before administering a 1.2 mg/kg dose of rocuronium and a minimum waiting period of 4 hours before administering a 0.6 mg/kg dose of rocuronium or a 0.1 mg/kg dose of vecuronium. The product insert for sugammadex warms that patients receiving a 1.2 mg/kg dose of rocuronium within 30 minutes of reversal are likely to experience delayed onset and shortened duration of neuromuscular blockade. For patients that receive a 16 mg/kg dose of sugammadex, a minimum wait time of 24 hours is likely needed.

Sugammadex does not bind to succinylcholine or benzylisoquinoline neuromuscular blocking drugs such as mivacurium, atracurium, and cisatracurium.

# Adverse Effects

The most commonly reported adverse reactions after sugammadex administration is nausea and vomiting, headache, itching, procedural pain, and dysgeusia.

Bradycardia has been noted after sugammadex administration, with some reports of cardiac arrest.

Though more of a characteristic of rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than a side effect, surgeons have noticed that patients under light anesthesia may start to cough or move when sugammadex is administered. Bronchospasm after the administration of sugammadex has been reported—the incidence appears to be quite low.

# Contraindications

Sugammadex is contraindicated for patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions, ranging from isolated skin reactions to anaphylaxis. In a study conducted by the manufacturer, the incidence of hypersensitivity in patients with given doses of placebo, 4 mg/kg, or 16 mg/kg was 1%, 7%, and 9%, respectively.

Patients with a creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min are currently not considered candidates for sugammadex. Plasma clearance and urinary excretion of rocuronium and sugammadex are significantly decreased in patients with a creatinine clearance of < 30 ml/min.

The remaining contraindications should be considered relative. Therefore, the decision to administer sugammadex should be determined on a patient-by-patient basis after weighing individual risks and benefits.

Few studies have been conducted on children. The recommended doses for adults appear to be equally efficacious and safe in children.

There is very little information regarding the use of sugammadex in pregnant patients. Sugammadex appears to be effective and has a low maternal side effect profile when administered during cesarean delivery.

The use of sugammadex in breastfeeding patients is likely safe, but there is insufficient data to understand the effect on milk letdown, breastfeeding success, and fetal safety. While it is unknown if the drug is secreted into human breast milk, the likelihood of effects on the infant is low. In one study, sugammadex was present in rat milk, with the maximum drug level occurring 30 minutes after intravenous administration. The Drug and Lactation Database currently states that fetal exposure to sugammadex through breast milk is likely to be low and that sugammadex administration to breastfeeding women is acceptable.

Patients taking hormonal birth control to prevent pregnancy should consider nonhormonal alternatives for one week after exposure to sugammadex. Sugammadex can bind to progesterone and decrease the effectiveness of hormone-based contraception. Receiving a single dose of sugammadex has been stated to be similar to missing one dose of birth control containing estrogen or progesterone. Therefore, it is recommended that institutions develop a standard handout describing the effect of sugammadex on hormone contraception and recommend additional barrier contraception for seven days following surgery.

# Monitoring

Reoccurrence of, or residual neuromuscular blockade, is possible when sugammadex is underdosed.

Through in vitro and in vivo studies, it has been established that sugammadex can prolong the prothrombin time (PT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). In a study conducted by the drug manufacturer, healthy volunteers receiving 4 to 16 mg/kg of sugammadex demonstrated a 25% prolongation in aPTT and PT that lasted for 1 hour. However, this laboratory coagulopathy has not translated to more bleeding events or a higher incidence of anemia during surgery.

# Toxicity

Sugammadex is biologically inactive and is generally well tolerated. However, concerns related to anaphylaxis caused the Food and Drug Administration to delay approval for sugammadex for years. An early manufacturer-sponsored study found a 0.3% incidence of anaphylaxis. The study involved 299 subjects, and one subject who received the largest dose, 16 mg/kg, had an anaphylactic reaction. Sugammadex has been approved in the United States since 2015, in Japan since 2010, and in the European Union since 2008. The actual rate of anaphylaxis appears to be much lower, perhaps similar to the incidence of anaphylaxis from rocuronium.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

It is now undisputed that sugammadex provides a faster and more complete reversal of neuromuscular blockade than neostigmine. However, for most institutions, sugammadex remains more expensive than neostigmine. Therefore, there is significant international interest in determining if the increased cost of sugammadex can be offset by increased operating room efficiency, better surgical outcomes, shorter recovery room times, fewer postoperative complications, and reduced hospital readmission rates.

Residual neuromuscular blockade is common after surgery, with an estimated 30 to 60% incidence in the recovery room.

Evidence is emerging that sugammadex may reduce the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. Single-institution interrupted time series analysis and a large multi-institution retrospective matched cohort study found a lower rate of postoperative pulmonary complications with sugammadex than neostigmine.

There is budding interest in determining if sugammadex may help reduce the incidence of postoperative ileus. The incidence of postoperative ileus after colorectal surgery has been reported to be 10 to 25%.

In summary, sugammadex is a valuable tool to reverse neuromuscular blockade administered to perform many procedures and surgeries. Still, for safe and effective use, it requires the efforts of an interprofessional team, including clinicians, surgeons, specialists, anesthesiologists/nurse anesthetists, surgical nurses, and pharmacists. An interprofessional approach will improve patient outcomes and fewer adverse events when using sugammadex in situations where it has been indicated. [Level 5]
