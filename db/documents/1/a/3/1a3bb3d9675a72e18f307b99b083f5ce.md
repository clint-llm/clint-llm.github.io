The AchA may be most prominent in its vascular supply to the brain during the choroidal stage of development, around five weeks. During this time, the vertebrobasilar system has yet to develop, and the internal carotid arteries almost exclusively supply the brain. Thus, the AchA provides cortical branches to the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes during this early embryonic stage, which is later dominated by the posterior cerebral artery in the adult human.

Due to its prominence in early embryonic development, the AchA does have various anatomic variants that may exist in the adult brain. Such variations include the possibility of the AchA arising directly from the ICA bifurcation, the M1 segment of the MCA, or from the Pcom. In such cases, collateral circulation may diminish, and thus it is essential to keep the singular vessel supplying that area patent. It has also been shown that some variations of the AchA result in duplication of the artery, which may result in an increased risk of an aneurysm at that bifurcation.
