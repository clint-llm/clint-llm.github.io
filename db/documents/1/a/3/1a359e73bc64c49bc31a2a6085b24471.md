Genital symptoms are commonly seen in the outpatient primary care setting, despite many going without a clear diagnosis. HSV-2, in particular, may present as a primary infection with painful genital ulcers, sores, crusts, tender lymphadenopathy, and dysuria.

It is important to note that HSV-2 does not typically present with painless ulcers. Systemic symptoms can occur to include fever, headache, and malaise and are often due to concurrent viremia, which has been reported in up to 24% of patients in one study.
