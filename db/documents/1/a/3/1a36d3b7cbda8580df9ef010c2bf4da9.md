Microphthalmia with cyst is a congenital malformation and hence, cannot be prevented. However, the associated cosmetic and functional disability can be minimized if appropriate measures are taken at every step. As opposed to the loss of an eye in adulthood, an early loss in childhood results in hypoplasia and volume loss of the affected orbit. It leads to distorted orbital-facial growth, rendering the management more challenging. Hence, an early presentation and a timely intervention are recommended to effectively manage these patients. Another issue is the loss of follow-up and the unwillingness of the parents to place a conformer/orbital expanders/prosthesis in the childâ€™s orbit. The importance of close monitoring of the orbital growth and volume, and the need for these therapeutic measures to minimize asymmetry and achieve desirable aesthetic and functional outcomes, should be well-explained.
