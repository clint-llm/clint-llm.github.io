Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) itself is rare, with the prevalence in the United States approximately one in 25,000 deliveries. However, the case mortality rate varies somewhere between 40 to 60%. A study in California showed that 26.4% of women died while 66% developed DIC.

Two-thirds of women surviving AFE are left with serious neurologic, pulmonary, and cardiovascular deficits. The risk of recurrence is unknown. Successful subsequent pregnancies have been reported.
