The differential diagnosis for epidermolysis bullosa acquisita includes other subepidermal blistering disorders, such as dystrophic EB, BP, MMP, porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), pseudoporphyria, and bullous lupus erythematosus (LE). Dominant dystrophic EB clinically resembles the mechanobullous type of EBA but would have a positive family history of a bullous disorder, onset at birth, and negative DIF findings. BP and MMP can appear clinically identical to the inflammatory variants of EBA but can be distinguished by an n-serrated DIF immunodeposition pattern. Other diagnostic tests, including IIF with salt-split skin substrate, ELISA, Western immunoblotting, or immunoelectron microscopy, can help exclude other autoimmune bullous diseases.

PCT classically involves the hands but would be distinguished by positive porphyrin studies. Similarly, pseudoporphyria may mimic EBA, but patients would have an additional history of chronic kidney disease, renal dialysis, or ingestion of specific drugs, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, furosemide, antibiotics, and retinoids.

Bullous LE can infrequently present as a mechanobullous eruption with milia and scarring. However, on histology, it demonstrates subepidermal bullae with a primarily neutrophilic infiltrate with dermal papillary microabscesses resembling dermatitis herpetiformis.
