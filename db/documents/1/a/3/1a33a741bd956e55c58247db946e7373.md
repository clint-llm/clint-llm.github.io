Orbital pseudotumor, orbital inflammatory pseudotumor (OIP), or idiopathic orbital inflammation (IOI) is a benign, non-infectious, non-neoplastic, space-occupying, inflammatory condition of the orbit and peri-orbit without identifiable local or systemic causes. This article presents the current theories on the etiology, clinical manifestation, pathogenesis, differential diagnosis, laboratory and imaging tests, and treatment options for the management of orbital pseudotumor. The role of the interprofessional team will be reviewed in this activity.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of orbital pseudotumor. 
- Review the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of orbital pseudotumors.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for orbital pseudotumors. 
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the diagnosis and treatment of orbital pseudotumor and improve outcomes.
