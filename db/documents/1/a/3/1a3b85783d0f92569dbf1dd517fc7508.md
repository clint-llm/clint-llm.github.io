The cervical spine is a dynamic structure tasked with protecting nervous innervation to the entire body while also maintaining a range of motion for the head and neck. Fractures of the cervical spine are a leading cause of mobility and mortality in trauma patients, and a bone fracture is associated with 56% of cervical spinal cord injuries. Fractures of the cervical spine can be described based on the level involved and typically divided into three groups: C1, C2 and the sub-axial spine (C3 to C7). This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of cervical spine fractures, and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the various type of cervical spine fractures, by mechanism and location.
- Review the diagnostic approach and evaluation criteria for potential cervical spine fracture injuries.
- Summarize the treatment options for cervical spine fractures depending on the type and location of the fracture.
- Explain possible interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and treatment of cervical spine fractures and improve outcomes.
