Patient safety is a fundamental concern in any health care organization, and early detection of any clinical deterioration is of paramount importance whether the patient is in the emergency department or on the hospital floor. The early detection of changes in vital signs typically correlates with faster detection of changes in the cardiopulmonary status of the patient as well as up-gradation of the level of service if needed. Vital signs assessment currently uses electronic equipment, but there is evidence that, outside of the intensive care units, respiratory rate assessment through observation, leading to insufficient, subjective, and unreliable results.

In a case-control study conducted by Rothschild and colleagues, early warning criterion among patients on the medical floor, the presence of respiratory rate over 35/min (OR=31.1) was most strongly associated with a life-threatening adverse event.

It seems intuitive that the higher the frequency of vital sign measurement, the faster the chances of clinical deterioration are detected. There is variability between institutes within and across nations depending on the acuity of clinical condition, any active intervention carried out, the amount of staff availability, cost issues, organizational practices, and leadership styles. The weighted average score deduced from the vital sign measurements (i.e., an early warning score) is used to determine the timing of the next observation sets.
