Given the highly variable causality of elevated CRP, marginal elevations in the CRP can be difficult to interpret and should not be used as an isolated test result interpreted as appropriate for the clinical picture. It is useful in suggesting infection versus inflammation if the levels are extremely high, but levels between 1 mg/dL and 10 mg/dL can be difficult to interpret accurately. Chronic conditions, such as inflammatory arthritis or SLE, can make these levels elevated chronically, making it harder to determine if there is any significance to an elevated hs-CRP level when using it as a predictive marker for cardiovascular disease.
