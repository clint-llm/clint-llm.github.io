Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis commonly presents in the third to fifth decade of life. It is also common in children. It usually found in severe asthmatics and patients with cystic fibrosis.

Allergy to Aspergillus, as shown by a positive skin prick test to Aspergillus antigen, is present in almost 25% asthmatics and 50% of cystic fibrosis patients, but ABPA is not that much prevalent. The prevalence of ABPA in asthma and cystic fibrosis is about 13% and 9%, respectively.

A. fumigatus is the most common organism that causes ABPA, and the fungus requires dead organic matter to survive. The highest incidence of the infection is known to be in the winter season around the world (secondary to fallen leaves).
