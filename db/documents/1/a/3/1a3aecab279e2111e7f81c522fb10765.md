Thioridazine is a low potency typical antipsychotic, like chlorpromazine. Unlike higher potency antipsychotics, thioridazine has a lower incidence of extrapyramidal side effects. However, lower potency antipsychotics are more likely to be associated with antimuscarinic, antihistaminic, and antiadrenergic side effects. Thioridazine is metabolized through the liver with a half-life of 24 hours and is excreted in the urine, bile, and feces. The hepatic cytochrome P450 CYP2D6 metabolism of thioridazine is important because it assists in identifying different drug-drug interactions. Thus, it is necessary to evaluate patients and identify medications that may increase or decrease thioridazine levels.
