It is vital to identify breach rhythm while interpreting EEG to avoid misinterpretation of epileptiform activity.

It is important to inquire about the patient's surgical history and any history of head trauma to evaluate if breach rhythm is likely to be present. The palpation of the scalp may not be sufficient. Breach rhythm is seen over skull defects and abruptly diminishes beyond the margin of the defect. It is best appreciated by bipolar montage, due to its higher spatial resolution.

Pure breach rhythm does not have an after going slow wave. There is no spread of activity to other areas of the brain. Sleep recordings can aid differentiation between breach rhythm and epileptiform activity.

In general, interictal epileptiform abnormalities are facilitated during NREM sleep and inhibited during REM sleep. If breach rhythm is constituted mostly by enhanced underlying rhythms, breach rhythm will attenuate or disappear during drowsiness and sleep. It may linger into drowsiness and light NREM sleep if breach rhythm is mixed with a mid-temporal, alpha-like rhythm. Mu rhythm within breach rhythm can be tested for reactivity by asking the patient to move the contralateral limb. Attenuation on doing so suggests reactivity of breach rhythm and is indicative of a normal pattern; however, lack of reactivity does not rule out the presence of normal rhythm.

EEG filters should be used carefully. Filters to reduce too-high frequency may filter out the higher frequencies of breach rhythm, but the left out activity could resemble spikes or sharp waves. Muscle artifacts usually can be easily identified by their much higher frequency component, provided an appropriate high-frequency filter be chosen. Filtering out muscle activity will attenuate the signals and may be confused for epileptiform abnormalities within the breach rhythm.
