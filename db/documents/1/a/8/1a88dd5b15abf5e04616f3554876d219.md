Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is thrombotic microangiopathy characterized by the presence of a triad of symptoms: thrombocytopenia, acute renal impairment, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Although traditionally thought of as a triad, HUS presentation may vary based on different etiology. This activity describes the evaluation and management of HUS and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of hemolytic uremic syndrome.
-  Identify appropriate evaluation of hemolytic uremic syndrome.
- Outline the management of hemolytic uremic syndrome.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for those affected with hemolytic uremic syndrome.
