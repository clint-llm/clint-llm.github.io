Infertility is a common problem encountered in the medical community. If a female patient cannot become pregnant after one year of unprotected intercourse performed regularly, an evaluation is in order. An important consideration is the patientâ€™s body mass index. If a patient is overweight, weight loss may improve her chances of becoming pregnant.
