**Imaging Evaluation**

Following the physical examination in patients with a high clinical suspicion for trochanteric bursitis, plain film radiographs, including a two-view hip and pelvis, should be obtained to rule out an associated fracture or other osseous abnormalities. Plain films will be unremarkable in the setting of trochanteric bursitis. Advanced imaging is rarely necessary to diagnose trochanteric bursitis but is often ordered if there is a concern for an occult fracture of the femoral neck. Trochanteric bursitis will show up as an area of increased signal on T2 sequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is obtained; however, this is not necessary for diagnosis.

**Laboratory Evaluation**

Laboratory workup is not routinely performed if clinical suspicion is high for trochanteric bursitis in the absence of constitutional symptoms. If the patient has associated fevers, chills, or other signs of systemic infections, CBC with differential can be obtained to look for the presence of leukocytosis. If suspicion exists clinically for an underlying septic hip joint, acute inflammatory markers, including ESR and CRP, can be obtained.
