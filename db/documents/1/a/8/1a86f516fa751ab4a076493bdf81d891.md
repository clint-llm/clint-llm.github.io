The lack of stroke center certification standardization is a potential area of future concern. As previously discussed, stroke centers are currently certified through independent organizations (e.g.-TJC, DNV GL, HFAP). There are government agencies that, in some jurisdictions, may give stroke center designation and some institutions even elect self-certification. The BAC strongly endorses independent certification as that has been demonstrated to be more accurate, rigorous, and comprehensive a process.

One study examining the quality of care and outcomes in PSCs taking part in "Get With The Guidelines"-Stroke data comparison found statistically significant differences between certification organizations. The rate of IV tPA use was found to be higher in TJC and DNV GL and lower in HFAP and state-certified hospitals. Door-to-needle times were longer in HFAP hospitals, and state-certified PSCs had higher in-hospital mortality.
