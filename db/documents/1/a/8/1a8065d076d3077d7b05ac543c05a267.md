Lead encephalopathy can present as an acute critical illness, and the most important initial consideration in managing these patients is the stabilization of airway, breathing, and circulation. In the appropriate clinical setting, lead encephalopathy should be considered in patients presenting with delirium, altered mental status, or seizures.

A physical exam will primarily reveal CNS derangement. Generally speaking, patients afflicted with lead encephalopathy will appear to be globally altered. They may also exhibit signs of peripheral neuropathy on the exam, such as wrist drop and loss of 2 point discrimination. Patients also commonly exhibit ataxia on the exam. They may also present with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, or, more rarely, focal seizures. In rare cases, patients with lead encephalopathy may present with focal neurologic deficits.
