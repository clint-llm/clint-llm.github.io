Zoledronate is a versatile medication that helps prevent morbidity and mortality in various conditions. It is used in different medical and surgical specialties. As it is an infused therapy, patients often receive this treatment in a healthcare facility. Interprofessional collaboration is vital to providing safe and effective care with this medication.

Counseling patients regarding potential side effects of zoledronate begins with the physician. Pharmacists play an integral role in checking for drug interactions. Nurses infuse this medication and monitor for adverse reactions. This approach requires collaboration from all healthcare team members and can help ensure our patients are given optimal treatment.

The safety of patients receiving treatment with zoledronate relies on the prescriber's knowledge of the contraindications, monitoring, and dose adjustments required when using this medication. For this medication, each indication has different parameters for each of these categories. Careful attention to these details is needed for each patient care team member.

Healthcare costs and the appropriate utilization of healthcare resources are of utmost importance. When making decisions regarding patient care, one must ensure that when selecting a treatment option, all aspects of the patient are considered. Many treatment options for osteoporosis are available, and when zoledronate is selected as therapy, patients receive this medication in a healthcare facility intravenously.

This medication requires more invasive procedures for administration compared to its oral counterparts. Also, as it is administered under direct supervision in a healthcare facility, the total healthcare cost is higher than other options. These factors should not deter prescribers from utilizing this treatment option, but appropriate patient selection is required for this drug to have the most benefit. [Level 5]
