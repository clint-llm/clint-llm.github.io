Hyperbaric oxygen is usually well tolerated. Occasionally patients who have difficulty equalizing may develop barotrauma to the ears. This can usually be managed with nasal decongestants and rarely requires myringotomy tubes to be placed by an otolaryngological surgeon. Pulmonary barotrauma is very rare; however, the possibility of pulmonary trauma should be consideredÂ when patients develop chest pain on an ascent. Pulmonary and cerebral oxygen toxicity is typically not an issue with the relatively short exposures used for acute traumatic peripheral ischemias but can occur.
