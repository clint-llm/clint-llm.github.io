The etiology of cerebral salt wasting (CSW) is not completely understood. Cerebral salt wasting is most commonly seen after a central nervous system insult. The most commonly described precipitating insult is aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Why cerebral salt wasting occurs more frequently after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage versus traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage or other CNS insult is not well defined. Why cerebral salt wasting is uncommon after other injuries or diseases is also not well defined.
