Pregnancy-related liver disease includes several distinct liver disorders that affect different stages of pregnancy; these include acute fatty liver of pregnancy, pre-eclamptic liver dysfunction, and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets syndrome (HELLP).

Acute fatty liver of pregnancy is a relatively rare complication of pregnancy, with an incidence of approximately 5 cases per 100000 pregnancies.
