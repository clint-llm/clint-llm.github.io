It is often the case that corneal dystrophies must be differentiated among each other, as clinical presentations may often overlap. While biomicroscopy findings may identify different types of CD, these findings may be similar among dystrophies. Genetic testing may aid in the differentiation among dystrophies of similar presentations.

The presenting signs and symptoms of CD may be due to other ocular diseases. Recurrent corneal erosions may be caused by non-genetic etiologies.

A patient with corneal erosions could also be affected with Herpes keratitis, infectious keratitis, conjunctival foreign bodies, dry eyes secondary to autoimmune disease, among other pathophysiological processes.
