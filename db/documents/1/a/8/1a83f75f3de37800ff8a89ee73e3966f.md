At approximately week three following fertilization, the developing embryo forms the neural groove, the shallow median indentation of the neural plate. The neural tube on the neural plate's lateral margins begins to elevate before joining to form the neural tube.  Signaling from the notochord causes the neural tube and related structures to give rise to central nervous system components. The brain arises from the cranial end of the neural tube the spinal cord from the caudal end. Neural crest cells arise from the neural ectoderm during the neurulation process, transitioning from epithelial to mesenchymal cells then migrating and giving rise to the peripheral nervous system.
