The pathophysiology is incompletely understood, but the plasmablast is known to be the cell of origin. The plasmablast is an activated B cell that has undergone somatic hypermutation and class switching recombination and is becoming a plasma cell. It is also proposed that in PBLs in which EBV is one of the risk factors, EBV leads to the prevention of apoptosis of B cells by several mechanisms.
