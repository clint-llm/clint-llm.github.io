Duodenal ulcers occur when there is a disruption to the surface of the mucosa of the duodenum. These ulcers are part of peptic ulcer disease, which involves the stomach and first part of the duodenum. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of duodenal ulcers and explains the interprofessional team's role in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the epidemiology of duodenal ulcers.
- Outline the dysfunctional mucosal defense mechanisms in the pathophysiology of duodenal ulcers.
- Review the importance of proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor blockers in the treatment of duodenal ulcers.
- Describe the importance of the interprofessional team in the diagnosis and treatment of duodenal ulcers.
