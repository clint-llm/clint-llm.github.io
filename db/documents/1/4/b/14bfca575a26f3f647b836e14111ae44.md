To summarize the function of gastrin:

- Causes gastric acid secretion in the stomach via Ca-dependent release mechanism

- Act on enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells of the gastric fundus to cause histamine release

- Allows for the support and proliferation of the gastric epithelium

- Inhibits the apoptosis of gastric epithelial cells and supports the migration of epithelial cells
