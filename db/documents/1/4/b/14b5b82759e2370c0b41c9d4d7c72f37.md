Acute management is mostly supportive care, while other life-threatening differential diagnoses are ruled out.

The cornerstone of hereditary fructose intolerance management is the absolute avoidance of foods containing fructose, sucrose, and sorbitol-containing products. Enlisting the help of a nutritionist may be helpful, extensive lists of foods containing fructose are available, along with sample diets for patients with the condition.

Patients may be predisposed to nutritional deficiency as their diets necessitate lower fruit and vegetable consumption. Supplementation with a multivitamin is recommended. Follow-up testing of growth, renal, and hepatic function may be useful, especially when the compliance with dietary fructose restriction is poor.

Transferrin isoelectric focusing (TfIEF) and monitoring of increased aspartylglucosaminidase activity (AGA) could be used in the follow-up of patients withÂ this condition.
