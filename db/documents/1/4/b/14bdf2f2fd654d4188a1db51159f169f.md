**Posterior Tibial Tendon Insufficiency (PTTI)**

The tibialis posterior tendon (TPT) can become inflamed and irritated due to an acute injury, such as a fall, or overuse during high-impact sports such as basketball, tennis, or soccer. Acute on chronic bouts of recurrent tendinitis propagate the tendinopathic cascade, potentially leading to posterior tibial tendon insufficiency (PTTI).

The pathophysiology underlying PTTI entails the progressive loss of the medial longitudinal arch, compromising its ability for dynamic stabilization of the foot. Later stages of PTTI and arch collapse eventually lead to attritional failure of static hindfoot stabilizers, including compromise to the spring ligament complex (superomedial calcaneonavicular ligament), the plantar fascia, and plantar ligamentous support structures.

Patients often present secondary to pain and progressive dysfunction. Observation of the foot highlights a spectrum from flexible (early) to rigid (end-stage, degenerative) deformities. The patient should be observed clinically during normal gait posturing as well as statically and dynamically. The patient is asked to stand during the examination, and when viewed from the back, the examiner may be able to appreciate the "too many toes sign," referring to the lateral deviation of the toes relative to the hindfoot. The spectrum of PTTI foot deformity and characteristic posturing categorizes into the following descriptions:

- Pes planus

- Hindfoot valgus

- Forefoot varus

- Forefoot abduction

**Compartment Syndrome**

**Acute Compartment Syndrome (ACS)**

Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) occurs secondary to traumatic (e.g., fractures), iatrogenic (e.g., external sources of cast/dressing compression), or comorbid medical conditions (e.g., bleeding disorders). Regardless of the underlying etiology, ACS develops when the osseous-fascial compartment pressure increases to a level that results in decreased perfusion of the muscle(s) within the specific compartment, potentially leading to irreversible muscle and nerve damage.

- Polytrauma patients

- Intubated/sedated patients

- Pediatric patients

These exceptions require heightened clinical suspicion, and immediate clinical attention is warranted to delineate a diagnosis to expedite the decision to proceed with surgical intervention. Classic examination findings include:

- Pain with passive stretch

- The most sensitive finding before the onset of ischemia.

- Paresthesia

- Motor weakness 

- It can be subtle and difficult to appreciate, especially in the setting of trauma.

- Palpable swelling

- Diminished to absent peripheral pulses

- Absent pulses are often a late finding and often result in inevitable amputation.

Lower leg ACS, specifically isolated to the posterior compartment, will lead to the aforementioned clinical findings, including motor weakness/inability to plantarflex the foot and weakness of toe flexion and foot inversion. There will be a sensory loss over the lateral part of the leg and foot due to compression of the sural nerve, as well as sensory loss along the plantar surface of the foot and toes due to tibial nerve ischemia.

Diagnosis of compartment syndrome before severe ischemia and necrosis occur is necessary for preventing poor outcomes. The clinical diagnosis in a patient with an intact mental status is often by physical examination alone. Treatment is emergent fasciotomies of the involved compartments.

**Chronic Exertional Compartment Syndrome (CECS)**

CECS is clinically differentiated from ACS and is a diagnostic consideration in athletes presenting with lower leg pain often attributable to endurance exercises, including sport-specific activities and training programs. CECS is thought to occur secondary to increased intramuscular pressures within a specific compartment(s) attributable to exercise and activity. Unlike ACS, however, CECS occurs across a spectrum of transient ischemia with or without progressive neurovascular dysfunction.

**Tarsal Tunnel Syndrome**

Tarsal tunnel syndrome results from tibial nerve compression within the tarsal tunnel. The tibial nerve travels inferiorly through the posterior compartment of the lower leg on the posterior surface of the tibialis posterior. It follows the tibialis posterior tendon posterior to the medial malleolus through the tarsal tunnel. This compartment is narrow, and increased compression will affect the tendons and the tibial nerve. Compression of the nerve could come from fibrosis, ganglion cysts, osteochondromas, trauma, ankle sprains, obesity, tight shoes, or other causes.

The symptoms are similar to the symptoms of carpal tunnel in the wrist with the median nerve. Symptoms include burning, numbness, tingling, and weakness of the plantar muscle of the foot and toes. The pain worsens with prolonged use, such as standing, activity, and motion through the carpal tunnel. Tinel's sign can be elicited with percussion on the tibial nerve, and a positive sign is pain, numbness, or tingling along the nerve distribution.

Treatment can include noninvasive modifications such as weight loss, changing daily habits, changing shoes to orthotics, NSAIDs, and osteopathic manipulative medicine. Surgery is possible management for decompression of the tibial nerve, which involves manipulating the flexor retinaculum covering the tarsal tunnel.
