Healthcare providers need to be informed and up to date on the nomenclature of brand-name medications, indications, and adverse effects to ensure safe and successful therapy and positive patient outcomes. It is also crucial that patients receive proper screening for open-angle glaucoma due to the disease rarely presenting with side effects. Appropriate diagnostic testing should be a consideration when optic disc margins are abnormal, and follow-up should include central corneal thickness measurement, a visual field exam, as well as the optic nerve and retinal imaging, as vision loss and nerve damage are markers for the progression of the disease.

Follow-up should include central corneal thickness measurement, a visual field exam, as well as opticÂ nerve and retinal nerve imaging, as vision loss and nerve damage are markers for the progression of the disease.
