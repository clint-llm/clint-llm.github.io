Dizziness and associated postural imbalance have been shown to increase the risk of falling and fear of falling (which is a strong predictor of multiple falls). Dizziness alone is a large economic burden on the US healthcare system, accounting for approximately 4%, or $4 billion, annually within the US.

Falls are the leading cause of injury-related emergency room visits, hospital admissions, and accidental deaths in the elderly population, with associated costs estimated at $754 million in 2015 and are expected to climb within the next 20 years.

With canalith repositioning being as much as 89% effective following a single treatment and vestibular rehabilitation exercise being accepted as an effective treatment for peripheral vestibular hypofunction based on multiple high-level studies as well as a promising potential treatment of central causes of hypofunction, the potential effect to reduce this burden should be considered.
