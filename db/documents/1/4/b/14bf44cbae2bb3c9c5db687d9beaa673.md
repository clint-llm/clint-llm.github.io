Strabismus or squint is broadly classified as

- Pseudostrabismus or apparent squint: Pseudoesotropia and pseudoexotropia

- Latent squint (Heterophoria)

- Manifest squint (Heterotopia): Concomitant squint and incomitant squint

Causes for Pseudostrabismus

- Pseudoesotropia: Prominent epicanthal fold and negative angle kappa

- Pseudoexotropia: Hypertelorism and positive angle kappa

Causes for Heterophoria

- Anatomical causes: Orbital asymmetry, abnormal interpupillary distance (IPD), mild weakness of extraocular muscles, etc.

- Physiological causes: Esophoria is seen in increased accommodation (hyperopes) and exophoria in decreased accommodation (myopes), excessive or decreased use of convergence, and in dissociated works like working with a uniocular microscope or magnifying glasses.

- Decompensation causes psychiatric disorders, illness, the inadequacy of the fusional reserve, older age, and precision jobs.

Causes of Concomitant Squint:

- Sensory causes: These interfere with a clear image formation in one eye. Refractive errors, anisometropia, media opacities, obstruction of pupillary area, macular and optic nerve diseases, and wrong glass prescription for refractive error.

- The motor causes: These interfere with ocular alignment. Orbital, extraocular muscle, and accommodation abnormalities.

Causes of Incomitant Squint:

- Neurogenic causes: Hypoplasia of 3rd, 4th, and 6th cranial nerve nuclei, tumors, infections, trauma, toxicity (alcohol, lead, carbon monoxide), vascular (ophthalmoplegic migraine), and demyelinating lesions affecting the third and sixth cranial nerves.

- Myogenic causes: Congenital lesions, trauma, muscle incarceration in orbital fractures, post-viral myositis, and chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO).

- Neuromuscular junction disorders: Myasthenia gravis.

Risk factors

Strabismus is more prevalent with certain syndromes like Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, Apert-Crouzon syndrome, premature infants with low birth weight, and in kids with affected parents or siblings. All siblings of a strabismic child should be screened at an early age for strabismus as sensorimotor anomalies are common in the pedigrees of strabismic probands.
