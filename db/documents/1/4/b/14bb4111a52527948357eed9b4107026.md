Because of the many causes of pleural effusions, it is important to have an interprofessional team. Irrespective of the cause, if the fluid is aspirated or a chest tube is inserted, the nurse has to look after the patient to ensure that he or she has not developed a pneumothorax. A chest x-ray is mandatory after pleural fluid aspiration. Once a chest tube is inserted, the nurse is responsible for recording the drainage, ensuring a proper seal of the connections, and assessing the patient's respiratory status. Some patients with a chest tube or a pleural effusion may require oxygen and chest physical therapy. For those with chylous ascites, a dietary consult is necessary to help lower the amount of drainage. Limiting fat intake may benefit some patients. Regular chest x-rays are done in patients with chest tubes, and thus the radiologist has to evaluate the chest tube position and site of drainage ports. Pain is a significant problem when chest tubes are inserted, and hence, anesthesia may be contacted for a pain pump or a thoracic epidural.

Clinicians need to inform patients with recurrent pleural effusions about the treatment options and their potential side effects.  Open communication between the team members is necessary to improve patient outcomes and reduce morbidity.

**Outcomes**

The outcome of patients with pleural effusions depends on the cause, severity, and patient comorbidity. In general, people who do not seek therapy have a poor outcome compared to those who are treated. Overall, patients with malignant pleural effusions tend to have a poor outcome. Most patients are dead within 12 to 24 months, irrespective of the cause of the malignant pleural effusion. When pleural effusions are inadequately treated, this can result in empyema, sepsis, and even a trapped lung.
