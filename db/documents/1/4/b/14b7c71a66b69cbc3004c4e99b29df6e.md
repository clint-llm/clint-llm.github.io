The finding of conduction aphasia at the bedside suggests the possibility of a lesion in the dominant hemisphere of the brain, specifically the areas that connect the Wernicke and Broca areas. The clinician should perform neuro-imaging to look for a stroke, tumor, infection, or another pathology in the setting of conduction aphasia. CT or MRI of the brain is the first imaging modality of choice. Depending on the results, further testing may be necessary to determine the precise etiology.
