Depending on the dose and coingestants, dextromethorphan can cause a broad spectrum of clinical effects ranging from mild agitation to psychosis to seizures and coma. Many times, patients are unable to give a clear history due to altered mental status. Obtaining a history from emergency medical personnel, family, friends, and witnesses can be helpful. Familiarity with street names for dextromethorphan can be helpful as well.

- General – hyperthermia, diaphoresis, altered mental status (ranging from mild agitation to coma)

- HEENT – mydriasis, nystagmus

- Cardiovascular – tachycardia, hypertension

- Respiratory- respiratory depression

- Neurological – mild to severe agitation, confusion, hallucination, ataxia, muscular rigidity, seizures, coma

Trauma -  thorough examination for evidence of trauma should take place in the examination as injury secondary to dextromethorphan intoxication can occur due to altered mental status.
