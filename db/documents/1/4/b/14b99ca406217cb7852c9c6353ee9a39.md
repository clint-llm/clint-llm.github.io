OSHA has a notable influence on clinical practice within healthcare institutions. The enforcement of this influence is through standards of hazard communication, bloodborne pathogens, ionizing radiation, exit routes, electrical, emergency, fire safety, medical/first-aid, and personal protective equipment (PPE) within healthcare settings. In the perioperative setting, the risk of exposure to bloodborne pathogens and potentially infectious materials to employees is markedly high, which makes the implementations and regulations set forth by OSHA ever more important.

In 2001, OSHA revised the bloodborne pathogens standard also to include components of the needlestick safety and prevention act.
