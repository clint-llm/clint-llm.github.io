Providing medical support to law enforcement, specifically to tactical teams, can be a time consuming and daunting initiative. The results and outcomes, however, can be some of the most rewarding a medic or physician see in their career. Professionals say that there is nothing like being directly involved in the heat of battle and knowing that their efforts, expertise, and capabilities may save the life of someone who has experienced a traumatic injury. Being involved in tactical field operation is dramatically different from that of a quasi-controlled environment such as the emergency department or a relatively “routine” medical emergency run.

Minus the initial response to an active violence incident, tasks associated with tactical operations are methodical, tedious, and time-consuming. Tactical physicians and emergency medical service (EMS) personnel may be sidelined in the warm zone (see zones of care) as a safety precaution. There is a more frequent integration of medical providers into entry teams or more frequent positioning close to the fight to provide the quickest possible intervention should something go wrong and the need for emergency medical care becomes necessary. If integrated into the entry team, medical providers should expect a significant amount of training and practice. This training will focus on the dynamics of the tactical team movements, operations, and communication.
