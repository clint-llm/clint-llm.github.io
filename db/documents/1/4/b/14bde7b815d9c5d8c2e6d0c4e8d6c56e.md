Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) is considered the standard of care during many procedures, including spinal, intracranial, and vascular surgeries, where there is a risk of neurological damage.

Enhancing communication between multidisciplinary teams increases the safety, quality, efficacy, and efficiency of perioperative care by decreasing adverse events and improving perioperative outcomes.

Continuous IONM is a helpful real-time adjunct to detect malpositioning related nerve injury and anesthesia-related signal changes. The anesthesiology team relies on the IONM team to identify physiological deterioration. It allows the anesthesiology team to adjust their anesthetic dosing to provide a condition that supports neurophysiological monitoring.
