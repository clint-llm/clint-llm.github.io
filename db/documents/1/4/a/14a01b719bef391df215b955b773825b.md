The family history of cancer, young age at initial diagnosis, and multiple malignancies suggest cancer syndromes that are hereditary. Patients should be informed adequately about all the signs and symptoms of cancer. They must be counseled to consult whenever they have any unusual signs or symptoms related to cancer. A complete family history of multiple generations is very important due to a significant increase in cancer risk within families.

No specific physical findings are seen in individuals affected by Li-Fraumeni syndrome that differ from the findings related to specific cancers. Physical findings to watch for in specific cancers include:

- Neurologic features like seizures, vomiting, headaches, and gait changes related to brain cancers

- A breast lump in breast cancer

- Soft-tissue mass or a bone-related mass in soft tissue sarcoma or bone sarcoma

- Pancytopenia, fatigue, fever, weight loss, loss of appetite, swollen lymph nodes, bleeding gums, and infections in acute leukemia

- Virilization including prepubertal genital hair, increased penile size, clitoromegaly, deep voice associated with an abdominal mass in adrenal cortical carcinoma

An annual physical examination should be performed, including breast, skin, and neurological assessments.
