The common adverse effect of rufinamide includes somnolence, vomiting, headache, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, and rarely, flu-like symptoms, nasopharyngitis, rash, ataxia, and diplopia.

Four less common but potentially significant adverse effects related to rufinamide are shortening QT interval, multi-organ hypersensitivity/drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), leukopenia, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

The QT interval shortening below 300 was not observed in the studies with doses up to 7200 mg per day. There was no sign of drug-induced sudden death or ventricular arrhythmias with rufinamide. However, in patients with a history of familial short QT syndrome, rufinamide was associated with an increased risk of sudden death and ventricular arrhythmia/fibrillation. Such events tend to occur when the QT interval falls below 300 msec. Therefore, caution is also necessary with the concomitant use of rufinamide with other potential drugs that shorten the QT interval.

In the clinical trials, DRESS is most commonly seen in children less than 12 years of age; it occurred within four weeks of rufinamide initiation and resolved or improved with discontinuation of the drug. Therefore, if there is an index of suspicion of DRESS, the patient shouldÂ undergo evaluation, and rufinamide should be discontinued and alternative treatment initiated.
