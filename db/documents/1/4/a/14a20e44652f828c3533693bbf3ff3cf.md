The majority of infants present at birth with severe weakness and wasting of the limbs. These infants have difficulty with swallowing and respiratory muscles. Other brain stem muscles also become involved, including the bulbar muscles. The distinctive feature of Werdnig-Hoffmann disease is that these individuals do not have any evidence of cerebral or higher central nervous system dysfunction. They have normal intelligence and demonstrate a keen sense of learning. Hypotonia is a very profound and classical finding. Deep tendon reflexes are absent diffusely. Hypermobility of the joints is noted secondary to poor muscle tone. The twitching of muscles of the tongue (fasciculations) is noted. Tongue fasciculations are classical findings seen in motor neuron diseases and are also seen in other motor neuron diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, etc. The child does not gain head control and is unable to sit, stand, or walk. They often have difficulties with swallowing and breathing. They have a poor sucking reflex. They have a high risk of aspiration pneumonia due to weak bulbar muscles. For infants in whom the symptoms develop after birth, motor regression occurs, and there appears to be greater involvement of lower extremities than upper extremities. Muscles controlling extraocular movements are generally spared.
