Nintedanib therapy is available in soft capsules with 100 mg and 150 mg dosages.

The manufacturer's recommendation is for the capsule to be taken whole with food and fluids. Chewing, crushing, or splitting the capsules can cause a bitter taste. The typical recommended dosage is 150 mg twice daily.

In cases of mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A), low body mass index (BMI), or persistent gastrointestinal side effects, a dose reduction to 100 mg twice daily is recommended.

The drug should be kept tightly closed in the same container it came in and out of reach from children. Nintedanib should be stored at room temperature, away from moisture and excessive heat. Disposal of nintedanib should be done safely, ensuring that children, pets, or other people do not have access to the disposed-of capsules. The best way of drug disposal is through a medication take-back program at a local pharmacy.

Precaution should be taken when nintedanib is co-administered with medications metabolized by CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein enzymes due to altered bioavailability and metabolism.
