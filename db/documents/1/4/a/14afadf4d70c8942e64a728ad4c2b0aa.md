Bisphosphonates define a class of drugs widely indicated since the 1990s to treat osteoporosis both in men and women. Their effectiveness in treating osteoporosis and other conditions is related to their ability to inhibit bone resorption. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the treatment of patients using bisphosphonate drugs.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the mechanism of action of bisphosphonates.
- Identify the approved indications for bisphosphonate therapy.
- Review the potential adverse events for bisphosphonate drugs.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients using bisphosphonate therapy for indicated conditions.
