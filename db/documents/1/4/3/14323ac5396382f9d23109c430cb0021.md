The brachial artery ranks as the most commonly injured upper extremity artery and accounts for 28% of all vascular injuries.

If the brachial artery is injured distal to the origin of the profunda brachii artery at the lower border of the teres major muscle, the profunda brachii artery will serve as the primary source of collateral circulation to the distal extremity.
