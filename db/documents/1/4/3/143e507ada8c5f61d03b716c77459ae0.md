Ketorolac is contraindicated in individuals who have adverse reactions or are allergic to NSAIDs. It is not recommended to be given intraoperatively or preoperatively due to the increased risk for bleeding. It is not recommended during labor and delivery, as it negatively affects fetal circulation and decreases uterine contraction.
