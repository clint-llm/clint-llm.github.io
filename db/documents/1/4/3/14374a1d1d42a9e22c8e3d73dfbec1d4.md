Teeth are formed from mesenchyme derived from the neural crest and surface ectoderm. The steps involved in the embryogenesis of teeth are complex, with the main components of this multi-step process including

- Formation of the dental placode

- Formation of the dental buds

- Formation of the dental papilla

- Formation of the enamel knot

- Transition to the cap stage in tooth morphogenesis

- Formation of enamel and dentin

- Tooth eruption upon the formation of the crown
