Dopaminergic agonists have been used for the treatment of parkinsonism. They can be categorized into ergot-derived and non-ergot-derived medicines. The focus of this review is pramipexole, a non-ergot-derived dopaminergic agonist used broadly in the treatment of Parkinson disease (PD) and restless leg syndrome (RLS). The FDA approved pramipexole for the treatment of PD in 1997 as a monotherapy or add-on drug to other first-line agents.

Two years later, the first randomized control trial was conducted on pramipexole to explore its efficacy in treating RLS. After several studies, the FDA approved pramipexole for RLS treatment in 2006, shortly after it approved ropinirole in 2005.

Apart from the FDA-approved indications, studies have shown that pramipexole has been effective in treating bipolar depression and treatment-resistant depression.

Pramipexole’s role has also been discovered in patients chronically treated with morphine. A very recent study suggested that it can effectively reduce tolerance to morphine and shorten the duration of its withdrawal symptoms. This result led to the conclusion that pramipexole could restore the analgesic effects of morphine in a patient once they weaned off it.
