The incidence of congenital heart diseases is decreasing day by day because of the avoidance of known teratogens and risk factors by the patients through their education and counseling. The incidence of pulmonary atresia is also falling down. The prevalence of pulmonary atresia in the years 1999 to 2000 was 12.1% of all congenital heart diseases, which gradually went down to 9.6% in 2008 (p=0.01).
