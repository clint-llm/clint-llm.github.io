Surgery for isolated seminal vesicle disease is rare but is an option in cases of cysts, stones, neoplasms, or chronic infection. Increasingly, clinicians offer such surgery via minimally invasive techniques such as endoscopic, laparoscopic, or robotic approaches.

Radical prostatectomy typically includes excision of the seminal vesicles, "en bloc," along with the prostate. However, their proximity to the inferior hypogastric plexus has led some to consider the preservation of the seminal vesicles in a bid to improve the recovery of urinary and sexual function post-operatively. The evidence so far suggests, although oncologically safe, there is no difference in the recovery of function compared to more standard methods of nerve-sparing technique.

Major sympathetic efferent fibers to the seminal vesicle and vas deferens originate from the hypogastric nerve, which forms the lower end of the sympathetic chain. This region is at risk during major retroperitoneal surgery, such as retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, and damage can fail emission, also known as anejaculation.
