Alkaptonuria is a rare metabolic disorder. Thus, patients and thoseÂ caring for them should be educated on the disease process and progression to make educated decisions regarding their condition. Individuals with a positive family history can be offered further testing and family planning services. Testing includes biochemical evaluation for elevated urinary HGA levels and molecular genetic evaluation that tests for HGD mutations.
