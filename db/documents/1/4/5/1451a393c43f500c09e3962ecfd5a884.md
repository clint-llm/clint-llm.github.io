Symptoms of pulmonary hypertension significantly overlap with the underlying disease. For group 3 PH, it mimics the clinical manifestations of other groups except for clinical history of chronic lung disease and hypoxia during the day or nighttime. Although unexplained dyspnea is a ubiquitous presentation, in a recent survey of experts, it was not found to be very specific. Instead, the expert panel identified syncope, dizziness, and palpitations as highly predictive of PH.

Physical exam findings are not specific and cannot accurately predict the disease's progression. Poor oxygen saturation, jugular venous distension, peripheral edema, ascites, altered heart sounds (especially loud P2 or S2), right ventricular heave, and right-sided heart failure signs such as hepatomegaly are helpful but present later in the disease process.
