A number of treatments have been tried, ranging from reassurance to conservative splint placements to surgically corrective procedures. Although somewhat controversial, there is some consensus in the literature that in the absence of large articular surface disruption or subluxation, non-operative treatment with the placement of a splint is favorable for both soft tissue and bony mallet

**Conservative options**include Stack splint, thermoplastic splint, or aluminum foam splint, all to achieve the same principle which is an extension or slight hyperextension at the DIP joint

**Indications for surgical intervention:**

- Open injuries.

- Bony mallet with a large fragment and subluxation of the DIP joint.

- Unstable fractures (30–50 % of the joint surface involved).

- Intolerance to splints.

- Chronic injuries (older than 12 weeks).

- Painful arthritic DIPJ.

- Swan neck deformity.

**Surgical techniques include but are not limited to:**

- Closed reduction with percutaneous pinning (CRPP) e.g. Kirschner wiring and extension block wiring

- Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) e.g small screws

- External fixation

- surgical reconstruction of the terminal tendon

- Swan neck deformity correction.

- Trans-articular Kirschner wire at the DIP joint and/or conjoint tendon advancement.

- DIPJ arthrodesis for painful arthritic DIP joint.

**A chronic mallet finger**is an injury that is more than 4 weeks old
