Mortality associated with refractory hypoxemia is significantly high. In general, patients with severe hypoxemia, even after all the rescue therapies other than ECMO carries an overall risk of mortality near 90%. With ECMO support, the chance of survival increases to 40% to 93%, depending on the patient's diagnosis. CESAR trial compared standard conventional ventilation therapy versus ECMO in patients with severe hypoxemia and showed patients in the ECMO group had a higher survival rate of 63% vs. 47% in the conventional group.
