Right heart catheterization appears to be generally performed in patients with cardiac and pulmonary disorders. These patients receive multi-disciplinary care from their primary care physicians, pulmonary physicians, and cardiologists. There must be recognition of conditions that could be appropriately diagnosed or excluded by right heart catheterization. Also, the optimal performance of these procedures relies on the entire team performing the procedure, including the nurse, the cardiovascular technologists, to ensure safety against potential risks and complications of the procedure. Identifying potential issues with the fluid-filled transducer system and recognizing abnormal waveforms due to technical issues are critical to performing the right heart catheterization. The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions has developed best practice guidelines for cardiac catheterization procedures, which help adhere to national and international standards.
