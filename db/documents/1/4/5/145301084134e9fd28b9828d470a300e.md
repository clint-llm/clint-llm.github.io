There is little information regarding absolute contraindications for kratom use; however, there is a risk of possible pharmacologic interactions for patients who ingest it. Mitragynine, a substrate of kratom, appears to inhibit glucuronidation by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT).

Also, patients with liver, neurologic, pulmonary, renal, or cardiac disease should avoid this substance as there have been multiple case studies showing that kratom can potentially cause injury to these organ systems.
