Localization studies are critical to the performance of a minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP). If these studies have not been completed or are equivocal or discordant, a MIP should not be attempted. Traditional, bilateral exploration rather than minimally invasive thyroidectomy is recommended in cases of familial hyperparathyroidism (such as the MEN syndromes) as these tend to be caused by 4-gland hyperplasia rather than a single adenoma. Suspected or known cases of parathyroid carcinoma or concomitant thyroid disease are also contraindications for a MIP, and these patients should undergo radical resection instead. Finally, a history of previous neck irradiation is an absolute contraindication for MIP. It should be noted that previous neck surgery does not exclude a MIP, as it is a relative contraindication rather than absolute.
