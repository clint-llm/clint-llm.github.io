The term Retinitis Pigmentosa encompasses a group of hereditary retinopathies that result in progressive vision loss. This activity will cover the underlying pathophysiology which produces dysfunction in the retina, as well as appropriate diagnostic measures, including an adequate physical exam and appropriate referral for expert evaluation. While there is as yet no cure, research is ongoing. We will examine the need for appropriate education for patients and their families to keep RP patients abreast of potential treatments as they emerge. The importance of an interprofessional approach to evaluation and education is also discussed.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the classic history for the onset and progression of vision loss with retinitis pigmentosa.
- Explain the final common pathway of multiple biochemical dysfunctions in the retina, which ultimately causes vision loss in retinitis pigmentosa.
- Identify the "classic triad" of findings on direct fundoscopic examination which correspond with retinitis pigmentosa.
- Summarize the importance of the interprofessional team in managing the needs of retinitis pigmentosa patients, including diagnosis, genetic counseling, education regarding expectations, and possibilities for future treatment options, and mental health support.
