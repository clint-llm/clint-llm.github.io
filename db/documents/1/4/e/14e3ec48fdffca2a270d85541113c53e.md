The two most important differential diagnoses to rule out include those that share zoonotic-exposure history to farm animals and exhibit cutaneous lesions.

Paravaccinia (Milker’s nodules) is a very similar parapoxvirus infection – just arising from cows rather than goats/sheep as in orf disease. Clinically they are indistinguishable and resolve spontaneously within six weeks or so.

Cutaneous anthrax is a bacterial infection from Bacillus anthracis. An eventual “black eschar” evolution is pathognomonic for this lesion. The more infamous pulmonary symptoms can develop in the systemic spread and can be life-threatening. Spores are transmittable from infected animals, wool, and even meat. Gram stain, culture, and even PCR are all available to aid in diagnosis.
