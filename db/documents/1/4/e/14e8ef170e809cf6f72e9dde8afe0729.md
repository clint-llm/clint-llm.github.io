In addition to history and mental status examination, laboratory testing to rule out other medical causes of cognitive deficits such as HIV, syphilis, vitamin B12, and folate deficiency, and paraneoplastic syndromes, etc., should be ordered.

Neuropsychological tests— Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), Wechsler Memory scale (WMS), clock drawing test, and Trail Making test are commonly used.

Neuroimaging studies— Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) are ordered to look for particular brain abnormalities seen in dementia.

Rating Scales— The most commonly used scale for screening depression in dementia is the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD). The CSDD is a 19-item instrument assimilating data from both patient and caretaker. It evaluates mood-related signs (Anxiety, sadness, anhedonia, irritability), behavioral disturbance (Agitation, retardation loss of interest), physical signs (Appetite and weight loss), cyclic functions (diurnal variation in symptoms), and ideational disturbance (Suicide, poor self-esteem, etc.). Scores greater than ten are associated with a probable diagnosis of a major depressive episode. Scores of more than 18 indicate a definite major depressive disorder.
