This review is intended to serve as a general presentation of sexually transmitted diseases, including the most common infections such as human immunodeficiency virus, gonorrhea, chlamydia, genital herpes, human papillomavirus, trichomoniasis, and syphilis. Sexually transmitted infections can be bacterial, viral, or parasites, transmitted through sexual activity with the exchange of bodily fluids from the infected partner. STIs invade the human body through microscopic abrasions within the mucosal membranes of the penis, vagina, anus, or any other mucosal surfaces. Transmission of STIs can include using intravenous drugs, exposure through the vagina during childbirth, or breastfeeding.

Basic symptomatology, including genital, extragenital, or disseminated, with the use of a history and physical exam to assist with differential diagnosis and recommended treatments, will be reviewed. Updated treatment guidelines by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) will be presented as well as a general overview of all common sexually transmitted infections.

Physicians and other healthcare professionals must understand curable versus incurable sexually transmitted infections. Untreated STIs can lead to severe, lifelong health disorders, including infertility, scarring, chronic pain, sexual dysfunction, HIV, and cancer.
