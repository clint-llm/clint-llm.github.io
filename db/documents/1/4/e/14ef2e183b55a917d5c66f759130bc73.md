Fine motor disability has numerous causes and can affect any individual at any age. Interprofessional teamwork is, therefore, key to assessing, investigating, and treating the numerous causes of fine motor disability. Dependent on the presenting history and age of the patient, potential team members include neurologists, radiologists, radiographers, nurses, primary care clinicians, pharmacists, neurosurgeons, psychologists, pediatricians, occupational therapists, and physiotherapists. Experts in the major causes of fine motor disability such as stroke and Parkinson's disease, recommend the coordinated clinical approach ofÂ interprofessional teams as a way of improving patient safety and outcomes.
