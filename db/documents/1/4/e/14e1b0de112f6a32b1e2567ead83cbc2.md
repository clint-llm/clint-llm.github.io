The diagnosis of ALL/LBL is based on clinical, morphologic, immunophenotyping, and molecular features. Workup for ALL cases usually includes a complete blood count (CBC) with smear evaluation, PT, PTT, comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), baseline viral titers for cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, and varicella-zoster virus. Peripheral blood smear may show lymphoblasts, especially in ALL cases. Bone marrow involvement with more than 20% blasts is diagnostic and necessary for diagnosis and future follow-up. The lymphoblasts vary in size from small-medium and show scant cytoplasm, condensed nuclear chromatin, and indistinct nucleoli. It is crucial not to misinterpret hematogones with lymphoblasts. Some cases may need a flow-cytometry assessment to confirm the preliminary findings. In B-LBL, lymphoblasts may show a diffuse or a paracortical pattern of the lymph node.

The differentiation of B and T lymphoblasts cannot be done based on morphology and is usually rendered based on immunostaining and immunophenotyping. The use of cytochemical staining has significantly decreased as compared to immunostaining. Lymphoblasts can be differentiated from myeloblasts utilizing cytochemical staining. Lymphoblasts are negative on myeloperoxidase and Sudan black stain. Lymphoblasts may show periodic acid-Schiff positivity. Lymphoblasts in B-ALL/LBL are positive for CD19, cytoplasmic CD79a, cytoplasmic CD22, TdT, HLA-DR, PAX5, and CD10; and negative for CD117, T-cell markers, CD15, CD30, myeloid markers (CD13/CD33), CK, S100, and neuroendocrine markers. On tissue sections, CD79a and PAX5 are useful in differentiating B- from T-cell lineage. Immunophenotyping has become a crucial test for diagnosis and follow-up of ALL/LBL patients. For B-cell ALL/LBL, the degree of differentiation can be assessed utilizing a combination of B-cell lineage markers. Early precursor B-ALL or pro-B-ALL express CD19, cytoplasmic C079a, cytoplasmic CD22, and nuclear TdT. The second stage, also called common-ALL, the blasts express CD10. The third stage referred to as mature precursor or pre-B-ALL, the blasts express cytoplasmic mu chains (c-u). Research has demonstrated that mature B-cell ALL has a different biology and a poorer overall prognosis when compared to precursor B-ALL. Molecular studies are essential for diagnosis, prognosis, classification, and treatment. Cytogenetic abnormalities are used to classify B-ALL/LBL into separate entities. Most cases of B-ALL have clonal DJ rearrangements of the IGH gene

Approaches to genetic testing in ALL depend on the national guidelines and are largely based on WHO guidelines and recommendations. In the majority of western and developed countries upfront, broad-based testing is implied. This approach is rapid but is more expensive. A stepwise diagnostic algorithm is implemented in some countries and some hospitals in the United States and offers the advantage of overall cost savings at the expense of potentially longer turn-around times. Finally, a tailored genetic approach has also been proposed and implemented in some health care facilities in the United States. The approach implements genetic testing based on the patient's NCI risk.

T-ALL/LBL can only be differentiated from B-ALL/LBL based on IHC and/or flow cytometry. However, some morphological features are common in T-ALL/LBL, for example, increased mitotic index and capsular involvement of the lymph node. Lymphoblasts in T-ALL/LBL are positive for CD3 , CD99, TdT, CD7 and variable expression of other T cell markers (CD1a, CD2, CD4, CD5, CD8), CD34, CD10, CD4/CD8; and negative for CD19, CD20, HLA-DR, surface immunoglobulin, CD22, CD25. Stages of intrathymic differentiation in T-ALL/LBL is based on the cells immunophenotype and is as follows:

- Pro-T: cCD3+, CD7+, CD2-, CD1a-, CD34+/-, double negative CD4 / CD8

- Pre-T: cCD3+, CD7+, CD2+, CD1a-, CD34+/-, double negative CD4 / CD8

- Cortical T: cCD3+, CD7+, CD2+, CD1a+, CD34-, double positive CD4 / CD8

- Medullary T: cCD3+, CD7+, CD2+, CD1a-, CD34-, surface CD3+, either CD4+ or CD8+

Genetics studies for T-ALL/LBL show clonal TCR gene rearrangements and abnormal karyotypes in the majority of cases, most commonly involving 14q11.2 (a/d TCR loci), 7q35 (beta) and 7p14-15.
