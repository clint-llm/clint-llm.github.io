The characteristic ECG findings for right bundle branch block are as follows:

- QRS duration is greater than or equal to 120 milliseconds

- In lead V1 and V2, there is an RSR` in leads V1 and V2

- In Leads 1 and V6, the S wave is of greater duration than the R wave, or the S wave is greater than 40 milliseconds

- In Leads V5 and V6, there is a normal R wave peak time

- In Lead V1, the R wave peak time is greater than 50 milliseconds

T waves tend to be discordant to the terminal QRS vector. This results in inverted T waves in the right precordial leads and upright T waves in the left precordial leads.
