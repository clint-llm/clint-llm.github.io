Patients with pars planitis present with minimal symptoms, for example, floaters or blurry vision. In most cases, there is the absence of photophobia and pain. Occasionally patients may present with sudden loss of vision due to retinal detachment or acute vitreous hemorrhage.

Clinical signs of anterior segment inflammation may be present, mild anterior chamber cells. A characteristic sign of pars planitis is vitreous cell infiltration, ranging from 1+ to 4+. Sometimes the cellular infiltration is so dense that it may obscure the view of the retina. Snowballs, are the yellowish, white vitreal aggregate hallmark and are found in the inferior periphery. Peripheral vasculitis may be seen in 10% to 32% of patients. This may present as venous sheathing which may lead to occlusion and occasionally retinal neovascularization. Cystoid macular edema may be present and is the usual cause of visual decline. There may be complicated cataract (posterior subcapsular cataract).

During the acute phase, white exudates are present, in the later stage, there is collagen production which results in snowbank formation. Snowbanks are mostly located inferiorly, but occasionally they may encompass the entire peripheral retina.
