There are very limited studies describing the trends and prevalence of precocious puberty. The first epidemiologic study from a Danish national registry estimated that 0.2 % of females had some form of precocious puberty (CPP, PPP or benign variants) while it was less than 0.05% in males. There was female predominance about 20 to 23 per 10000 girls compared to boys, which were less than 5 per 10000 boys.
