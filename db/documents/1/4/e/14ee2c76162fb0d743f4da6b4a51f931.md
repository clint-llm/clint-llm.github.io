Barbiturates are a class of sedative-hypnotic drugs. They are commonly used as antiepileptics (phenobarbital) and for the induction of general anesthesia (thiopental). This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of barbiturate toxicity and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of barbiturate toxicity.
- Review the symptoms of withdrawal in the physical examination of patients with barbiturate toxicity.
- Explain the use of immunoassays (EIA) in the detection of the drug in patients with barbiturate toxicity.
- Describe the importance of the interprofessional team in educating patients to prevent further cases of barbiturate toxicity.
