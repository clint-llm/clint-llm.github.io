Breast cancer diagnosis and treatment use a multidisciplinary team's multimodality imaging approach to provide thorough evaluation and staging. Breast cancer detection begins with skilled mammography technicians and physician radiologists trained under Mammographic Quality Standard Act (MQSA) program guidelines to acquire and interpret screening mammography.

While imaging may be the center of breast cancer detection and staging, fluent conversation with the institution's breast surgeons and radiation oncologists is crucial in providing complete patient care and appropriate imaging workup. Collaborative multidisciplinary tumor boards allow for discussion with all treatment team members, ensuring up-to-date workup and oncologic and surgical management ofÂ breast cancer patients, including the appropriate use of PET/CT.
