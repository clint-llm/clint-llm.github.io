Autoimmune neutropenia (AIN) and chronic idiopathic neutropenia (CIN) are multifactorial in etiology. Basically, in children, the primary form is seen, and in adults, the secondary form is seen. Primary form in children is mild and resolves after a few years of life in the majority, while in adults, it represents a chronic entity. The history of the following is seen in both:

- Recurrent respiratory infections in childrenÂ that are usually minor and upper

- Opportunistic infections

- Rare serious invasive infections mostly in young infants

- Recurrent use of antibiotics and antifungal agents and developing resistance

In AIN and CIN, the physical examination findings are:

- Delayed separation of the umbilical cord in LAD patients

- Gingivitis

- Skin infections

- Bacteremia

- Septicemia

- Lung abscess

- Pneumatocele

- Sinus infections

- Pneumonia

- Osteomyelitis

- Arthritis

- Fever

- Cough

- Malaise

- Recurrent abscess

- Stomatitis

- Cutaneous infections (e.g., Staphylococci)

- Splenomegaly

- Poor wound healing

- Omphalitis

- Bleeding complications

- Granuloma

- Urinary tract infections

- Meningitis

- Denture abnormalities

- Otitis media

- Graft versus host reaction
