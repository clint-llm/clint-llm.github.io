History frequently includes a report of significant weight loss associated with the lack of appetite. Also, there is a reduction of quality of life associated with increased fatigue and poor tolerance to activity. In advanced cancer patients, cachexia is correlated with increased severity of multiple symptoms. These include lack of appetite, dry mouth, vomiting, dysgeusia, early satiety, and diarrhea. It also increases the severity of less intuitive symptoms such as pain, fatigue, and loss of energy, sleep disturbances, and anxiety. This excess symptom burden is independent of age, tumor stage, and treatment type. Diagnostic criteria for cachexia are a 5% weight loss in 12 months or a body mass index of less than 20 kg/m2 in the presence of a known chronic disease with at least 3 of the following factors:

- Loss of muscle mass,

- Asthenia

- Loss of body fat, in the presence of inflammation as evidenced by albumen less than 3.2 g/dL or increased Câ€“reactive protein.

The physical exam is nonspecific. Exam findings may be normal early in the course of the disease. Other findings might include bitemporal muscle wasting, supraclavicular wasting, and general lack of muscle definition.
