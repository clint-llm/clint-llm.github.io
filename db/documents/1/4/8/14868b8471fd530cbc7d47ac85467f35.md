NODAT is more common in Black and Hispanic patients compared to Whites, which might be because of genetic polymorphisms among Black and Hispanic transplant recipients. NODAT incidence in the United States has been reported to be about 9.1% of patients at 3 months, 16% at 12 months, and 24% at 36 months post-transplantation. Also, NODAT has been estimated to occur in about 4 to 25% of renal transplants, 2.5 to 25% of liver transplants, 4 to 40% of heart transplants, and 30 to 35% of lung transplant recipients. The risk of NODAT increases in liver transplants if the patient has an HCV infection and can range between 40% and 60%**.**Some studies report the range of NODAT to be from 7 to 30% in the first year after kidney transplantation. Also, the majority of organ recipients (about 76.5%) develop NODAT in the first 3 months. After 6 months, the incidence of DM is almost the same as the patients with no transplant. Using higher doses of immunosuppressive medications after transplant correlates with a higher incidence of NODAT.
