Smallpox is widely regarded as one of the most destructive diseases since antiquity, and because of its distinctive symptoms and rash, it was recognized and documented by almost every culture in the old world. As a poxvirus, it was incredibly stable, hardy, and contagious, with an infectivity rate in non-vaccinated persons exceeding 85 percent.

Early attempts at antigenic immunogenicity were recognized and employed since the fourth century in China and India with inoculation of milder variants (variola minor etc.), but it was not until the isolation of variola vaccinia (cowpox) by Edward Jenner in 1786 did an established “vaccine” come into the picture. The strong antigenic stimulus of vaccinia, lack of non-human reservoirs, and slow mutation rate led to its official extinction in 1980.

Molluscum contagiosum is a common dermatological disease in children with genital lesions generally considered sexually transmitted in adults. In immunocompromised individuals, It can present with a very extensive debilitating, dermatological disease.

Other poxviruses have established some level of host-range in humans, such as monkeypox and orf virus, with demonstrated human to human spread, but others are largely considered zoological diseases, with low infectivity and isolated occurrence.
