Abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture (rAAA) represents a true catastrophic emergency and if not recognized and appropriately treated, carries significant morbidity and mortality, with untreated mortality approaching 100%. Although many patients are identified as having abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) (abdominal aortic diameter greater than 3 cm) that are preemptively repaired, thereby decreasing mortality, as many as 50% of patients with aortic aneurysms have an aneurysm rupture as their primary presentation. Mortality estimates for patients with ruptured aortic aneurysms are difficult to calculate, but acute mortality has been reported as high as 90% in historical reports and as high as 75% with current surgical modalities.

Abdominal aortic aneurysms are commonly found in men aged 65-85 years. These aneurysms are usually asymptomatic until they rupture which is a catastrophic complication. There are several causes of aneurysm dilatation such as direct trauma, chronic infections, acute infections, inflammatory. Atherosclerotic aortic wall damage has been considered major risk factor associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm. This conventional view in recent times has been challenged.
