The reports of variants of the medial pectoral nerve are scanty because they are less frequent than, for example, the variants of the lateral pectoral nerve. It is most likely to arise from the medial cord, but sometimes it can arise from the anterior division of the lower trunk, and less frequently, the medial pectoral nerve can arise directly from the trunk of the brachial plexus. There are reports of the medial pectoral nerve originating from the C6 root and the anterior division of the middle trunk, but origin directly from the middle trunk of the brachial plexus has not been reported until now.
