Prolonged INR greater than or equal to 1.5, often elevated bilirubin and aminotransferases, thrombocytopenia, with anemia, hypoglycemia, elevated ammonia and features of acute renal injury (with elevated serum creatinine), and dyselectrolytemia (hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia) is common.

Imaging of the abdomen, pelvis, brain, and chest should be considered. Abdominal imaging to determine the presence of cirrhosis, features of portal hypertension, hepatocellular carcinoma, vascular thrombosis, lymph nodes, and spleen is vital. Abdominal sonogram with Doppler could be considered in patients with concomitant renal injury and vascular thrombosis. Brain imaging (CT or an MRI) is helpful to rule out organic etiology of altered mental status while chest imaging will help rule out pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
