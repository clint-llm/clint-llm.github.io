Diagnostic imaging of clear cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix contributes to therapeutic management, surgical planning, and the prediction of prognosis.

**Magnetic Resonance Imaging**

MRI findings tend to be hypointensity on T1-weighted images, hyperintensity on T2-weighted images, and heterogeneous enhancement in the contrast-enhanced phase.

**F-18 FDG PET/CT**

According to some authors, F-18 FDG PET/CT can be valuable for evaluating clear cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix with metastatic lymphadenopathy in the pelvic cavity and retroperitoneum.

**Cytology**

Cytology has been found to be less efficient in diagnosing cervical adenocarcinomas.
