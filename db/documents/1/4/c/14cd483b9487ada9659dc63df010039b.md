As such, complications are associated with a delay in the diagnosis of the disease leading to extensive glomerular damage causing the progression of proteinuria into a nephrotic range followed by hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and clotting disorders due to loss of anti-thrombin III. A delay in the diagnosis and treatment can result in progression into rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with crescents. Furthermore, renal biopsy is related to post-procedural complications like bleeding, arterio-venous fistula, peri-renal soft tissue infection, and prolonged pain. Late diagnosis is also linked with progression into chronic renal disease (stage V) or end-stage renal disease with eGFR less than 15 ml/min requiring a patient to have lifelong hemodialysis sessions.
