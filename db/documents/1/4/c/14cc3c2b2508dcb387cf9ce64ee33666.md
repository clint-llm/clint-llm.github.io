Subtrochanteric fractures account for approximately 7% to 34% of femur fractures. They are sustained equally between males and females. Studies have shown that 7% of patients with atypical subtrochanteric femur fractures were exposed to the bisphosphonate alendronate. The reported one-year mortality of elderly patients with subtrochanteric femur fractures is 25%.
