All the suprahyoid muscles of the neck receive vascular supply from the branches of the external carotid artery. The anterior belly of the digastric muscle gets its blood supplied from the facial artery (submental branch) and the posterior belly by occipital artery and posterior auricular artery. Geniohyoid receives supply via the lingual artery branches. The mylohyoid's blood supply is from the facial artery (submental branch) and inferior alveolar artery (mylohyoid branch).

Lymphatics from the suprahyoid part of the neck drain into the submental and submandibular group of lymph nodes of the neck. Finally, these all drain into the deep cervical group of lymph nodes.
