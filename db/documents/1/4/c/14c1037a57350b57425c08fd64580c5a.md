The diagnosis and management of hypopituitarism are made with an interprofessional team that consists of a neurosurgeon, endocrinologist, pathologist, radiologist, primary care provider, nurse practitioner, and ophthalmologist. Nurses and pharmacists can also play key roles as part of the interprofessional healthcare team. Management is dependent on the cause of hypopituitarism. Initial treatment should address the underlying cause of hypopituitarism. Mass lesions may be removed surgically, and other medical conditions treated accordingly. Many patients may require hormone replacement therapy. The outcome in most patients with hypopituitarism is good, but those who have a neurological deficit may continue to have partial deficits even after treatment.
