Arthrocentesis is performed to identify the etiology or pain relief, injection of medications, or effusion drainage. To avoid complications, the clinician should be familiar with the anatomy. The risk of complications can be minimized by using an appropriate technique.

Crystal analysis is usually an important result of a successful knee aspiration. The clinician commonly differentiates gout (negatively birefringent urate crystals), pseudogout (weakly positive birefringent crystals), and an infectious process.

Synovial fluid associated with septic or infectious joint effusion is as follows:

- Total white blood cell count higher than 25,000/microliter (approximately 75% sensitive, 75% specific)

- Total white blood cell count higher than 50,000/microliter (approximately 60% sensitive, approximately 90% specific)

- Total white blood count higher than 100,000/microliter (approximately 20% sensitive, approximately 99% specific)

- PMN cell proportion 0.9 or higher (approximately 75% specific, 80% sensitive)

- Lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration higher than 250 U/L (approximately 100% sensitive, 50% specific)

- Synovial glucose or serum glucose concentration lower than 0.5 (approximately 50% sensitive, 85% specific)

- Protein concentration higher than 3 g/dL (approximately 50% sensitive, 50% specific).
