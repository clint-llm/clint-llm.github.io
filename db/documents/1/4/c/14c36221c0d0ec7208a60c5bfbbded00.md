Normal versus chronic adaptations to aerobic exercises occur as a natural response to acute bouts of aerobic exercise and prolonged periods of training. The cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems are the two main organ systems affected during aerobic exercise. This activity reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing individuals with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the differences in acute and chronic cardiovascular adaptations to aerobic exercise.
- Explain the differences in acute and chronic musculoskeletal adaptations to aerobic exercise.
- Describe the impact of aerobic exercise on cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes mellitus.
- Identify the overall goal of the interprofessional team to identify acute and chronic cardiovascular and musculoskeletal adaptations to aerobic exercise.
