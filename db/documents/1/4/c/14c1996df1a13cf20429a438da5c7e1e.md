In general, nerves provide cutaneous and motor function to the muscles, skin, and viscera of the body. In particular, cutaneous nerves communicate external stimuli (touch, pain, temperature, etc.) from the environment to the brain. The ICBN carries sensory information from nerve endings within the axilla, lateral chest, and medial aspect of the arm. In most cases, it originates from the second intercostal nerves via the lateral cutaneous branch, which exits at the second intercostal space, travels obliquely across the axillary region, and terminates at the posteromedial aspect of the arm. The ICBN is present in more than 98% of the human population, although the origin, course, and distribution may vary between individuals.
