Statin medications are used in the management and treatment of hypercholesteremia. They are known to be inhibitors of the hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase enzyme and lower total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglyceride concentrations while increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations. FDA-approved statins include atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, and pitavastatin.This activity describes the indications, actions, and contraindications for statins as a valuable agent in treating hypercholesteremia. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, dosing, and monitoring pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with hypocholesteremia.

**Objectives:**
- Identify indications for initiating statin therapy.
- Review contraindications for statin therapy.
- Explain common and uncommon adverse effects associated with statin therapy.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes and treatment efficacy for patients who might benefit from therapy with statin drugs.
