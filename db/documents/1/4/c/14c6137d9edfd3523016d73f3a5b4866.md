The medial meniscus is a crescent-shaped, cartilaginous band between the medial tibial and medial femoral condyle. The primary function of the medial meniscus is to decrease the amount of stress on the knee joint.

The medial meniscus receives vascular supply via a capillary network formed by the medial, lateral, and middle geniculate arteries. It receives innervation from the posterior tibial, obturator, and femoral nerves. Discoid and ring-shaped variants of the medial meniscus have been discovered but are uncommon.

Acute medial meniscus tears are common injuries in athletes, and chronic, degenerative tears are common with increasing age. Multiple variables determine the management strategy of such injuries, including age, mechanism of injury, type of tear, symptoms,Â and individual goals. Surgical repair or meniscectomy is often the treatment. New developments in medial meniscus transplants are promising innovations for individuals suffering from medial meniscus injuries.
