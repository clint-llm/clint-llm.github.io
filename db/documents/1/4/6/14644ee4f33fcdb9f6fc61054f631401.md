The thyroid gland is responsible for the production of iodothyronines, of which there are three. The primary secretory product is inactive thyroxine, or T4, a prohormone of triiodothyronine, or T3. T4 is converted to T3 peripherally by type 1 deiodinase in tissues with high blood flow, such as the liver and kidneys. In the brain, T4 is converted to active T3 by type 2 deiodinase produced by glial cells. The third iodothyronine is called reverse T3, or rT3. rT3 is inactive and forms by type 3 deiodinase activity on T4.

These iodothyronines are composed of thyroglobulin and iodine. Thyroglobulin is formed from amino acids in a basal to apical fashion within the thyroid cells themselves. Thyroglobulin is then secreted into the follicular lumen, where it is enzymatically combined with iodine to form iodinated thyroglobulin. Endosomes containing this iodinated thyroglobulin then fuse with lysosomes, which enzymatically release the thyroglobulin from the resultant thyroid hormone. The thyroid hormones are next released from the cell while the remaining thyroglobulin is deiodinated and recycled for further use.
