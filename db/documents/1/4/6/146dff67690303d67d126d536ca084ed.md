The axillary artery commences from the subclavian artery at the outer border of the first rib and terminates when it becomes the brachial artery at the outer border of the teres major muscle. It is enclosed in the axillary sheath, a continuation of fascia from the prevertebral fascia of the neck, and is anatomically divided into three parts by the pectoralis minor muscle, providing a useful way to conceptualize its course. The first part (proximal to pectoralis minor) has one branch, the second part (beneath pectoralis minor) has two branches, and the third part (distal to pectoralis minor) has three branches.

A study of 59 cadavers found the average length of the axillary artery to be 11.22 cm, with each section occurring at roughly equal intervals alongÂ its course.

The first part of the axillary artery is defined as being between its commencement distal to the lateral border of the first rib and proximal to the pectoralis minor. It lies on top of the serratus anterior muscle. It has one branch called the superior thoracic artery, which supplies the pectoralis minor and pectoralis major muscles.

The second part of the axillary artery lies directly underneath the pectoralis minor. The first branch of the second part of the artery is the thoracoacromial trunk, which pierces the clavipectoral fascia and divides into four terminal arteries: the acromial artery, pectoral arteries, clavicular artery, and deltoid artery. The second branch of the second part of the axillary artery is the lateral thoracic artery, which follows the lower border of the pectoralis minor and provides blood to the pectoralis and serratus anterior muscles, as well as the mammary gland.

The third part of the axillary artery lies distal to the lower border of the pectoralis minor muscle, anterior to the subscapularis muscle, and teres major muscle.

It gives rise to the scapular circumflex artery and the thoracodorsal artery. The scapular circumflex artery runs through the triangular space and provides blood to the scapular region. The scapular circumflex artery eventually anastomoses with the suprascapular artery, thus connecting and providing a collateral route between the first and third parts of the axillary artery. The thoracodorsal artery supplies the latissimus dorsi muscle. The two remaining branches of the third part of the axillary artery, the anterior and posterior humeral circumflex artery, supply the head of the humerus and shoulder joint. These arteries anastomose with one another. The anterior humeral circumflex is smaller and runs anterior to the humerus. The posterior humeral circumflex is larger and runs through the quadrilateral space and then posterior to the humerus, accompanied by the axillary nerve and supplying the deltoid muscle.

The axillary artery terminates at the lower border of teres minor muscle, becoming the brachial artery which supplies the distal upper limb.
