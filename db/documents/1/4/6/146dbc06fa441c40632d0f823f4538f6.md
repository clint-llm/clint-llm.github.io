Causes of fibroadenoma are debatable, but professionals believe that the lesion has a hormonal etiology related to the increased sensitivity of breast tissue to the female reproductive hormone estrogen. Fibroadenoma usually grows during pregnancy and tends to shrink during menopause. This supports the hormonal etiologic theory. Females who take oral contraceptives before 20 years of age tend to suffer from fibroadenoma at higher rates than the general population.
