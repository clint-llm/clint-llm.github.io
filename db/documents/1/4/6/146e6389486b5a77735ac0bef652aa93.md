Femoral hernias present typically with a mass or bulge below the level of the inguinal ligament. Femoral hernias occur most commonly in women but lower incidence overall than inguinal hernias.

Incarceration or strangulation is common with a femoral hernia due to the small size of the hernia neck or orifice.

All patients with a femoral hernia should be considered for repair due to the high risk of complications associated with femoral hernias.

Surgical techniques for repair include open (standard Cooper’s ligament repair, preperitoneal approach) and minimally invasive (standard laparoscopic or robotic-assisted laparoscopic) techniques. Patient factors and surgeon preference and technical proficiency should factor into the method of repair.
