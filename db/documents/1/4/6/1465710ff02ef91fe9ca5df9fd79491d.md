In general, Vasodilators dilate or prevent constriction of the blood vessels, which allow greater blood flow to various organs in the body.

Below are the specific mechanisms of action for different classes of vasodilators:

**ACE Inhibitors:**Prevent the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor.

****Angiotensin Receptor Blockers**:**Prevent angiotensin II from binding to its receptor.

**Nitrates:**Increase the amount of NO in vascular smooth muscle cells, causing vasodilation. Nitrates dilate veins more than arteries and decrease preload.

**Calcium Channel Blockers:**Block calcium channels in the cardiac and smooth muscles, causing decreased muscle contractility and vasodilation. There are two classes of CCBs: Dihydropyridines (act on the vascular smooth muscle), and non-dihydropyridines (act on the heart).

**Minoxidil:**Directly relaxes arteriolar smooth muscle, with minimal effect on the vein. Cyclic AMP may mediate its effects.

**Hydralazine:**the exact mechanism is still unknown.

**Beta-Blockers:**Nebivolol and carvedilol are third-generation β-adrenoreceptor antagonists that have additional endothelium-dependent vasodilating properties.
