Cardiopulmonary resuscitation should not be interrupted for doing blood or radiological investigation. However, point of care testing, like blood glucose or serum potassium may be done if it doesn'tÂ interfere with cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts. Point of care ultrasound can also be used to evaluate the activity of the heart during cardiopulmonary resuscitation which has proved beneficial in many studies.
