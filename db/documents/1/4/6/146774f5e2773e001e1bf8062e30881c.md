Os peroneum is typically asymptomatic but can be fractured or displaced in the setting of a peroneus longus tendon tear, either from direct injury or indirectly from abrupt foot dorsiflexion or inversion.

Physical examination findings related to a peroneus longus tear include edema, tenderness, and weakness inÂ eversion and plantar flexion.
