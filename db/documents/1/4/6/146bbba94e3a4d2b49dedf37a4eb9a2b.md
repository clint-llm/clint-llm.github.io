Because SUNCT/SUNA can be secondary or symptomatic of underlying structural pathology, including pituitary, posterior fossa, or local lesions, a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with pituitary views and blood tests for pituitary function must be the minimal work-up for SUNCT/SUNA.

However, the diagnosis is mostly clinical and is defined by the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition by the following diagnostic criteria.

A) Have had a minimum of 20 headache episodes that fulfill the criteria below

B) Headache is at least of moderate-intensity in the orbital or temporal area on one side and lasts more than one second but less than 600 seconds.

C) Must have one of the below symptoms on the same side as the headache

1. Tearing and redness of the eyes 2. Stuffy nose or runny nose3. Eyelid swelling on the same side as the headache 4. Sweating of head and neck area 5. Redness of head and neck area 6. Ear fullness and discomfort 7. Droopy eyelid or pinpoint pupil

D) At least one attack per day when the disease is active

These headache attacks occur very frequently when the disease is active. SUNCT and SUNA tend to have some associations with seasons.
