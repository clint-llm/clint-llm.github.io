Marking of the stoma preoperatively by an entero-stomal therapist helps to place the stoma in an appropriate location away from the beltline and away from folds of skin on the anterior abdominal wall to prevent repeated colostomy bag peel-off and leak.

A nasogastric tube may be placed in the pre or intraoperative period for bowel decompression, and a Foley catheter must also be placed to keep the bladder empty to prevent intraoperative injury and also to monitor urine output, especially during emergency procedures.

Mechanical bowel preparation may or may not be done, depending on the indication and the surgeonâ€™s preference.

Antibiotics must be given just prior to the surgery.

For colostomy care preparation, a nurse or attendant is equipped with all the required equipment, including the appliance, the paste, and the scissors. A Macintosh sheet is placed under the patient, and gloves are worn.
