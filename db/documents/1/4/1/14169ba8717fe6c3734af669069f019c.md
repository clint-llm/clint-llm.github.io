Indomethacin is not a benign substance- as noted above, there are many potential side effects of the medication; according to the product labeling in specific scenarios, its use needs patient monitoring.

- If indomethacin is used in patients with a recent myocardial infarction, monitor patients for signs of cardiac ischemia (tachycardia, shortness of breath, sweating, fatigue, pain in neck/jaw/arm/shoulder).

- If the patient reports clinician signs of hepatotoxicity (nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, "flu-like" symptoms, eosinophilia, rash), obtain liver function tests. The enzyme elevation pattern is hepatocellular, but cholestatic and mixed patterns have also been noted.

- Monitor patients for changes in the signs/symptoms of asthma when used in patients with asthma and without known sensitivity to aspirin.

- Watch for signs and symptoms of bleeding and GI ulceration during indomethacin therapy.

- Monitor hemoglobin or hematocrit if a patient treated with indomethacin develops signs and symptoms of anemia.

- Serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and renal injury can occur without warning symptoms/signs. Therefore, consider monitoring the patient's CBC and a chemistry profile periodically if indomethacin is used long-term.

- Patients with coagulation disorders or concomitant use of warfarin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs),  and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are at increased risk of bleeding. Monitor these patients for signs of bleeding.

- Concurrent use of indomethacin with digoxin can increase digoxin's half-life and serum concentration. Monitor serum digoxin levels.
