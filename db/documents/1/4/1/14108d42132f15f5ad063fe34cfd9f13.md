Even though TXA only has a few approved usages, it is a well-researched drug and has many uses to help reduce blood loss. It has a low side effect profile and is safe to administer in most instances.

TXA is often a clinician-driven decision in the acute setting with hemorrhagic shock or expected MTP activation. Studies have shown that if administered within one hour of injury, it decreases the relative risk of death from bleeding by 32%, and if given within 1 to 3 hours after injury, by twenty-one percent.

If clinical indications exist to administer TXA, it is important to communicate with all interprofessional team members. Ensure the medical professional administering the drug know to give via a slow intravenous push over 10 minutes.

Clinicians should keep TXA in mind for patients that have religious concerns about blood transfusions. It is a possible option in the event of hemorrhage or before surgery, where blood loss is expected to be high.
