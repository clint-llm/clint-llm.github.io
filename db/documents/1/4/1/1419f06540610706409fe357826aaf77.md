Pathophysiology is dependent on the type of entropion seen. In general, the lower lid is stabilized from, the lower lid retractors,orbicularis, tarsus, and canthal tendons. The canthal tendons and tarsal plate horizontally stabilize the lid. The weakening of these structures, permits the inversion of the lid. The lower lid retractors stabilize vertically. In the upper lid, the levator aponeurosis and Mueller's muscle provide this role. The lower lid retractors connect to the orbicularis muscle and overlying skin. As these extensions weaken, the preseptal orbicularis can travel superior and override the pretarsal muscle causing the eyelid margin to rotate against the eye. Inversion of the lid margin is also thought to be due to tarsal atrophy with the loss of support from the verticle lid and orbital fat atrophy.

Involutional entropion is caused by horizontal laxity of the eyelid, attenuation or disinsertion of eyelid retractors, and overriding by the preseptal orbicularis oculi muscle. Acute spastic entropion is a condition that arises following ocular irritation or inflammation.  Sustained orbicularis oculi muscle overwhelms the oppositional action of the lower eyelid retractors causing inward rotation of the eyelid margin. A cycle of increasing frequency of spasm caused by corneal irritation perpetuates the problem, often only interrupted by intervention. Cicatricial entropion is caused by vertical tasoconjunctival contracture and internal rotation of the eyelid margin.
