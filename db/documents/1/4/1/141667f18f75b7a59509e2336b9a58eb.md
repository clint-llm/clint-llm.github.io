Granulosa theca cell tumors affect teenagers to the elderly and are most common in postmenopausal women with an average age of 45 to 55 years. The presenting symptoms are usually nonspecific with abdominal pain (41.1%), distension (26.4 percent), or a palpable abdominopelvic mass that is usually unilateral. About 70 percent of these tumors are hormonally active and the manifestations of hyperestrogenism depend on age and menstrual status. Postmenopausal bleeding is the usual presentation in older women while heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), irregular menstrual bleeding patterns, or amenorrhea can be seen in premenopausal women along with breast enlargement /tenderness. Rare adult GCTs can secrete androgens and result in virilization in young women aged 15 to 35 years and manifest with hirsutism, clitoromegaly, deepening of the voice, or amenorrhea.

High Inhibin levels may result in infertility due to inhibition of FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) secretion. Rarely these tumors can present during pregnancy. Complications like tumor rupture [seen in 10 percent] or torsion of the adnexal mass or intratumoral hemorrhage can present as a case of acute abdomen with hypotension. Some patients with thecoma have a Meigs-like syndrome, with ascites and hydrothorax.
