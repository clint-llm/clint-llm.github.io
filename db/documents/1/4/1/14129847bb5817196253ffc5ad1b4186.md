Differential diagnosis may be broad since signs and symptoms of Chagas disease are non-specific and may include dysfunction of multiple organ systems. During the acute phase, symptoms of fever and malaise can mimic many other febrile illnesses. Unilateral palpebral edema could be mistaken for periorbital cellulitis. A chagoma could be mistaken for another arthropod bite or other dermatologic conditions of localized inflammation.
