The management of cryptogenic cirrhosis, like all causes of cirrhosis, requires a team-based approach to have high-quality care. The coordination between primary care physicians, gastroenterologist, hepatologists, transplant hepatologists and surgeons, nutritionists, and social workers is vital to this care. An interprofessional, team-based approach to the care of a patient can help prevent many complications associated with cryptogenic cirrhosis and can potentially slow its progression if the specific etiology is targeted. For example, management of metabolic derangements in those with underlying NASH through lifestyle and diet modifications. Common complications of cryptogenic cirrhosis can include the need for a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), varices, ascites, SBP, hepatic encephalopathy. The management of these complications is much better when the care of the patient is coordinated between healthcare providers.
