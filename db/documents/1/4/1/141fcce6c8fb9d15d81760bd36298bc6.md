Ibuprofen is available as tablets with strengths ranging from 200 to 800 mg. It is well absorbed orally, with peak plasma concentrations reached in 1 to 2 hours. The onset of action after oral ingestion is 30 to 60 minutes for analgesia.

Symptoms from ibuprofen toxicity are unlikely at doses of less than 100 mg/kg in children.
