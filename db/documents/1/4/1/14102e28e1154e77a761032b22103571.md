Ophthalmomyiasis is a clinical condition wherein the larvae of different flies either inhabit the ocular surface or get inside the eye. This clinical condition arises out of the accidental encounters of flies carrying larvae and is more commonly reported amongst shepherds or those involved in animal husbandry. To avoid the morbidity and rarely mortality associated with this condition, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the clinical features and treatment of ophthalmomyiasis and highlights the role of early diagnosis to avoid its complications. A well-coordinated communication between the interprofessional team and the ophthalmologists helps treat the condition at the earliest opportunity.

**Objectives:**
- Review the risk factors of ophthalmomyiasis.
- Summarize the epidemiology and pathophysiology of the disease.
- Describe the common clinical presentations of ophthalmomyiasis, close differentials, and management.
- Outline the complications and the interprofessional teamâ€™s role in improving patient care in patients with ophthalmomyiasis.
