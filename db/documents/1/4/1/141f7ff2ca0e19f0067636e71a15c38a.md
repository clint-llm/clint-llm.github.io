The vast majority of studies done on CoQ10 in humans have only evaluated it as an oral supplement. There are tablets, capsules, soft gels, and liquid oral supplement formulations available in the markets.Â  Various oral formulations from 30 mg to 600 mg per unit dose are available over the counter. Topical over-the-counter preparations are also available, but studies on this route of administration are limited. One study investigated a topical preparation as a treatment for age-related skin oxidative damage.

- Supplementation with 50 mg twice daily has shown to decrease statin-related mild-to-moderate myalgias, resulting in an increased ability to perform daily activities.

- Supplementation with 300 mg daily for 24 weeks in men with Peyronie disease may decrease penile plaque size, reduce penile curvature, and improve erectile function.

- A double-blind, randomized controlled trial showed 300 mg daily to be safe and superior to a placebo for migraine prevention.
