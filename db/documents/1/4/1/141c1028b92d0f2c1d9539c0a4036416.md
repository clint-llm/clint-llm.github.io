Since the femoral head is highly vulnerable to avascular necrosis, it is often deemed easier to replace it with an artificial construct rather than to salvage what is left, especially in the elderly population. Total hip arthroplasty and hemiarthroplasty are both plausible options when avascular necrosis is of high certainty. Open reduction internal fixation can also be utilized with a femoral head fracture with headless compression screws as they do not alter the spherical shape of the femoral head. Small diameter drilling decompression can delay the need for arthroplasty
