A well-sealed root canal system provides the patient with the best possible treatment outcome. Ensuring an adequately filled root canal requires collaboration between dentists, endodontists, dental radiologists, and dental assistants. Dental nurses/assistants play a central role, as they are in charge of mixing and manipulating the sealers and core filling materials and handing them to the dentist. Root canal therapy is full of intricacies that require excellent interprofessional communication. This ensures that clinicians arrive at a proper diagnosis, generate clear imaging, and determine the best technique to perform the procedure, including which material to use to fill the root canal.
