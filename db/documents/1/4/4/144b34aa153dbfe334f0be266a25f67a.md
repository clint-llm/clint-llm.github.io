ONSM is usually localized in the intraorbital or intracanalicular portions of the optic nerve sheath and originates from theÂ cap cells of the arachnoid surrounding the nerve. The intraorbital portion is the most common site of origin (92%). About 95% of ONSM is unilateral. Rare bilateral tumors tend to occur in patients with neurofibromatosis type 2.

Most tumors do not have a clear etiology, but they probably have a genetic influence. Meningiomas in particular can have an association with ionizing radiation and hormonal influences, although, there is not a clear association in ONSM.
