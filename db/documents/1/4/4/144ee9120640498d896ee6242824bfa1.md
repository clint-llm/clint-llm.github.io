Rotator cuff-related pathologies lead to 4.5 million visits and 40,000 surgical procedures annually in the United States alone. The rate of rotator cuff pathology is estimated to affect 16 to 34% of people, with incidence increasing with age. Causes of rotator cuff-related pain include acute and chronic injury patterns, including trauma, repetitive activity, impingement, and degeneration. When investigating rotator cuff pathologies, an MRI is the imaging modality of choice. The muscle group is best demonstrated on a sagittal oblique T1 weighted section.

On physical exam, if there are signs of atrophy of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles, there is usually an associated compression of the suprascapular nerve near the scapular notch. This compression can be seen in overhead throwing motion athletes such as swimmers or baseball players and superior labrum anterior and posterior (SLAP) tears. If there is isolated weakness or atrophy of the infraspinatus muscle, there is usually an associated nerve compression at the spinoglenoid notch. The compression of the nerve at the spinoglenoid notch is usually due to a ganglion cyst. Atrophy of the muscle may also be due to tendinous ruptures greater than five centimeters or chronic rotator cuff tears. Weakness in external rotation of a 90-degree flexed arm may be an indication of rotator cuff tears or tendinous rupture of the infraspinatus.
