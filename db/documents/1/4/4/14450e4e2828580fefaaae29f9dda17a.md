Bladder diverticulum occurs when a defect is found between the detrusor muscle fibers, which will lead to herniation of the bladder mucosa. The causes are acquired or congenital. Acquired causes tend to form multiple herniation, and most of the time is due to bladder outlet obstruction. Congenital causes, on the other hand, are solitary and are associated with many other congenital syndromes such as Menkes syndrome. They affect both adult and pediatric age groups. The diagnosis is usually made when investigating non-specific symptoms such as hematuria, dysuria, and urinary tract infection. This activity outlines the etiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of bladder diverticulum and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care and rehabilitation of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of the bladder diverticulum.
- Explain how to evaluate for bladder diverticulum.
- Identify the treatment options for bladder diverticulum.
- Review the necessity of strengthening care coordination within the interprofessional team to increase care delivery for patients with bladder diverticulum.
