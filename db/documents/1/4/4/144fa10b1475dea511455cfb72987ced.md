The humerus serves as the origin and insertion site of many upper limb muscles that divide into the following distinctions: scapulohumeral muscles, anterior compartment muscles, posterior compartment muscles.

Scapulohumeral muscles: The deltoid muscle, which defines the shoulder contour of the upper limb, originates at three locations: the acromion of the scapula, the spine of the scapula and clavicle, with each part inserting into the deltoid tuberosity of the humerus. The deltoid muscle allows internal/external rotation and abduction/adduction of the humerus.

Anterior compartment muscles: The biceps brachii muscle has a long head and short head but does not have an actual origin or insertion sites on the humerus.

Posterior compartment muscles: The triceps brachii muscle contains three heads, with the medial head originating on the posterior aspect of the humerus, inferior to the spiral groove, and the lateral head originating on the posterior surface, both insert into the olecranon process of the ulna and allow extension of the forearm at the elbow joint.
