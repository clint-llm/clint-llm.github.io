Purpura fulminans is a rapidly evolving syndrome of skin microvascular thrombosis and hemorrhagic necrosis. It is considered a sign of certain systemic diseases rather than a disease unto itself. The 3 types of purpura fulminans are neonatal, idiopathic, and acute infectious.  Neonatal purpura fulminans is associated with a hereditary deficiency of the anticoagulants protein C,  protein S, and antithrombin III. It manifests very early in life and treatment is aimed at these deficiencies.
