Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a multisystem disorder and the most common genetic disease in the United States, affecting 1 in 500 African Americans. About 1 in 12 African Americans carry the autosomal recessive mutation, and approximately 300,000 infants are born with sickle cell anemia annually. Knowledge of the phenotypic expression of the disease is still limited although environmental factors such as cold weather and air quality, infections, fetal hemoglobin level, and genetic subtypes play a role in the manifestations of the disease. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of sickle cell disease and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of sickle cell disease.
- Describe the different types of sickle cell crises.
- Review the treatment and management options available for sickle cell disease.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of sickle cell disease and improve patient outcomes.
