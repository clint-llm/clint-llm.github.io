The elimination half-life of atenolol is approximately 6 to 7 hours. The beta-blocking effects manifest within an hour of ingesting a single oral dose and last 24 hours. With an intravenous dose, effects are evident within 5 minutes but dissipate after 12 hours.

Unlike its other beta-1-blocking counterparts, there is little hepatic metabolism of atenolol - it is primarily renally excreted. Therefore, while no hepatic dosage adjustment is needed, it is imperative to assess renal function before starting treatment, with regular monitoring throughout treatment. In addition, impaired glomerular function results in a significant accumulation of the drug in the body; therefore, patients with creatinine clearance under 35 mL/min should receive much lower doses.

Blood pressure and heart rate should also undergo periodic monitoring.

Patients with a history of obstructive airway disease should have regular lung function tests, and patients with diabetes should monitor blood glucose levels.
