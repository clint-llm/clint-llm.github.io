Heyde syndrome is a complex, multisystemic disorder that often requires multispecialty involvement for proper management. Interventional cardiologist referral should be sought to address the issue of aortic stenosis, especially if TAVR is under consideration. Consultation with a gastroenterologist is also essential to characterize any gastrointestinal bleeding. In select cases, cardiothoracic surgery input may even be an option.
