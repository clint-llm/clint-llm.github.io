Hibernating myocardium: When myocardial and left ventricular function is persistently impaired due to chronic reduction in coronary blood flow, the myocardium adapts to a low flow state called the hibernating myocardium. Myocardial tissue that undergoes hibernation has reduced contractility due to prolonged poor perfusion but is viable and can recover full functionality with revascularization. The important difference between the two phenomena is in the level of blood flow to the tissue. Stunned myocardium has, by definition, been reperfused and the ischemia relieved; however, the function remains depressed for hours, days, or even weeks afterward. In contrast, hibernating myocardium represents the persistent dysfunction of viable myocytes only during a period of reduced blood flow; when blood flow is restored, ventricular function improves. Imaging techniques used to determine myocardial stunning can also help assess hibernating myocardium.
