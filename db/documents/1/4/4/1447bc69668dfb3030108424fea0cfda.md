A patient with angiokeratoma circumscriptum typically presents with involvement on the skin of one lower extremity, most commonly on the buttocks or thigh. Angiokeratoma circumscriptum at birth most commonly manifest as multiple erythematous macules. Over the years, the macules can develop into dark red or violaceous keratotic papules, which coalesce into plaques. These characteristic plaques may vary in size from a few centimeters to covering as much as one-fourth of the body surface area.

Upon physical exam, involved areas are typically tender to palpation, well-circumscribed, firm, non-pulsatile, and non-compressible. Angiokeratoma circumscriptum lesions show no propensity toward spontaneous regression.

Several cases of angiokeratoma circumscriptum lesions associated with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) have been reported in the literature worldwide. Usually, KTS involves venous malformations and a port-wine stain on a limb with concomitant soft tissue swelling and bony hypertrophy. The rare reported cases described angiokeratoma circumscriptum instead of the port wine stain malformation.

Other entities that have correlations with angiokeratoma circumscriptum include Cobb syndrome, nevus flammus, cavernous hemangioma, and traumatic arteriovenous fistula.
