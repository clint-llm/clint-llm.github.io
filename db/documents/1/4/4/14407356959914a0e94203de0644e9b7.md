History should attempt to ascertain the amount of tetramine ingested and the time of ingestion. The possibility of co-ingestants should also be shown. The symptomatic onsetÂ is rapid. The physical exam should focus on the neurologic evaluation. Physical exam findings are generally nonspecific. Animal models suggest lethargy and tremor as early toxicity signs.

Common symptoms reported from minor toxicity include headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and hallucinations.

Given the rapid nature of toxicity development, the patient may present in status epilepticus to the hospital setting, and other symptoms might not be prevalent by the time the patient arrives.
