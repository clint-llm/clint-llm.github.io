Pain is a complex sensation influenced by a variety of factors. On the periphery, it is mostly transmitted by the somatic nerves. Yet, internal organs relay nociceptive information via visceral afferent fibers that travel together with sympathetic nerves. Disrupting these pathways may provide profound analgesia for diseases of internal organs, cancer in particular, and reduce the use of opioid medications. Activity in the sympathetic efferents can exacerbate some chronic pain states (notably, sympathetically maintained pain of CRPS and ischemic pain), and sympathectomiesÂ may effectively relieve these types of pain. Decreasing sympathetic tone by blocking sympathetic ganglia can also be used for treating certain cardiac arrhythmias (sustained ventricular tachycardia), hyperhidrosis, headaches, PTSD, and a variety of other conditions.
