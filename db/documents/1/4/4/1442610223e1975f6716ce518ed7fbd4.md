- Alteration in mental status is common in HIV-infected patients and etiology may be unclear.

- The common use of HAART in developed countries has greatly decreased the risk of developing HAND; however, disorders on this spectrum are common in patients from developing countries or in patients whose advanced disease have gone untreated.

- Cognitive deficits associated with HAD include impaired executive function, decision making and language; these are generally slow and progressive in onset.

- Patients with nonspecific cognitive symptoms, low CD4 count or risk factors for HAD should be screened using neuropsychologic testing.

- Workup should focus on excluding other causes of cognitive impairment in immunocompromised individuals.

- Treatment for HIV-infected patients with neurocognitive impairment is the initiation of or adherence to HAART therapy.

- Rapid neurologic or cognitive decline, especially in an appropriately treated patient with high CD4 count and low viral load, should prompt investigation into alternative causes including CNS infection, tumor, neurodegenerative diseases or toxic encephalopathy.
