In most cases, the clinical picture of omphalitis is sufficient to make the diagnosis. A patent urachus, which results in direct communication between the bladder and umbilicus can be mistaken for infection due to the persistent drainage from the umbilicus. Umbilical granulomas may also be misdiagnosed as an umbilical infection because the friable tissue can cause serous or serosanguinous drainage and easy bleeding with trauma. These typically occur after the first week of life and can be distinguished by their soft, velvety texture and pinkish color. Umbilical polyps are firm masses comprised of urachal embryologic remnants that often require surgical excision but do not cause infection.
