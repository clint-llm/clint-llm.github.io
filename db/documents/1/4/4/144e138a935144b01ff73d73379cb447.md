Paget disease is the second most common bone disorder in the elderly and is associated with very high morbidity and mortality. There is no cure for the disorder and early diagnosis is key.

The diagnosis and management of Paget disease are better made with an interprofessional team that consists of a rheumatologist or endocrinologist, neurologist, audiologist, internist, nurse practitioner, and a pathologist. Asymptomatic patients do not require treatment.

Patients need to be referred to a physical therapist as they will benefit from learning about body mechanics, proper posture and avoidance of trauma. Because the patients have weak bones, they need to be educated about protected weight-bearing and the use of ambulatory devices. The nurse should reinforce education about safe ambulation to prevent fractures. Immobility should be avoided as it also increases morbidity. The pharmacist should educate the patient on medication compliance and potential adverse effects, and nursing should watch for signs of adverse drug effects and monitor treatment progress on subsequent visits, reporting any findings to the clinician staff.

Symptomatic patients usually can be managed by bisphosphonates, calcitonin and vitamin D supplements. The pharmacist should be involved in the decision of best medication and dosing choice to optimize the therapeutic effect. A pain specialist should also be involved as these patients have moderate to severe bony pain that is often disabling.

Indications for surgery are usually offered as an option to patients diagnosed with Paget disease when there is a progression into osteosarcoma. The majority of patients diagnosed with osteosarcoma are usually offered palliative options such as amputation of the affected limb. Patients may also develop pathologic fractures that may need radiation and internal fixation to relieve pain burden. Chemotherapy has been shown to be an ineffective option for patients diagnosed with a sarcoma. It is important to note that surgical failure rates are high in this group of patients.

These examples of interprofessional teamwork demonstrate how such collaboration between disciplines can result in optimal patient outcomes. [Level 5]
