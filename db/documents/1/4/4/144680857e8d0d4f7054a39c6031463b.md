The management of the patient should include a complete blood count (CBC) with particular attention to the hemoglobin and hematocrit level.  Patients may accumulate a significant amount of blood in the subdural space and display anemia due to blood loss before neurological signs. When there is longstanding accumulation as in chronic subdural hematoma, platelets decrease, signaling the beginning of consumptive coagulopathy. Prolonged prothrombin and activated prothrombin time, a decrease in fibrinogen, and elevation of fibrin degradation products may confirm this condition. A basic metabolic panel (BMP) is informative with particular attention to the serum potassium. Hyperkalemia heralds the breakdown of red blood cells that have extravasated into the subdural space. Stabilization of the patient to minimize the likelihood of secondary injury is of paramount importance. Following the initial stabilization, radiological investigation including a computerized tomography of the head is imperative. If time permits and the risks of sedation mitigated, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
