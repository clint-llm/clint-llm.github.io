Laboratory studies and imaging should be done to evaluate the condition and the extent of the disease as well as the possible etiology. A complete blood count should be obtained for lupus erythematosus and possible malignant neoplasms. A basic metabolic panel with creatinine and urea can be obtained to evaluate for chronic kidney failure. Parathyroid hormone and vitamin D level are done to rule out hyperparathyroidism and hypervitaminosis D. Calcium, phosphate, total proteins, albumin, 24 h urine excretion of calcium/inorganic phosphate levels should be obtained for metastatic calcification. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT), and aldolase levels should be obtained to evaluate for dermatomyositis. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-dsDNA, and anti-ENA for lupus and systemic sclerosis. Anti-ENA looks at Ro, La, Sm, RNP, Scl-70, Jo1. Bicarbonate and arterial pH can be obtained to rule out milk and alkali syndrome.

Other studies should include x-ray, skin ultrasound, bone scintigraphy, CT and MRI, and skin biopsy.
