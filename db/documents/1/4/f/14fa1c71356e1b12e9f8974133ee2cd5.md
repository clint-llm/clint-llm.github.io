Bazex syndrome, also known as acrokeratosis paraneoplastica or acrokeratosis neoplastica (AN) syndrome is a rare, acral psoriasiform dermatosis associated with internal malignancies, most frequently squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract. However, it is important to know that almost any malignancy of squamous cells can be associated with the syndrome. Thus, these patients need an exhaustive workup to determine the location of the malignancy. The skin lesions are usually noticed before the diagnosis of the underlying malignancy and frequently subside spontaneously after complete treatment of the malignancy.
