The most definitive treatment of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is the identification and removal of the offending agent. Acute allergic contact dermatitis can also be treated with topical or oral corticosteroids.  Oral antihistamines may help with pruritus in some cases.  If ACD involves a delicate area such as skin folds or eyelids, topical calcineurin inhibitors or PDE4 inhibitors may also be effective.  If the allergen is identified, strict avoidance is necessary to prevent recurrence.

In cases of chronic or recalcitrant ACD, patch testing is the gold standard in identifying the causative agent.
