Therapeutic plasmapheresis is used for numerous diseases. The conditions involve the presence of a toxic substance in plasma (e.g., immunoglobulin), which can be filtered. The disorders where therapeutic plasmapheresis can be done are grouped into four categories by the Apheresis Applications Committee of the American Society for Apheresis (ASFA). Category 1 includes disorders where plasmapheresis can be done as a first-line treatment, category 2 includes disorders where plasmapheresis can be done as a second-line treatment in addition to the existing standard of care, category 3 includes disorders in which the evidence of the benefit of plasmapheresis is minimal, and therapy must be individualized, and category 4 includes disorders in which the evidence suggests that plasmapheresis is either ineffective or harmful, however, may be considered after approval from the institute ethics committee.

The alphabetical list of various indications for plasmapheresis, along with their ASFA category, is as follows.
