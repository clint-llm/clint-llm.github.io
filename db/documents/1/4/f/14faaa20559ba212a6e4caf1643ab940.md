Complete surgical resection is the mainstay treatment and the most important prognostic determinant for both malignant and benign forms of solitary fibrous tumors of the pleura.

There is a lack of prospective data supporting neoadjuvant or adjuvant radiotherapy after surgical resection. The role of adjuvant radiation therapy is local control, especially in tumors at high risk for recurrence. Patients with tumors with high-risk histologic features and positive surgical margins are likely to benefit from adjuvant radiation therapy. In locally recurrent solitary fibrous tumors of the pleura, adjuvant radiation therapy may be employed after re-resection. Neoadjuvant radiotherapy may have a role as upfront therapy in patients with large-difficult-to- resect tumors. Radiation therapy can be offered for palliation in patients with metastatic disease.

Chemotherapy has a limited role in the treatment of completely resected SFTPs. It may be offered in unresectable or metastatic disease but typically results in a poor partial response with progression-free survival in months.
