The pericapsular nerve group block (PENG) is a regional anesthetic technique that was described in 2018, developed primarily in total hip arthroplasties (THA) for postoperative analgesia with motor sparing benefits. This activity reviews the pericapsular nerve group block, a supplemental analgesic technique for hip surgery and hip fractures, and explains the role of an interprofessional team in improving care for patients with these conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the technique of nerve block.
- Identify the indications for the PENG block.
- Summarize the risks associated with any nerve block.
