Ocular trauma is largely preventable with proper counseling and using protective eyewear during high-risk activities.

High numbers of non-emergent ophthalmology consultations and follow-ups may reflect a lack of comfort among emergency physicians in managing ocular trauma. For this reason, ophthalmologists need to educate and train their colleagues to recognize, triage, and appropriately refer ocular injuries, especially in low-resource settings with limited access to specialty care.

The sequelae of ocular trauma result in various degrees of vision loss with functional deficits that affect all aspects of patients’ lives. It is often up to all healthcare team members, including ophthalmologists, to advocate for patients and ensure access to essential equipment, as well as to educate patients on their rights in the workplace.
