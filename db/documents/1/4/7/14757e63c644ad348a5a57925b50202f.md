Femoral neck fractures (FNFs) are among the most common fractures in the elderly population, with a high mortality riskÂ at one year, ranging up to 36%.

These fractures demonstrate a bimodal distribution pattern secondary to low-energy falls in elderly patients and higher-energy traumatic mechanisms in younger patients. The majority of such fractures are seen in the elderly population, with risk factors including osteoporosis, female gender, smoking, and low BMI.
