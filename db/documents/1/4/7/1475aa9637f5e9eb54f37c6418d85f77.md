Due to the lack of biomarkers, epidemiological studies to find the incidence of aspiration pneumonia have been difficult. Several studies showed that aspiration pneumonia contributes to 5 to 15% of all community-acquired pneumonia. A retrospective study done on 628 patients with aspiration pneumonia by Lanspa et al. showed 30-day mortality of 21%. The study also showed that CURB 65, a predictor of mortality in Community-acquired pneumonia, is not a reliable tool for aspiration pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia remains one of the common complications following general anesthesia and occurs in one in every 2000 to 30000 cases. In a study conducted on the elderly population aged older than 65 who underwent cardiovascular surgery, the incidence of aspiration pneumonia was found to be 9.8%, with 12 out of 123 patients having aspiration pneumonia post-extubation. A case-control study conducted by Marrie T.J. et al. showed that the incidence of aspiration pneumonia was 18% in nursing home patients and 15% in community-acquired aspiration pneumonia. Since most cases of aspiration pneumonia are silent or unwitnessed, the true incidence rate is difficult to calculate.
