Metastasis is one of the most important determinants of survival. The disease tends to locally disseminate in the peritoneum, causing peritoneal carcinomatosis, which indicates rapid disease progression. Lymph node metastasis, rectal and colon metastases, and bone metastasis are common in advanced disease and associated with poor prognosis and failure to surgical cure.
