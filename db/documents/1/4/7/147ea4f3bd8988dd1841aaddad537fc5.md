Otitis media with effusion (OME) is a condition in which there is fluid in the middle ear but no signs of acute infection. As fluid builds up in the middle ear and Eustachian tube, it places pressure on the tympanic membrane. The pressure prevents the tympanic membrane from vibrating properly, decreases sound conduction, and therefore results in decreased hearing. This activity reviews the pathophysiology and presentation of otitis media with effusion and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the risk factors for otitis media with effusion.
- Explain the presentation of a patient with otitis media with effusion.
- Summarize the treatment options for otitis media with effusion.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected with otitis media with effusion.
