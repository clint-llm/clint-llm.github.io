IBD has a waxing and waning course, and most patients maintain an active, healthy lifestyle. Treatment and lifestyle modifications help manage the symptoms of the disease. Careful screening and early management of EIMs improve health, quality of life and reduce morbidity. EIMs associated with intestinal-IBD disease activity manifest during flare-ups of the disease, whereas EIMs independent of intestinal-IBD severity may precede IBD diagnosis or occur during IBD remission.
