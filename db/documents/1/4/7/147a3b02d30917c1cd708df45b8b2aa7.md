Medical management focuses on the elimination of opportunistic infections and relieving pain:

- Treatment and prevention of opportunistic infections: Inform the health practitioner about health status, significant lab reports, and prescribe antibiotics as prescribed by the doctor.

- Antidiarrheal therapy: Therapy with octreotide acetate, a synthetic analog of somatostatin, for the management of severe chronic diarrhea.

- Antidepressant therapy: Monitor patients' sleep/wake cycle, any changes in appetite or concentrations and get help from psychiatrists if needed.

- Nutrition therapy: For all patients with unexplained weight loss, calorie counts should be obtained, and oral supplements and appetite stimulants should be discussed with the primary physician.

- Pain therapy: Administer NSAIDS or opioids as needed by the patient, in recommended dosages.
