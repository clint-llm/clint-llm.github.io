**Masseter Muscle Rigidity**

Masseter muscle rigidity (MMR), also known as "jaws of steel," occurs following a dose of succinylcholine and is defined as limb muscle flaccidity with jaw muscle tightness. There is a variable presentation from complete trismus and severe spasticity to a tight jaw response, which becomes concerning as the patient is unable to be adequately intubated, leading to an increased risk of malignant hyperthermia in the patient.

**Masseter Reflex**

The masseter reflex, also known as the mandibular reflex or jaw-jerk reflex, involves opening the mouth and placing a finger on the chin of the patient and striking the finger with a reflex hammer. The downward force can cause a reflex action in the masseter muscles resulting in an elevation of the mandible. The normal response is very little to no reflex activity, but with a brainstem lesion involving an upper motor neuron lesion, hyperreflexia of the masseteric reflex is possible.

**Tetanus Toxin**

Tetanus toxin comes from the gram-positive spore-forming bacteria Clostridium tetani. Tetanus toxin enters the body, binds to peripheral neurons, and is transported retrogradely to the spinal cord or brainstem. Once in the central nervous system tetanus toxin inhibits the vesicular release of inhibitory neurotransmitters, glycine. This disinhibition of lower motor neurons leads to sustained contractures and muscle rigidity including opisthotonus, respiratory failure, trismus, and dysphagia. Trismus is muscle rigidity and spasms primarily of the masseter and temporalis muscle leading to an inability to open the mouth and leading to smile characteristically called risus sardonicus.
