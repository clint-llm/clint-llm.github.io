Heterochromia or heterochromia iridum indicates a difference between the color of the two irises. It usually involves the whole iris and can less commonly affect only part of the iris (sectoral heterochromia). It is an often under-recognized sign of both systemic and ocular congenital or acquired diseases. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients with heterochromia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the anatomy and embryology of the human iris with respect to pigmentation and color.
- Summarize the causes and differential diagnosis of heterochromia.
- Outline the important elements in the assessment of patients with heterochromia.
- Explain the treatment of patients with heterochromia.
