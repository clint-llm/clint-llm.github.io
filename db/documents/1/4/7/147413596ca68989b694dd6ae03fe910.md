The perichondrium is a layer of dense connective tissue that surrounds the cartilage. It facilitates the growth and repair of the cartilage. Trauma can cause microfractures of the cartilage and causes the perichondrial layer to strip off the cartilage, resulting in devascularisation and necrosis.

The scanty blood supply to this area makes it especially susceptible to infection despite even aseptic techniques of ear piercing.
