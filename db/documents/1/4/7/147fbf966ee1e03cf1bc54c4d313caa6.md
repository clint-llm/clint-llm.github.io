Blood supply to the spinal cord is highly complex and anastomotic to ensure adequate supply to the entire structure. Variability in the vasculature is not uncommon. Additionally, blood flows preferentially to certain regions of the spinal cord, particularly the cervical and lumbar enlargements.

Longitudinally, the spinal cord receives vascular supply by the anterior spinal artery (ASA) and a pair of posterior spinal arteries (PSA). These three arteries typically originate from the distal vertebral arteries at the superior aspect of the spinal cord. However, some literature has described the PSAs as branches of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. The ASA is the predominant supply of the spinal cord. It supplies the anterior two-thirds of the cross-sectional area through its terminal branches, the central arteries. The paired PSAs provide blood to the spinal posterior one-third cross-sectional area. The three vessels also connect circumferentially around the structure via the pial plexus, often referred to as the vasocorona. It supplies the periphery of the cord via small perforators, known as rami perforantes.

Segmentally, numerous anterior and posterior radicular arteries (see below) provide collateral blood flow to the entire vertebral column, including the vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs, in addition to the spinal cord.
