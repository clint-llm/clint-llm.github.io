Architecturally, the nose is designed in a way to facilitate the movement of inspired air toward the olfactory epithelium. The olfactory epithelium is specialized epithelial tissue covering the septum, the upper portion of the superior turbinate and the lateral surface of the posterosuperior portions of both nasal cavities. This specialized epithelium contains the cell bodies of bipolar olfactory neurons from which the olfactory nerve fibers originate and extend apically. In each nostril, human beings have 6 to 10 million olfactory sensory neurons distributed along a surface area of 2.5 cm^2. These cells continuously regenerate from stem cells within the basal portion of the epithelium and have a half-life of 30 to 40 days. The apical portion of these cells has dendrites that project into the epithelial surface, where they interact with odoriferous particles from the outside world via G protein-coupled receptors.

The basal projections of olfactory neurons ascend and traverse the cribriform plate of the ethmoid as unmyelinated axons grouped into small nerve bundles called fila olfactoria. Each of these small nerve bundles forms the olfactory nerves, and there are around 15 to 20 of them on each side of the nasal cavity. The junction at which the olfactory nerves traverse the bony cribriform plate is a potential area of harm, either through the form of infection or trauma. The foramina in the cribriform plate serve as easy entry points for pathogens to gain access to the intracranial space and also facilitate the shearing of olfactory nerves during trauma. After penetrating the cribriform plate and traversing the subarachnoid space, the fila olfactoria enter the olfactory bulbs ventrally. The dura mater ensheathing the intracranial surface of the cribriform plate runs continuously with the basal membrane of the olfactory epithelium emerging through the foramina.

The ventral surface of the olfactory bulb lies on top of the posterior third of the cribriform plate, while the dorsal surface sits beneath the inferior surface of the frontal lobes, specifically the orbital and rectus gyri. The olfactory bulbs serve as a relay station for all impulses transmitted between the olfactory epithelium and the primary olfactory cortex.

The olfactory bulb consists of a constellation of neurons and sophisticated synaptic fields distributed uniquely among five layers. There are a variety of neurons in the olfactory bulb, including the mitral cells, tufted cells, granule cells, and periglomerular neurons. The axons of olfactory nerves originating from cell bodies in the olfactory epithelium terminate at the olfactory bulb, where they converge with the dendrites of mitral and tufted cells in small clusters called glomeruli. These glomeruli form the first layer of the olfactory bulb that we come to know as the glomerular layer. Under high magnification, glomeruli are described as round, ball-like structures and receive inputs from the periglomerular cells, olfactory epithelium, mitral cells, and tufted cells. The periglomerular cells surround the entire glomeruli and maintain reciprocal dendrodendritic synapses with mitral and tufted cells. In conjunction with granule cells, periglomerular cells serve to modulate and fine-tune the processing of olfactory information. Both granule cells and periglomerular cells are considered interneurons.

After olfactory information is transmitted from olfactory receptor neurons to mitral and tufted cells in the glomeruli, the axonal projections of mitral and tufted cells form bundles that pass through the olfactory bulb and run dorsally, merging to form the olfactory tract. From the olfactory bulb, each olfactory tract runs posteriorly along the olfactory sulcus and ends in the olfactory trigone. The olfactory trigone is a triangular widening of the terminal olfactory tract located superior to the anterior clinoid process and directly rostral to the anterior perforated substance. At this unique anatomic landmark, the fibers of the tract diverge to form two main bundles, the lateral and medial olfactory stria.

The medial olfactory stria is responsible for autonomic responses associated with olfaction, such as an increase in salivation and gastric peristalsis/secretion in response to the smell of food. The medial olfactory stria sends projections to the ipsilateral anterior olfactory nucleus and through the anterior commissure to the contralateral olfactory bulb. These projections end in septal nuclei surrounding the para-terminal gyrus from which two fiber bundles split: the medullary stria and the olfacto-hypothalamic-tegmental bundle. The medullary stria pathway is responsible for salivation in response to the smell of food. It involves the activation of the superior and inferior salivatory nuclei via projections to the habenacular nuclei and the tegmentum. The olfacto-hypothalamic-tegmental bundle interacts with the dorsal vagal nucleus in the medulla and is responsible for increased peristalsis and gastric secretion in response to the smell of food.

The lateral olfactory stria contains the largest number of fibers in the olfactory tract and is responsible for the majority of functional olfactory transmission. The lateral olfactory stria carries the efferent projections of the olfactory bulb toward the limen of the insula, where it bends medially to enter the temporal lobe near the uncus, where the primary olfactory cortex is.

The primary olfactory cortex is the main site of olfactory information processing. The primary olfactory cortex interacts with a wide variety of cortical and limbic structures, and by definition, refers to the structures that receive axons from the olfactory bulb. These structures include the piriform cortex, amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, olfactory tubercle, and anterior olfactory nucleus. These structures provide a multitude of functions that result in the integration of olfactory sensory information to encode, recognize, and contextualize scenarios.
