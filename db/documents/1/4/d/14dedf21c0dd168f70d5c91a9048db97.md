Shock refers to the inadequate perfusion of tissues due to the imbalance between oxygen demand of tissues and the bodyâ€™s ability to supply it. Classically, there are four categories of shock: hypovolemic, cardiogenic, obstructive, and distributive shock. Hypovolemic shock occurs when there is a decreased intravascular volume to the point of cardiovascular compromise. The hypovolemic shock could be due to severe dehydration through a variety of mechanisms or from blood loss. The pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of hemorrhagic shock, a subset of hypovolemic shock, will be explored in this activity. It reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the definition of shock.
- Summarize the evaluation of hemorrhagic shock.
- Outline management options available for the treatment of hemorrhagic shock.
- Identify some interprofessional team strategies for improving care and communication to improve patient outcomes in patients with hemorrhagic shock.
