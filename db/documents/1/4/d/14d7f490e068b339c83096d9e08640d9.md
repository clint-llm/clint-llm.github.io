Insulin administration can be via subcutaneous, intravenous, and intramuscular routes. The route of administration usually depends on the patient condition and setting.

The subcutaneous route is the most widespread route of administration and is preferred by most patients due to its ease and convenience in administration. Patients use the subcutaneous route in the form of insulin syringes, pens, and pumps. It is an easy and convenient way for patients to self-administer.

Intravenous insulin is used in the hospital setting, especially when immediate and close monitoring of blood glucose levels is needed.

Intramuscular insulin use is rare and utilizes concentrated regular insulin. In 2014, the FDA approved an inhalable insulin formulation. It passes through the lungs and into the bloodstream and provides a rapid onset of action within 12 minutes. It can be taken by patients with diabetes type 1 and type 2 before meals. The insulin pump is a device that works like a natural pancreas. It replaces the need for long-acting insulin and continuously delivers small amounts of short-acting insulin in the body throughout the day.
