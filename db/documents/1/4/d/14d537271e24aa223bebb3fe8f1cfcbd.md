Differential diagnosis of papuloerythroderma of Ofuji should include the following: cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, secondary syphilis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). Differentiation of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and PEO is by flow cytometry and evaluation of clonal t-cell samples, secondary syphilis may be ruled out via VDRL and RPR testing, and DRESS can be differentiated via its acute presentation versus the more gradual, chronic course of PEO.
