There are many options available to manage DVT. The first decision that should be made is whether the patient will require hospital admission or can be discharged on anticoagulation. This is a complex decision that depends on many factors including patient adherence to medication, insurance issues, the reliability of follow-up, renal function, comorbidities and concomitant medications, the risk of falling, and how ill the patient appears. The traditional treatment option is to use heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin and bridge to warfarin therapy. This often requires hospital admission, but in some healthcare settings, may be managed as an outpatient. New anticoagulants such as the direct antithrombin inhibitors are also options, but the use of these medications must be made on an individual basis.

Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters have been used historically to avoid the propagation of DVTs in the pulmonary artery. Based on current literature, it is unclear if IVC filters prevent PEs, and therefore, they are falling out of favor. They may still be indicated in specific clinical situations.
