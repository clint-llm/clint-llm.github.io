Test interpretation is positive or negative in a binary fashion. Verging outcomes are uninterpretable and have no clinical significance, and therefore should be reiterated. Indeterminate or borderline results, typically arising from either a failed control group and more likely in the setting of the weakened immune system, are often uninterpretable and should be replicated as well. The statistical data of positive to negative reversal is unclear, while it may indicate the voluntary resolution of disease or reduced/excluded regression threat.
