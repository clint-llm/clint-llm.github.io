Other adverse consequences of chronic sleep loss on public health include increased mortality & morbidity, poor performance on waking activities resulting in increased accidents & injuries, lower self-reported quality of life, decreased family well-being, and reduced use of health care. It is clear that sleep loss has a profound effect on human health and well-being. Quantity and quality of sleep play an essential role in mental & physical health and merit consideration in any treatment plan.
