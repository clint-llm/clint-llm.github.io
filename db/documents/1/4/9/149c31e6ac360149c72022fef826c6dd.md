The sympathetic autonomic nervous system (SANS) is spatially and pathophysiologically related to both acute and chronic pain. Acute generalized sympathetic activation, as occurs with the stress response, can temporarily increase the nociceptive threshold via a combination of neural and endocrine effects.

Selective interventional blockade of sympathetic pathways is commonly used to treat ischemic pain or sympathetically mediated pain. Most large sympathetic ganglia and plexi are anatomically separate from somatic nerves in prevertebral and paravertebral regions, and thus are readily accessible to percutaneous interruption. When indicated, sympathetic blocks can provide significant analgesia without causing somatic sensory deficits; but blockade of visceral sympathetic outflow will shift the homeostatic balance in the target region toward parasympathetic prevalence, with corresponding physiologic effects.
