In addition to evaluating the A through E characteristics of a pigmented lesion, there are specific dermoscopic patterns to guide examination. There are three benign patterns and one malignant dermoscopic pattern to consider. The parallel furrow pattern of linear pigmentation is benign over 93.2% of the time. The fibrillar pattern with pigmented furrows and fine angulated crossing filamentous, as well as the lattice-like pigment, are benign patterns. Most importantly, the parallel ridge pattern with wide diffuse pigmentation of the ridges predicts melanoma 93.7% of the time. Violation of the normal parallel furrow pattern indicates biopsy.
