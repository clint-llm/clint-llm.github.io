One of the earliest histopathologic findings in RA is new synovial blood vessel growth; this leads to the transmigration of lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes into the synovial fluid. Angiogenesis is required to support the highly catabolic synovium and is accomplished via proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF).

The histopathology of rheumatoid synovium reviews intense FLS activation and proliferation and subsynovial accumulation of T cells, including Th1, Th17, and Treg cells. B cells also accumulate and differentiate into plasma cells. The appearance of synovial tissue can appear similar to secondary lymphoid tissues such as lymph nodes. Macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, and fibroblasts are also present in the subsynovial tissue. Rheumatoid synovial tissue becomes invasive, eroding into the bone and causing marginal erosions.

Rheumatoid nodules initially have a small vessel vasculitis phenomenon followed by a chronic inflammatory granulomatous phase. The development of rheumatoid nodules is frequent in rheumatoid arthritis, involving the dermis or subcutis in peri-articular areas. When multiple, this phenomenon can be related to methotrexate therapy and is called accelerated rheumatoid nodulosis.
