The mechanisms of action of these antimicrobials are broad, and they generally require patients' to have functional immune systems to function optimally. This activity outlines the indications, mechanisms, and contraindications of bacteriostatic antimicrobials in treating bacterial infections and other key factors pertinent to members of the healthcare team treating patients with bacterial infections.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of various bacteriostatic antimicrobials.
- Describe the indications for different bacteriostatic antimicrobials.
- Review the toxicity of bacteriostatic antimicrobials.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the use of bacteriostatic antimicrobials.
