Complications include a high risk of refracture in patients with pathologic fractures due to the brittle nature of their sclerotic bone. Hardware failure is a common problem in osteopetrosis patients requiring fracture fixation. Peri-prosthetic fractures around previously reinforced bone can further complicate care. Also, these patients can require specialized orthopedic tools intraoperatively as the hard, brittle bone can cause failure in some tools such as bone drill bits and Kirschner wires. Bone infections secondary to disrupted bone vascularity are common, as well as malunion and non-union of pathologic fractures.
