All patients with macular drusen should be educated on the importance of regular Amsler grid use to check for metamorphopsias or scotomas that may indicate conversion from dry to wet ARMD. Any change in near or distance vision may also indicate developing CNV, and patients should be instructed to contact their ophthalmologist without delay.

Patients who already have severe vision loss may benefit from visual rehabilitation and referral to a low-vision clinic, where they can learn about resources to help them function with their limited vision. Several low-vision tools can be offered, including handheld magnifiers, closed-circuit television viewers, or accessibility apps on common electronic devices, including both smartphones and tablets. In addition, they should be counseled on the availability of large-print periodicals, audiobooks, and other resources offered by their local library and available through the Library of Congress. They may also benefit from referral to social services to help them preserve their independence as much as possible.
