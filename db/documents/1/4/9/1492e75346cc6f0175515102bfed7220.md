A **lumbar puncture**is the diagnostic tool of choice for the identification of meningitis. After obtaining a patient’s consent, a lumbar puncture should be prioritized to ensure prompt evaluation and diagnosis. Based on patient history and exam, CT imaging may be indicated before lumbar puncture to ensure no increased risk for herniation (i.e., those patients with altered mental status, new-onset seizure within one week of symptoms, papilledema, an immunocompromised state, or focal neurologic deficits).

Diagnosing meningococci can also include analyzing peripheral blood, skin lesions, synovial fluid, pleural fluid, or pericardial fluid in patients suspected of having pneumonia, septic arthritis, or pericarditis due to N. meningitidis.

CSF assays exist and include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and latex agglutination to confirm N. meningitidis infection. PCR detects small quantities of bacterial DNA and has been used increasingly due to rapid results. Because PCR detects strands of bacterial DNA, it does not require an intact bacterium for detection. Latex agglutination is another testing modality using antibody-coated latex beads to detect capsular antigens.
