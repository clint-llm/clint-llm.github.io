Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in men and women in the United States. The instantaneous wave-free ratio (IFR) can be used to determine whether or not coronary lesions that are visualized angiographically should undergo percutaneous intervention. This activity describes the instantaneous wave-free ratio and its use in the cardiac catheterization lab to determine the hemodynamic significance of coronary lesions and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for percutaneous coronary intervention candidates.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the technical aspects of the instantaneous wave-free ratio (IFR).
- Explain how the instantaneous wave-free ratio is used in the management of coronary artery disease.
- Identify instantaneous wave-free ratio values at which coronary lesions are determined to be hemodynamically unstable and therefore should undergo percutaneous intervention.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to ensure appropriate selection of candidates for percutaneous intervention.
