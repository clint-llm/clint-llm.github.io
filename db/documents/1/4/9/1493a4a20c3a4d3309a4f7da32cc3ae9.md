Lymph nodes with the suspicion of lymphoma are sent fresh to histopathology laboratory. A sample for flow cytometry in a special RBMI medium is taken along with touch imprints for possible preliminary diagnosis. The rest of the specimen is processed as a routine histological specimen. The lymph node is sliced, and representative sections are taken for microscopic study. The slides are stained by hematoxylin and eosin. Sentinel lymph nodes are sampled for breast cancer that is also sent fresh for intraoperative assessment.
