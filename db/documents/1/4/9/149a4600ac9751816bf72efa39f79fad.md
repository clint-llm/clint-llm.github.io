**Blood Supply**

The blood supply begins in the external carotid artery from which the facial artery branches. The facial artery then gives rise to the ascending palatine artery which then anastomoses with the tonsillar artery, ascending pharyngeal artery, and the descending palatine artery. The blood then continues to supply the soft palate; palatoglossus, palatopharyngeus, tensor veli palatini, musculus uvulae, and the levator veli palatine, as well as the eustachian tube, and palatine tonsils.

**Lymphatics**

The palatine tonsils are known for supplying blood to the palatine tonsils, which are responsible for filtering bacteria and viruses while producing white blood cells and antibodies. The retropharyngeal lymph nodes also receive blood supply from the ascending palatine artery and the ascending pharyngeal artery. Therefore it is targeted in cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma when radiotherapy is necessary.
