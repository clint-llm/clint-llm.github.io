Indications for cervical spine imaging include localized neck pain, deformity, edema, altered mental status, head injury, or neurological deficit. Computed tomography is the preferred imaging in acute spine trauma as it is more sensitive for detection of bony cervical spine injury when compared to plain radiographs (sensitivity of 98% versus 52%). Further evaluation of ligamentous structures of the spinal cord with MRI is important for determining spinal stability and in planning surgical treatment. Scoring systems in dealing with cervical spinal cord injury that includes ligamentous, bony and neurologic injury exist, a common one is called SLICS (Subaxial Cervical Spine Injury Classification System), and this can be used to help with evaluation and guidance of surgical or nonsurgical management. A SLICS score of 1 to 3 is nonsurgical, a score of 4 is not specified, and a score of 5 or greater is a surgical indication.
