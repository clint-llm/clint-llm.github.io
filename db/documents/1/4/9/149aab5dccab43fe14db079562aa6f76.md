Recent work suggests that olfactory training is more effective in younger individuals than in the elderly and is more effective in individuals with severe olfactory dysfunction than in individuals who are only mildly affected.

- **Post-infectious olfactory dysfunction:**This is one of the most common causes of olfactory decline in clinical practice and one of the most common indications for olfactory training.

- **Post-traumatic olfactory dysfunction:**This type of olfactory dysfunction may occur suddenly or with a delay after a brain or nasal injury.

- **Parkinson disease:**Patients with Parkinson disease have a severe impairment of olfactory functioning, which starts many years before the onset of motor symptoms such as tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesic gait.

- **Idiopathic olfactory dysfunction:**This diagnosis is made after excluding all other causes of olfactory dysfunction.
