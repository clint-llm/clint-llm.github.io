Pacemaker syndrome is most commonly seen in the setting of a single chamber device with ventricular sensing and pacing lead. Since there is no atrial sensing lead to guide the ventricle, the ventricle contracts at the programmed rate regardless of the timing of atrial contraction. This leads to loss of AV synchrony which leads to a loss in stroke volume and cardiac output. VA conduction, which is usually a ventricular beat finding its way upwards to the atria also leads to a mistimed atrial contraction and produces similar effects.
