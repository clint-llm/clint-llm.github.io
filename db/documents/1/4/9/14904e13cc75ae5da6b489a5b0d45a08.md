The periodontium functions include supporting the tooth, protecting it against oral microflora, and making the attachment of the tooth to the bone possible.

The periodontal ligament (PDL) is a connective tissue that consists mostly of type I collagen bands and fibroblasts. PDL connects the cementum of the tooth to the gingivae in the alveolar socket using collagen bands. On the other hand, fibroblasts have a role in forming and repairing the alveolar bone and cementum.

Cementum is the mineralized tissue covering the dentin surfaces and is known to be the attachment site for PDL.
