The management of patients with the ovarian cyst is multidisciplinary, and teamwork is necessary between the following specialties:

- Obstetrician/gynecologist

- Infertility and reproductive endocrinologists

- Gynecologic oncologist

- General surgeon

- Radiologist

- Pathologist

Patients at high risk for ovarian malignancy should have their case reviewed with a gynecologic oncologist for further assessment and determination of optimal surgical management. Specific guidelines can help gynecologists differentiate when to refer patients with an adnexal mass. Typically, postmenopausal women with an elevated CA-125 or premenopausal women with significantly high CA-125, ultrasound characteristics suspicious for malignancy, nodular or fixed pelvic mass, ascites, evidence, or abdominal or distant metastasis should be referred to gynecologic oncology. Ultrasound findings that are suspicious for malignancy include cysts larger than 10 cm, irregularity of cyst, high color Doppler flow, papillary or solid components, and presence of ascites.
