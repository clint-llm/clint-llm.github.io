According to the National Research Council and Institute of Medicine, about 14% to 20% of  C/A have a psychiatric illness. Up to 80% of these C/A are on multiple psychotropics simultaneously, including atypical antipsychotics. The US - FDA has approved the use of antipsychotics in specific psychiatric disorders include Tourette's and other tics disorders, behavioral and emotional symptoms associated with developmental delay, autistic spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Also, significant off-label antipsychotic uses (without FDA approval) are of the standard of practice today to manage C/A emotional and behavioral symptoms.

A metanalysis reported a median prevalence of antipsychotics use in autism spectrum C/A of about 17%. Risperidone is the most commonly prescribed antipsychotic (55%), followed by aripiprazole (35%).

Studies indicate that up to two-thirds of patients treated with atypical antipsychotics experience impaired bone marrow density, leading to osteoporosis.
