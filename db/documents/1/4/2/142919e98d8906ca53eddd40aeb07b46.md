PA is effective in promoting weight loss maintenance in patients with obesity or who are overweight. However, maintaining patient adherence and commitment to PA programs alongside calorie restriction programs requires consistent input from a multidisciplinary healthcare team. Consistent, realistic counseling from medical, nursing and allied health professionals is the best way to avoid unrealistic patient expectations and resulting disillusionment and lack of adherence. Early involvement of behavioral and eating disorder specialists, motivational interviewing, and physical therapy assessment has been shown to promote weight loss maintenance.

Maintaining weight loss in patients with obesity or who are overweight has been repeatedly demonstrated as extremely difficult. This is compounded by both the physiological response from the body to calorie restriction and the physical and mental effort required to maintain sustained PA and diet programs. Therefore, a consistent, combined, multidisciplinary approach is required to give patients the optimum support to maintain weight loss.
