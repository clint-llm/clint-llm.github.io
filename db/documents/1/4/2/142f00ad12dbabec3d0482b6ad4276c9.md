The appendix, transverse colon, and sigmoid colon are intraperitoneal organs. The cecum also is located intraperitoneally, but it lacks a mesentery. The cecum is an intraperitoneal organ, however, as it is covered on all sides by peritoneum. The ascending colon, descending colon, rectum, and anal canal are retroperitoneal structures.

Multiple surgical approaches are possible for colonic resection. These include a right hemicolectomy, extended right hemicolectomy, left hemicolectomy, extended left hemicolectomy, abdominoperineal resection. Simple excision with primary anastomosis is also an option. Side-to-side and side-to-end anastomoses are preferable to transanal anastomoses due to decreased incidence of anastomotic leakage.

Colonic ischemia or ischemic colitis is a dangerous complication following aortic surgery, as well as any perioperative hypotension. This condition typically presents with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea in the post-surgical period. Care is necessary to optimize fluids in the perioperative period to prevent ischemic colitis.
