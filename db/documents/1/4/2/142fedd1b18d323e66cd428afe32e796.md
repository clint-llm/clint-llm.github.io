This activity reviews salient details regarding accessing tissue specimens via a puncture through the chest wall into the lung (percutaneous lung lesion biopsy). Percutaneous lung lesion biopsy (PLLB) is by far the most common indication for percutaneous needle biopsy of the deep tissues of the thorax. PLLB has one of the highest complication rates among procedures performed by radiologists, with complication rates of around 35%. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment using a percutaneous lung biopsy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in coordinating this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications and contraindications for PLLB.
- Apply best practices for patient preparation and procedural techniques for PLLB.
- Identify complications from and limitations of PLLB.
- Recognize clinical benefits that can be achieved by PLLB and how the interprofessional team can assist in procedure and post-procedure management.
