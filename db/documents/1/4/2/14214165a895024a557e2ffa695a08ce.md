In 1977, Milgram was reported to be a self-limiting disease. Macroscopically and microscopically, it was classified into three stages:

**Stage I:**An active, inflammatory intrasynovial process without loose bodies. It could be asymptomatic or present with localized joint pain and swelling.

**Stage II:**Active synovial proliferation with transitional loose bodies (between synovium and hyaline cartilage from pedunculated to free loose bodies). Patients present with mechanical symptoms and decreased range of motion.

**Stage III:**AÂ quiescent stage of the disease with no ongoing metaplasia. Several loose bodies with minimal synovial disease and inflammation. Patients tend to be asymptomatic in this stage as well.
