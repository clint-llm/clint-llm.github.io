Infection control is a challenge of HHC due to a lack of measurement methods. There are various areas where OASIS can help determine the course of treatment of the patient proposed. Because of its broad points of assessment,Â when used in the HHC setting, OASIS can help measure the rates of infection and increase the detection of infections.

Consequently, OASIS has helped increase the discharge to home health from hospitals for wound infections.
