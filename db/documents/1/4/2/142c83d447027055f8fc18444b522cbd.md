With a positive Spurling Test, the suspected diagnosis is a cervical nerve root compression commonly related to intervertebral disc pathology (e.g., herniation).

The differential diagnoses of cervical radiculopathy include entrapment neuropathy (most commonly of the median or ulnar nerve), complex regional pain syndrome, brachial plexus lesions, cervical spondylotic myelopathy. It may also be present as a sequela of malignancy (primary or metastatic) or infection (meningitis).
