Robinson et al. evaluated renal biopsies in patients with orthostatic proteinuria and noted these findings:

- Eosinophilic granules within capsular space in 67% of specimens

- Minimal to moderate thickening of the glomerular capillary wall in 43% of specimens

- Glomerular hypercellularity in 41% of specimens

- Focal capillary dilatation in 22% of specimens
