When schizophrenia is traditionally discussed, the focus is usually on the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and less on the negative symptoms.

However, given its poor prognosis, patients and families would benefit from understanding the nature of symptoms such as stereotypy, automated mannerisms, and immobility to better identify its manifestations.
