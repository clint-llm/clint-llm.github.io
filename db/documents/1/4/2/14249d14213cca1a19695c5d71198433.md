Patients should be educated about the roles of phosphorous, calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone in their condition. Furthermore, they should be referred to a dietician to provide a phosphate restricted diet while maintaining a good protein intake. Phosphate restriction in the diet will prevent secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Patients should also be informed of the types of phosphate binders, as well as the importance of taking it with meals. Supplementation of calcium and vitamin D is also necessary for patients.
