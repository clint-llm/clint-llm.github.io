Gastroenterologist consultation is necessary for patients with symptomatic angiodysplasia for confirmation of diagnosis and further treatment with a combination of different endoscopic methods. Patients with symptomatic angiodysplasia with an unconfirmed source of bleeding after initial investigations may require an interventional radiology consultation for angiography for diagnosis as well as the opportunity for treatment. Cases with uncontrolled bleeding after attempts to control it fails with all other intervention will require surgery.
