Acute balanoposthitis is a purulent, pyogenic infection of the prepuce and represents the most severe form of posthitis. These conditions lead to erythema and edema of the prepuce. Dysuria is common, and minor bleeding may occur. These episodes typically resolve with antibiotic treatment and require no further intervention unless recurrent episodes occur.

Paraphimosis is related to manipulation of the foreskin with failure to reduce the foreskin to its natural position. Presentation with pain and edema of both the prepuce and the glans is typical. Paraphimosis does not represent a disease process, and single episodes, once resolved,Â warrant no surgical intervention. Recurrent episodes are unusual and are an indication for circumcision.

Congenital megaprepuce is a rare condition. On examination, the outer preputial skin directly meets the abdominal wall dorsally, the scrotum ventrally with an absence of penile shaft skin. Micturition is always abnormal with the entire preputial sac filling with urine. This can be expressed to leave a more normal appearance. This condition must be treated with a modified circumcision; any attempt to treat this condition with a standard circumcision will result in the requirement for revision surgery complicated by the loss of outer preputial skin.

Preputial adhesions are a normal physiological feature and resolve spontaneously over time
