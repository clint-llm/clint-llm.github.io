Symptoms related to the obstruction of the biliary tree require differentiation from other extrahepatic causes of cholestasis such as choledocholithiasis, choledochal cyst, sclerosing cholangitis, cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic pseudocysts, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Similarly, symptoms secondary to pancreatic insufficiencies such as steatorrhea and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus should raise suspicion of somatostatinoma in addition to chronic pancreatitis and other pancreatic tumors.
