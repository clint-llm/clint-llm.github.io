Patients should be counseled on proper safety precautions when handling tarantulas, regardless of whether the animal is wild or a pet. Eye protection, such as goggles, should be worn. Gloves should be worn, if possible, and hand washing should always be performed immediately after handling tarantulas. Great care should be given to avoid touching the face or eyes during and after handling the spider.
