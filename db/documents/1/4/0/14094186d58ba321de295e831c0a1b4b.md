Infantile spasms are epileptic spasms that occur in infancy or early childhood. These spasms are classically characterized clinically by symmetric, brief jerking spells that involve the head, neck, arms, legs, and abdomen which may consist of flexion, extension, or a combination of flexion-extension. Infantile spasms often are associated with a characteristic pattern on electroencephalogram (EEG) called hypsarrhythmia. When the triad of infantile spasms, hypsarrhythmia, and developmental regression occur together, this triad is termed West Syndrome.
