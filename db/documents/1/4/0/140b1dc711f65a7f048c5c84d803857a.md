Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a combined endoscopic and fluoroscopic procedure in which an endoscope is advanced into the second part of the duodenum, thus allowing other tools to be passed into the biliary and pancreatic ducts via the major duodenal papilla. Contrast material may be injected into these ducts, allowing for radiologic visualization and therapeutic intervention when indicated. ERCP initially started as a diagnostic procedure through cannulation of the pancreatic and biliary ducts but has evolved over the years and is currently predominantly used as a therapeutic tool. This activity reviews the indications and procedural techniques for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
- Describe the technique involved in performing an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
- Outline the potential complications of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies to optimize care coordination and communication and advance the appropriate and efficacious utilization of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
