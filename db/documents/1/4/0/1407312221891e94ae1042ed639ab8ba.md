Neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be considered for patients with an unresectable primary tumor, bulky lymphadenopathy or bilateral inguinal adenopathy. These patients have a low probability of cure from surgery alone. The TIP regimen is the standard regimen used and consists of paclitaxel, ifosfamide, and cisplatin. This is given at 3 to 4 week intervals for 4 cycles. There is little evidence for the role of adjuvant therapy in men with penile carcinoma. A good response was recently reported in a patient whose metastatic penile cancer progressed after standard cisplatin based chemotherapy and radiation. He had significant expression of PD-L1 and CDKN2A mutations. He responded particularly well to cemiplimab with a durable, complete response.
