Folinic acid is a medication used in the treatment of various cancers in combination with 5-FU. It is also commonly used as an antidote to folic acid antagonists such as methotrexate. Folinic acid (leucovorin) is an antidote, chemotherapy modulating agent, and rescue agent for the chemotherapy class of medications. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, and contraindications for folinic acid as a valuable agent in the management of certain types of cancer as well as megaloblastic anemia. This activity will also highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, monitoring) pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the care of patients treated with 5-FU and methotrexate.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize why it is essential to counsel patients on the risk of developing gastrointestinal toxicity. 
- Explain why it is crucial to rule out pernicious anemia or vitamin B12 deficiency in patients before initiating folinic acid therapy.
- Describe why methotrexate levels require close monitoring.
- Outline the importance of interprofessional team members in providing adequate and clear communication between oncology and team members, including nurses and pharmacists, in the setting of chemotherapy.
