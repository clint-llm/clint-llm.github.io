Disk battery ingestion is a relatively common problem seen in the emergency department. The vast majority of disk battery ingestion is in children who merely are exploring their home environment. However, disk battery ingestion can lead to serious complications. The ingestion is best managed by an interprofessional team that can provide aggressive care that may include surgical removal. The triage nurse must be fully aware of the consequences of disk battery ingestion and quickly get the patient admitted and seen by the emergency department physician. The prognosis for those who undergo prompt removal of the foreign body is excellent. Gastroenterologists and GI nurses are needed for endoscopy. However, delayed removal may lead to perforation or necrosis of the esophagus. The key to managing disk battery ingestion is the education of the parent who should keep these items locked up safely in an unreachable area.
