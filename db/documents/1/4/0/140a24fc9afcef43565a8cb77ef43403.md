Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is usually asymptomatic in individuals. However, when symptomatic, the most common clinical manifestation is spontaneous lobar hemorrhage. The location and the size of the hemorrhage largely determine the clinical deficits. Those extending towards the ventricles may cause hemiplegia and decreased consciousness, while smaller hemorrhage may cause more focal deficits, headaches, or seizures. Interestingly, very small hemorrhages may be asymptomatic. The hemorrhage location often reflects the distribution of the amyloid-beta peptide, favoring the cortical vessels. The hemorrhages are more likely to occur in the posterior brain. The cerebellum commonly contains vascular amyloid accumulation (primarily the cerebellar cortex and vermis).

Cognitive impairment has also been described as a presenting symptom. Three patterns have been described:

- Gradual decline - microhemorrhages, lobar lacunas, microinfarcts, ischemic leukoencephalopathy

- Step-wise decline - recurrent lobar hemorrhages

- Rapidly progressive decline - cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related inflammation
