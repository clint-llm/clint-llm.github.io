Trichinellosis usually has a benign course and is self-limiting. Full recovery of patients within 2 months to 6 months of infection is the expectation. However, some cases might be severe, and even death is a possibility. Death is rare if the cardiac and CNS remain uninvolved. Some individuals with CNS involvement may have residual deficits long-term. The prognosis of the disease proportionately correlates with the parasitic burden.
