In patients of SARS-CoV-2, data were collected from 40 patients between 22 and 64 years of age who required ECMO support in severe respiratory failure. A single-access, dual-stage right atrium to pulmonary artery cannula was used. Primary outcome survival following safe discontinuation of ventilatory and ECMO support was hypothesized. All patients were successfully discontinued from ECMO support in the mean of 2.6 days from ECMO initiation. Thus, single-access, dual-stage cannula offered better direct pulmonary artery flow, improved oxygenation and ventilation, and early mobility. To prevent thrombosis, all patients received systemic anticoagulation as patients with COVID-19 are prone to develop severe thrombosis.

Overall, this study showed promising outcomes with most patients being alive and discharged home without any oxygen support; complications were minimal, no ischemic stroke, ionotropic support, and tracheostomy required. But this study was limited to 40 subjects, single access, dual-stage venovenous ECMO with early extubation. Ongoing studies are necessary to define the long-term outcomes of this approach further.
