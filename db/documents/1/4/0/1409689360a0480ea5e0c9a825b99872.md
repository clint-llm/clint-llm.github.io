Early diagnosis of somatostatinoma can be difficult as non-functional tumors often produce no symptoms, and functional tumors present with non-specific symptoms that can masquerade other clinical conditions. Hence most non-functional tumors are discovered incidentally or during the workup of vague gastrointestinal symptoms.

Since somatostatinoma usually presents late, tumors are large at diagnosis and are easily visualized using imaging modalities such as CT, MRI, or MRCP.
