Tropical sprue is a malabsorption syndrome characterized by acute or chronic diarrhea. It is seen in the people of the tropical region in the absence of any specific cause of malabsorption.

The disease was first described by William Hillary in 1759 in a population with chronic diarrhea from Barbados.
