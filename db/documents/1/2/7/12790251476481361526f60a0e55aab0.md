Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a hormone secreted from the right atrium in response to atrial stretch from hypervolemia as well as in response to hypertension. Since its discovery in the early 1980s, there have subsequent discoveries of other natriuretic peptides, includingÂ brain or B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP). ANP and BNP are predominately produced by cardiomyocytes, while CNP is found more in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues.
