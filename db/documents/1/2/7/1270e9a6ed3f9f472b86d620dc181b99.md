The Spurling test is a well-recognized provocative test that is routinely used in the evaluation of neck pain and cervical radiculopathy. If used appropriately in conjunction with other history and exam findings, the Spurling test can help determine the cause of cervical radiculopathy and guide further workup and imaging studies. However, despite its clinical importance in the evaluation of cervical pathology, the test does have a relatively low sensitivity; therefore, it should not be the only criterion to determine whether further workup is indicated.
