Ibutilide is a class III antiarrhythmic drug. FDA-approved indications include the conversion of acute atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm (NSR).

**Off-Label Uses**

Ibutilide has utility asÂ a pretreatment for electro cardioversion. Pretreatment with ibutilide, sotalol, or dofetilide may help conversion to NSR in cases of refractory atrial fibrillation. Ibutilide may also be given post cardioversion to prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation.

Ibutilide administration may be necessary following surgery.
