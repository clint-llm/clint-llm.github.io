Mecamylamine is a secondary amine and thus demonstrates the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. At low doses, mecamylamine's central effects are prominent, however its antihypertensive effects less so. The same can be said for its parasympathetic side effects, blockade of which is responsible for many of its troublesome side effects. Mecamylamine is currently be investigating for several other therapeutic uses other than as an antihypertensive, and suggestions are that the drug's toxicity/risk profile is potentially better at lower doses.
