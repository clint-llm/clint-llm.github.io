The prognosis of acute tonsillitis in the absence of complications is excellent. Most cases are self-limiting infections in healthy patient populations who improve and have minimal sequela. Those with recurrent infections may require surgery; however, even these patients have good long term prognosis. In the age of antibiotics, even patients with complications, including peritonsillar abscess and Lemierre syndrome, have excellent long-term outcomes. In cases with GABHS complications, including rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis, patients can have long-term sequela, including cardiac valvular disease and decreased renal function. These entities are very rare in the developed world, and incidence has dropped with the advent of penicillin treatment. If symptoms do not improve, another diagnosis should be considered, including HIV, TB, gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, mononucleosis, Kawasaki disease, abscess, and Lemierre syndrome. Overall prognosis in these cases is related to the underlying condition.
