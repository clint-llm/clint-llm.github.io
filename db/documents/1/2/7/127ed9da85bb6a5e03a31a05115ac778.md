External Pacing is the fastest available method to synchronize cardiac rhythm in all the bradyarrhythmias indicated byÂ the American Heart Association (AHA)

External Pacing can be done in patients having Atrioventricular Nodal dysfunction caused by an acute myocardial infarction, chest or cardiac trauma, infections (Lyme disease or bacterial endocarditis), sepsis, etc. Bradycardic patients secondary to electrolyte disturbances, metabolic abnormalities, drugs (such as beta-blockers), or hypothermia are also strong candidates for this pacing method

Certain cases of ventricular tachycardia such as postoperative atrial flutter, Torsades de Pointes may also be improved with external pacing after all other options have been exhausted. Recurrence of the arrhythmia was prevented from recurring in 14 of 16 cases using transcutaneous overdrive pacing.
