Subaxial cervical spine fractures can be the result of high-energy mechanisms such as motor vehicle accidents and falls from heights to moderate energy mechanisms such as contact and non-contact sports. They can even occur lower energy mechanisms such as ground-level falls. The cervical spine is vulnerable to injury due to the vast amount of motion allowed in this region of the spine.

Vertebral body fractures can take many forms. An anteroinferior teardrop fracture can result from a flexion compression mechanism.

The anterior ligaments, along with the intervertebral disc and posterior ligaments are collectively referred to as the discoligamentous complex (DLC).
