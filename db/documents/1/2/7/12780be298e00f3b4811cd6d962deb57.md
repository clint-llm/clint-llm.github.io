Interprofessional communication involving healthcare providers from multiple disciplines is key for the coordinated care of patients with fungal endophthalmitis. Consultations with internists or infectious disease specialists should be considered in all cases of fungal endophthalmitis in order to help facilitate the diagnostic workup for systemic fungal infections. Likewise, all cases of fungemia should be referred for ophthalmologic and optometry consultation to rule out ocular involvement. [Level 4]

Other specialists that are often involved in the care of patients with fungal endophthalmitis include cardiologists, pulmonologists, and nephrologists. Consultation with cardiologists is required to perform echocardiography to assess for fungal vegetations on heart valves. In cases of Aspergillus endophthalmitis, a pulmonologist will help manage infections of the lungs. Nephrology consultations are necessary when the source of infection is chronic indwelling hemodialysis catheters. Practicing a collaborative andÂ interprofessional team approach will promote improved outcomes for patients with fungal endophthalmitis. Coordinated follow-up with an optometrist working with an ophthalmologist will lead to the best outcomes.
