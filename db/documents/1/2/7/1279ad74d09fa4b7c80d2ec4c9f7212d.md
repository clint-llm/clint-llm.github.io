Dopamine has been cited as a cause of immobility and stupor, and the initial studies researched the role of dopamine in catatonia. However, these studies have been found to be inconclusive.

The N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has been studied extensively both clinically and in mice studies. NMDA encephalitis can produce catatonia-like symptoms.
