At the extreme end of life, patients often develop noisy respiration that is secondary to salivary or bronchial secretions that accumulate in the oropharynx. It is most commonly observed in terminal patients who are too weak to expectorate.Â  Type 1 death rattle is sometimes defined as noisy breathing caused by loss of swallowing reflex in patients near death. Type 1 noisy breathing, sometimes referred to as "true death rattle," is thought to result from the unpredictable accumulation of salivary secretions during the last few hours of the patient's life.

While not FDA labeled specifically for use in death rattle and with limited evidence to support their use, antimuscarinic drugs are often used to mitigate the disturbing symptoms.

The injectable forms of glycopyrrolate and atropine bear an FDA-approved indication for use in peri-operative secretion reduction, though neither has explicit approval for the reduction of noisy breathing near death. Scopolamine hydrobromide injection is available for use outside of the United States and is dosed at 0.3 to 0.6 g to reduce secretions.

A small study performed in thirteen patients demonstrated greater efficacy of glycopyrronium over scopolamine for death rattle.

A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial comparing 1 mg sublingual atropine to placebo found no difference in death rattle, as evidenced by the death rattle scoring system previously used by Back et al.

The timing of pharmacologic intervention may be an important factor that impacts the outcomes. An open-label randomized study performed in 132 patients at the end of life found that hyoscine bromide administered as prophylaxis significantly reduce death rattle, compared to hyoscine bromide administered after the onset of a death rattle.
