Most traumatic pulmonary pseudocysts present within 24 to 48 hours following blunt chest trauma. The clinical presentation is variable and ranges from asymptomatic to acute respiratory distress requiring ventilatory support.

Patients present with hemoptysis 56% of cases, chest pain, and cough. These symptoms are attributable to the pulmonary parenchymal injury but not to the traumatic pneumatocele itself.

Mild fever or leukocytosis usually occurs 12 to 36 hours after trauma. It occurs as a result of the absorption of damaged lung tissue or blood clots; this should not be misinterpreted as infection.

Toxic shock syndrome toxin associated with staph.aureus can present with rash, fever, chills, mucositis, and result in pneumatocele formation during the disease course.

In traumatic pneumatocele, acute respiratory failure is related to the presence of an associated pulmonary contusion.

**Risk factors for developing pneumatocele:**

- Young age, in children high risk

- Post-infection

- Post-traumatic

- Post pneumonic

- HIV

- IV drug use

- Hyper IgE syndrome
