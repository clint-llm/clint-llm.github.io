Turner syndrome results from a deletion or the non-functioning of one X chromosome in females. About half of the population with Turner syndrome have monosomy X (45,XO). The other 50% of the population has a mosaic chromosomal component (45,X with mosaicism).

Some types of anomalies in the X chromosome that can lead to a nonfunctioning X chromosome are as follows

- # Isochromosome Xq, where there are two copies of the long arm of the chromosome that are connected head to head.

- # Ring chromosome, where a part of the ends of short and long arms of the X chromosome is missing

- # Xp or Xq deletion, where the deletion of part of the short armÂ of the X chromosome takes place

Some patients with Turner syndrome can have a Y chromosome mosaicism. Although not a cause of Turner syndrome, the SHOX (short stature homeobox-containing gene on the X- chromosome) is associated with the short stature found in Turner syndrome. Turner syndrome is usually not inherited but is a random event during reproduction.
