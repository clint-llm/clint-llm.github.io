The pathophysiology of middle lobe syndrome varies by type. In obstructive middle lobe syndrome, there is a noticeable decrease in endoluminal diameter in the right middle lobe bronchus or left lingular bronchus due to extraluminal or intraluminal obstruction. The right middle lobe bronchus, in particular, is susceptible to near or total obstruction due to a smaller intraluminal diameter than other lobar bronchi.
