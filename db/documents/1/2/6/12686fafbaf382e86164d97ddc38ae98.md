Corneal lacerations are common in ocular trauma. Repair should occur within 24 hours to reduce the risk of infection, alleviate patient discomfort, and avoid further damage to the eye. The goal for repair is a watertight closure, restoration of normal anatomy, and prevention of high astigmatism or scarring. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of corneal lacerations and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the initial steps for evaluation when evaluating a patient with an eye injury.
- Describe the process for treatment of a corneal laceration.
- Review surgical techniques for repairing a corneal laceration. 
- Summarize the postoperative complications that can occur after a corneal laceration repair.
