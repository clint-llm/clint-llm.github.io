Genetic predisposition, infantile temperament, early childhood environment, and attachment style have all been postulated to play a role in the development of AVPD. The heritability coefficient for AVPD has been estimated to be 0.64.

Studies reveal that the dynamic relationship between temperament and attachment can further exacerbate the development of AVPD. This phenomenon manifests as the already minimally expressive infantâ€™s distress is met with dismissive responsiveness from the caregiver, potentiating maladaptive behavior patterns.
