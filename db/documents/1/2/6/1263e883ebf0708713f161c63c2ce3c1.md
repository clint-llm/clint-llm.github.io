An interprofessional team should treat a patient with leukocyte adhesion deficiency, comprised of a specialty trained genetics nurse, pediatrician, geneticist, clinical immunologist, and an infectious disease specialist. This problem is not treatable in a primary care facility. Parents of a child affected with leukocyte adhesion deficiency should receive counsel about the disease, and the integral management of the patient. Parents also require psychological support.
