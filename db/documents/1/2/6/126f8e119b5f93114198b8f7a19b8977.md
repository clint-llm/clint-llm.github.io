Classic post-operative care for the excisional methods described here includes applying antibiotic ointment, vitamin A and D ointment, and petroleum jelly to promote healing and moisture retainment. Non-adherent dressings and hemostatic agents can be utilized for 7 to 10 days to promote continued hemostasis, reduce infection risk, and accelerate wound healing. The literature reports the use of specialty dressings, including calcium alginate, oxidized cellulose polymer saturated with fibrin sealant, and xeroform petroleum gauze with microfibrillar collagen or triple antibiotic ointment.

Fibrin glue after dermabrasion has been reported with satisfactory healing outcomes.
