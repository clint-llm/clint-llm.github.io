Trigeminal neuralgia causes episodes of spontaneous pain or a triggered intense facial pain limited to one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve that last for a short duration (a few seconds to two minutes).

The distribution of TN pain may be in one or more of the territories of the three divisions: ophthalmic (V1), maxillary (V2), and mandibular (V3). V2 is the most frequent territory involved, followed by V3 and then V1.

Autonomic symptoms (e.g., mild lacrimation without conjunctival injection) may occur in association with TN attacks in the V1 trigeminal distribution. This is in clear contrast to the attacks involving short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headaches with conjunctival injection, tearing, and rhinorrhea (SUNCT), which are always accompanied by lacrimation and conjunctival injection of the symptomatic side from the onset of symptoms.

**Diagnosis and Criteria**

“International Classification of Headache Disorders-3 (ICHD-3) diagnostic criteria.”

- At least three attacks of facial pain, mostly unilateral

- Occurs in one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve and no radiation beyond the trigeminal distribution.

- Pain has all of the following characteristics.

- It lasts from a fraction of a second to nearly two minutes.
- Severe intense pain
- Electric shock-like, shooting, sharp, or stabbing in quality

- Precipitated by innocuous stimuli within the affected trigeminal division

- Not accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis
