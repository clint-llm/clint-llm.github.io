Post-operative monitoring should be tailored to the kind of regional technique performed, in addition to monitoring for recovery from GA. For an epidural, this means hemodynamic monitoring to avoid hypotension, checking ability to void, prevent urinary retention, and also monitor the level of blockade. Continuous catheters should be monitored for dislodgement, disconnection, leakage, the integrity of the sterile occlusive dressing, and signs of infection.

Motor recovery should be monitored and documented for all regional blocks. In cases of same-day surgery, discharge should be permitted only after motor power has been at least partially restored. This reduces the incidence of falls and subsequent injuries. The sensory blockade should be monitored, and pressure points should be padded to prevent pressure-related injuries. Patients who have received neuraxial opioids should be monitored overnight for respiratory depression in the hospital.
