The most common complication is generalized fatigue, reported in three-fourths of patients with GBS and MFS. Recovery tends to be better in patients with MFS. About one-third of all patients still experience pain one year after onset. Severe complications are more likely in patients with an extended ICU stay. These include sepsis, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism from a deep vein thrombosis (e.g., immobilization), and gastrointestinal bleeding. Other complications may arise from patients suffering from autonomic dysfunction including arrhythmias, and ileus. Respiratory muscle fatigue is a feared complication in ICU patients older than 50 years, due to the risk of mortality from respiratory failure. Among severely affected patients, 20 to 33% may be unable to walk for more than 6 months after symptom onset, especially if infected with C. jejuni. Patients may also suffer from chronic psychiatric illness due to persistent pain and disability.
