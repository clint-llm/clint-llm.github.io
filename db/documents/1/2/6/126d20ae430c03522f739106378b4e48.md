The four significant aspects of respiratory mechanics are as follows: lung compliance, chest wall compliance, respiratory rate, and airway resistance. These work in conjunction to create a negative pressure within the lungs and pleural space, allowing air to be drawn into the lungs. Conversely, drops in lung volume increase pressure in the lungs, which forces air out.

The following equation represents lung compliance:  C = V/P, where C is lung compliance, V is lung volume, and P is lung pressure.

Respiratory rate will adjust to meet the needs of the body. As oxygen demand increases and carbon dioxide builds up (i.e., exercise), the lungs will accommodate by increasing the respiratory rate to facilitate diffusion of these gases.

Chest wall compliance counteracts the force of lung compliance, attempting to increase lung volume (contrary to lung compliance where the lungs attempt to decrease volume)

Poiseuille’s law describes airway resistance, the law states: R = (8*n*l)/(pi * r ^4), where R = resistance, n = viscosity of air, l = length of the airway, and r = radius of the airway. It is essential to note the inverse fourth power relationship between the radius of the airway and the resistance. Small adjustments in airway radius will substantially alter the resistance.
