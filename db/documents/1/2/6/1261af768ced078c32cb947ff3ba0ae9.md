Enterocutaneous fistula mortality rates vary from 6 to 33 percent. Associated morbidity and complications can also be significant. Enterocutaneous fistulas most commonly occur as a surgical complication, but can also occur due to trauma, malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease, or ischemia. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of enterocutaneous fistulas and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of enterocutaneous fistulas.
- Describe the typical presentation of a patient with an enterocutaneous fistula.
- Review the treatment and management options available for enterocutaneous fistulas.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of patients with an enterocutaneous fistula and improve outcomes.
