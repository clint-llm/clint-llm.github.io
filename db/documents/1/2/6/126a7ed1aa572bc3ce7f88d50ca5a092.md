The pharyngeal plexus provides the sensory and motor innervation to the pharynx. This innervation forms via contributions from the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves, as wellÂ as branches of the superior cervical ganglion. Specifically, the motor innervation of the STP muscle is mostly from the glossopharyngeal nerve, while the vagus nerve supplies the innervation to the other pharyngeal muscles. The pharyngeal muscles have a high nerve-muscle fiber ratio of 1:2 to 1:6 which allows for precisely coordinated pharyngeal functions.
