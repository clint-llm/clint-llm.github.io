Botulinum toxin is an FDA-approved medication indicated for therapeutic and cosmetic treatments. Managing the care of patients prescribed botulinum toxin for therapeutic purposes requires excellent communication between the patient and an interprofessional team of healthcare providers. These providers include a primary care clinician, a neurologist, a gynecologist, a urologist, and a nurse with their respective therapeutic uses for chronic migraine, post-stroke pain, cervical dystonia, and urinary incontinence from detrusor overactivity. Meanwhile, cosmetic treatments require technique and skill for facial injections, which can be administered in an outpatient clinic setting by a highly skilled nurse or clinician. The recommendation is that site injections are under the clinician's guidance to assure patient safety in case complications do arise. The primary care, specialist, and nurses should be familiar with botulinum toxin, its implications, and adverse effects. The clinicians and nurses require excellent patient rapport, and the patient needs thorough education on the treatment and symptoms of adverse effects. Botulinum toxin injections require routine checkups every three to five months to keep desired outcomes in an optimal range.
