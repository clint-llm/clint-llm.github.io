Ideally, an IAN or LN injury would be identified when it occurs so that repair can be accomplished immediately to maximize the chances of sensory recovery. If the injury is not identified until after the surgery, the likelihood of spontaneous recovery decreases, particularly if there is no improvement within three months. In these cases, surgical intervention should be considered.

It remains unclear, however, what the optimal timepoint is to repair an injured nerve that was identified after the completion of the procedure during which it was injured. The prognosis for sensory recovery after surgical repair of an injured IAN or LN varies among studies; however, a 2021 systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that compared outcomes of surgical repair at different time points after the injury concluded that there is a trend toward better recovery with the earlier repair.

Preferably, the nerve would be reconstructed within 3 to 6 months of the injury, as there seems to be a poorer prognosis for injuries older than nine months at the time of repair.
