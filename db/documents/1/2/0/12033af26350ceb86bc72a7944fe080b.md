There is an FDA black-box warning that severe psychiatric symptoms and neurological impairment may occur during treatment with ziconotide.Â Specifically, patients with a preexisting history of psychosis should not be treated with this medication. Patients should, therefore, be monitored for evidence of cognitive impairment, hallucinations, or changes in mood or consciousness. There is no evidence of withdrawal effects from ziconotide, and therefore, in the event of severe side effects, this medication can be discontinued without tapering.

Since ziconotide must be administered intrathecally, contraindications to intrathecal drug administration apply, for example, infection at the injection site, bleeding disorders, and spinal canal obstruction.
