The pathophysiology of Henoch-Schönlein purpura is not fully understood; however, IgA plays a significant role. IgA-antibody immune complexes caused by antigenic exposure from an infection or medication deposit in the small vessels (usually capillaries) of the skin, joints, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract. This results in an influx of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins. Complement C3 receptor lymphocytes may bind to immune complexes and deposit in the vessel walls contributing to the hyper-inflammatory response. If the immune complexes are deposited in the intestinal wall, they may cause gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Renal involvement of IgA-mediated immune complexes may result in mild proliferative or severe crescentic glomerulonephritis.
