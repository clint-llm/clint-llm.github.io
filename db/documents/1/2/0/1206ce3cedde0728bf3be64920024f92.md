**Medical Therapy**

A standard four-drug regimen, consisting of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, is recommended for ATT in intra-abdominal/gastrointestinal tuberculosis. These four drugs are used thrice weekly for the initial two months, followed by isoniazid and rifampin for an additional four months.

Most treatment guidelines recommend a 6-month course of ATT for luminal TB. Prospective, randomized controlled studies and as well as a Cochrane systematic review have confirmed good cure rates with six months of therapy, instead of 9 months, with the added benefits of reduced cost and increased compliance.

However, when there is a concern for disseminated disease, prolonged therapy may be needed.

Response to ATT occurs by mucosal healing. However, strictures, polyps, and hypertrophic lesions may persist despite the use of ATT.

Drug-induced liver injury during ATT is the most common reason for discontinuation of therapy.

**Endoscopic Intervention**

Endoscopic balloon dilatation has been used for the management of ileal strictures and duodenal strictures.

**Surgical Therapy**

Surgery may be needed in the setting of complications such as obstruction, perforation, and fistulation.

Surgical options are categorized into three main broad groups:

- Bypassing of involved bowel segments - entero-enterostomy, ileo-transverse colostomy. These procedures are not routinely done as they are usually complicated by blind loop syndrome, fistula formation, and recurrent disease in the remaining segments.

- Radical resection of involved segments - hemicolectomy. Tuberculous bowel perforations are usually treated with resection of involved segments and primary anastomosis. This can be combined with effective ATT to eradicate the disease. However, these surgeries are hindered by the malnourished status of most patients, making them poor surgical candidates.

- Conservative surgeries, such as like strictureplasty, in strictures causing more than 50% luminal compromise. Surgery may be needed in patients with persistent strictures while on ATT, as well as those with multiple strictures that are less likely to respond to ATT.
