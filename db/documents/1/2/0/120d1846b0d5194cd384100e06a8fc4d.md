Upon determining a diagnosis of vasomotor rhinitis, educating the patient on avoiding environmental triggers is critical.

A stepwise pharmacologic approach is often implemented, with the initial intervention targeted toward the predominant symptom.

Anticholinergic medications can provide relief from unrelenting rhinorrhea. However, the oral preparations have disturbing systemic side effects such as blurred vision, dry mouth, and thickened secretions. A topical anticholinergic like ipratropium bromide is the first choice for rhinorrhea. Two separate randomized controlled trials demonstrated the effectiveness of ipratropium bromide in controlling rhinorrhea.

Oral antihistamines have a limited role in vasomotor rhinitis, with no specific formulation approved. They tend only to benefit those patients with a sneezing and itching component. Topical antihistamines such as azelastine have approval for both allergic and nonallergic rhinitis. Azelastine is helpful in patients with rhinorrhea and nasal congestion. Azelastine is an H1-receptor antagonist. It also inhibits the synthesis of leukotrienes, kinins, cytokines, and adhesion molecule expression, while providing anti-inflammatory effects unrelated to histamine.

Sympathomimetic medications, specifically topical decongestants, can provide short-term symptomatic relief. Topical decongestants work primarily by stimulating alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoreceptors on the vasculature of the nasal mucosa. This action leads to vasoconstriction, decreased blood flow, and subsequently decreased congestion and rhinorrhea of the nasal cavity. To date, no study has determined the effectiveness of topical decongestants on chronic non-allergic rhinitis. Long-term use of topical decongestants can lead to rebound vasodilation and increased congestion. This condition is termed rhinitis medicamentosa, a form of drug-induced rhinitis. By limiting the use of nasal decongestants to five days and not exceeding the recommended dosing, rhinitis medicamentosa and addiction are avoidable.

Botulinum toxin has also demonstrated a potential role in the treatment of vasomotor rhinitis through its anticholinergic effects.

When medical management alone does not adequately control vasomotor rhinitis symptoms, surgical interventions may be employed. Mucosal sparing inferior turbinate reduction surgery improves obstruction symptoms and acts synergistically with medical therapies.

The therapeutic transection of the vidian nerve is a well-known surgical option for vasomotor rhinitis. The technique aims to disrupt the autonomic nerve supply of the nasal cavity, thus decreasing nasal secretions.

Treating nonallergic rhinitis in pregnancy and the pediatric population presents its own challenges. Management should center around conservative therapy first. Nasal saline irrigations have essentially no risk and may be helpful. If medications are necessary, several options exist. Diphenhydramine may be an option when needed, although with caution in children less than two and in the first trimester of pregnancy. Ipratropium bromide carries a category B rating and is safe in children as young as six. As discussed above, budesonide is the only topical nasal steroid with a category B rating. Fluticasone is safe to use in patients as young as four years of age. Topical decongestants can be used on a limited basis in children as young as 6. Oxymetazoline is the decongestant of choice in both pregnancy and pediatric populations.
