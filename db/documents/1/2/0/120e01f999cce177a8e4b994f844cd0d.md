A neuropsychologist consult should be done to test the baseline cognitive function better and to create a cognitive treatment plan. Unfortunately, medications for frontal lobe syndrome are mainly aimed to treat symptomatically. During hospitalizations, care should be given to providing a safe and secure environment. Given the complexity and variability within frontal lobe syndrome, cases require an interprofessional team involving nurses, therapists, physicians, and social workers. It is important to plan for a family meeting to discuss end-of-life care should patients no longer have the capacity to make decisions. Non-medical treatments include physical and occupational therapy, especially in diseases such as frontotemporal dementia. Speech therapy may also be helpful for symptoms like aphasia, apraxia, and dysarthria.
