Intramural hematoma of the esophagus is rare. This condition presents as an acute esophageal condition in patients who either have a bleeding tendency or are on anticoagulation therapy. It is more common in those who have had esophageal instrumentation or a possible traumatic mucosal injury though spontaneous IHE is also possible. With an increasingly older population who have cardiovascular risks on anticoagulation, it is essential to recognize and diagnose this condition early. Misdiagnosis of IHE as other cardiopulmonary diseases could lead to a potentially dangerous complication with the use of anticoagulation or thrombolytic therapy.
