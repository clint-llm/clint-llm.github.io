The parathyroid glands’ function is to maintain serum calcium homeostasis through synthesis and release of PTH. At the bone, PTH inhibits osteoblast activity and stimulates osteoclast activity leading to bone breakdown and calcium release. At the kidneys, PTH increases calcium reabsorption and blocks phosphate reabsorption from the tubules. PTH also acts at the kidneys to stimulate the formation of vitamin D. Vitamin D is an essential component of calcium and phosphate homeostasis, yielding its effects on the kidneys and gastrointestinal (GI) system.

**Skeletal System**

PTH works at the cellular level by indirectly stimulating osteoclasts to break down bone. PTH binds to cell receptors on osteoblasts stimulating the release of Receptor Activator of Nuclear factor Kappa-B Ligand (RANKL). RANKL binds to its receptor on osteoclast precursors, stimulating them to fuse into mature osteoclasts thereby increasing calcium resorption from bone.

**Renal System**

PTH has 2 main roles in the kidney. It works in the thick ascending loop of Henle, distal convoluted tubule (DCT), and collecting ducts to increase reabsorption of calcium by up-regulating TRPV5, a calcium transporter on the tubular epithelium. PTH also binds to sites in the proximal tubule that block phosphate reabsorption. Therefore, the net effect of PTH is to decrease calcium excretion and increase phosphate excretion in the urine. Additionally, PTH works at the proximal tubule of the kidneys to up-regulate translation of alpha-1-hydroxylase, the enzyme responsible for generating the biologically active form of vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D or calcitriol). Vitamin D binds to receptors in the bone that function similarly to PTH, increasing serum calcium. In the kidney, vitamin D increase both calcium and phosphate reabsorption.

**Gastrointestinal System**

Calcium absorption occurs in the small intestines, with 70% to 80% being absorbed in the ileum. Although PTH has no direct effects on the small intestine, the downstream effects of PTH on vitamin D synthesis occur at this level. Vitamin D increases calcium and phosphate absorption from the gut. Vitamin D receptors occur along the entirety of the gut epithelium, and studies have shown that both paracellular and transcellular absorption of calcium increase when they are stimulated. Vitamin D works by increasing transcription and translation of calcium transport proteins in the epithelium including TRPV6, calbindin, and ATP-dependent calcium pumps.
