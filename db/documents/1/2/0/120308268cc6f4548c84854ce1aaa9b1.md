Traumatic glaucoma is a type of secondary glaucoma occurring because of various mechanisms related to the trauma of the eye. Eye trauma can be divided into two categories: closed—globe injuries and open-globe injuries.

All types of ocular trauma have the potential to cause an elevation of the intraocular pressure (IOP) in the affected eye through various mechanisms. Without appropriate treatment, this can lead to irreversible glaucomatous damage to the optic nerve and potentially permanent loss of visual function.

In this review, glaucoma and ocular hypertension, i.e., those without glaucomatous optic disc changes, will be collectively known as ‘traumatic glaucoma’ to not only facilitate readability but also because optic nerve examination and visual field testing, two of the main modalities to diagnose glaucoma and distinguish it from ocular hypertension, can be challenging to perform in these trauma patients.
