In a few cases, there is evidence of the resolution of spontaneous intracranial hypotension in a time frame of 2 weeks.

In others, the condition can go on for months or even years in rare cases. If intermittent CSF leaks are occurring with intervals of weeks or months, they can produce intermittent headaches with no symptoms in between.

In nearly 10 percent of patients afflicted with spontaneous leakage of the CSF, the condition will reoccur despite the proper treatment.
