As migraine headache is a clinical diagnosis, providers need to be aware of various presentations of migraine, to reduce unnecessary investigations and neuroimaging. Optimal management will require the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team. A good history and physical examination can rule out other differentials and help diagnose migraine. An interprofessional approach is necessary for the management of patients with migraines. Neurologists should be involved in patient care when a primary care provider is unsure of the diagnosis. With proper management, most patients with migraine headaches have a good prognosis. Neuroscience and pain control nurses can work with patients on lifestyle changes and educate them about the use of medications. Pharmacists must review prescriptions, consult with the prescriber on optimal agent selection, check for drug-drug interactions, and inform patients about usage and side effects. Nurses can help monitor and reinforce medication teaching points and serve as a contact point connecting clinicians and other team members.

All team members must document all observations in the patient's medical record and reach out to the appropriate team members for necessary therapeutic interventions. These interprofessional efforts will help drive better outcomes for patients with migraine headaches. [Level 5]
