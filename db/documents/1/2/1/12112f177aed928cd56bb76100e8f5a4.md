Symptoms of clobazam overdose are almost similar to other typical benzodiazepines, which include CNS depression, drowsiness, dizziness, hypotension, respiratory depression, confusion and lethargy, ataxia, and rarely coma or death. These symptoms can become aggravated with concomitant use of other CNS depressing agents/medications like alcohol. In general, overdose monitoring includes airway protection, hemodynamic monitoring, IV fluid replenishment for hypotension. The usual antidote for benzodiazepine overdose is flumazenil; however, its use in clobazam toxicity has not been well established.
