Multiple studies have shown that airway suctioning should be done as needed or based on clinical parameters, including pulse oximetry levels, respiratory rate, or visible secretions in the airway. Optimal suctioning helps reduce airway obstruction and the incidence of atelectasis, which leads to hypoxemia and impaired gas exchange.
