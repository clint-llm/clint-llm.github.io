FL originates from germinal/follicular center B cells. Most cases of FL show at (14;18) (q32;q21), which leads to an overexpression of BCL2, an anti-apoptotic protein. About 5% of FL have BCL-6 deregulating mutations. BCL-6 is required for germinal center formation. BCL-6 related protein is a repressor of transcription and modulates the interleukin-4 response of B-cells
