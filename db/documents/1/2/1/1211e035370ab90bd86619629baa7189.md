The pathophysiology of Fournier gangrene involves a synergistic infectious process involving anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. The bacterial infection starts with an initial insult such as a urinary tract infection, perineal abscess, localized cellulitis, recent surgical manipulation of the genital or perineal area, or even a simple scratch or pimple. The synergistic activity of the bacterial infection leads to bacterial production of tissue-destructive enzymes, collagenases, and endotoxins, causing obliterative endarteritis with micro thromboses of subcutaneous vessels.
