Further workup is essential in learning the etiology and acuity.

- Send a blood sample immediately to be typed and cross-matched - so blood can be readied

- Complete blood count (CBC): to assess the hemoglobin and hematocrit

- It is important to note that in an actively bleeding patient, the hematocrit level on initial presentation could be normal

- Follow serial CBCs with suspicion of acute bleeding

- Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) classifies the anemia as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic:

- Microcytic anemias (usually defined as MCV less than 80 fL) include the mnemonic TAILS: thalassemia, anemia of chronic disease, iron deficiency, and sideroblastic/sickle cell disease
- Normocytic anemias (MCV 80 to 100 fL) include anemias due to active bleeding, hemolysis, or malignancy
- Macrocytic anemias (usually defined as MCV greater than 100 fL): anemias related to alcohol, folate and vitamin B-12 deficiencies (pernicious anemia), and some preleukemic conditions

- LDH, haptoglobin, bilirubin, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels

- in hemolytic anemia, LDH and indirect bilirubin are elevated, and haptoglobin is low
- an elevated BUN is common in patients with upper GI bleeds, due to undigested blood

- Reticulocyte count: erythropoietic response by the bone marrow assessment is via the reticulocytes; there will be an increase in both percentage of reticulocytes and the absolute reticulocyte count (the more definitive parameter). 

- Reticulocytosis correlates with an increased mean corpuscular volume (MCV) in the blood count
- A low value may suggest an inadequate bone marrow response: this occurs with aplastic anemia, hematologic cancers, drugs, or toxins

- Screening labs for DIC: prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen, fibrin split products, and platelets

- Findings associated with DIC include increased coagulation times, decreased platelets and fibrinogen, and fibrin split products
- DIC should be a diagnostic consideration in patients with severe sepsis, complications with giving birth, burns, malignancies, or uncontrolled hemorrhage

Other tests that merit consideration include:

- Iron studies

- Folate and vitamin B-12 levels

- Lead levels

- Hemoglobin electrophoresis

- Factor deficiency tests

- Bleeding time

- Bone marrow aspiration

- Coombs test

Imaging:

- Ultrasound: a quick and noninvasive way for diagnosing intraperitoneal bleeding. The focused abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST) examination is commonly performed to diagnose intra-abdominal hemorrhage in unstable trauma patients

- Chest x-ray: useful in trauma patients. Can look for hemothorax, pulmonary contusions, aortic rupture, or free air under the diaphragm with suspected GI bleeding

- CT: useful for a patient with GI trauma causing bleeds

- Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD): for diagnostic and treatment an upper GI bleed

- Sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy for diagnosis a lower GI bleed
