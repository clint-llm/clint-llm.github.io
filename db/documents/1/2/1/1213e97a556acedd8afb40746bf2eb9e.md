Indomethacin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drug with broad applications. It inhibits the synthesis of prostaglandins produced primarily by cyclooxygenase enzymes which are critical mediators of inflammation, fever, and pain. Indomethacin is FDA-approved to manage acute pain, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritis, bursitis, gouty arthritis, and patent ductus arteriosus. This activity reviews the indications, action, and contraindications of indomethacin as a valuable agent. In addition, this activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, and relevant interactions) pertinent to members of the interprofessional healthcare team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the FDA-approved and off-label indications for indomethacin.
- Describe the mechanism of action of the therapeutic effects of indomethacin.
- Review the adverse event profile of indomethacin.
- Outline some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance indomethacin therapy, improve outcomes, and minimize adverse events.
