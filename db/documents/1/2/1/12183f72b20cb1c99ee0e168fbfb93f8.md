The epidemiology of CO2 narcosis is difficult to ascertain due to all the possible disease entities contributing to it. Given that most hypercapnia cases result from lung diseases that increase dead space, one can make a generalized estimation. Approximately 5% of the US population is affected by COPD, and it appears to be more prevalent in women than men. Of this 5%, not all patients with COPD will develop CO2 narcosis. The prevalence of COPD increases as age increases but is more common over the age of 45.
