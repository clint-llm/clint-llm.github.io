Children with focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS) typically present with full-blown nephrotic syndrome (edema, massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hypercholesterolemia). Adults can have nephrotic or sub-nephrotic proteinuria, hypertension, microscopic hematuria, or renal insufficiency. Patients with primary FSGS often have profound hypoalbuminemia and edema, but these are rare in secondary forms.

It is essential to obtain an extensive history, including birth history (low birth weight/premature birth, congenital renal malformations), family history, medical comorbidities, pre-existing renal disease, exposure to drugs/toxins, recent viral illnesses, and family history to identify secondary causes of FSGS.

Generally, edema develops over a few weeks; however, the onset may be abrupt, with sudden weight gain of 15-20 lbs (6.8 to 9 kg) or more. Frequently, a recent upper respiratory tract infection precedes edema.

Pleural effusion and ascites could be present, although pericardial effusions are rare. Gross edema could predispose patients to infections and ulcerations in dependent areas, such as the lower extremities. Abdominal pain may be a sign of peritonitis, a common finding in children. Rarely, xanthomas may be seen in cases of severe hyperlipidemia. In many patients, physical examination is normal except for edema. Severe hypertension is not uncommon, particularly in Black patients with renal impairment.
