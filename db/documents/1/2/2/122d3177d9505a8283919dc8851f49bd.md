A cuboid-navicular coalition deformity that has exhausted conservative treatment is treatable with surgical resection and interposition of an adipose graft.

Surgical intervention is a consideration for cuboid fractures in which lateral column length and/or joint congruency have suffered compromise. The purpose of surgery in these cases is to restore lateral column length and anatomy of surrounding joints to avoid functional and biomechanical consequences and prevent adverse effects such as stiffness, arthritis, and deformity. Surgical techniques of cuboid fractures include external fixators, open reduction and internal fixation, bone grafting, and/or joint fusion.
