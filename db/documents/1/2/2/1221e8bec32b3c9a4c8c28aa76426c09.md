Other complications may relate to preoperative systemic chemotherapy and include steatohepatitis, sinusoidal obstruction, leukopenia, system infections, fever, fatigue, weight loss, poor wound healing, and other potential side effects. Radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) can occur if the dose to the whole liver exceeds known toxicity thresholds that depend on volume, dose, and fractionation. Other complications of external beam radiotherapy include bowel perforation and spinal cord injury.
