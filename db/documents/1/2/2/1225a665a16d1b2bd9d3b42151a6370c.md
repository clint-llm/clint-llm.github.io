Horner syndrome is a complication born from interruption of the sympathetic innervation to the eye and adnexa at varying levels, most commonly of the neck, resulting in increased parasympathetic input. It presents with the classic triad of ipsilateral ptosis, pupillary miosis, and facial anhidrosis. It can be a complication of neck surgeries that damage the sympathetic input.

Hyperhidrosis, otherwise known as excessive sweating, is a common indication for minimally invasive thoracic sympathectomy. Hyperhidrosis is excessive sweating beyond the organismâ€™s physiological need to sweat to have a temperature within an adequate range. Removing the sympathetic input to the part of the body affected by hyperhidrosis is an acceptable and well-tolerated treatment.
