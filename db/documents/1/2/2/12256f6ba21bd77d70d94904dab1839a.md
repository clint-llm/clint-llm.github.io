- Congenital myotonic dystrophy (CMD) is an autosomal dominant neuromuscular disorder with multisystem involvement. It is a subtype of myotonic dystrophy type 1. Features include severe hypotonia and generalized muscle weakness; myotonia is classically absent in infancy.Â 

- Severe CDM will require intensive care mainly for feeding and respiratory support. Gastric/jejunum feeding tube, and tracheostomy for mechanical ventilation, and splinting of talipes is occasionally commenced.

- Mutation in the DMPK gene, located on chromosome 19q13.3, results in the expansion of DNA (CTG) repeats.

- Targeted molecular genetic testing of the DMPK gene appears positive for a heterozygous pathogenic variant in nearly 100% of affected individuals.

- The multidisciplinary team approach is critical for symptom management, surveillance, and family support.

- The mortality rate is up to 40% in the neonatal period due to respiratory diseases. The mean life expectancy is 45 years.
