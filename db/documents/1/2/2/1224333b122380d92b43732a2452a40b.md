Balanitis xerotica obliterans is a condition that requires the interprofessional contributions of primary care physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and consulting services, including dermatology and urology. Prescription topical corticosteroids will be used for symptomatic patients. Surgery will be required in a large percentage of patients who continue to have symptoms despite topical therapy. Circumcision and the need for additional surgical intervention may be required.

Follow up with both primary care physicians and the consulting services is important to prevent further progression of inflammatory changes to squamous cell cancer or evidence of urinary difficulty from stricture disease. Clinicians should prepare patients for signs and symptoms to watch for, and when disease progressions occur, a urology consultation should be placed for further treatment.
