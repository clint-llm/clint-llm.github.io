Patients with UGH syndrome should be educated on their conditions, including their ocular manifestations, treatment, and complications. Complicated cataract surgery and complications afterward cause a significant impairment both in terms of vision and mental well-being. The patient should be well motivated and educated about the nature of the condition and the benefits of timely intervention.

Careful counseling is needed for such persons because the management depends upon the cause of the prevailing condition. The management options include explantation of the intraocular lens or the implant or other procedures to reduce the damage. All the conditions should be assessed beforehand, like the patients' ability to lay supine and any other coexisting medical conditions that may further add to the complications.
