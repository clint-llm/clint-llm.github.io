Thymectomy is the resection of the thymus gland and is most commonly performed for patients with myasthenia gravis and thymoma. It is currently performed utilizing a minimally invasive approach with the use of video-assisted thoracoscopic or robotic-assisted surgery. Historically a median sternotomy was performed. This activity reviews thymectomy and the interprofessional team's role in evaluating and treating patients who undergo this procedure.
