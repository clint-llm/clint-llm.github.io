The surgical relevance of the conjoined tendon is anatomical consideration during inguinal hernia repair. Techniques such as McVay, Bassini, and Shouldice involve suturing through the conjoint tendon to repair the weakness of the inguinal canal floor.

A weakness in the conjoint tendon causes a type of direct herniation known as Bugosa herniation or a Gill-Ogilvie hernia.
