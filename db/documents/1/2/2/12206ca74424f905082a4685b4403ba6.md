Treatment of retinoblastoma involves a multidisciplinary approach involving an ophthalmologist,Â  pediatric oncologist, ocular pathologist, geneticist, allied health professional, and parents. Different treatment modalities employed in the treatment of retinoblastoma are;

**CHEMOTHERAPY**is the mainstay of treatment. It is also used in combination with local therapies. Intravenous carboplatin, etoposide, and vincristine are used in three to six cycles depending upon the grade of retinoblastoma. Single carboplatin****or dual agent therapy can also be used and has shown favorable results in selective patients such as bridging therapy to avoid aggressive measures. Intravitreal melphalan is used in cases of vitreous seeding although it carries a small risk of extraocular dissemination. Chemoreduction is followed by cryotherapy or transpupillary thermal therapy to maximize tumor control.

**TTT (Transpupillary thermal therapy)**is used mostly for focal consolidation after chemotherapy; however, it can be used as an isolated treatment. TTT has a direct effect but also augments the effects of chemotherapy.

**CRYOTHERAPY:**the****triple freeze-thaw technique is an option for pre equatorial tumors without deeper invasion or vitreous seedings.

**BRACHYTHERAPY**is used for an anterior tumor when there is no vitreous seeding and in cases of resistance to chemotherapy.

**EXTERNAL BEAM RADIOTHERAPY**is avoided when possible, especially in the case of heritable retinoblastoma****because it can result in a second malignancy. Retinoblastomas are radiosensitive, but adverse effects include cataract, radiation neuropathy, radiation retinopathy, and hypoplasia of orbit.

**ENUCLEATION:**enucleation is performed when there is infiltration of the anterior chamber, neovascular glaucoma, invasion of the optic nerve, and if the tumor comprises more than half of the vitreous volume. It is also useful when chemotherapy has failed and in cases of diffuse retinoblastoma due to poor visual prognosis and a high risk of recurrence. Minimal manipulation should take place when performing enucleation, and a portion of the optic nerve of about 10 mm requires excision.

**EXTRAOCULAR EXTENSION**Adjuvant chemotherapy for 6 months is given following enucleation when there is retrolaminar or massive choroidal spread. When the extension of the tumor is up to the cut end of the optic nerve at enucleation, or it is through the sclera, then external beam radiation is used.

**REVIEW**careful follow-up at repeated intervals is required after treatment for early diagnosis of recurrence or development of new tumor, especially in patients with inherited disease.
