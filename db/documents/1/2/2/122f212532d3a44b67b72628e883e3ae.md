Chagas disease is a vector-borne disease commonly transmitted through contact with contaminated feces/urine of the reduviid bug, also known as the kissing bug or triatomine bug. It is this insect which in turn carries the causative agent, the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Currently, there are 11 different species of the triatomine bug. The most common species in the southern United States are Triatoma sanguisuga and Triatoma gerstaeckeri. The main vectors for Mexico, Central, and South America are Rhodnius prolixus and Triatoma dimidiata. Both sexes of reduviid bug take its blood meal at night, but female bugs must take blood meals to lay their eggs. As it takes the meal or even after the meal, they defecate and expels parasites in the feces/urine near mucous membranes, commonly the mouth or eyes. The parasite then enters through the mucous membrane, or through an open bite wound. Feces of infected reduviid bugs carry the largest number of the infectious trypomastigote form.

Other mode transmissions include:

- Vertical transmission from mother to fetus leading to congenital Chaga's disease

- Organ transplantation

- Transfusion of blood and blood products
