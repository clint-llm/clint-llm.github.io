Early rehabilitative intervention is key to improve functional outcomes and quality of life. Early mobilization and stretching can help patients maintain a range of motion for future applications with gait, hygiene, and activities of daily living (ADLs). Most patients have a combination of upper and lower motor neuron symptoms and have varying motor control requiring individualized therapy plans. Patients will also typically require orthotics for joint stabilization, prevention of deformity, gait, and overall improved function. They will also require assistive devices such as crutches, canes, walkers, or wheelchairs for support. Some may require assistive devices for ADLs. Patients should participate in physical and occupational therapy over the long term. Some may require speech therapy for dysphagia, dysarthria, vocal cord paralysis, and cognitive training. Neuropsychology would also be important in the early stages of adolescence to assist with adjustment to complications as they arrive. However, research shows that despite the risk of significant complications, only 5% of patients develop depression.
