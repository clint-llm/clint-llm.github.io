Chronic anemia is a very common condition seen in day-to-day clinical practice and managed in outpatient settings. Anemia management can range from simple to complex based on the underlying condition causing it. Most of the time patient's primary care physician needs help with a specialist based on underlying condition either a gastroenterologist or a hematologist or a nephrologist or a gynecologist. It is very important to have good interprofessional communication and care coordination for the management of anemia appropriately and promptly. This would help both in correcting anemia and treating underlying conditions.
