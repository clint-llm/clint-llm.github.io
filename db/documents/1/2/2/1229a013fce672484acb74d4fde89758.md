Medial medullary syndrome is a form of stroke that affects the medial medulla of the brain. It is usually caused by atherothrombotic occlusion of paramedian branches of the anterior spinal artery, the vertebral artery, or the basilar artery. To avoid the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of medial medullary syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the etiology of medial medullary syndrome.
- Describe the pathophysiology of medial medullary syndrome.
- Review the clinical features of medial medullary syndrome.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with medial medullary syndrome.
