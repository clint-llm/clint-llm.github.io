Patients presenting with Goodpasture syndrome (both glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage) may be critically ill on presentation. Urgent hemodialysis often is needed for standard indications, and intubation for respiratory failure may be necessary. When the clinician suspects the diagnosis, a kidney biopsy should be done as soon as the clinical situation allows.

Upon diagnosis, patients should be started on prednisone, cyclophosphamide, and daily plasmapheresis to improve overall mortality in general and renal survival in particular.

Typically, daily plasmapheresis is performed until anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies are undetectable, with steroid and cyclophosphamide continuing after that for 3 to 6 months until full remission is achieved. This can be gauged by checking repeated titers following plasmapheresis, as well as any time new symptoms develop that could be a harbinger of relapse. Overall, relapse remains rare. The starting dose of cyclophosphamide is 2 mg/kg orally, adjusted to keep a white cell count of approximately 5000. Treatment of acute life-threatening alveolar hemorrhage is with IV methylprednisolone pulse therapy 1g/day for 3 days, followed by a tapering dose at 1 to 1.5 mg/kg orally.

Rituximab has been found to have a role in some studies in which the conclusion was that it led to the undetectable levels of anti-GBM antibodies.
