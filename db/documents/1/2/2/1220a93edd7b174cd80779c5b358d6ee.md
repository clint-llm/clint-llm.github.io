Toxicity from sympathomimetic agents occurs both from prescription and nonprescription drugs. In addition, many modified illegal sympathomimetic agents also are available on the street.

- The toxicity of sympathomimetic agents occurs within minutes after intravenous administration. However, there are many sustained-released products that increase the duration of action.

- Overall, almost all sympathomimetic agents, when consumed orally, are absorbed into the systemic circulation. These include ketamine, marijuana, gamma hydroxybutyrate, cocaine, and methamphetamine.

- Many of these agents are used at rave parties where the rooms are hot and humid, and dehydration and hyperthermia may play a role in their absorption and toxicity.

- Crack cocaine and methamphetamine are frequently abused via inhalation or intravenously, which is known to produce immediate effects compared to the oral route.

- The half-life of methamphetamine is much longer than that ofÂ amphetamine by 4 to 20 hours, and this accounts for its popularity.

- The classic sympathomimetic, cocaine, is rapidly absorbed into the systemic system when taken intranasally, intravenously, or via inhalation. Its effect can be seen within 15 minutes, and it is demethylated in the liver
