The potential complication of the untreated condition includes poor linear growth, osseous deformities, multiple pathological fractures, hydrocephalus, increased intracranial hypertension (ICH), abnormal dentition (dental caries, dental hypoplasia, delayed dentition). Persistent hypocalcemia can lead to complications such as skeletal and cardiac myopathy, seizures, and eventual death.
