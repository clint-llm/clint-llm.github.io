A plica is a band of thick, fibrotic tissue that extends from the synovial capsule of a joint. The knee is the joint most commonly affected by plica tissue. As a result of overuse or injury, plica can become inflamed or irritated due to friction across the patella or the medial femoral condyle leading to plica syndrome. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of plica syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients affected by this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the symptoms consistent with plica syndrome.
- Review physical exam findings consistent with plica syndrome.
- Summarize the role of imaging in the diagnosis of plica syndrome.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the diagnosis and management of plica syndrome and improve outcomes.
