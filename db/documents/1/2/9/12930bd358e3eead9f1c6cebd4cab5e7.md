The anatomy of the vulva and vulvar vestibule is very important to understand vulvodynia.

The vulva and vulvar vestibule: the vulva is the external female genitalia, which includes the mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora, clitoral hood, clitoris, and vestibule. The vulva is innervated by the anterior labial branches of the ilioinguinal nerve, genitofemoral nerve, and branches of the pudendal nerves. The pudendal nerve divides into three branches near the medial aspect of the ischial tuberosity: (1) the dorsal nerve of the clitoris, (2) the perineal nerve which innervates the labia majora and perineum, and (3) the inferior rectal nerve which innervates the perianal area. The pudendal nerve also innervates the external anal sphincter and deep muscles of the urogenital triangle.

The pelvic floor muscles are divided into three categories:

- The superficial pelvic floor muscles (bulbocavernosus, ischiocavernosus, and superficial transverse perineal muscle) are collectively known as the urogenital diaphragm. These muscles control sexual function, e.g., clitoral engorgement, vaginal closure, and reflexive response to enhance sexual pleasure, and facilitate closure of the urethra and anus for continence.

- The middle layer consists of the sphincter urethra and deep, transverse perineal muscle.

- The deep pelvic floor muscles are sometimes called the anal triangle. They are the levator ani (pubococcygeus, iliococcygeus, and puborectalis) and coccygeus. The piriformis, obturator internus muscles and the gluteus maximus are associated pelvic and hip muscles. The perineal body is the central tendon and attachment site for the pelvic floor muscles. These muscles support the abdominal viscera, provide pelvic and spinal stability, assist in respiration, provide sphincteric closure for bowel and bladder, and have a role in sexual function.

The internal pudendal artery, vein, and nerve pass through the Alcock canal and provide a neurovascular function for the pelvic floor musculature.
