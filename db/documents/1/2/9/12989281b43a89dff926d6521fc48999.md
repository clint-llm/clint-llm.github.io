# Introduction

The filling of root canals, commonly referred to as obturation, is a critical step in successful root canal treatment (RCT). The goals of obturation are twofold: to create an apical seal and fill the root canal without incorporating voids within the filling material.

The ability to adequately obturate a root canal is directly related to the preceding step of cleaning and shaping. Cleaning and shaping refer to the mechanical and chemical preparation of a root canal to remove organic and inorganic matter. A canal that has been poorly cleaned and shaped will result in equally poor obturation and is one of the strongest indicators of treatment failure.

Root canals are 3D structures with complex and unique anatomy, and no two are alike. Achieving a 3D obturation with complete coronal, lateral, and apical seals is essential for long-term success.

There are countless materials and techniques for obturation. Most techniques employ the use of a sealer and a core filling material in order to ensure complete obturation. This activity will discuss available sealers and proceed to core obturation materials.

# Classification

**Root Canal Sealers**

The role of the sealer is critical for establishing a fluid-tight seal of the root canal as it fills the vacant space between the prepared dentinal wall and the core filling material.

Most sealers are toxic before setting, so care should be taken to avoid the extrusion of sealers into the periapical tissues.

Several types of sealers are available, which vary in formulation and properties. They are classified into five main groups according to their composition: zinc oxide eugenol (ZOE) based, calcium hydroxide based, glass ionomer-based, resin-based, and bioceramic sealers.

The properties of an ideal sealer have been outlined in the literature. It is important to note that no material has been proven to eliminate leakage completely nor fulfill all the ideals.

Properties of an ideal sealer material:

- Ability to establish a fluid-tight seal

- Radiopaque (to be visible on radiographs)

- Antimicrobial

- Non-shrinking upon setting

- Non-staining

- Non-irritating to periapical tissues

- Insoluble in tissue fluid

- Biocompatible

**Core Obturation Materials**

Core materials exist to fill the bulk of the root canal space and act as a plug to prevent any leakage or ingress of foreign material. They take up most of the area within the canal and rely on the sealer to fill any voids or irregular spaces between it and the canal walls. Although other materials have been fabricated in recent years, gutta-percha remains the most widely used and accepted core filling material.

Properties of an ideal core obturation material:

- Ease of manipulation

- Dimensional stability

- Excellent sealing ability (apically and laterally)

- Non-irritating to periapical tissues

- Radiopaque (to be visible on radiographs)

- Non-staining or discoloring

- Antimicrobial

- Biocompatible

# Properties

**Root Canal Sealers**

**Zinc Oxide Eugenol Sealers**

Zinc oxide eugenol (ZOE)-based sealers are the most used sealers in clinical endodontics. They present as a powder-liquid or a two-paste preparation.

Notable properties of ZOE sealers include absorption if they are extruded into the surrounding tissues and anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects.

**Calcium Hydroxide Sealers**

Calcium hydroxide is a widely used material in clinical dentistry due to its therapeutic properties for dental pulp in procedures such as pulp capping and apexification.

Several calcium hydroxide-based sealers are available, which vary in terms of antibacterial effect, cytotoxicity, and solubility.****Their sealing capacity to provide an appropriate seal has proven similar to ZOE sealers.

**Glass Ionomer Sealers**

Clinicians advocating for the use of glass ionomer (GI) sealers as an obturation material do so due to their dentin-bonding properties.

**Resin Sealers**

Resin sealers are non-eugenol sealers that provide excellent adhesion to the canal walls.

**Bioceramic Sealers**

Bioceramic sealers are biocompatible materials that use either calcium silicate or calcium phosphate as their main constituent.

MTA is activated with the introduction of water and produces a highly alkaline mixture with a pH of 12 and beneficial hydrates of calcium silicate. These hydrates make MTA an excellent endodontic material as they form on the surface of existing calcium silicate particles and continue to grow inwards, effectively creating a barrier.

**Core Obturation Materials**

**Silver Cones**

Silver cones (also referred to as silver points) are a historic obturation material that is no longer used in modern endodontics. The original basis for their use stemmed from the belief that they had an oligodynamic property (heavy metals' capacity to exert a bactericidal effect) that led to the destruction of intracanal microbes.

**Gutta-Percha**

Gutta-percha (GP) is the most commonly used core obturation material in modern endodontics.

The popularity of gutta-percha as an obturation material stems from its variable chemical composition. GP exists in two crystalline phases, alpha, and beta, and can cycle between these phases when heated is applied or removed. The alpha phase of GP occurs when it is heated and produces a tacky material that can flow under pressure. Alternatively, the beta phase is when the GP is unheated, forming a solid mass of compactable material.

Gutta-percha has many advantages, such as ease of manipulation, radiopacity, low toxicity, and plasticity. But, it does not bond to dentin and shrinks when cooled.

Gutta-percha cones are available in standardized 0.02 taper as specified by the International Organization of Standardization (ISO) and non-standardized sizes.

**Bioceramic Materials**

Bioceramics, in particular MTA, can also be utilized as a core filling material. In addition to the aforementioned chemical properties of MTA, it is commonly used as an endodontic material due to its many beneficial characteristics. These include a long set time, a low relative compressive strength, high fracture resistance, and both antibacterial and antifungal properties.

**Other Core Materials**

There are various other core obturation materials commercially available; however, no statistical difference in terms of reduction in leakage has been noted between them and gutta-percha.

# Indications

Several key characteristics should be kept in mind when selecting sealers and core obturation materials. Firstly, most sealers are soluble and subject to dissolution when they come into contact with tissue fluids.

Lastly, most sealers experience shrinkage upon setting and can result in void space being created between the core material and the dentinal wall, with the exception of bioceramic sealers exhibiting expansion upon setting.

# Contraindications

There are few true contraindications for sealers and core obturation materials. One major contraindication is an allergy to any component of the material.

# Technique

**Root Canal Sealers**

Several techniques are used to insert the sealer into the root canal and ensure that it evenly coats the prepared surface. One technique utilizes a screw-like file that attaches to a slow-speed handpiece called lentulo spiral.

**Core Obturation Materials**

Since there are numerous types of obturation materials, there are several ways to insert them into the root canal, and as a result, this section will focus primarily on the insertion technique of gutta-percha (GP). GP has two main obturation techniques, cold lateral condensation (CLC) and warm vertical compaction (WVC).

The cold lateral condensation technique involves the selection of a master GP cone, the use of spreaders, and the insertion of secondary GP cones.

The master cone is inserted into the canal to the working length, followed by the spreader, which, if properly selected, should reach 2 mm shorter. The spreader is then rotated and withdrawn from the canal, and the matching GP cone is inserted into the vacant space.

The warm vertical compaction technique also uses a master GP cone, Schilder pluggers, and a heat source.

# Clinical Significance

The goal of root canal obturation is to ensure that any residual microorganisms remaining after canal cleaning and disinfection are completely entombed, thus preventing future proliferation and subsequent reinfection.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

A well-sealed root canal system provides the patient with the best possible treatment outcome. Ensuring an adequately filled root canal requires collaboration between dentists, endodontists, dental radiologists, and dental assistants. Dental nurses/assistants play a central role, as they are in charge of mixing and manipulating the sealers and core filling materials and handing them to the dentist. Root canal therapy is full of intricacies that require excellent interprofessional communication. This ensures that clinicians arrive at a proper diagnosis, generate clear imaging, and determine the best technique to perform the procedure, including which material to use to fill the root canal.
