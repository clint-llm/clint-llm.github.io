Prader Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare and complex genetic disease. The condition has numerous implications on metabolic, endocrine, and neurologic systems. It also presents with behavior and intellectual difficulties as well. PWS is mainly characterized by severe hypotonia with feeding difficulties in the first years of life followed by global developmental delays, hyperphagia, and gradual development of morbid obesity at about three years of age. It is also recognizable by typical facial features, strabismus, and other musculoskeletal conditions. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of Prader Willi Syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional clinical team in improving care for patients with the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of Prader Willi Syndrome, medical conditions and emergencies.
- Review the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of Prader Willi Syndrome.
- Describe the treatment and management options available for Prader Willi Syndrome.
- Identify some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance Prader Willi Syndrome and improve outcomes.
