The marginal artery, also known as the artery of Drummond, supplies the proximal descending colon at the splenic flexure. The artery of Drummond is an arterial arcade formed by an anastomosis between the distal branches of the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. This anastomosis is often weak and tortuous, or may even be absent. Thus the splenic flexure is a watershed area that is prone to ischemia and infarction in the setting of hypoperfusion.

Sudden occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery causes acute mesenteric ischemia, a surgical emergency that carries a high mortality rate.

The left renal vein can be compressed between the angle formed by the superior mesenteric artery and the abdominal aorta, resulting in nutcracker syndrome. Symptoms may include hematuria, abdominal pain, and left testicular pain in men or left lower quadrant pain in women. These symptoms are due to the occlusion of the left gonadal vein, which drains into the left renal vein.

Superior mesenteric artery syndrome occurs when the third and fourth portions of the duodenum become compressed between the abdominal aorta and the superior mesenteric artery. Its symptoms include early satiety, nausea, vomiting, and sharp postprandial abdominal pain due to small bowel obstruction.
