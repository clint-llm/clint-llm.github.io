All patients and family members should receive genetic counseling from a qualified clinician. It is imperative that the patient and his/her family is aware that Holt-Oram syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder and that an affected individual has a 50% chance of having an offspring with the disorder. It should also be made known that the severity of the condition in a parent is not necessarily an indication of the potential severity in the patient's children.
