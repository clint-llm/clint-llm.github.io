Mitral regurgitation is a common yet debilitating condition that leads to increased morbidity and mortality.

With medical treatment alone, a study of patients aged 50 and older calculated a yearly mortality rate for moderate and severe organic mitral regurgitation as 3% and 6%, respectively.

Mitral valve repair and replacement surgeries have been extensively studied and have shown significant improvement in symptoms and mortality.

- A study of 83 asymptomatic patients undergoing early valve surgery with a mean subject age of 56-years, found residual mitral regurgitation requiring re-repair in 1%, and patients requiring a permanent pacemaker was 4%. The 10-year survival rate after mitral valve surgery was 91.5%.

- Patients with degenerative or RHD with a mean age of 57-years-old undergoing mitral valve repair had comparable survival rates with individuals in the general population. A study of 125 mitral valve repairs determined early mortality in 2.4% and 10-year-survival of 84.3% postoperatively.

- The greatest predictor of survival and improvement of symptoms after MV surgery is pre-operative ejection fraction over 60%.

MR repair is associated with increased survival and decreased morbidity and mortality compared to MR replacement.
