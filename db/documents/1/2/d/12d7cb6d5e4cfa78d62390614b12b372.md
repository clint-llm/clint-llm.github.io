The prognosis in neonatal jaundice is excellent if the patient receives the recommended standard of care. In most cases, jaundice gets better within one or two weeks. In some cases, such as breast milk jaundice and maternal serum jaundice, jaundice can persist for several weeks. Thus, the patientâ€™s serum bilirubin levels need to be monitored closely, with adequate adjustments in treatment made accordingly to prevent persistent hyperbilirubinemia and thereby its consequence, kernicterus and bilirubin induced neurologic dysfunction. The prognosis of patients with ineffective erythropoiesis, which causes the overproduction of bilirubin is also excellent and depends on the cause. Patients with Crigler Najjar syndrome type I have a high risk of kernicterus, and thereby present a poor prognosis and need intensive, aggressive management. However, the prognosis of Crigler Najjar syndrome type II patients is more favorable and rarely associated with kernicterus. Gilbert syndrome is a benign condition, and patients with this syndrome have an excellent prognosis. An individual affected with this inherited disorder can live a normal life. Recent studies have shown that a person with Gilbert syndrome has a low risk of cardiovascular diseases, possibly due to an increase in bilirubin ameliorating oxidative stress.
