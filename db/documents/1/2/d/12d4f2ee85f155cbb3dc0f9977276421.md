Nerve compression syndromes of the hand can be treated well with conservative methods. It is crucial to optimize the patientâ€™s medical status to ensure there is no systemic cause contributing to the nerve compression symptoms. Once the cause is determined, patients should receive education regarding the modification of activities that aggravate symptoms. When conservative treatment fails, or symptoms persist, there are surgical options available for patients to pursue that can have success in treating their condition. Additionally, educational resources can be utilized by health care providers, patients, and the general public to improve outcomes. These resources include:

- American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons

- American Academy of Neurology
