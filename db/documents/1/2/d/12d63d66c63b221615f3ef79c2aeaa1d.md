Seventy-five percent to eighty percent of medullary thyroid cancers are sporadic, and the remainder is familial as part of multiple endocrine neoplasias (MEN) 2A, MEN 2B, and familial medullary thyroid cancer (FMTC). RET mutations in neural crest tissue in the thyroid gland can lead to medullary thyroid cancer development. Germline mutations are associated with MEN2 and FMTC medullary thyroid cancers. Forty to fifty percent of sporadic medullary thyroid cancers have acquired RET mutations.
