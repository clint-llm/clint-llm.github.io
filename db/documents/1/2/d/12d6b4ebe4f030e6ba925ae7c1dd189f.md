In the typical configuration, the lungs are divided into 5 lobes (3 on the right and 2 on the left) and are surrounded by serous membranes called pleural membranes. The parietal pleura is the inner lining of the thoracic wall, and the visceral pleura is the outer lining of the lungs. Between the membranes is a potential space or cavity called the pleural space that normally contains scant fluid, which allows the visceral pleural to slide along the parietal pleura while still maintaining surface tension (preserving contact) between the membranes. Without this surface tension, the lungs do not remain fully inflated.

The lungs have a dual blood supply by bronchial and pulmonary arteries. The aorta supplies the bronchial arteries, and the right ventricle supplies the pulmonary arteries. The most common configuration of the bronchial arteries is 2 to the left lung and 1 to the right. They bifurcate alongside the bronchi and bronchioles. The most common configuration of the pulmonary arteries is 1 pulmonary trunk with 1 primary artery per lung and 1 secondary artery per pulmonary lobe.
