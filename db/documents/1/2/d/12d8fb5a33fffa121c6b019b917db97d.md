Endogenous endophthalmitis is a rare and dreaded ophthalmic emergency that usually results in vision-threatening sequelae. The diagnosis is often a challenge for all ophthalmologists and vitreoretinal surgeons and is generally secondary to underlying secondary systemic pathology. In a few cases, sometimes the cause may not be identified. It can manifest at any age and has varied predisposing risk factors. The etiology is multifactorial with a broad spectrum of microorganisms. Medical or surgical management depends on the manifestation and severity of the pathology. Prompt diagnosis, meticulous management, and regular follow-up are mandated for managing this serious entity. This activity describes the risk factors, etiology, clinical manifestations, investigations, and treatment protocols used by the interprofessional team.
