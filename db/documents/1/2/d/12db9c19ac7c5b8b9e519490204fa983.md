Whole-body plethysmography is the most common method for measuring airway resistance. A plethysmograph is an air-tight chamber that the participant sits inside, which contains a tube that the patient puts in their mouth. There are two transducers within the plethysmograph: one located in the chamber that measures chamber pressure and one inside the tube that measures mouth pressure. There is also a flowmeter in the tube that measures the flow rate. During the test, the patient is asked to breathe normally while the tube is left open. When the participant breathes into the open tube, mouth pressure and flow rate are recorded. A shutter then occludes the tube, and the participant is asked to try to breathe normally. With the participant attempting to breathe against the closed tube, there is no airflow, and mouth pressure approximates alveolar pressure.

R = (Pm – Pa) / Vo

Where Pm = pressure in the mouth, Pa = pressure in the alveoli, and Vo = flow rate.
