Infective endocarditis is an infectious disease involving the endocardial surface of the heart and can include the valves and/or the mural endocardium. Infective endocarditis is a serious condition with significant morbidity and mortality. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and complications of infective endocarditis and underscores the importance of an interprofessional team approach to its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiological trends for infective endocarditis.
- Review the most commons symptoms associated with infective endocarditis. 
- Summarize the treatment options for infective endocarditis. 
- Outline how infective endocarditis requires an interprofessional team approach involving medical specialties such as cardiology, infectious disease, radiology, and cardiothoracic surgery to enhance care coordination for patients with infectious endocarditis, determine which patients are surgical candidates, and optimize clinical outcomes.
