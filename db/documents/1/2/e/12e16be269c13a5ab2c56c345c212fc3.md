It is extremely important to identify severe cerebral edema as early as possible to prevent herniation and death. For example malignant middle cerebral artery stroke presenting with severe cerebral edema. Malignant middle cerebral artery stroke is seen more commonly in the younger population. Usually, these patients are admitted to the ICU setting. Following the Neurological exam closely is very important. Usually, there is an altered mental status and development of fixed and dilated pupil. Patients presenting with findings suggestive of cerebral insult should undergo computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain; this can show the edema, which is visible as areas of low density and loss of gray/white matter differentiation, on an unenhanced image.  There can also be the obliteration of the cisterns and sulcal spaces.  A CT scan can also reveal the cause in some cases.  If flattened gyri or narrowed sulci, or compression of the ventricles, is seen, this suggests increased ICP.  Serial CT scans are used to show the progression or improvement of the edema.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can show increased T2 and FLAIR signal changes (hyperintensity) within the brain.

If increased ICP is a concern from the cerebral edema, then an ICP monitor or ventriculostomy may be needed to monitor ICP and can provide better outcomes by helping to tailor therapy.
