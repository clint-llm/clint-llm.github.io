Patients should be educated on the chronic nature of this disease. In addition to discussing therapeutic options, side effects, as well as the rate of relapse, should be discussed before initiating therapy. Patients should be counseled on the high degree of psychological distress that can accompany this condition and be referred to mental health providers when appropriate. Patients should be given resources for organizations such as the National Alopecia Areata Foundation (NAAF), where they can learn more about this disease and connect with other affected individuals.
