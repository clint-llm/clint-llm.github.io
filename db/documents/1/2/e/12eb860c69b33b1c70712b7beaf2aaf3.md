Unlike bladder exstrophy, consultations with multiple specialties are seldom required in isolated epispadias. A trained pediatric surgeon/urologist has to be consulted immediately after birth, as an early repair will avoid an osteotomy. The involvement of a nephrologist in the care of these children might be required in occasional cases prone to upper tract damage and kidney injury. Adolescents with isolated epispadias may have psychosocial and sexual issues similar to those with patients of bladder exstrophy that need to be addressed properly. Therefore, consultation with a psychiatrist and a urologist/andrologist is required during their transitional care.
