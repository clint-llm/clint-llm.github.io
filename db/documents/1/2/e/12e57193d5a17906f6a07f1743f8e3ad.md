A thorough history and physical should be obtained to determine the mechanism of injury to the affected digit. Treatment options vary depending on etiology and early identification of injury can prevent long-term complications and deformities from these injuries. A deformity can take several weeks to manifest. In the setting of a laceration injury, the area needs to be thoroughly cleaned and examined in a “bloodless field” for tendon integrity.

- The patient places his affected finger over the edge of a surface such as a table. The digits are placed in a flexed position along the surface edge at the level of the PIP joint.

- The examiner applies pressure to the digit at the level of the middle phalanx.

- The patient is instructed to extend the finger at the PIP joint(opposite to the vector of pressure).

- A positive test is confirmed when the DIP is noted to hyperextend at the DIP joint.

If rheumatoid arthritis causes a boutonniere deformity, a thorough history should include the duration of symptoms, medications (both previous and current), level of pain, and degree of disability.
