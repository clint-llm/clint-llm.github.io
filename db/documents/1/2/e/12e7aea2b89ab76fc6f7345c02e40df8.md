Early intervention in rheumatoid arthritis may result in successful control of disease activity and improved functional performance. The major roadblock to an effective response to therapy might arise from disease-related or treatment-related multisystem complications such as cardiovascular, gastrointestinal diseases, osteoporosis, pulmonary involvement, recurrent infections, neoplastic disorders, renal and psychological complications. These comorbidities in addition to side effects of medications affect response to treatment, drug tolerability, and patient survival.
