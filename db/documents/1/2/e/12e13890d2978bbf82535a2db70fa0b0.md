The high incidence of laryngeal airway surgery may lead to several complications. The first and most common complication is the recurrence of the lesion or spread of the disease to adjacent tissues due to iatrogenic squamous metaplasia. Furthermore, aggressive removal may lead to vocal cord scarring or glottic webs. These complications would affect the phonatory qualities of the vocal cords. Another complication in the use of laser surgery is airway fire.
