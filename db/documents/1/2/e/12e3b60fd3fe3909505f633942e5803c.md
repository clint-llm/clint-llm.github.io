In CNCP, cortical processes like alertness activate pain-facilitatory cells in the medulla. Different single-nucleotide-polymorphisms can generate more or less pain sensitivity. Functional MRI studies demonstrated that patients reported different pain levels for standard stimuli with varied activation of the anterior cingulate gyrus, frontal cortex, and somatosensory cortex
