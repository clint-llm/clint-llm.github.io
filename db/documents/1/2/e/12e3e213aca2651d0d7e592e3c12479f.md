There is a spectrum of clinical presentations of cholangitis, ranging from mild forms to severe forms, including overwhelming fulminant sepsis. Symptoms include fever, chills, malaise, rigors, generalized abdominal pain, jaundice, pruritus, and pale stools.Â Medical history, including cholelithiasis, recent cholecystectomy, post-ERCP, prior history of cholangitis, and history of AIDS, may increase the risk of cholangitis. Individuals with cholangitis tend to appear quite ill and often present with severe sepsis or septic shock. On physical exam, they present with fever, right upper quadrant tenderness, jaundice, abdominal distension, altered mental status, or hemodynamic instability.

The definitive diagnosis of acute cholangitis would include systemic signs of infection as well as confirmatory evidence of purulent bile by endoscopic, percutaneous, or surgical means. Although feasible, it proves invasive and may not be the best use of resources. Therefore clinical tools such as the Charcot triad and Tokoyo guidelines have been implemented in clinical practice.

Charcot triad describes cholangitis as clinical findings of fever, right upper abdominal pain, and jaundice. The Reynolds pentad adds altered mental status and sepsis to the triad. Many patients with acute cholangitis do not present with classic symptoms and signs.
