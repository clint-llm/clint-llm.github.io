Perioperative staff could utilize this classification system for perioperative outcomes management.  However, this must be considered in the larger context of the variability and inconsistency with classification between classifying entities, as meta-analyses have shown the ASAPS having a sensitivity around 0.74 (95% confidence intervals 0.73 to 0.74), specificity around 0.67 (0.67 to 0.67), and a receiver operating curve area under the summary of around 0.736 (0.725 to 0.747) in predicting mortality postoperatively.

- Age

- Comorbidities and their relative severity and level of optimization

- Intended surgical procedure

- Potential additional surgical procedures that may be needed intraoperatively

- Location, extent, and adjacent structures of the intended lesion for surgical intervention

- Intended surgical equipment to be utilized

- Intended implants

- Intended duration versus possible duration of surgical procedure and thus anesthesia administration

- Surgical team composition, experience, ability, and skill

- Likely need for any blood products, along with the likelihood of volume, type, and rapidity with which any blood products might be needed intraoperative

- Intended medications that may be required along with the possibility of precise timing requirements depending on surgery type

- Intended anesthetic technique along with the likelihood of the need for any additional rescue equipment or interventions, for the availability of any further rescue equipment or interventions

- Anesthetic team composition, experience, ability, and skill

- Intended anesthetic medications along with the likelihood for additional or complementary medication administration as well as the likelihood of the need for reversal or treatment of the effects of any such medications

- Surgical facility equipment, personnel, and resources

- Preoperative and postoperative team composition, experience, ability, and skill

- Intended postoperative plan, location, and course, along with the likelihood of alternative postoperative plans, locations, and complications

- Time of day, weekend versus weekday, time of the year when the surgical procedure is being performed

- The surgical operating room location logistics related to the potential likelihood of needing transport of the patient under anesthesia intraoperatively

- The classification of the surgery as elective, urgent, or emergent
