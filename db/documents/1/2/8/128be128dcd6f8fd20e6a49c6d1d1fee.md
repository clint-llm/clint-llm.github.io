Benzodiazepines represent first-line treatment for methamphetamine toxicity but frequently require repeated and escalated dosing to achieve the effect. Methamphetamine users may be resistant to benzodiazepine treatment. Antipsychotics, such as haloperidol and olanzapine, are also useful in the management of agitation. Combination treatment with benzodiazepines and antipsychotics has been shown to be more efficacious than monotherapy.

For concomitant tachycardia and hypertension that does not respond to sedation, the combined beta/alpha-blocker labetalol is preferred based on a systematic review from 2015.

There are no FDA-approved medications for stimulant use disorder but a recent study found theÂ combination of injectable naltrexone and oral bupropion was safe and effective in treating adults with moderate or severe methamphetamine use disorder.
