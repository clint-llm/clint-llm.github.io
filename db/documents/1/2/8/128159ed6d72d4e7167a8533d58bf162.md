Vascular surgery is considered a high-risk procedure, and most procedures carry a greater than 5% risk of an acute cardiac event. Direct reconstruction of aorta iliofemoral disease is associated with a 2.8% perioperative mortality, while extra-anatomic bypass confers an 8.8% mortality. Mortality increases in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, advanced age, pre-existing cardiac disease, diabetes, renal failure, and tobacco use. Under this pretense, accurate risk stratification is warranted in patients undergoing PVB. While most patients are managed under general anesthesia, local and regional anesthesia (RA) provides several possible advantages, including stable cardiovascular hemodynamic perioperative course and improved postoperative pain relief. Moreover, chronic postsurgical pain syndromes are more efficiently prevented by applying local and regional anesthesia methods.

Myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS) is considered an index of cardiac risk stratification in vascular surgery patients. An elevation of fourth-generation troponin T equal to or greater than 0.03 ng/mL is considered significant.

Patients with a medical history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk for contrast-induced and contrast-associated nephropathy. Therefore, a baseline creatinine level and re-check in the immediate preoperative period are mandatory. The patients who are subjected to angiography should be well-hydrated. Accordingly, intravenous hydration with 1 mL/kg/hour of isotonic saline for 6 to 12 hours pre and peri-procedure are recommended. The hydration protocols should be continued for 6 to 12 hours post-operatively.
