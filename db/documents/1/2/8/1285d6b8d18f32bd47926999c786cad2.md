Successful treatment and management of patients suffering from temporal bone fractures require an interprofessional effort. Trauma surgery, neurosurgery, otolaryngology, and neurotology should be consulted. As in all trauma cases, one must follow the ABCD protocol and consult with the relevant specialists depending on the pathology found on imaging studies. The outcomes for most patients without intracranial injury are good, but those with intracranial pathology have a guarded prognosis. Some patients may have residual neurological deficits that may persist for a long time, with some sequela reducing patients' quality of life.
