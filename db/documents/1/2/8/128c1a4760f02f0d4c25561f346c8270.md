Distinguishing oncocytomas from malignant mimics can be challenging and should be done with immunohistochemistry.

The main diagnoses that should be included in the differential diagnosis include eosinophilicÂ variant chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, succinate dehydrogenase-deficient renal cell carcinoma, tubulocystic renal cell carcinoma, papillary renal cell carcinoma with eosinophilic cytoplasm, and epithelioid angiomyolipoma.
