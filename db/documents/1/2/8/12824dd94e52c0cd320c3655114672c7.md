Boyle’s law is a gas law that describes the relationship between the pressure and volume of gas for a mass and temperature. This law is the mechanism by which the human respiratory system functions. Boyle’s law is equivalent to**PV = K**(P is pressure, V is volume, K is a constant), or one may state that pressure is inversely proportional to the volume.
