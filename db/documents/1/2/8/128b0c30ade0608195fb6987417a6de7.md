There are many physiologic variants of the IVC.

- Left Inferior Vena Cava: This anomaly is caused by the regression of the right supracardinal vein and the persistence of the left supracardinal vein. The left inferior vena cava is joined by the left renal vein and then crosses anterior to the aorta before it joins the right atrium, forming a normal pre-renal IVC. This anomaly has a suspected prevalence of 0.2% to 0.5%.

- Double Inferior Vena Cava: This anomaly is caused by the persistence of both the left and right supracardinal veins. A prevalence of 0.2% to 0.3% is suspected.

- Intrahepatic Inferior Vena Cava Agenesis: Congenital anomaly resulting in the lack of the intrahepatic IVC. Intrahepatic venous supply bypasses the hepatic IVC through the azygous/hemiazygous venous system.

- Absent Infrarenal Inferior Vena Cava: This is the rarest of the physiologic caval anomalies. The suspected and currently accepted etiology of absent infrarenal inferior vena cava is intrauterine or perinatal thrombosis and resultant degeneration of the infrarenal IVC.
