Treatment for failure to thrive includes identifying the underlying etiology and addressing the caloric deficit. Often, patients are admitted to an inpatient setting to facilitate the workup, observe feeds and to ensure appropriate weight gain prior to discharge. However, depending on the clinical status of the patient this may not always be warranted. Whenever possible, enteral feeds should be provided. For patients with feeding refusal or inability to consume enough calories, nasogastric tubes (in the short-term) and gastrostomy tubes (long-term) are sometimes needed. Parenteral nutrition is a last resort. For patients with increased caloric demands, working with nutritionists to prescribe a high-calorie diet that is appropriate for the patientÂ is essential. Establishing specific meal times and routines can help with toddlers who have difficulty feeding. Minimizing fruit juices and empty calories is also helpful. For patients with increased caloric losses, there are often disease-specific treatments to address this issue. An example would be pancreatic enzyme replacement in cystic fibrosis patients. Frequent follow-ups to confirm weight gain, once it is established, is essential. If needed, parental education and additional psychosocial support can be very helpful.
