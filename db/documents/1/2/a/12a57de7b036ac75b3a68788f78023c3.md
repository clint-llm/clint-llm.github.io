Reidel thyroiditis is a rare disorder that often presents with vague signs and symptoms. Due to its rarity, it can be slow to diagnose (Level 4, 5). Patient care can be enhanced by a team of physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other health professionals.  Once diagnosed, the patient will need routine follow-up with either a primary care physician or an endocrinologist for routine laboratory studies, imaging, and physical exams to monitor for the progression of the disease.  If the patient develops symptoms of tracheal compression despite medical therapy, they will need to be referred to a surgeon for a partial or subtotal thyroidectomy.
