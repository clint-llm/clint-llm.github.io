The development of a diabetic ulcer is usually in 3 stages. The initial stage is the development of a callus. The callus results from neuropathy. The motor neuropathy causes physical deformity of the foot, and sensory neuropathy causes sensory loss which leads to ongoing trauma. Drying of the skin because of autonomic neuropathy is also another contributing factor. Finally, frequent trauma of the callus results in subcutaneous hemorrhage and eventually, it erodes and becomes an ulcer.

Patients with diabetes mellitus also develop severe atherosclerosis of the small blood vessels in the legs and feet, leading to vascular compromise, which is another cause for diabetic foot infections. Because blood is not able to reach the wound, healing is delayed, eventually leading to necrosis and gangrene.
