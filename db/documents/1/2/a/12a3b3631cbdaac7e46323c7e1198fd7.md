The approach to the treatment of patients with radiation necrosis should be divided into patients who are asymptomatic and symptomatic. In the asymptomatic patients, it would be reasonable to do serial MRI scans to follow the area of suspected necrosis and see if it further evolves or consider the possibility of tumor recurrence. A lesion biopsy ultimately may be necessary to determine whether it is radiation necrosis versus tumor recurrence, especially if the lesion continues to grow. It is very important to establish the diagnosis of radiation necrosis versus tumor recurrence so that the appropriate therapy may be rendered to the patient. If the patient is having neurologic symptoms or increased intracranial pressure, then surgical options, steroids, anticoagulation therapy, and even hyperbaric oxygen therapy will need to be considered. A novel treatment for radiation necrosis using bevacizumab has been studied with just class one evidence available for its efficacy but is not yet considered standard therapy.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO2) has no double-blind placebo-controlled trials to prove its efficacy, but many case studies and prospective studies demonstrate some benefit. HBO2 promotes tissue healing by improved angiogenesis that results in better tissue perfusion. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy also can reduce tissue edema and enhance collagen synthesis by fibroblasts which activity is crucial for the healing of damaged tissue. Radiation necrosis is in part caused by a coagulative and ischemic process which leads to cellular death; this is, in essence, an ischemia-reperfusion injury phenomenon. HBO2 helps to restore normal cellular functions to aid the repair of the ischemic damaged tissue. It is important to note that the angiogenesis that occurs with hyperbaric oxygen therapy produces a vascular supply to the radiation damage tissue that is more robust than the telangiectasia that sometimes occurs as a part of the radiation necrosis.

HBO2 usually is delivered at a dose of 2 to 2.4 atmospheres absolute for 90 to 120 minutes daily and may take 20 to 30 treatments before significant angiogenesis occurs with the improvement of the neurologic symptoms. The major disadvantage of hyperbaric oxygen therapy is that it is expensive, time-consuming, and universally not readily available, although this later problem is becoming less of a concern as more facilities are built. More studies on the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy alone and in conjunction with other therapies, such as concomitant steroids and surgery, are needed to determine the best treatment practices.
