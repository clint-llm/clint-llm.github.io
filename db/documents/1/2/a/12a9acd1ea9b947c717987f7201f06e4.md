The mid-trimester ultrasound scan should be performed according to international standards and preferably by accredited sonographers.

When a structural abnormality is detected, the questions the obstetrician would like to know are: how severe is the anomaly, is it lethal? Does the fetus have a chromosomal abnormality? What is the cause? How can the fetus be best salvaged? A fetal karyotype is indicated when there are multiple structural malformations, associated fetal growth retardation, certain anomalies like cystic hygroma, non-immune hydrops, and cardiovascular defects. It is better to know the fetal karyotype during pregnancy rather than to wait till after delivery, as quite often the baby may not survive, the chromosomal cultures might fail, and valuable information might be lost, which could be of vital importance for future counseling.

Management guidelines for a lethal anomaly like anencephaly and bilateral renal agenesisÂ indicate the termination of pregnancy. If the defect is non-progressive and correctable at birth, as in mild hydronephrosis with good renal function, the decision would be to wait till term; delivery followed by neonatal treatment. Fetal therapy of a structurally malformed fetus requires a multidisciplinary team of the obstetrician, geneticist, neonatologist, and pediatric surgeon. Malformations that require correction in utero are those that would cause deterioration of the fetal organs if left alone.
