Two papillary muscles are part of the mitral valve, the anterior and posterior papillary muscles, and each of them provides tendon cords for both valve leaflets. The anterior papillary muscle receives vascular supply via the anterior descending artery and the circumflex artery, which is a branch of the left coronary artery, while branches of the right coronary artery vascularize the posterior papillary muscle. Dysfunction of blood supply can damage the valve.
