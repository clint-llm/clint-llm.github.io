Human immunodeficiency virus is a lentivirus in the retrovirus family.

The life cycle of HIV provides several drug targets.

The first drug approved as an anti-HIV agent was azidothymidine (zidovudine), a nucleoside analog of thymidine without 3’-hydroxyl group on the sugar.

Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors also bind to the enzyme, but not at the same sites where the nucleotide substrate binds. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors are non-competitive inhibitors of reverse transcriptase. The six FDA-approved non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors are delavirdine, doravirine, efavirenz, etravirine, nevirapine, and rilpivirine.

Viral integrase enzyme is essential for the integration of proviral DNA into the host chromosome. The four FDA-approved viral integrase inhibitors are bictegravir, dolutegravir, elvitegravir, and raltegravir are integrase inhibitors.

Due to the essential role of HIV protease in the production of the mature virus, HIV protease has been the target for anti-HIV drugs. The ten FDA approved protease inhibitors are amprenavir, atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir, and tipranavir. These drugs are peptide mimetics that compete with the Gag and Gag-Pol proteins, which are natural substrates of HIV protease.

Additionally, enfuvirtide and maraviroc are viral entry inhibitors. Enfuvirtide is a peptide mimic to the region of the HIV-1 glycoprotein 41 that is essential for the entry of HIV-1 to the host cells. Maraviroc is a chemokine receptor CCR5 inhibitor. The CCR5 is a co-receptor that HIV uses for host cell entry.

These therapeutics are used in various combinations, called antiretroviral treatment (ART), to combat the rapid mutation rate that leads to the evolution of drug resistance seen in HIV.
