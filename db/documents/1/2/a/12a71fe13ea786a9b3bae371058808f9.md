Entomophthoromycosis is caused by fungi belonging to the order Entomopthorales. The Zygomycota phylum included orders Mucorales and Entomopthorales, among others. Mucorales included genera such as Rhizopus and Mucor. Entomophthorales comprised of Basidiobolus and Conidiobolus genera. Zygomycota was found to be polyphyletic and has since been eliminated as a phylum. Zygomycosis and mucormycosis were terms at times used interchangeably, leading to confusion. Entomophthoramycotina is a new subphylum created to include Basidiobolomycetes (includes Basidiobolus spp.), Neozygitomycetes, and Entomophthoramycetes (includes Conidiobolus spp.). With the changes in the order Entophthorales, revision of classification with broad consensus is needed for wide clinical use.

Entomophthoromycosis has two clinically distinct forms:

- Basidiobolus spp causes basidiobolomycosis (subcutaneous zygomycosis).

- Bonidiobolus spp causes conidiobolomycosis (rhinofacial zygomycosis).

Human pathogenic isolates for Basidiobolus are Basidiobolus ranarum, and for Conidiobolus, are Conidiobolus coronatus and Conidiobolus incongruus.
