The causes of primary defects of neutrophil function include failure of the following

- Adhere to endothelial cells

- Migrate into inflammation sites (abnormal chemotaxis)

- Ingest and kill bacteria

- Produce microbicidal compounds to kill fungi and other pathogens

- Form phagolysosomes

- Make high concentrations of toxic reactive oxygen species

Low levels of neutrophils may be due to hypoplastic bone marrow, an infection, radiation exposure, tumor infiltration of the bone marrow, myelofibrosis, prolonged exposure to a drug, or a hereditary disorder. Congenital neutropenia or Kostmann syndrome is acquired in an autosomal recessive fashion.

Drugs known to cause neutropenia include:

- Quinidine

- Aminopyrine

- Cephalosporin

- Sulfonamides

- Hydralazine

- Penicillins

- Heavy metals

- Phenothiazine

Antineutrophil or autoimmune neutropenia has been observed in:

- Rheumatoid arthritis (Felty syndrome)

- Inflammatory bowel disease

- Chronic autoimmune hepatitis

- Granulomatosis with polyangiitis

- Hodgkin lymphoma

- Sjogren syndrome

Almost any infection can cause neutropenia. The condition is also seen with folate, vitamin B12, and copper deficiency.
