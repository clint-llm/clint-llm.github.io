It is important to distinguish the difference between age-related changes and disc degeneration. After young adulthood, as nucleus cell density decreasesa nd the proportion of senescent cells increases resulting in an accompanying decrease in proteoglycan content, disc water content, and extracellular matrix turnover.

An additional finding can be the detachment of the hyaline cartilage endplates due to this loss of internal pressure. The nucleus also tends to bulge into the vertebral body leading to radial bulging of the annulus with subsequent loss of disc height. As a result, compressive stresses are placed on the neural arches, leading to facet osteoarthritis and osteophyte formation. This can lead to a further source of axial back pain. Other features of aging are a decrease in vertebral endplate permeability and metabolite transport. This is a noteworthy difference from disc degeneration where damage leads to an increase in these features.

Adams et al. define disc degeneration is an aberrant, cell-mediated response to progressive structural failure. Along with structural failure are signs of accelerated or advanced aging. Causes of disc degeneration include genetic inheritance, advanced age, inadequate metabolite transport, and loading history. These elements provide the setting for structural failure to occur with normal activities of daily living.

Characteristics of structural damage include endplate fracture, radial fissuring, and herniation. Due to the lumbar spine’s function as a major motion segment, annular disc tearing is often seen in this region. There are three types of annular tearing. Circumferential tearing results from shear stresses. Peripheral tearing usually is located in the anterior annulus and likely related to trauma. Radial tearing is associated with nucleus degeneration and posterior projection. If the nucleus migrates enough to affect the periphery, the disc is herniated or prolapsed. The extent of migration can result in protrusion, extrusion, or sequestration of the disc material. Additionally, damage or fracture to the vertebral endplate induces the increased activity of degradative enzymes and pro-apoptotic factors.
