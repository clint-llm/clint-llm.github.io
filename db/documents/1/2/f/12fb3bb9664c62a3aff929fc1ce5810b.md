The optimal patient outcome for HHV-8-associated malignancies, especially Kaposi's sarcoma, involves a multidisciplinary approach. MCD and PEL may cause multisystemic disease in severe cases and may be complicated with HIV/AIDS as well as other infections. Kaposi sarcoma skin lesions can cause many psychological consequences, especially if located anywhere visible such as the face.

Frequently, KS may be challenging to diagnose for pathologists because of its histologic similarity to a variety of malignancies. Also, the treatment can be challenging as well; most treatment goals are palliative and not curative. However, chemotherapy is optimal for quality of life improvement.
