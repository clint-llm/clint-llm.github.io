**Urinary System**

The urinary system begins forming during the 4th week of gestation. At the end of week 4, a nephrogenic cord has formed, giving rise to three kidney systems:

A. The pronephros in the cervical region

B. Mesonephros in the thoracic and lumbar region

C. The metanephros, which will ultimately transform into functional kidneys.

The most cranially positioned kidney system, the pronephros, is nonfunctional and regresses by the end of the fourth week of gestation as the more caudal kidney systems begin to form. The nephrotome is a vestigial excretory unit present with the pronephros. The mesonephros exists as the embryonic kidney in the lumbar region from weeks 4 to 8, and its remnants go on to form several structures in the male genital system.

The mesonephric cord creates vesicles from provesicular cell masses, which make contact laterally with the collecting system of the mesonephros, the mesonephric (Wolffian) duct. The fusion of these vesicles with the Wolffian duct, and the acquisition of a lumen, form the tubules of the nephron.

After several generations of buds, absorption of the third and fourth generations forms the minor calyces and, eventually, the renal pyramid. The ureters and 1 to 3 million collecting tubules also originate from the ureteric bud. The cells of the metanephric tissue cap covering the collecting ducts form the renal vesicles, which give rise to S-shaped tubules that acquire capillaries to form glomeruli, the proximal end of which forms Bowman’s capsule. The excretory tubule lengthens to form the proximal convoluted tubule, the loop of Henle, and the distal convoluted tubule. With the expansion of the abdomen and growth of the lumbar and sacral regions, the kidneys separate and ascend between weeks 6 and 9.

The cloaca is the shared component of the anorectal and urogenital passages at the 5th week of gestation that subdivides into two separate channels during the 6th and 7th weeks.

The bladder begins development during weeks 4 to 7. Initially, the bladder is continuous with the allantois, and when the lumen becomes obliterated, the urachus connects the bladder's apex with the umbilicus. Involution of the cloaca and embryonic allantois form the urachus, whose remnant is the median umbilical ligament.

**Genital System**

All fetuses begin with undifferentiated gonads, which will develop into either the ovaries in females or the testes in males. Although morphologically indistinguishable at this stage, unisex gonads are known as ‘bipotential’ because of the ability to transform into an ovary or testis depending if the individual possesses an XX or XY chromosome, respectively.

The initial appearance of the gonads is the genital (gonadal) ridges formed by the proliferation of the epithelium and condensation of underlying mesenchyme. The development of testes in males and ovaries in females relies on the induction by primordial germ cells from the yolk sac to the genital (gonadal) ridges during the 4th through 6th weeks. These primordial cells arrive at the primitive gonads at week 5 and invade the gonadal ridge during week 6.SRY gene (sex-determining region on the Y chromosome) on the short arm of the Y chromosome (Yp11) influences their development into testes, while the gonads will become ovaries in the absence of the gene. The presence of estrogen is paramount in the formation of external genitalia in females, whereas testosterone drives the development of male external genitalia.

The formation of the gonads begins at embryonic day 10, and the expression of Sry protein, also known as the testes-determining factor, begins between days 10 and 11. The undifferentiated genital system consists of two pairs of ducts at week 7: the mesonephric (Wolffian) and paramesonephric (Mullerian) ducts. The paramesonephric ducts arise on the anterolateral surface of the urogenital ridge.

- In males, the paramesonephric ducts regress under the influence of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), also referred to as Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS), produced by the Sertoli cells beginning in weeks 8 to 10. Testosterone secreted by the Leydig cells beginning at week 9 causes the mesonephric ducts to differentiate into the epididymis, vas deferens, ejaculatory duct, and seminal vesicles.

- In females, the absence of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and the influence of estrogen leads to the formation of the Fallopian tubes from the cranial portion of the paramesonephric ducts, and the upper third of the vagina, cervix, and uterus from the caudal portion. These processes are complete by the end of the first trimester. The endometrium of the uterus originates from simple epithelium, while the myometrium and perimetrium covering the uterus originate from the surrounding mesenchyme.

The genital tubercle forms from a pile of mesenchymal cells from the cloacal folds and is positioned cranial to the opening of the urogenital sinus. The genital tubercle will elongate under the influence of androgens to become the phallus in males and the clitoris in females in the absence of androgens.

The labioscrotal swellings initially appear in week 4, lie lateral to the genital tubercle, and migrate caudally and medially during weeks 9 to 11 to form the scrotum by week 12. Estrogens are essential for the development of the clitoris, labia, and lower vagina. The processus vaginalis, from the evagination of the peritoneum of the abdominal cavity, forms the inguinal canal after protrusion into the scrotal swelling.
