The undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS), formerly known as malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH), is a high-grade soft-tissue sarcoma (STS). The historical literature previously encompassed various STSs as MFH. These were later reclassified as distinct entities, with the advancements in cytogenetics and immunohistochemistry studies. This activity reviews the current description, evaluation, and management of UPS and highlights the interprofessional team's role in improving the care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.
- Describe the evaluation protocol for undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.
- Outline treatment alternatives for undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma according to disease staging.
- Review how interprofessional strategies can optimize patient outcomes in cases of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.
