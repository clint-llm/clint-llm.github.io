In a healthy synovial joint, bone ends are linked by an elastic layer of articular hyaline cartilage. This layer mainly consists of water, type II collagen that maintains the structure, and proteoglycans that provide the cartilage with the ability to withstand compressive and shear forces.

Early in osteoarthritis, loss of proteoglycans disrupts the cartilage fibers, leads to the softening of cartilage, and increases the water content. The earliest sign of cartilage damage observed by light microscopy is chondral fibrillation, followed by cracks and deeper fissures. Cartilage loss promotes chondrocyte proliferation and activation. Fibroblasts in, a type I collagen matrix fills the areas that have lost cartilage and are called a “pannus.” The remodeled matrix can then become calcified and invaded by small vessels later in the disease.

In end-stage disease, the subchondral bone becomes thicker and sclerotic. The margins of the articular bone form outgrowths called “bone spurs” or “osteophytes.” Bone cysts may appear connected to the subchondral surface by a fissure filled with inflammatory fluid, myxoid material, or bone fragments.
