Most nadolol poisonings occur via the intentional consumption of the tablet. There are no reports of significant toxicity in the literature.

Signs and symptoms of moderate to severe poisoning include severe hypotension, bradycardia, bronchospasm, heart failure, hypoglycemia, seizure, and coma. First, maintaining a patent airway is essential. Use suction if necessary, attempt to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%, and resort to endotracheal intubation if necessary. Continuously monitor the patient for pulmonary edema or signs of shock. There is no specific antidote for nadolol toxicity. However, for the treatment of hypotension, glucagon,Â dopamine, or sodium bicarbonate, followed by multiple IV boluses of epinephrine if the former is not adequate, can be used.

Treat heart failure with cardiac glycosides and diuretics.
