The coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is a complicated surgical procedure that requires operative skills and expertise as well as good perioperative care. Therefore it is necessary to have a system to ensure the completion of all aspects of patient care. In pre-operative care, in addition to discussing the risks and benefits of the procedure with the patient and family, the assessment must be done to ensure that patient meets the recommended criteria for the procedure. Proper sterile technique is fundamental to better outcomes.

In the postoperative period, patients need regular monitoring by trained nursing staff for complications. After recovery, every patient should undergo cardiac rehabilitation. It is now recommended to have a multidisciplinary team approach that may include a primary care provider, intervention cardiologist, cardiac surgeon, cardiac rehabilitation specialist, a cardiac nurse, and a cardiac pharmacist to enhance patient care, optimize procedural success and minimize perioperative complications.
