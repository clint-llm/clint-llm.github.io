Infective endocarditis (IE) is an infection of the endocardial surfaces of the heart, which includes one or more heart valves. The incidence of infective endocarditis hospitalization in the United States is estimated at 12.7 per 100,000 annually. Most of the patients (57.7%) were male, and more than a third were 70 years and older.

Acute infections present as a rapidly progressive disease with high fevers, rigors, and sepsis. On the other hand, subacute bacterial endocarditis diagnosis is often delayed and presents with non-specific symptoms such as weight loss, fatigue, and dyspnea over several weeks to months. There are several differences between subacute bacterial endocarditis and acute bacterial endocarditis. Most cases of subacute bacterial endocarditis are caused by penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus viridans, while Staphylococcus aureus causes most cases of acute bacterial endocarditis.

As the incidence of infective endocarditis continues to rise in the United States, healthcare providers must make appropriate decisions regarding antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent further complications. Antibiotic prophylaxis before procedures, especially dental procedures, used to be widely utilized to prevent infective endocarditis despite a lack of established evidence to support this practice. In guidelines published by the American Heart Association (AHA) in 2007, the recommended indications to use antibiotics for endocarditis prophylaxis were significantly restricted.
