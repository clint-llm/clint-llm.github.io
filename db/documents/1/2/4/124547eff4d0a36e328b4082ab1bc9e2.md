Jacobs syndrome is a rare genetic abnormality in which a male receives an extra Y chromosome from his father. While many patients go undiagnosed due to mild symptoms, the disease does seem to confer an increased risk for certain comorbid conditions such as asthma, seizure disorders, autism spectrum disorder, learning disabilities, and behavioral problems. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of patients with Jacobs syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the patient history associated with Jacobs syndrome.
- Outline the management considerations for patients with Jacobs syndrome.
- Explain how to counsel a patient with Jacobs syndrome.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by Jacobs syndrome.
