Best vitelliform macular dystrophy without a choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM) needs no treatment. Dilated fundus evaluation of family members, electrophysiological testing (EOG, ERG), and genetic analysis are essential in establishing the diagnosis. Regular follow-up is vital for the early detection of complications, especially CNVM.

The CNVM may respond favorably with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents (anti-VEGF agents like bevacizumab, ranibizumab, or aflibercept).

All patients should receive good refraction.

In patients with significant cataracts, cataract surgery may lead to visual improvement.

Amsler grid is an important tool for home monitoring and may detect metamorphopsia early.

Low vision aids, including magnifiers and telescopes, may help to rehabilitate patients with atrophic disease with poor vision.
