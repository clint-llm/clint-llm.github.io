The flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) is an extrinsic hand muscle that flexes the metacarpophalangeal and distal interphalangeal joints of the index, middle, ring, and little fingers.Â The flexor digitorum profundus lies in the deep volar compartment of the forearm and originates from the upper three-fourths of the volar and medial surfaces of the ulna, interosseous membrane, and deep fascia of the forearm. The tendons of the flexor digitorum profundus insert into the base of the distal phalanges of the index, middle, ring, and little fingers. The tendons of the flexor digitorum profundus lie deep to the tendons of the flexor digitorum superficialis, and the tendon to the index finger is usually separate from the other three partially attached flexor digitorum profundus tendons as they pass through the carpal tunnel.
