An echocardiogram is the best tool to screen for DIVHD. Most of the time, DIVHD is not associated with symptoms. The FDA criterion for significant drug-induced heart valve regurgitation is mild or greater aortic regurgitation and/or moderate or greater mitral regurgitation.

Usually, these findings are associated with restricted valve motion, affecting predominantly the posterior leaflet in mitral valve regurgitation; however, less frequently, the condition can affect the anterior mitral leaflet as well. In aortic regurgitation, variable degrees of leaflet retraction has been described as being responsible for this valve insufficiency. Both valves are associated with mild to moderate valve thickening in the absence of calcification of marked commissural fusion. Tricuspid and pulmonary DIVHDs are less common, but echocardiographic changes are similar to those seen in the mitral and aortic valve. DIVHD has not been related to valvular stenosis.
