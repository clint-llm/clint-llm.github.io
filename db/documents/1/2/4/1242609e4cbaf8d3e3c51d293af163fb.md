In 2015, ARMD was the third most common cause of moderate to severe visual impairment globally. The global prevalence of ARMD among those aged 45 to 85 years old was 8.7%, with a prevalence of 0.4% for advanced ARMD. Early ARMD is more common among those of European ancestry than in Asians, and ARMD of any stage is less common in individuals of African ancestry.

Approximately 10% of patients with ARMD develop neovascular disease. In the absence of anti-VEGF therapy, between 79% to 90% of those eyes will eventually become legally blind due to complications from neovascularization.
