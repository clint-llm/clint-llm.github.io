The mainstay of treatment lies in early detection. All providers who encounter patients with HIV disease should be encouraged to start their patients on HAART. Patients must receive education about the onset of HIV-associated dementia, especially early signs of asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment, which may show a decrease in functioning. All providers must also be educated about the stages of dementia, especially when patients speak about the gradual loss of functioning in daily activities.

Infectious disease specialists treating these patients are encouraged to perform simple screening tests like the Mini-Mental State Exam or the Montreal Cognitive Assessments to look for neurocognitive impairment. They are also encouraged to simultaneously screen for symptoms of depression, including anhedonia, apathy, and lack of concentration. If there is any deficit seen in the screening tests, providers are highly encouraged to refer the patients for neuropsychological testing to determine areas of dysfunction.

Given that mood symptoms are prevalent in patients with HIV disease, a careful history is necessary regarding the onset of mood symptoms, and screeners such as the PHQ-9 may be used. If a patient scores in the range of moderate to severe depression, then a referral to a mental health provider should be made. Evidence has shown that treatment of concurrent mood and even psychotic symptoms has played a role in treating HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. In case patients with HIV disease are hospitalized and show signs of cognitive dysfunction, a careful distinction must be made between delirium and cognitive decline. Longitudinal cognitive assessments and neurological exams must be made during the hospitalization.

Specialty-trained nurses can assist clinicians with early detection of this disease by conducting a cognitive screen every year and monitoring scores to recognize any sharp decline. Nurses can also help educate patients regarding the importance of compliance with HAART to prevent this disease. Clinical pharmacists can help providers identify treatment options with minimal adverse side effects and check for drug-drug interactions. A collaborative interprofessional team approach to patients with HIV can help deter neurocognitive disorders and ensure adequate management if the disease occurs.[Level 5]
