The stomatognathic system includes various anatomical structures, which allow the mouth to open, swallow, breathe, phonate, suck and perform different facial expressions. These structures are the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), jaw and mandible, muscle tissues and tendons, dental arches, salivary glands, as well as the hyoid bone and the muscles that connect the latter to the scapula and the sternum, the muscles of the neck.

TMJ through its complex movements, on different orthogonal planes and multiple rotation axes, works in synergy with all the structures just listed. The TMJ must also work in coordination with the contralateral TMJ to coordinate tandem dynamic function.

Its position and structure make it an intersection of information and influences that expand throughout the body, and vice-versa; the mechanical information of other body districts can reflect in the TMJ.

The article reviews functional anatomy, embryological development, differences in the anatomy of the child and the adult, with a look at the surgical, clinical and other physiological variables that influence the temporomandibular function. The text reviews the manual approach to TMJ, which is often used as a support for joint rehabilitation, in synergy with the doctor.
