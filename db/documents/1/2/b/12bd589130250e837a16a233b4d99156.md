Cat scratch disease typically causes a mild illness in immunocompetent hosts. Fifty-five percent of cases are in children younger than 18 years of age; 60% of these are males. More than one-half occur in September through January in the United States. The distribution is worldwide.

The vector of cat scratch disease are cats that acquire the bacteria from the cat flea (Ctenocephalides felis) bite with subsequent bacteremia. The cat is not symptomatic at the time. B. henselae is difficult to culture but can be detected by serologic or by PCR methods.  Infection may be acquired from scratch, bite, or infected saliva through broken skin. Fifty-six percent of cats with bacteremia are less than 1 year of age.
