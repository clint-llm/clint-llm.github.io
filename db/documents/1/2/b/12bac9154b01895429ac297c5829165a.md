Reports exist of acute thrombocytopenia within 24 hours. If platelet count drops below 100,000/mm during the infusion, discontinue the GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. Usually, platelet count normalizes between 1 to 2 weeks. The clinician should have the patient's coagulation parameters and platelet count checked before and during infusion. Platelet count should be checked 2 to 4 hours after the beginning of infusion and at 24 hours. These patients require careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of bleeding along with other possible adverse events. The glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors may need to be continued after the procedure in patients at high risk for thrombus burden. Such patients should be monitored closely in an intensive care unit.
