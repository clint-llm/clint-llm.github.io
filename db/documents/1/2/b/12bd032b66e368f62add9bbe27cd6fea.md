Approximately 75% to 95% of patients with medullary thyroid cancer present as a thyroid nodule in the upper portion of the gland where C cells are primarily located. About 70% will have cervical lymphadenopathy, and a few patients have compression symptoms like dysphagia, hoarseness, or respiratory difficulty. Metastatic spread can be present in less than 10% of patients at presentation. Liver, bone, lung, and brain are common sites for metastases in medullary thyroid cancer. High calcitonin levels can cause diarrhea in a minority of patients.

The index case in FMTC and MEN syndrome presents similarly to sporadic medullary thyroid cancer, except that presentation is often at an earlier age compared to sporadic medullary thyroid cancer.
