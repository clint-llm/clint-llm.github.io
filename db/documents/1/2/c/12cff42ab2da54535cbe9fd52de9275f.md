Histopathologic findings are often nonspecific and distinguishing LGV from other inflammatory or infectious etiologies may be challenging. Inflammation, cryptitis, and crypt abscesses are prominent histologic features of inflammation due to LGV on rectal biopsy. Crypt architectural distortion, increased inflammatory cells in the lamina propria, granuloma formation, and transmural inflammation may be evident.
