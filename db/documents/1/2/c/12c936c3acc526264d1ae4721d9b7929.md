Antimicrobial resistance is becoming an increasingly common clinical dilemma for medical providers. In particular, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) is challenging to manage. Enterococci are facultative anaerobic gram-positive cocci that are normally commensal organisms of the human gastrointestinal tract. However, they can cause a variety of infections. This activity reviews the development of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus and its epidemiology and presentation, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.
- Review the presentation of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.
- Summarize the treatment considerations for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.
