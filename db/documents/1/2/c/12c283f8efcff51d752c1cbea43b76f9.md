Salicylate poisoning causes a variety of metabolic disorders. Direct stimulation of the cerebral medulla causes hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis. As it is metabolized, it causes an uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria. Lactate levels then increase due to the increase in anaerobic metabolism. The lactic acid along with a slight contribution from the salicylate metabolites result in metabolic acidosis. Hyperventilation worsens in an attemptÂ to compensate for the metabolic acidosis. Eventually, the patient fatigues and is no longer able to compensate via hyperventilation, and metabolic acidosis prevails. This results in hemodynamic instability and end-organ damage.
