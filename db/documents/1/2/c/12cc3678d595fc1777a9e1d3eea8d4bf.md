Elbow dislocations represent the second most common large joint dislocation.

The second decade age group also accounts for nearly half (43.5%) of the elbow dislocations. Age is inversely proportional to elbow dislocation rates: as age increases, elbow dislocation rates decrease. Over half of dislocation events occur at home, followed by at work and at school. The most popular sports with elbow dislocations from highest to lowest rates are football, roller-blading or skateboarding, and wrestling.
