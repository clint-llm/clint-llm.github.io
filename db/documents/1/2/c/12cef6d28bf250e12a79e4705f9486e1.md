Crystalloid fluids are a subset of intravenous solutions that are frequently used in the clinical setting. Crystalloid fluids are the first choice for fluid resuscitation in the presence of hypovolemia, hemorrhage, sepsis, and dehydration. Further clinical applications include acting as a solution for intravenous medication delivery, delivering maintenance fluid in patients with limited or no enteral nutrition, blood pressure management, and increasing diuresis to avoid nephrotoxic drug or toxin-mediated end-organ damage. This activity reviews the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, toxicity, dosing, pharmacodynamics, and monitoring of crystalloid fluids pertinent for interprofessional team members for treating hypovolemia and other indications.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of crystalloid fluids.
- Review the indications for using crystalloid intravenous fluids.
- Summarize the potential adverse effects associated with crystalloid fluid administration.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients when administering crystalloid fluids.
