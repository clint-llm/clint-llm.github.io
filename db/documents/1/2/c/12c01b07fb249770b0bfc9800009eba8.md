Non-surgical rhinoplasty represents a quick, safe, and reliable modality for patients looking to enhance the appearance of the nose while avoiding the cost, recovery, and complications associated with surgical rhinoplasty. Despite its rising popularity, however, non-surgical rhinoplasty should be performed only on a case-by-case basis. It should always be compared to surgical rhinoplasty, which remains the gold standard for treating patients with cosmetic and/or functional deficits of the nose.
