Obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is a syndrome of upper airway dysfunction during sleep that is characterized by snoring and/or increased respiratory effort secondary to greater upper airway resistance and pharyngeal collapsibility. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a sleep disorder that involves a significant decrease or cessation of airflow in the presence of breathing effort. An estimated 58% of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea is attributable to obesity. This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment of obstructive sleep-disordered breathing and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of Obstructive sleep-disordered breathing.
- Describe the pathophysiology of Obstructive sleep-disordered breathing.
- Summarize the treatment options for Obstructive sleep-disordered breathing.
- Outline the use of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members to emphasize diet, weight loss, and use of CPAP, which will decrease morbidity and mortality in those with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing.
