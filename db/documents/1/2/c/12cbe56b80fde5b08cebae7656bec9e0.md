Free air under the diaphragm is often an emergency and warrants surgical exploration. However, there are some findings, such as Chilaiditi sign and syndrome, which are benign and do not warrant surgical intervention.

Identifying pseudo-pneumoperitoneum from pneumoperitoneum could decrease the incidence of unnecessary exploratory laparotomies.
