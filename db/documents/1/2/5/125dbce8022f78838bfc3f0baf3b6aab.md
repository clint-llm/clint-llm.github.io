# Continuing Education Activity

Non-odontogenic tumors of the jaw are rare pathologies that can often be overlooked, resulting in delayed diagnosis and treatment. They cover a vast range of pathologies categorized below; due to the breadth of this topic, only six more common conditions are described in detail; osteosarcoma, central giant cell granuloma, fibrous dysplasia, osteoma, osteochondroma, and osteoblastoma. The activity reviews the assessment and treatment of non-odontogenic tumors and discusses the role of the interprofessional team in caring for these patients.

**Objectives:**

# Introduction

Non-odontogenic tumor of the jaw is a term that encompasses a vast range of pathologies that cannot be fully dealt with below. Instead, the focus will be on pathology that is more commonly encountered in clinical practice, although many are still exceedingly rare.

**Osteosarcoma**

Osteosarcoma is a malignant tumor of the bone, accounting for over half of all primary bone tumors. Osteosarcoma of the jaw accounts for 6% of all osteosarcoma,s and after squamous cell carcinomas are the second most common malignancy of the jaws.

**Fibrous Dysplasia**

Fibrous dysplasia is a fibro-osseous disease that causes abnormal bone maturation and remodeling. It does not cause a discrete lesion but leads to abnormal bony swellings and has therefore been included as an important form of non-odontogenic tumor.

It can occur in monostotic (80 to 85%) and polyostotic forms (single vs. multiple bones, respectively). McCune-Albright syndrome is a form of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia. There are associated cutaneous changes in the form of café-au-lait spots and widespread endocrinopathies. Jaffe-Lichtenstein syndrome is another polyostotic form of fibrous dysplasia with café-au-lait spots but the absence of endocrinopathies.

**Central Giant Cell Granuloma**

Central giant cell granuloma is the most common non-odontogenic tumor that affects the jaws, accounting for 7% of benign jaw tumors.

**Osteoma**

An osteoma is a benign, slow-growing proliferation of compact or cancellous bone.

Gardener syndrome must be investigated as an underlying diagnosis in either the presence of multiple osteomas or osteoma in children. This is an autosomal dominant condition that leads to osteomas, fibromatosis, and polyposis of the large intestines. These adenomatous polyps ultimately undergo malignant transformation and lead to adenocarcinomas of the large intestines in all patients.

**Osteochondroma**

Osteochondroma is a benign hamartoma in the form of cartilage capped, bony outgrowth. They are primarily found in the axial skeleton in areas of endochondral ossification. Consequently, they are rare in the facial skeleton, as this primarily undergoes membranous ossification. When they do occur, they appear in the mandibular condyle, occasionally also occurring in the coronoid process.

**Osteoblastoma**

Osteoblastoma is a rare benign neoplasm; it is primarily found in the vertebral column but can occur in the jaws, most commonly the mandible. There is significant debate surrounding their natural course of progression and histology; consequently, diagnosis can be challenging.

Surrounding literature will often use terms such as ‘osteoid osteoma,’ ‘juvenile active ossifying fibroma,’ and ‘aggressive osteoblastoma’ to describe this pathology. Osteoid osteoma is histologically indistinguishable from osteoblastoma but will exhibit pain as a more prominent feature. Some believe it represents a different pathology entirely, and others feel it is an early phase of the developing osteoblastoma. Juvenile active ossifying fibroma and aggressive osteoblastoma both describe the same subtype of osteoblastoma. This aggressive subtype, described above, is more often seen in young adults.

# Etiology

**Osteosarcoma**

The true etiology of osteosarcoma is unknown. Most research analyses the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma of the long bones rather than being specific to the jaws. The relevance of this distinction is the variation in characteristics and clinical behavior between the two. Osteosarcoma of the jaw has a later onset, is more commonly low-grade, has a reduced risk of metastasis, and better overall prognosis.

Tumor suppressor genes p53 and RB1 mutations are thought to be involved in tumor initiation.

**Fibrous Dysplasia**

Fibrous dysplasia is caused by a genetic mutation in GNAS 1, leading to defective bone maturation during embryogenesis. This mutation occurs at different points in embryogenesis for each individual, altering the population size of daughter cells carrying the mutation. This accounts for the heterogeneity seen and is a form of somatic mosaicism. It is felt that earlier mutations lead to conditions like McCune-Albright syndrome and later monostotic fibrous dysplasia.

**Central Giant Cell Granuloma**

It was once thought that central giant cell granuloma represented a local reparative response to traumatic or inflammatory intramedullary hemorrhage.

**Osteoma**

The cause of osteoma is unknown. Multiple theories exist, defining them as either development abnormalities, neoplastic events, or a reactionary response. Most cited within the literature is that of a reaction to trauma or infection, with subsequent subperiosteal edema, bleeding and muscle traction thought to trigger uninhibited bone growth. Evidence to support abnormal muscle traction is their development in proximity to the muscular attachment on the lower border of the mandible.

**Osteochondroma**

There are many theories as to the development of osteochondromas. Some believe they occur due to epiphyseal cartilage herniation. Alternatively, due to their common formation at the insertion of the lateral pterygoid, some suggest that periosteal stress triggers the cartilaginous potential of accumulated embryonic cells in the region of tendon insertion.

**Osteoblastoma**

With the large degree of debate on the categorization and natural history of osteoblastoma, it is not surprising that etiology is poorly understood. Some have stated that trauma and abnormal local response to injury are involved, but little is truly understood.

# Epidemiology

**Osteosarcoma**

Osteosarcoma of the jaw is seen later than osteosarcoma of long bones, with an average onset in the third to fourth decade. It is seen equally in both genders. Osteosarcoma of the jaws represented only 6% of all osteosarcomas.

**Fibrous Dysplasia**

This is a rare disease encountered in young individuals, with few cases occurring after 20 years. There appears to be no sex predilection.

**Central Giant Cell Granuloma**

Population incidence is thought to be 0.0001%.

**Osteoma**

Osteoma of the jaw is rare, with an incidence of 0.01 to 0.04%.

**Osteochondroma**

Osteochondroma can occur at any age, more commonly over 20 years.

**Osteoblastoma**

Osteoblastoma of the jaw is seen more commonly in males at a ratio of 6 to 4. The age of onset is broad-ranging, 5 to 60 years.

# Histopathology

**Osteosarcoma**

Osteosarcoma is of mesenchymal origin and exhibits proliferation of osteoblastic precursors, which produce osteoid and immature bone. Neoplastic cells will show anaplasia, filling of marrows space, and erosion of trabecular bone. They can be histologically classified depending on the extracellular matrix cells produced: osteoblastic, chondroblastic, and fibroblastic. The osteoblastic subtype is most commonly observed in the jaws.

**Fibrous Dysplasia**

It must be noted that fibrous dysplasia is indistinct from ossifying fibroma histologically and, therefore, may only be commented on as a ‘fibro-osseous lesion.’

**Central Giant Cell Granuloma**

Histology shows these lesions to be localized, lobulated, and have osteolytic proliferations. Vascular connective tissue is observed, with a patchy distribution of multinucleated giant cells in the surrounding stoma. Extravasated erythrocytes and hemosiderin deposits are frequently seen, highlighting multifocal hemorrhage.

**Osteoma**

Histology can divide osteomas into compact or cancellous. Compact osteomas, also known as ‘ivory’ osteomas, will exhibit a mature, dense lamellar with minimal fibrous marrow tissue. Cancellous osteomas, however, will exhibit trabecular bone with intervening fibrous fatty marrow and a peripheral cortex.

**Osteochondroma**

Histology shows a bony lesion with a hyaline and fibrous cartilaginous coverage, commonly described as a cap. At the cartilage-to-bone interface, endochondral ossification is commonly observed.

**Osteoblastoma**

The histology of osteoblastoma causes a significant degree of debate, specifically in distinguishing it from low-grade osteosarcoma.

# History and Physical

**Osteosarcoma**

Osteosarcomas of the jaw present with swelling, as opposed to the pain often seen in osteosarcoma of the axial skeleton.

**Fibrous Dysplasia**

Fibrous dysplasia presents as painless, asymmetric bony expansion in children and adolescents. Its onset tends to occur with periods of high skeletal growth and will often stabilize as skeletal maturity is obtained.

**Central Giant Cell Granuloma**

Central giant cell granuloma may be indolent, causing a painless bony swelling.

**Osteoma**

Osteomas are slow-growing lesions that can remain asymptomatic for years. This means that they can be incidental findings on imaging. Depending on their location and size, they can cause distortion of form and function. They can lead to trismus, malocclusion, and occasionally pain; aesthetically, they can cause facial asymmetry and prominent swellings.

**Osteochondroma**

As these lesions commonly occur in the mandibular condyle or coronoid process, symptoms are related to temporomandibular joint dysfunction.

**Osteoblastoma**

Often patients will show minimal symptoms of osteoblastoma, and swelling with fluctuating, dull-pain related to bone expansion may be experienced. The duration of symptoms varies from months to years.

Osteoblastomas are classically felt to have limited growth potential, not exceeding 4cm. The exception to this is an aggressive osteoblastoma seen in younger individuals.

# Evaluation

**Osteosarcoma**

The features seen on plain film radiographs vary depending on the destructive nature of the tumor and the degree of remineralization. Often, a lesion with irregular, poorly defined margins is observed. Several classical signs may be noted. They are not pathognomonic for osteosarcoma and are not always present. Codman’s triangle is an effect caused by the elevation of the periosteum over the lesion in a tent-like manner. The classical ‘sun-ray’ appearance describes the invasion of the periosteum by thin spicules of bony tumors in an outward direction. Garrington’s sign describes widening of the periodontal ligament and inferior alveolar nerve canal.

More precise imaging should be undertaken, ideally with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to assess the extent and invasion of the lesion, specifically looking at marrow involvement and relation to surrounding structures; this will allow for tumor staging.

Biopsy through the center of the lesion must be obtained to get an accurate tissue diagnosis. Osteosarcoma can be a difficult histological diagnosis, and occasionally repeated biopsies are required. Staging scans are undertaken specifically to assess thoracic metastasis, most commonly through a computerized tomography (CT) of the chest.

**Fibrous Dysplasia**

On radiographs, fibrous dysplasia is a poorly defined lesion that merges into surrounding bone. It has a classical ‘ground glass’ appearance. It may begin as a lucent lesion and become more sclerotic over time. On CT imaging, there is a buccolingual expansion and thus thinning of the cortical plate. There is also a characteristic 3-dimensional displacement of the inferior alveolar nerve canal and loss of the lamina dura around affected teeth.

**Central Giant Cell Granuloma**

When assessing central giant cell granulomas, it is important to exclude any underlying systemic diagnosis. Hyperparathyroidism will lead to brown tumors, which will occur as multiple osteoclastic giant cell tumors. Cherubism will cause bilateral lesions in the mandible of young children. Bloods work assessing bone profile and PTH levels is important, and family history might highlight potential cherubism.

Radiographic assessment is not pathognomonic and may vary. It will show a radiolucent lesion, which may be small around the root of a tooth or large, involving most of the jaw, resorbing the cortical plate and adjacent teeth. For small lesions, plain radiographs may suffice. For large, aggressively destructive lesions, 3-dimensional CT imaging will provide a more complete picture of the bony destruction.

**Osteoma**

Osteoma may be incidental findings on imaging. However, in the case of clinical detection, assessment with initial radiographs will show a well-defined radio-opacity.

**Osteochondroma**

Plain film radiograph of osteochondroma has pathognomonic features, specifically continuity of the medullary space with the underlying bone. Three classical appearances have been described. Firstly, an enlarged condyle with anteromedial extension into the lateral pterygoid.

CT imaging will give a more 3-dimensional appreciation when assessing the lesion and allow better pre-operative planning; this can often be completed as a cone-beam CT with reduced radiation doses.

**Osteoblastoma**

Radiographic findings are mixed for these lesions; alternating regions of radiolucency and radiopacity are observed depending on the degree of calcification.

# Treatment / Management

**Osteosarcoma**

Osteosarcoma is primarily managed surgically, with 1.5 to 2 cm margin excision.

**Fibrous Dysplasia**

Fibrous dysplasia bony expansion stabilizes as bony maturity is achieved; therefore, the timing of any intervention must be closely considered in light of the patient’s age. Patients with a milder degree of deformity will require no surgery as they adapt to the facial expansion. Surgical management consists of debulking and recontouring. While the bony skeleton is still growing, the fibrous dysplasia is in a more active phase, and therefore recurrence is more likely to occur. It is, therefore, preferable to wait until adulthood before surgical intervention is undertaken.

**Central Giant Cell Granuloma**

These lesions can be treated via surgical and non-surgical means. The surgery varies depending on the location, size, and aggressiveness of the lesion and can range from curettage to large-scale resection and reconstruction.

**Osteoma**

As a benign, slowly growing pathology, the management of osteoma is dependent on the symptoms it produces. When small and not causing any functional or aesthetic distortion, it can be monitored.

**Osteochondroma**

Treatment is dependent on the size and location of the osteochondroma. Generally, they required surgical excision, as their location in the joint impinges function. If the entirety of the condyle is involved, a condylectomy is performed and most commonly reconstructed with alloplastic total joint prostheses.

**Osteoblastoma**

The main obstacle to treatment for osteoblastoma is diagnostic certainty. Treatment is case-specific, depending on the aggressiveness of the tumor. Some cases are well managed with local curettage, whereas others undergo wide margin resections.

# Differential Diagnosis

**Osteosarcoma**

- Osteoblastoma – it can be very difficult to distinguish between low-grade osteosarcoma and an aggressive subtype of osteoblastoma. Osteoblastomas are benign and do not metastasize.

- Ossifying fibroma – can be distinguished by absent extracortical bone loss.

- Osteomyelitis – will produce a similar moth-eaten appearance on radiographs with extra-cortical bone loss but has a differing clinical course and is unlikely to cause paraesthesia, a feature of perineural invasion.

**Fibrous dysplasia**

The primary differential for fibrous dysplasia is other fibro-osseous conditions.

- Ossifying fibroma – histologically indistinct from fibrous dysplasia, this is more commonly in tooth-bearing areas and has well-defined radiolucency.

- Segmental odontomaxillary dysplasia – this causes failure of maxillary pre-molar eruption with gingival hyperplasia.

- Paget’s disease – seen in an older population, more commonly associated with pain and altered bone profile.

**Central giant cell granuloma**

Giant cell granulomas can be seen in other systemic conditions; it is, therefore, vital to exclude these.

- Brown’s tumor of hyperparathyroidism – histologically indistinguishable but normally present in multiple and with deranged bone profile results.

- Cherubism – this is an autosomal dominant disorder, most commonly caused by a mutation in SH3P2. It causes widespread and multiple osteolytic lesions of, primarily, the posterior mandible. Onset is in childhood, producing a classical, symmetric full-cheek appearance.

- Noonan syndrome

- Neurofibromatosis type I

- Aneurysmal bone cysts

**Osteoma**

- Bony exostoses – differentiated by lack of further growth following puberty, most are lobulated and multifocal.

- Osteoid osteoma – pain is a more prominent feature, and faster expansion is present.

- Late-stage, central ossifying fibroma – borders are well defined, with a surrounding sclerotic border presenting as a thin radiolucent line.

- Complex odontoma – demonstrates greater density on radiographic assessment.

**Osteochondroma**

Generally, due to their pathognomonic radiographic features, osteochondromas can be identified from plain films.

- Malignant lesions, i.e., chondrosarcomas and osteosarcomas - will have aggressive spread, causing surrounding soft tissue damage, leading to symptoms such as paraesthesia.

- Condylar hyperplasia – proportionate growth with regular contours of the condyle.

- Hemimandibular hyperplasia – Anomaly of the entire mandible involving ramus and body.

**Osteoblastoma**

- Osteoid osteoma – may represent an early phase of the disease or be a separate entity. Clinically distinguished by smaller size (<2cm), pain worse at night, and good response to salicylates and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories.

- Low-grade osteosarcoma – distinction can be difficult with similar histology. Osteosarcoma can cause lung metastases and is more likely to cause surrounding neural dysfunction.

- Cementoblastoma – round radiopacity, normally at apical half of single-rooted tooth causing pain, odontogenic in origin.

- Ossifying fibroma – mixed radiolucency, spherical in shape, pain is not a prominent feature.

# Prognosis

**Osteosarcoma**

Osteosarcoma is an aggressive, metastatic malignancy. The types seen in the jaws are less aggressive and have a better prognosis than those in the axial skeleton. The risk of lung metastasis is 20 to 25%.

**Fibrous Dysplasia**

Malignant transformation, although very rare, can occur (1%).

**Central Giant Cell Granuloma**

Central giant cell granuloma can have aggressive, locally destructive behavior or may be indolent and respond to non-surgical therapies. The recurrence rate is higher in these aggressive forms, particularly if incompletely removed. Recurrence normally occurs within the first 12 to 18 months.

**Osteoma**

Osteomas have a good overall prognosis, recurrence following surgical excision is exceedingly rare, and there are no reported cases of malignant transformation.

**Osteochondroma**

Excision is usually curative. The recurrence rate is low and elsewhere in the body, reported at 1 to 2%. There are only two reports within the literature on the malignant transformation of craniofacial osteochondromas.

**Osteoblastoma**

Osteoblastoma has a high recurrence rate, reported at up to 20%.

# Complications

**Osteosarcoma**

Complications are inherent to the malignant nature of the condition. Significant morbidity is associated with wider resection of the jaws and needs for subsequent reconstruction.

**Fibrous Dysplasia**

Fibrous dysplasia can cause marked facial asymmetry in children and adolescents, and it can therefore cause a large degree of distress to patients and their families. Complications are from specific surgical intervention and the risk of regrowth if the patient is in the active phase.

**Central Giant Cell Granuloma**

Complications can occur due to the destructive nature of central giant cell lesions, particularly loss of dentition or tooth buds.  When cortical bone erosion occurs around nerves, specifically the inferior alveolar nerve, impingement can occur. As it does not exhibit perineural invasion but only impingement, once repositioned, the inferior alveolar nerve function is restored.

**Osteoma**

Complications from osteomas can be either related to their functional impact or the surgery performed to remove them and are therefore related to their location and surrounding anatomical structures.

**Osteochondroma**

Complications of osteochondromas occur due to their impingement of temporomandibular joint function and surgical intervention. These are not normally specific to osteochondromas but to temporomandibular surgical intervention generally.

**Osteoblastoma**

When small and managed with local curettage, complications may be minimal. However, when representing an aggressive subtype, high morbidity and small numbers of reported mortalities may be observed.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

The etiology of non-odontogenic tumors of the jaw is poorly understood, in part due to their rarity. Therefore, discussions around deterrence are minimal, as little can be done to stop their development. Once a diagnosis has been established, patient education and empowerment are always crucial. Understanding diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment options will allow for shared decision-making and improved compliance with the treatment plan.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

**Osteosarcoma**

As a malignant condition, osteosarcoma would involve the Head and Neck multidisciplinary team with input from surgeons, oncologists, pathologists, and specialist nurses, to name a few. As a rare malignancy, a specialist's opinion of tissue diagnosis is likely necessary.

**Fibrous Dysplasia**

Fibrous dysplasia can occur as part of a broader systemic syndrome; therefore, liaison with endocrinologists, pediatricians, and other specialists may be required. Asymmetric facial expansion is likely to cause malocclusion, and thus orthodontic treatment and liaison will be necessary.

**Central Giant Cell Granuloma**

It is important to distinguish central giant cell granuloma from its systemic counterparts. Clinicians, therefore, must have a broad appreciation of what multiple or bilateral lesions may imply and must carry out a relevant biochemical investigation and familial screening.

**Osteoma**

Osteomas in children, or their presence in multiple, must prompt consideration of Gardener syndrome. Osteomas can precede colonic polyposis; therefore, an awareness of underlying causes and screening is vital for early recognition of the disease.

**Osteochondroma**

As osteochondromas can lead to compensatory dentofacial deformity, involvement of the whole facial deformity team will therefore be involved; this will likely include both orthognathic and orthodontic specialists.

**Osteoblastoma**

Due to their ambiguous nature and thus challenge for diagnostic certainty, multiple specialist opinions are often sought in these cases. Where there is uncertainty, histological specimens may be sent to specialist bone units for analysis. The presence of aggressive lesions in adolescents will require a holistic approach when recommending and discussing treatment with patients and their families.
