Historically the Child-Pugh classification was used for liver transplant allocations. However, there were three primary limitations to its use: 1) grading ascites and encephalopathy require a subjective assessment, 2) the classification system does not account for renal function, and 3) there are only ten different scores (based on points) available. This last limitation was significant because patients were not able to be adequately differentiated based on the severity of the disease, and therefore wait time had a considerable impact on prioritization.
