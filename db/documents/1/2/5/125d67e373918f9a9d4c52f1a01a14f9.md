Nonorganic functional hearing loss is a unique condition in which hearing loss is present on audiological assessment despite the absence of corresponding organic impairment in the auditory system. It can result from a variety of underlying etiologies. A prompt and accurate diagnosis followed by appropriate treatment is necessary to prevent the morbidity associated with this condition. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of nonorganic functional hearing loss and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the etiology of nonorganic functional hearing loss.
- Describe a typical patient history associated with nonorganic functional hearing loss.
- Explain the interpretation of audiological and diagnostic tests for nonorganic functional hearing loss.
- Summarize the management considerations for patients with nonorganic functional hearing loss.
