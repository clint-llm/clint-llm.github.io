Uterine endometrial cancer is the most prevalent gynecologic malignancy in American women and a major cause of both morbidity and mortality. Over 60,000 new cases are expected during the next year. The diagnosis and management of endometrial cancer is challenging and complex, and requires the expertise of interprofessional team members who are familiar with all aspects of its evaluation and treatment. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of endometrial carcinoma and stresses the role of an interprofessional team approach to care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of endometrial carcinoma.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation for a patient with suspected endometrial carcinoma.
- Describe the treatment strategies for endometrial carcinoma based upon the stage of the cancer.
- Explain the importance of improving coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care for patients affected by endometrial cancer and improve outcomes.
