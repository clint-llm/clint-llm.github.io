Managing potassium overdose requires an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals, including nurses, laboratory technologists, pharmacists, and physicians in different specialties. Without prompt and proper management, the morbidity and mortality from potassium overdose are high. Cardiovascular mortality from hyperkalemia especially increases in patients with chronic kidney disease and those on dialysis.

- Ordering serial blood potassium levels

- Monitor the patient for signs and symptoms of cardiac arrhythmias, and continuous EKG monitoring

- Performing various maneuvers to help limit the absorption of the drug in the body

- Rapid administration of sodium bicarbonate and calcium gluconate or calcium chloride to limit cardiotoxicity

- Consult with the pharmacist about the use of Polystyrene sulfonate and glucose-insulin

- Consult with a nephrologist on further management, which may include dialysis

- Consult with a cardiologist for management of life-threatening arrhythmias

Existing treatment protocols for critical hyperkalemia resulting from potassium administration have no support by solid evidence and appear to be institution-specific.
