The thyroid diverticulum first forms at the end of the fourth week of development as a solid, proliferating mass of endoderm at the foramen cecum on what will become the tongue. This mass of endoderm migrates down through the developing neck via the thyroglossal duct toward its eventual home, just inferior to the cricoid cartilage. In normal development, the thyroglossal duct deteriorates by the end of the fifth week. The only remaining aspect of the thyroidâ€™s embryonal development will be the foramen cecum at the base of the developed tongue. The isolated thyroid gland develops two distinct lobes connected by an isthmus of tissue by this time and continues to descend and reaches its final destination by the end of the seventh week of development. Cells from the ultimobranchial bodies invade the developing thyroid and form the parafollicular cells, or C cells, which will produce calcitonin. The connective tissue of the thyroid gland forms from invading neural crest cells.
