**Oral Candidiasis**

Candida albicans are commensal fungi in the oral cavity. Commensal microorganisms reside in the external surface of the body or mucosa without affecting human health. However, they may become pathological under appropriate conditions, causing superficial to invasive disseminated infections.

In its commensal yeast state, Candida reversibly attaches to the oral epithelial cells through electrostatic interactions.

Extracellular hydrolytic enzymes like secreted aspartyl proteinases and secreted phospholipases produced by C. albicans mediate the destruction of host tissue and subsequent invasion.C. albicans can form biofilms on denture bases, thereby increasing virulence and decreasing antifungal susceptibility.

**Aspergillosis**

The fungal conidia enter the respiratory tract by inhalation but are removed by the alveolar macrophages in healthy people. Conidia that escape macrophage surveillance are encountered by the neutrophils. In patients with underlying risk factors, the conidia germinate and disseminate by vascular invasion and spread to the skin, orbits, and palate. After Aspergillus has inoculated the oral cavity, it can invade the host tissues by releasing toxins, e.g., aflatoxin, proteases, phospholipases, hemolysin, gliotoxin, and phthioic acid.

Spores can also enter the sinuses during dental procedures like root canal treatment or tooth extraction and become pathological.

**Mucormycosis**

Spores of Zygomycetes enter the host by inhalation of dust or air from air conditioners. Neutrophils and phagocytes play a central role in the host defense mechanism. This explains the prevalence of mucormycosis in patients with diabetes mellitus and neutropenia.

The infection usually starts in the nasal cavity, where the humid environment favors fungal growth. Oral infection usually spreads through the paranasal sinuses via the nose or direct wound contamination. The palate is affected if the infection spreads through the sinuses. Wound contamination can affect any part of the oral cavity. Implantation of the organism into the maxilla can occur during any oral surgical procedure.

The fungal organism invades the small blood vessels and forms thrombi within them, reducing the tissue vascularity and causing necrosis. Interaction of spore-coat protein (CotH) on the fungal surface and glucose regulator protein (GRP78) on the endothelium facilitates the organism's attachment to the blood vessels.

Patients with diabetic ketoacidosis or patients under deferoxamine therapy are at increased risk of developing zygomycosis. Increased serum iron levels are observed in diabetic ketoacidosis as acidosis causes the release of iron from iron-binding proteins like transferrin. Fungal hyphae produce rhizoferrin, which binds to iron and facilitates iron uptake by the fungus. Iron enhances the growth of Zygomycetes.

**Histoplasmosis**

Histoplasma capsulatum thrives in the soil rich in bird or bat excrement. Upon entry into the host through inhalation, the mycelium form transforms into yeast form.Histoplasma. To evade this host response, Histoplasma produces α-linked glucans to surround and conceal β-glucans.

The heat shock protein, Hsp60, present on the cell wall of the yeasts, facilitates their entry into the macrophage by interacting with the CR3 receptor present on the host macrophage without triggering inflammation. When the immunity is low, the fungus multiplies within the macrophages and disseminates to other organs. In some cases, the macrophages surround and confine the fungi, which reactivate at a later stage.

**Blastomycosis**

Following inhalation, Blastomyces dermatitidis conidia are phagocyted by alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, and monocytes. Conidia that survive phagocytosis undergo a morphological shift to the yeast form, which is resistant to phagocytosis due to a thick capsule.

The conversion of conidia to yeast form in response to a change in temperature from 22 to 37 degrees C is essential for its pathogenicity, which is mediated by virulence factors: dimorphism-regulating kinase-1 and blastomyces adhesion-1 (BAD1).

**Cryptococcosis**

The inhaled spores enter the lungs, where they activate alveolar macrophages. The macrophages, in turn, recruit other immune cells to elicit helper T cell responses.

The yeast can be latent within the phagolysosome in thoracic lymph nodes for many years. The prominent mucopolysaccharide capsule and other virulence factors (melanin production, phospholipase, and urease activity) protect the fungi against the host defense, enabling them to survive within the macrophages. The fungi produce mucin, causing the macrophages to burst, ultimately leading to granulomatous inflammation.

The infection may become symptomatic or disseminated without a granulomatous reaction. In immunodeficient states, the yeast proliferates and spreads through the blood to the brain by crossing the blood-brain barrier.

**Paracoccidiomycosis**

Paracoccidioides enter the lungs through inhalation, transform into yeast form, and then disseminate. Sometimes the organism can directly enter the mucosa without affecting the lungs.

**Geotrichosis**

Geotrichum is a part of the normal oral flora. It is not pathogenic in immunocompetent individuals.
