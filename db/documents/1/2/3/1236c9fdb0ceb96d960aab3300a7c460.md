There are two common forms of FXIII deficiency: congenital and acquired.

**Congenital FXIII deficiency**

Rare bleeding disorders are mostly inherited autosomal recessively. Iran, a middle eastern nation with remote areas of high incidences of consanguinity, has a phenomenally high rate of rare bleeding disorders (RBD), especially Factor XIII. While factor activity measurements are useful for other RBD, clot solubility is necessary for FXIII deficiency diagnostics. As aforementioned, severe, life-threatening bleeding is often the characteristic clinical presentation.

**Acquired FXIII deficiency**

Causes of acquired FXIII deficiency include immune-mediated inhibition, non-immune FXIII heightened consumption, or lack of synthesis. Acquired deficiency is attributed to idiopathic causes, autoimmune diseases, and malignant conditions.
