The blood supply of the mandibular and maxillary dentition is supplied by the maxillary artery, a branch of the external carotid artery.

Other important adjacent arteries include:

- The superficial temporal artery, a branch of the external carotid artery, which supplies the scalp of the forehead, the soft tissues below the zygomatic arch, the masseters, and the parotid glands

- The facial artery, a branch of the external carotid artery, which supplies the superficial face, the submandibular gland, the soft palate, the palatine tonsils, and the nose

- The ganglionic branch of the internal carotid artery which supplies the trigeminal ganglion

- The lingual artery, a branch of the external carotid artery, which supplies the floor of the oral cavity, the sublingual gland, and the tongue

The lymphatics of the mouth are complex, with key nodal drainage as follows:

- The superficial face and cheek drained by the buccal nodes

- The teeth and gingivae drained by the submandibular nodes

- The anterior gingivae, the tip of the tongue, and the anterior floor of the mouth are drained by the submental nodes

- The oral cavity, oropharynx, nasopharynx, and larynx are drained by the jugulodigastric nodes
