Fluoroscopy-guided catheter angiography complications are uncommon and can be divided into four groups: percutaneous access-site, catheter-related, systemic, and radiation-related. Access-site hematoma is unusual but may occur in up to 10% of patients.

Catheter-related complications include subintimal guidance of guidewires or catheters, dissections, or embolization. These complications occur in less than 0.5% of cases.

Systemic complications are seen in less than 1% of angiographic cases.

Reports of fluoroscopy-related skin injuries began to increase in the early 1990s and coincided with the increased utilization of fluoroscopy-guided interventions.
