Dysgraphia is defined as a difficulty or inability to clearly and correctly communicate through written language. This evaluation requires adjustment to the patient's age and education. Syntaxis errors, ineligible handwriting, odd spelling, and inaccurate word production are common. Writing is a complex task that requires exquisiteÂ coordination of higher levels of complex cognitive domains, including expressive language and fine motor skills.
