Pneumocystis was originally thought to be a member of the protozoan class but was reclassified as an ascomycetous fungus in 1988. Its life cycle had been said to resemble that of both a protozoan and a fungus, and the debate over its correct classification led to further studies. Through careful phylogenetic analysis of small subunit ribosomal RNAs, researchers have been able to compare plant, animal, fungi, and protozoan lineages. Ultimately, investigators have concluded with distinct certainty that Pneumocystis is a member of the fungi family based on cell wall composition, the structure of key enzymes, and gene sequencing. The Pneumocystis genus includes several species, including P. carinii and P. jirovecii, which infect rats and humans.
