The mainstay of diagnosis for La Crosse encephalitis is enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing for IgM and IgG antibodies in the serum. Convalescent titers in two weeks that demonstrate a four-fold increase is diagnostic.

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention suggests a preliminary diagnosis for La Crosse encephalitis be made based on clinical features of the symptoms described above as well as places or dates of travel for those living in a non-endemic region. Testing for cerebrospinal fluid or serum La Crosse virus IgM is recommended, whose results can take between a week to 14 days. In fatal cases, nucleic acid amplification and histopathology of brain tissue on autopsy can confirm the diagnosis. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis often reveals a lymphocytic pleocytosis with elevated protein and normal glucose. Cerebrospinal fluid viral culture is not as helpful and often yields a negative culture. Basic metabolic panel and complete blood count are also helpful in evaluating for leukocytosis and electrolyte derangements such as hyponatremia associated with La Crosse encephalitis.

Imaging modalities such as head computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) do not have any characteristic findings associated with La Crosse encephalitis and can oftentimes be normal. In some cases, however, CT head may show cerebral edema and possibly cerebral herniation due to increased intracranial pressure. Basal ganglia hemorrhage has also been reported in a few cases.

Electroencephalography (EEG) can demonstrate non-specific abnormal findings such as unilateral slowing, periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges, or seizures in up to 90% of patients.
