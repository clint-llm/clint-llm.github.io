Many patients with cardiomegaly are asymptomatic, and the presence of symptoms alone is neither sensitive nor specific to diagnosis. The diagnosis of cardiomegalyÂ is based on imaging, and history is only helpful in determining the cause of heart failure symptoms, resulting in systemic congestion and impaired organ perfusion.

A detailed history should elicit the presence or absence of the following:

- Shortness of breath on exertion or rest, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea

- Peripheral edema and abdominal distension

- Fatigue and poor exercise tolerance

- Palpitations, lightheadedness, and/or syncope

- Angina

- Anorexia, nausea, and early satiety

- Family history of cardiomyopathy

- Recent pregnancy/childbirth

- Comorbid illnesses, such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus

It is worth mentioning that cardiac function is adequate during rest and may become inadequate with exertion. Hence it is not uncommon for patients to be asymptomatic at rest and experience symptoms on exertion only. The New York Heart Association classifies the severity of disease based on symptoms, where class I disease is asymptomatic with ordinary physical activity, and class IV denotes symptoms with rest.

Perhaps the most specific sign of cardiomegaly is a displaced point of maximal impulse (PMI).

- Sinus tachycardia resulting from increased sympathetic drive

- Diminished pulse pressure reflecting reduced stroke volume

- Varying degrees of respiratory distress based on the severity of the disease

- Cool, cyanotic extremities secondary to peripheral vasoconstriction

- Jugular venous distension and/or positive abdominojugular reflex indicating elevated right-sided filling pressures

- Ascites, hepatomegaly, and peripheral edema result from increased pressure in the hepatic veins and systemic veins

- Pulmonary crackles resulting from elevated left-sided filling pressure and transudation of fluid into alveoli

- S3 gallop in early diastole resulting from volume overload and systolic dysfunction; S4 gallop in late diastole resulting from diastolic dysfunction
