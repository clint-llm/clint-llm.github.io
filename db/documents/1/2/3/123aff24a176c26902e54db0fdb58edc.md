Each part of the pyramidal tract receives vascular supply by a different artery depending on its anatomical position. The primary motor cortex, from whichÂ the pyramidal tract originates, is supplied by the middle cerebral artery (MCA), The MCA is responsible for supplying the face and upper extremities, while the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) supplies the lower extremities. Following the course of the pyramidal tract, it passes through the corona radiata and internal capsule, supplied by the lenticulostriate arteries, which are branches of the MCA. The tract continues to pass inferiorly into the brainstem, where the basilar artery provides arterial support. Blockages to the mentioned arteries will manifest as weakness in the body parts controlled by the areas supplied.
