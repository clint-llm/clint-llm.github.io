An interprofessional team approach is essential in the management of POW virus encephalitis and meningoencephalitis. The clinical care team should involve infectious disease, neurology, and critical care clinicians if needed. Patients may also require physical and occupational therapists' expertise to help improve any short or long-term neurologic sequelae that develop. In most US states, Powassan virus infection is a reportable disease, and regional public health authorities should be notified of potential and confirmed cases as active surveillance. Prompt reporting can help identify and mitigate community outbreaks.
