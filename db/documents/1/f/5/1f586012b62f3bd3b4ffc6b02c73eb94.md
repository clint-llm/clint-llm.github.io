**Participation and Psychological Well-being**

Lack of participation in meaningful occupations, called occupational deprivation, leads to depression among LTC residents, which compromises overall psychological well-being.occupational justice, which is a term used to describe humans' right to engage in valued occupations.

**Cognition Ability and Psychological Well-being**

Researchers associated poor quality of life and psychological well-being with impaired cognitive abilities.

**Emotional Health and Psychological Well-being**

With depression rates escalating after admission to LTC facilities, it becomes even more critical to assess the emotional well-being of residents.  Emotional well-being affects motivation to engage in once meaningful activities; depression may appear as a lack of interest, loneliness, and a decline in cognitive capabilities, which further compromises overall well-being.

**Psychological Assessment**

Psychological well-being encompasses participation in meaningful occupations, cognitive ability, and emotional health. Occupational therapy practitioners are proficient in the performance of evaluations for psychological well-being in residents living in LTC.  Comprehensive assessments for psychological well-being should target participation in meaningful activities (including leisure), cognitive abilities, and emotional well-being.  Because there are limited guides for the psychological evaluation available for occupational therapy practitioners in LTC, I list evidence-based assessment resources below.  Due to productivity demands in LTC settings, practitioners can complete most of these selected assessments within a reasonable amount of time.
