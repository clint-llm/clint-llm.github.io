Some anatomic predictors of difficult intubation include: small mouth opening, short thyromental distance, full set of teeth with prominent incisors, reduced mandibular protrusion, reduced submandibular compliance, short neck, large neck circumference, limited neck extension, Mallampati 3 or 4, obesity, surgery or radiation-induced changes. These are not often critical but do additively contribute to a higher likelihood of difficult direct laryngoscopy but may not for video laryngoscopy.

In addition to the anatomical airway factors, the physiologically difficult airway is a newer concept in airway assessment.  This assessment encompasses that airway management is difficult due to hypoxia, hypotension, severe metabolic acidosis, or right ventricular failure.

There can also be contextual issues that contribute to difficult or failed airway management. Examples may be the skill level of the clinician, available help, proper equipment, or patient factors such as intoxication or disability.
