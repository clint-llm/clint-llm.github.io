Patients with vasospastic angina present with the following:

- A chronic pattern of episodes of chest pain at rest that last 5 to 15 minutes, from midnight to early morning.

- Pain decreases with the use of short-acting nitrates.

- Typically, these patients have ischemic ST-segment changes on an electrocardiogram during an episode of chest discomfort, which returns to baseline on symptom resolution.

- Typically, the chest pain is not triggered by exertion or alleviated with rest as is typical angina.

- Often, the patient is younger with few or no classical cardiovascular risk factors.

Other vasospastic disorders, like Raynaud phenomenon or a migraine, can be associated with this subset of patients. Patients may complain of recent or past episodes with some symptom-free periods.
