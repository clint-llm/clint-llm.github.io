Degeneration changes in facet joints will involve the articular cartilage, synovium, and capsule. Thinning of the cartilage, formation of synovial cysts, fibrocartilage proliferation of the capsules, and osteophyte formation all can be seen in facet arthritis. Topographically, the prevalence of facet arthritis is the highest at L4-L5, followed by L5-S1. In the cervical region, it is more common in the mid-cervical region, (between the C3 and C5 vertebrae).
