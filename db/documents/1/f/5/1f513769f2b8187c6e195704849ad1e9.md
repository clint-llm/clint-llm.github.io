Blepharochalasis syndrome is a rare disease of unknown etiology. It is characterized by an active stage of recurrent episodes of upper lid swelling, followed by a quiescent stage with sequelae and no inflammatory signs. Although this condition does not affect the vision, the repeated episodes of inflammation lead to several periocular complications that usually need surgical treatment when the active stage ceases. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of blepharochalasis syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of blepharochalasis syndrome.
- Explain the common physical exam findings associated with blepharochalasis syndrome.
- Review the management options available for blepharochalasis syndrome.
- Outline the importance of care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by blepharochalasis syndrome.
