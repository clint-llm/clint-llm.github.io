Fatal familial insomnia (FFI) is a remarkably rare and invariably fatal inherited neurodegenerative prion disease. The mode of inheritance of this disease is autosomal dominant and involves a mutation of the prion protein (PRNP) gene. Aggressively progressive insomnia, with subsequent autonomic (tachycardia, hyperhidrosis, hypertension), cognitive (short-term memory and attentional deficits), motor system (balance problems), and endocrine dysfunction are a hallmark of the disease. The disease is currentlyÂ incurable and has a mean course of 18 months, ultimately leading to death. The earliest description of the disease dates back to 1765 with a report of an Italian man with symptoms suggestive of FFI. The disease was formally identified and clinically described in 1986 by Lugaresi E. et al., followed by subsequent studies, further describing its pathophysiology, etiology, and clinical course.
