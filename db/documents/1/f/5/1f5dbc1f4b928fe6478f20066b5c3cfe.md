**Joint Fluid Analysis**

- Characteristics of normal synovial fluid analysis include clear appearance, WBC count less than 200 cells/microL, PMNs less than 25%, synovial lactate less than 5.6 mmol/L, and glucose levels approximating serum glucose.

- Characteristics of synovial fluid analysis in inflammatory conditions (e.g., osteoarthritis, trauma) include clear/yellow appearance, WBC count less than 2000 cells/microL, PMNs less than 25%, high viscosity, and glucose level approximating serum glucose.

- Characteristics of synovial fluid analysis suggestive septic joint include WBC count greater than 50,000 cells/microL (greater than 1,100 in a prosthetic joint) with greater than 90% PMN (greater than 65% in a prosthetic joint). Additional suggestive findings include synovial lactate greater than 5.56 mmol/L and LDH >250.

- It is important to note that the absence of one or more of these findings does not definitively differentiate reactive and inflammatory arthritis from infection. It is imperative that the gram stain is obtained if there is a suspicion of septic arthritis. Gram stain must be prioritized if there is an insufficient quantity of synovial fluid to perform all of the recommended testings.

**Clinical Pearls**

- Needle trauma can damage cartilaginous structures. Avoid hitting the bone.

- The thoracoacromial artery lies medial to the coracoid.

- Directing the needle slightly superiorly will help to avoid neurovascular structures.

- The use of ultrasound for joint space identification can increase both procedure safety and success.
