Patients with renal angiomyolipoma should be informed about this disease's benign nature.

Health care providers also have to advise the patients about the importance of medication adherence and compliance and the need for long-term surveillance.

Any woman of childbearing age diagnosed with renal angiomyolipoma who plans to become pregnant should seek consultation to discuss the management of her condition before and during the pregnancy. Pregnancy is considered a significant risk factor for disease progression and complications as the tumor mass will likely grow and may rupture while she is carrying.
