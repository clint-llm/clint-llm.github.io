A thorough history and physical is key when evaluating patients with alcohol use disorder. Screening patients for alcohol abuse and alcohol consumption is very important. Many patients may not mention alcohol consumption when interviewed and may present with neuropathy complaints only. Additional nutritional and diet questions should be investigated. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism recommends using the CAGE questionnaire to help identify a patient's potential problem with alcohol. CAGE questions include:

- Have you ever felt you should **Cut Down**on your drinking?

- Have people **Annoyed**you by criticizing your drinking?

- Have you ever felt bad or **Guilty**about your drinking?

- Have you ever had a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or to get rid of a hangover (**Eye opener**)?

The two most important questions to ask when evaluating for alcohol neuropathy: (1) How much alcohol do you drink? and (2) What is the length of the abuse? These questions can help differential alcohol neuropathy from other forms of neuropathy. Screening for other disease processes that may cause neuropathy, such as diabetes, is also important.

Most patients with alcohol neuropathy initially present with symmetrical polyneuropathies in the lower distal extremities, however; heavier abuse can progress to distal upper extremity symptoms. The most common findings are sensory related and are varied to include pain, numbness, and paresthesias. Pain seems to be consistent through the literature to be one of the most common complaints and can be the first clinical indication of the disease. Keeping this disease process high on the differential with the right history is essential. Progression of the disease leads to symmetrical ascending motor and sensory deficits.

A complete neurological exam is imperative. Physical exam findings include diminished sensation to vibration, pain, dysfunctional thermo-proprioception, weakness in the ankle and toes with flexion and extension, atrophy of foot muscles, gait ataxia, and diminished deep tendon reflexes.
