In primary MN, circulating antibodies bind to intrinsic podocyte antigen. In the 1970s, the Heymann nephritis model of MN in rats showed antibodies to megalin, a transmembrane protein on the rat podocyte, being responsible for sub-epithelial immune deposits.

As for secondary MN, antigen gets deposited on the podocyte, followed by antibody deposition. Another proposed mechanism is the deposition of circulating immune complexes in the serum on the basolateral surface of podocytes. These antigen-antibody complexes cause activation of membrane attack complex C5b-9 which results in oxidative damage and DNA injury to podocytes causing damage to the actin cytoskeleton. Actin cytoskeleton collapse and loss of GBM adhesion cause proteinuria.
