Unique characteristics of keratohyalin granule immunohistochemistry have been used to evaluate many pathologic conditions of the skin and have led to a better understanding of healthy physiology as well.  Histochemistry of the granules in human oral leukoplakia produced staining with Pauly’s reagent, Congo red, and hematoxylin, suggesting a high amount of protein within the granules; however, the keratohyalin granules did not react with Feulgen reagent, demonstrating the absence of DNA.
