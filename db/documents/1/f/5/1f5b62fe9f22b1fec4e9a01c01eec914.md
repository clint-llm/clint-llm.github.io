Pearce et al. reported 26 patients with 226 penile biopsies (10%). Kumar et al. reported a prevalence of 5.82%.

It can present at any age, but it is usually seen in elderly uncircumcised men. Unlike other some inflammatory penile dermatoses, it is generally not thought to be a precursor for neoplasia.
