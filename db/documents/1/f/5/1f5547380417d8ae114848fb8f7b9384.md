CYP alleles group as wild-type vs. variant. Persons who inherit two wild-type alleles will generally be extensive metabolizers (normal), whereas persons with two variant alleles will be poor metabolizers (defective). Those that carry one allele of each are intermediate metabolizers. There is another group known as ultrarapid metabolizers who inherit more than two wild-type alleles, which are subject to their own potential drug effects. Genetic polymorphisms are one theory regarding why certain people exhibit varying tolerance levels of a specific drug. A poor metabolizer may express signs of toxicity at drug dosages that an extensive metabolizer could tolerate.

Outside of heritable DNA, CYP expression can undergo modification by epigenetic changes. Factors shown to play a significant role in CYP expression with varying effects on specific isozymes include age, sex, hormones, infection/inflammation, and environmental factors. Interestingly, females expressed a higher concentration of CYP enzymes, indicating one reason females are subject to metabolize drugs faster.

Research in the molecular field of CYP enzymes is still developing, and the addition of the human genome project will only prove more vital as an element in personalized medicine. Still, it is a known fact that polymorphism plays a significant role in drug metabolism due to the inherited CYP activity of individuals.
