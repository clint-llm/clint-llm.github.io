Calcified coronary plaques pose numerous challenges to successful PCI, often prohibiting stent delivery or inhibiting completeÂ stent expansion.

Vascular calcification is a complex and dynamic process for which the pathophysiology is not completely understood. Previous theories have been based on calcium/phosphate imbalance, circulating nucleation complexes, apoptotic bodies, and bone formation, while more recent studies have proposed microRNAs may play a role as regulators of vascular smooth muscle cells.

Though the exact pathophysiology of CAC remains unknown, certain risk factors have been associated with more severe and advanced CAC. Coronary calcification can occur in both the tunica intima and tunica media, but calcification of the media is believed to be more associated with cardiovascular events.

The most common risk factors for CAC include smoking/tobacco use, obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, advanced age, chronic kidney disease, male gender, and Caucasian race.
