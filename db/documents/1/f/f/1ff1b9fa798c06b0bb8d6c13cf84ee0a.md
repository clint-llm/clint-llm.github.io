Necrotizing enterocolitis is a disease affecting neonates and is the most common life-threatening emergency affecting the gastrointestinal tract of infants in the neonatal intensive care unit. Necrotizing enterocolitis typically occurs in the second to third week of life. Several risk factors have been identified, but prematurity, low birth weight, and formula feeding have been identified as primary risks

While necrotizing enterocolitis primarily occurs in premature infants, it has been documented in full-term infants. In this population, onset is typically in the first few days of life and is usually associated with a hypoxic event, such as a cyanotic congenital heart defect.
