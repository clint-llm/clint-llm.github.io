Tracheoesophageal fistulas (TEFs) represent one of the most common congenital anomalies seen in major pediatric surgical centers. Infants with tracheoesophageal fistulas classically present with respiratory distress, feeding difficulties, choking, and risk of aspiration. Tracheoesophageal fistulas most commonly occur alongside other congenital anomalies, particularly cardiac defects. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of tracheoesophageal fistulas and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the typical presentation of an infant with a tracheoesophaageal fistula. 
- Explain the evaluation of an infant with a suspected treacheoesophageal fistula. 
- Summarize the management of tracheoesophageal fistulas. 
- Review the importance of improving coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by tracheoesophageal fistulas.
