The most common site is the left ventricle (approximately 57% of the cases), followed by right ventricle (27.5%), and interventricular septum (17%). There is a hypothesis that the tumor increases in size with physiological cardiac growth and stops growing when the growth of the heart completes, usually at 17 to 20 years of age. Hence, with somatic growth, the size of fibroma decreases relative to cardiac mass, but unlike rhabdomyoma, fibromas never resolve completely. Septal involvement and age less than 17 years old at the time of diagnosis are associated with a poor prognosis. It is probably because younger patients have a smaller heart and high tumor-to-heart ratio compared to older individuals, generating low cardiac output leading to poor outcomes.

In contrast to cardiac rhabdomyoma, cardiac fibroma rarely regress spontaneously and often present with arrhythmias (32%), mostly ventricular tachycardia (risk exceeding 50%), ventricular fibrillation, murmur (20%), and abnormal chest x-ray (20%).
