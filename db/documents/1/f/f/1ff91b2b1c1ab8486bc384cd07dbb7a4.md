Although the pathergy phenomenon is seen in various disease entities, pathergy testing is only indicated in establishing the diagnosis of BD. Once regarded as synonymous with BD, pathergy has decreased in prevalence over time and varies among different populations.

The ISG criteria, most recently revised in 2006, has been validated to enable multicenter collaborations and reports values of 97% specificity and 92% sensitivity for BD.

Based on this scoring system, a diagnosis of BD is established by a sum of three or more points. Therefore, a pathergy test is indicated when an individual suspected of having BD exhibits only one of the major criteria or two or fewer of the minor criteria. For example, if a patient has a history of recurrent oral aphthosis (greater than 3 episodes per year) and pseudofolliculitis, a positive pathergy test can confirm the diagnosis of BD. However, if a different patient presents with recurrent oral aphthosis, uveitis, and genital aphthosis, a diagnosis of BD can be made without recourse to the pathergy test.
