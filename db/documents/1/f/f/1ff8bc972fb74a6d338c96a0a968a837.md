Griseofulvin is an oral medication. It comes in microsize (250 and 500 mg tablets) and ultra micro-size (125 and 250 mg tablets) forms. Ultra micro-size tablets are absorbed better than microsize. Griseofulvin is poorly soluble in water. Griseofulvin is best taken with a high-fat meal to increase absorption from the GI tract.****
