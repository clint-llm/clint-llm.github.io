History and physical exams are pertinent in diagnosing BPPV correctly. The classic symptoms of BPPV often include sudden onset vertigo, worsened by head movements. These attacks can last for under one minute. However, patients have described them as lasting much longer due to associated nausea and disequilibrium.

When the clinician has diagnosed BPPV, the clinician has likely ruled out more dangerous etiologies of dizziness; it is crucial to communicate with the patient to assuage their fears because many patients present concerned about the more dire causes of dizziness, such as an intracranial mass or a stroke. Following a thorough history and physical exam, and the dizziness determined to be secondary to a peripheral cause, the Dix-Hallpike maneuver can be an option. If the etiology of the dizziness is unknown or if a central lesion is a consideration, other physical exam maneuvers such as the HiNTS exam should be employed to further aid in narrowing the differential diagnosis.
