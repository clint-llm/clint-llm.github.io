CPM is a concentrated, often symmetric, noninflammatory demyelination within the central basis pontis. Demyelination also occurs in extrapontine regions in at least 10% of patients, including the midbrain, thalamus, basal nuclei, and cerebellum. Histology showed demyelination with astrocytosis and infiltration by lymphocytes and macrophages.
