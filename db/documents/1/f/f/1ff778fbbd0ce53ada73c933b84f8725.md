Kissing bug bites and the subsequent development of Chagas disease is under-recognized and frequently go untreated. Chagas disease can be challenging to diagnose and chronic in nature leading to significant morbidity and mortality. This activity will review the epidemiology of Chagas disease and how kissing bugs spread the disease. It will highlight the classic symptoms of both acute and chronic Chagas disease, how it is diagnosed, and the benefits of an interprofessional team in managing complications and side effects of treatment.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize how Chagas disease is transmitted in various at-risk populations.
- Describe the characteristic features of acute and chronic Chagas disease.
- Outline laboratory testing to diagnose Chagas disease.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for identifying and managing complications of Chagas disease.
