Absolute contraindications for an RYHJ are the same for other surgical procedures: the inability to tolerate general anesthesia. An intrahepatic proximal bile flow obstruction is also a contraindication to a hepaticojejunostomy (HJ).

Relative contraindications include timing of operation in the early postoperative period and uncontrolled biliary sepsis.
