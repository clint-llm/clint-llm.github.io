# Introduction

The Bowditch effect is also known as the Treppe phenomenon, staircase phenomenon, or frequency-dependent activation. It refers to the idea that an increase in heart rate increases the force of contraction generated by the myocardial cells with each heartbeat despite accounting for all other influences. This concept of a frequency-based positive inotropic response of the heart was first explained in 1871 by the physiologist Henry Pickering Bowditch after he stimulated a resting frog’s ventricular apex.

# Issues of Concern

Loss of intrinsic inotropy from impaired Bowditch effect has implications in conditions like cardiomyopathy, ischemia, and heart failure, leading to systolic dysfunction. The Bowditch phenomenon is often absent or even reversed in some cases of observed failing hearts that may be due to the failing hearts’ inability to provide the required blood circulation for energy due to the impaired actin-myosin interaction process even during low-stress exercise leading to decreased contractile ability. This is described as a null or inverse staircase phenomenon.

# Cellular Level

The current thought is that with every depolarization, the influx of calcium ions from voltage-gated channels occur that lead to calcium release from SR. Relaxation of the cell occurs when calcium levels return to their original values mainly via uptake by the SR through SERCA. Calcium further extrudes from the cell via Na/Ca exchanger (NCX) and mitochondrial calcium uptake.

SR calcium uptake is enhanced during calcium transient in diastole due to SERCA function acceleration that contributes to ‘frequency-dependent acceleration of relaxation’- causing reuptake of more calcium back into the SR. The SR can lose some Ca during diastole, but increased heart rate can shorten diastolic interval, which limits the loss of SR calcium, accumulating more calcium for the next contraction.

# Organ Systems Involved

The Bowditch effect has mainly been studied in the myocardium and is considered “a major contributor to the intrinsic myocardial reserve and responsible for 40% of the increase in cardiac output” secondary to the frequency-strength relationship.

A similar staircase response also has implications in skeletal muscle, attributed to a progressive increase in muscle tension during an early phase of repetitive tension by increasing calcium concentrations in the myocyte's’ sarcoplasm. However, augmented sensitivity of myofilaments to calcium by myosin light chain phosphorylation leads to further enhanced phosphorylation, which happens when the calcium released from SR binds to calmodulin, activating the myosin light chain kinase. With each subsequent stimulation of skeletal muscle fiber, phosphorylation of the myosin light chain persists as the phosphatase activity is slower than the kinase.

# Mechanism

The exact mechanism involved in the Bowditch effect is not entirely understood to date, but altered calcium movement is the most likely explanation.

# Pathophysiology

Bowditch effect is essential to understanding the dynamics of a failing heart. A healthy heart can induce a positive Bowditch effect due to its alterations in sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum Ca load, whereas a negative Bowditch effect is pathological. This negative Bowditch effect occurs from a diminished expression of the SERCA protein and is a characteristic ‘hallmark of heart failure’ in humans.

Testing with muscles from hearts with dilated cardiomyopathy exhibited reduced tension in the cardiac muscle, attributed to up to 45% less myofibrillar protein and reduced activation of the contractile proteins in myocyte in a failing heart. Other mechanisms proposed in changes to the tension-frequency relations can be due to the reduced number of SERCA pumps, decreased cAMP production, intracellular acidosis, or metabolic buildup secondary to the increased diffusion distances in hypertrophied myocytes.

# Clinical Significance

For years, the Bowditch phenomenon concept - increasing heart rate to enhance inotropy - was exploited to devise a therapeutic modality for the failing heart. However, research with various animal models made it apparent that the failing hearts do no exhibit the same phenomenon. This exploration has eventually led to the paradigm shift to current therapeutic knowledge of the role of long-term use of beta-blockers in improved cardiac function.
