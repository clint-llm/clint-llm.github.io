Clubbing of the nails is soft tissue swelling of the terminal phalanx resulting in flattening of the angle that exists between the nail bed and the nail. Clubbing typically occurs in combination with other dermatologic and skeletal findings but can also less commonly occur in isolation. Although clubbing can present in many pathologic conditions, it can be idiopathic or familial. This activity reviews how to properly evaluate nail clubbing, when patients with nail clubbing should receive additional evaluations and the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with nail clubbing.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the causes of nail clubbing.
- Explain when a patient with nail clubbing should undergo additional evaluations. 
- Review additional evaluations that should be done in select patients with nail clubbing. 
- Summarize the role of collaboration amongst interprofessional team members to improve care coordination and minimize oversight, leading to earlier diagnosis and treatment and better outcomes for patients with cardiac, pulmonary, infectious, neoplastic, inflammatory, and vascular diseases that may manifest with nail clubbing.
