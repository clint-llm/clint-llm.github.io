Mammography is the standard imaging modality for the evaluation of breast calcifications. Digital breast tomosynthesis, full-field digital mammography, and screen-film mammography are the available types. The standard and basic components of a screen film or digital mammography include cranial-caudal (CC) and medial-lateral-oblique (MLO) projections of both breasts. For tomosynthesis, the basic views are synthesized 2D CC and MLO views, as well as the tomosynthesis CC and MLO views.

Often typically benign calcifications are easily identified as benign on the standard views of screen film or digital mammography and tomosynthesis. This is because many benign calcifications are considered macrocalcifications and are larger than 2 mm.
