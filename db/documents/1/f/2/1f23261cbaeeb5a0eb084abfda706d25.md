The life span of patients with cerebral palsy depends on the severity of disability as well as complications. Those who are more severely disabled will usually have reduced life expectancy versus those who are less severely disabled.

For dyskinetic CP, there often is more severe motor impairment than other forms of CP. Patients with DCP often score higher on the gross motor function classification system (GMFCS) and manual ability classification system (MACS). There is a correlation between the amount of dystonia with disability level, more so than choreoathetosis.
