Intramuscular injection (IM) is installing medications into the depth of specifically selected muscles. The bulky muscles have good vascularity, and therefore the injected drug quickly reaches the systemic circulation and thereafter into the specific region of action, bypassing the first-pass metabolism. It is one of the most common medical procedures to be performed annually. This activity outlines and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients who undergo an intramuscular injection. This activity also summarizes the anatomic landmarks, safety precautionary checklists, the recommended procedural steps, and the complications to be aware of following the procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the safe anatomical landmarks for intramuscular injection.
- Describe the technique of intramuscular injections.
- Summarize the potential complications of intramuscular injection.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance intramuscular injection and improve outcomes.
