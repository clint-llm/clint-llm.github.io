Present consensus holds that pathogenesis of most endometrial endometrioid carcinomas begins with uninterrupted endometrial proliferation, hormonally stimulated by endogenous or exogenous estrogen unopposed by progesterone or progestins, progressing through states of simple to complex forms of endometrial hyperplasia (EH). Arising in this milieu, histologically recognizable atypical premalignant lesions, defined as endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN), may transform to endometrioid carcinoma, characterized by stromal and/or myometrial invasion, PTEN mutations, and often KRAS2 mutations, microsatellite instability caused by mismatch repair (MMR) defects, and near-diploid karyotype. Given the hormonal etiology, EIN and endometrial endometrioid carcinomas usually express estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR).

Most endometrial endometrioid carcinomas are lower grade cancers.

**Classification**

**International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 3-Grade Assessment of the Glandular Component**

Grade 1: Less than or equal to 5% solid non-squamous growth pattern

Grade 2: Six percent to 50% solid non-squamous growth pattern

Grade 3: Greater than 50% solid non-squamous growth pattern, upgrading by 1 grade when there is notable nuclear atypia

**Recent Binary System**

This system classifies endometrioid carcinomas with less than 50% solid component and absence of marked nuclear atypia as low-grade, and those with greater than 50% solid component and/or marked nuclear atypia are graded as high-grade carcinomas with either endometrioid, serous, clear cell or undifferentiated histology.

Type 1, low-grade endometrial endometrioid carcinomas with less than 50% myometrium invasion have favorable prognosis approaching 100% 5-year survival rates.****Low-grade endometrioid carcinomas with more than 50% myometrium invasion and high-grade endometrial cancer have much poorer prognoses with higher proportions of lymph node metastases and post-treatment recurrences.****Using binary grading, endometrioid carcinomas classified as high grade on the basis of 2 or more architectural features, which included greater than 50% solid growth pattern without distinction between squamous or non-squamous differentiation, diffuse infiltrative growth and/or tumor necrosis, were associated with only 46% 5-year survival rates compared to 93% 5-year survival rates in patients with low grade endometrioid carcinomas.****Aggressively malignant high-grade endometrioid carcinomas with such poor prognosis are more akin to type 2, high-grade non-endometrioid histotypes than they are to low-grade endometrioid carcinomas.

The most prevalent non-endometrioid, type 2 endometrial cancers are high-grade, serous, undifferentiated, and clear cell carcinomas. High-grade serous and clear cell carcinomas overall have been associated with significantly poorer 5-year survival rates than high-grade endometrioid carcinomas.TP53 with loss of heterozygosity, identified by DNA sequencing and/or aberrant immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of p53, are present in some 90% or more of endometrial serous carcinomas (ESC).

In contrast to low-grade endometrioid carcinomas, ESC typically arises in atrophic, resting, or weakly proliferative endometrium. In postmenopausal women on exogenous hormone replacement therapy, ESC may be diagnosed in a background of the proliferative endometrium and rarely even in the hyperplastic endometrium. Identical TP53 mutations have been found in foci of benign-appearing endometrium (“p53 signatures”), endometrial glandular dysplasia (EmGD) and associated serous endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma (EIC) and invasive ESC, giving credence to a concept of endometrial serous carcinogenesis with accumulation of TP53 mutations recognized first as p53 signatures, progressing to EmGD, to EIC, and ultimately to ESC.****Although the initiating event in carcinogenesis from precursor lesions to EIC and invasive ESC has not been identified, an inordinately high proportion of ESC relative to endometrial endometrioid carcinomas has been found in hereditary carriers ofBRCA1 mutations, and inordinately high proportions of BRCA1 mutation carriers have been reported in series of women diagnosed with ESC.

Even small ESC tumors are prone to lymphatic infiltration and transtubal dissemination.****HER/neu and p16, can be seen in advanced cases of ESC, and p16 protein overexpression (92% to 100% IHC positive) in ESC and mixed ESC-endometrioid carcinomas and high-grade endometrioid carcinoma (25% IHC positive) may help differentiate these cancers, especially when they are associated with low-grade endometrioid carcinoma (7% IHC positive).

The final mutational profile of high-grade endometrial clear cell carcinoma determined by IHC staining for p53 as a surrogate for TP53 mutations is somewhat different than either high-grade endometrioid carcinoma or ESC.TP53 missense mutations, and complete absence of p53 staining correlates with frameshift mutations in TP53.****While p53 staining is consistentlyaberrant in most or all ESC (93% to 100%), p53 is normal in the majority of high-grade endometrioid and clear cell endometrial carcinomas.PTEN mutations, which characterize endometrioid carcinomas.TP53 mutations, compared to those with wild-type p53 staining, the group of patients who had clear cell carcinomas with aberrant p53 staining trended to worse overall survival (p = 0.07) and had significantly shorter progression-free survival (p = 0.01) than the group with wild-type staining on univariate analysis, but not on multivariate analysis when tumor stage, mitotic index, architectural pattern, necrosis, and patients’ age were considered.****Other researchers have confirmed that worsened patient outcomes and advanced stage were associated with p53 overexpression in endometrial clear cell carcinomas.

The molecular etiologies of high-grade endometrioid and clear cell endometrial carcinomas lack the definition so far achieved by research on the pathogenesis of endometrial low-grade endometrioid carcinomas and ESC. Alhough the molecular pathways leading from initial mutational events in early neoplastic endometrial lesions to high-grade endometrioid carcinomas or clear cell carcinomas may be quite different from each other and different from ESC, cascading mutations during carcinogenesis of some eventually high grade endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas may result in the progressive accumulation of TP53 mutations and p53 overexpression in more advanced aggressive cancers demonstrating malignant behaviors similar to ESC.

A brief review of adnexal high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) with near ubiquitous TP53 mutations can provide insight into another possible etiology of endometrial high-grade endometrioid carcinomas. Arising in the fallopian tube, the evolution of adnexal HGSC from serous tubal in situ carcinoma (STIC) associated with p53 signatures in tubal endothelium has been established by evidence through molecular, transitional, and epidemiological research. From this, the developmental similarities between adnexal HGSC and ESC are evident for their mutual associations with p53 signatures in morphologically normal epithelium through the apparently in situ phases of STIC transitioning to HGSC and, likewise serous EIN transitioning to ESC with the potential intra-abdominal dissemination of very small, early cancerous lesions. High-grade adnexal carcinomas with aberrant p53 but non-papillary serous, endometrioid and transitional cell (SET) morphology and aggressive behavior are now classified as HGSC-SET carcinomas. In contrast to IHC demonstrating aberrant p53 staining in greater than or equal to 50% of high-grade, non-endometrioid adnexal tumors with associated poor prognosis, a study found that none of the adnexal tumors ultimately classified as endometrioid carcinomas showed aberrant p53 staining, and these patients had no recurrences and better survival.

It is controversial and far from settled whether or not hereditary germline mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 convey increased risks for ESC such as the known susceptibility of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers to adnexal HGSC with nearly ubiquitous TP53 mutations.BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations than to classical HGSC, which were associated with inactivation by BRCA1 promoter methylation or somatic BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.  And high-grade, adnexal carcinomas with germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations tended to more frequently have SET morphology than HGSC. HGSC were not associated with any BRCA1 or BRCA2 dysfunction.BRCA dysfunction.
