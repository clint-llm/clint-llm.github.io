The prognosis depends on the following factors:

Histology: in general seminomas have a better prognosis than non-seminomas

Localization of lesions. Those localized to the scrotum or retroperitoneum tend to have a better prognosis than the intracranial or mediastinal lesions

The higher the initial levels of B HCG and AFP the worse the prognosis.

Following chemotherapy, the survival of mediastinal seminomas is far better than non-seminomas. Overall, germ cell tumors of the mediastinum tend to be resistant to chemotherapy, can compromise respiratory function and a few patients may develop a hematological malignancy. Patients with mediastinal seminomas and metastatic disease have the worst survival.
