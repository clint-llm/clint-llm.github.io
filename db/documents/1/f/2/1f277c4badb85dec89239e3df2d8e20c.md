Oral lichen planus is a known T-cell mediated chronic inflammatory response affecting the oral mucosa. Evidence suggests that other factors such as trauma, dental plaque, and stress may play a role in exacerbating OLP symptoms.

Studies have also demonstrated that in certain geographic locations such as Japan, the Mediterranean region, and the United States metropolitan population, there is a strong association between Hepatitis C virus infection and OLP.
