Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a condition in which an increase in left ventricular mass occurs secondary to an increase in wall thickness, an increase in left ventricular cavity enlargement, or both. This activity reviews the normal limits of left ventricle mass and the criterion defined by the American Society of Echocardiography in establishing the diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of left ventricular hypertrophy and its complications.
- Outline the appropriate history, physical findings, and evaluation of left ventricular hypertrophy.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for left ventricular hypertrophy.
- Review the differential diagnosis and toxicokinetics of left ventricular hypertrophy and the pertinent ongoing trials.
