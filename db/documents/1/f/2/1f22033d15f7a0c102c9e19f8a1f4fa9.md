Angiotensin II causes direct vasoconstriction of precapillary arterioles and postcapillary venules, inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine, stimulates the release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla, reduces urinary excretion of sodium and water, stimulates synthesis and release of aldosterone, and stimulates hypertrophy of both vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac myocytes.

The exact mechanism of ACE inhibitors is not fully known. They interfere with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, but their effect is not directly related to renin levels in the blood. As the name implies, ACE inhibitors block an angiotensin-converting enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Decreased production of angiotensin II enhances natriuresis, lowers blood pressure, and prevents remodeling of smooth muscle and cardiac myocytes. Lowered arterial and venous pressure reduces preload and afterload.  Also, the hypothesis is that ACE inhibitors interfere with the degradation of bradykinin, a peptide that causes vasodilation.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme regulates the balance between the vasodilatory and natriuretic properties of bradykinin and the vasoconstrictive and salt-retentive properties of Angiotensin II. ACE inhibitors alter this balance by decreasing the formation of Angiotensin II and the degradation of bradykinin. ACE inhibitors also alter the formation and degradation of several other vasoactive substances, such as substance P, but the contribution of these compounds to the therapeutic or adverse effects of ACE inhibitors is uncertain.
