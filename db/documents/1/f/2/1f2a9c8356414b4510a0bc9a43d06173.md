Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine antagonist. The primary FDA-approved clinical uses for flumazenil include reversal agents for benzodiazepine overdose and postoperative sedation from benzodiazepine anesthetics. Flumazenil injection is indicated for a complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines in conscious sedation and general anesthesia in adult and pediatric populations. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, dosing, significant adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of flumazenil so that providers can direct patient therapy to optimal outcomes in benzodiazepine reversal.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of flumazenil.
- Outline the indications for using flumazenil.
- Summarize the adverse events associated with flumazenil administration.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance flumazenil therapy and improve outcomes.
