Sliding hip screw fixation constructs are contraindicated in the following (unstable) fracture patterns:

- Reverse obliquity

- Transtrochanteric

- Comminuted fracture patterns with a large posteromedial fragment; imply a loss of the medial calcar buttress

- Fracture patterns with subtrochanteric extension
