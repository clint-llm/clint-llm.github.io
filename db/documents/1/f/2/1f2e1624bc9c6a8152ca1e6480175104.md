Juvenile polyposis (JPS) is an autosomal dominant inherited condition that presents with hamartomatous polyps of the small intestine due to mutations in the BMPR1A, SMAD4, or ENG genes; however, dermatological findings of PJS are not appreciated.

Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, Bannayan-Riley Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS), and Cowden Syndrome belong to a family of hamartomatous polyposis syndromes. Therefore, they share similar clinical features, such as gastrointestinal polyposis, but they differ in genetic loci mutation. BRRS and Cowden syndromes belong to the PTEN1 gene mutations, with pigmented lesions most commonly on the glans penis. Bannayan-Riley Ruvalcaba patients present with macrocephaly, developmental delay, lipomas, and vascular abnormalities, and Cowden syndrome patients present with trichilemmomas, facial papules/oral papillomas, and acral keratoses.

Pigmented intraoral mucocutaneous macules can be found in Laugier-Hunziker syndrome (LHS) but appear later in life after childhood. Additional dermatological findings of longitudinal hyperpigmented bands (melanonychia) on the toes and fingernails are also present. Laugier-Hunziker syndrome is not associated with gastrointestinal polyposis.
