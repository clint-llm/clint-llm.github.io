The most clinically relevant nuclei all fall into the lateral nuclear group. These include the ventral posterolateral, ventral posteromedial, lateral geniculate, medial geniculate, and ventral lateral nuclei. The ventral posterolateral nucleus gets fed by the spinothalamic tracts and dorsal columns of the spinal cord. As a result, this nucleus handles sensations of temperature and pain, along with vibration, pressure, fine touch, and proprioception. Signals then proceed to the primary somatosensory cortex within the postcentral gyrus.

The reticular nucleus receives inputs from the other thalamic nuclei, but also the reticular activating system and basal forebrain. As a result, the thalamus plays a role in controlling alertness and attention.

The central medial nucleus, one of the intralaminar nuclei, is another clinically relevant thalamic nucleus. It receives inputs from the globus pallidus internus, deep cerebellar nucleus, and reticular activating system and primarily sends that information to the cerebral cortex and striatum. The central medial nucleus is located deep within the brain and handles alertness, motor information, consciousness, and awareness.
