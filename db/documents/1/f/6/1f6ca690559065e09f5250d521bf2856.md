**General**

Treatment of the underlying cause is necessary for the management of exophthalmos to maintain ocular function. In the case of thyroid-associated orbitopathy and other secondary causes, effective management requires an interprofessional approach between eye specialists, primary care clinicians and, endocrinologists.

**Lifestyle Modifications**

Smoking cessation is paramount in the prevention and progression of thyroid eye disease.

**Conservative Management**

Supportive therapies will provide appropriate symptomatic relief for patients while treatment of the underlying cause commences. Topical preservative-free ocular lubricants and taping eyelids should be administered to patients with dry eyes.

**Medical Management**

Moderate-to-severe thyroid orbitopathy is treated with oral and intravenous corticosteroids.

**Surgical Management**

Surgery is indicated to remove the offending tissue, tumor, or malignant disease where appropriate.

Orbital decompression and extraocular muscle repair have served to protect vision in severe cases of exophthalmos for decades, particularly when patients fail to respond to medical therapy.
