Before treating mandibular body fracture, a thorough evaluation and monitoring of the patients' general physical conditions are necessary. The force that has caused mandibular body fractures may also injure other organ systems. There may occur concurrent posttraumatic thrombotic occlusion of the internal carotid artery or basilar skull fracture, bilateral cervical subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and spleen lacerations after trauma. Therefore, patients should not be treated by surgical reduction of mandibular body fractures unless these issues are addressed.
