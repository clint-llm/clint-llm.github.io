Local anesthetics are primarily used to reversibly block action potentials that create impulse conduction along neural axons carrying sensory or motor signals. This occurs by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels.

To block impulse conduction, there is a minimum local anesthetic concentration necessary specific to each nerve fiber according to its size and myelination. Unmyelinated fibers that control pain require lower concentrations of LA than myelinated fibers controlling muscle contraction. Therefore, lower concentrations of LA can be used for analgesia, especially in children less than 18 months of age who have not yet completed myelination of their central nervous systems. Local anesthetics given by continuous infusion have a longer duration of action than those given as a single administration.

The actions of LAs are affected by the pH, the concentration of calcium, and the stimulation of the nerve. Increased dose, concentration, and volume of an LA can prolong block duration by as much as 50%.
