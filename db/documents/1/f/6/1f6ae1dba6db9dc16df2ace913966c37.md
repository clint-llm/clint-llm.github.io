Etiology for HTR varies based on the onset of rejection.

- Early graft dysfunction can be primary or secondary

Primary graft dysfunction (PGD): Universally accepted standard definition for PGD is lacking. Presence of ventricular dysfunction causing cardiogenic shock and requiring circulatory support such as inotropes/mechanical support devices in the absence of recipient alloimmune response or other discernible causes is endorsed as PGD. Various factors implicated in the development of PGD are:

- Pre-existing donor heart disease

- Re-perfusion injury immediately post-transplant

- Allograft injury occurring during organ retrieval, conservation and implantation.

Secondary graft dysfunction (SGD): SGD results from identifiable causes such as:

- Hyperacute graft rejection

- Increased pressure or volume load on the right ventricle

- Undiagnosed recipient pulmonary hypertension

- Late graft dysfunction includes

Acute allograft rejection which, can be cellular or antibody (humoral) mediated. Risk factors include younger patients, female donors or recipient, and increased HLA mismatches.

Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV). Risk factors include elevated cholesterol level, cytomegalovirus infection, insulin resistance, coronary heart disease in the donor, younger recipient, and history of acute rejection.

Other causes of allograft failure include recurrence of myocardial conditions such as amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, giant cell myocarditis, hereditary hemochromatosis and malignancy such as primary cardiac lymphoma.
