Multiple sclerosis is a complex disease process. In addition toÂ sensory and visual changes, weakness, coordination problems, or spasticity can present. Other complaints relating to overall health include bladder and bowel dysfunction, depression, cognitive impairment, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, sleep disturbances, and vertigo. Because of reduced life expectancy and multisystem involvement, the disorder is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a neurologist, pain specialist, physical and/or occupational therapist, nurse specialist, ophthalmologist, mental health nurse, gastroenterologist, and a urologist.
