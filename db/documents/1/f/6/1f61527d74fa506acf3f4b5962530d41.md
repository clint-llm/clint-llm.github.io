Interprofessional teamwork is essential in preventing DVT in hospitalized patients. Good interprofessional communication among attending clinicians, surgeons (for surgical patients), nursing staff, and pharmacists is vital in using the appropriate prophylaxis methods. All hospitals should have a formal strategy that increases compliance with DVT prophylaxis.

Nursing is on the "front lines" and is especially important in DVT prophylaxis, as they can spot patients who might be at risk but not receiving prophylaxis and alert the attending clinician. Pharmacists are valuable in consulting regarding appropriate agent selection and dosing based on various factors, including patient parameters and other medications. Open communication among clinicians, nursing, and pharmacy is vital in preventing DVT and successfully managing the condition should prophylaxis fail. The interprofessional approach to care, where all team members are empowered to provide input on the case, is the optimal paradigm in DVT prophylaxis. [Level 5]
