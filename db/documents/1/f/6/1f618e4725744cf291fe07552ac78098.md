There is a significant overlap between the risk factors accounting for cardiovascular events and cerebrovascular events. The INTERHEART study looked at nearly 30,000 patients divided into control and interventional groups to identify these risk factors. Stroke prevention follows a similar principle of controlling these risk factors.
