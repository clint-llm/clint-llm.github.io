Ranolazine was FDA-approved in 2006 for the treatment of chronic stable angina.

Chronic stable angina affects an estimated >7 million people in America and is one of the major causes of significant morbidity in these patients. Stable angina is treated to reduce the symptoms and occurrence of ischemia and to prevent myocardial infarction and mortality.

Off-label uses include the treatment of some arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia. However, there is little data to support this use.
