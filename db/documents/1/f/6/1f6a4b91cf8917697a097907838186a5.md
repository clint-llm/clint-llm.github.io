An interprofessional approach is paramount in providing care for patients with ALM. Primary care providers play an important role in patient education and the detection of early changing skin lesions. Once detected, dermatologists are often consulted to confirm the suspicious nature of the lesion and perform the initial biopsies.  Evaluation of the lesional biopsy by a trained dermatopathologist is also necessary as the diagnosis is difficult and requires significant clinicopathologic correlation. Treatment may involve multiple specialties include Mohs surgeons, general surgeons, or orthopedic surgeons for definitive excision of the lesion. If metastases are expected, surgical oncology and hematology/oncology should be consulted to facilitate sentinel lymph node biopsy and consider systemic therapies as warranted.
