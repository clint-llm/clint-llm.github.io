Drug overdose with zolpidem involves CNS depression, cognitive impairments leading to somnolence or coma, cardiovascular and respiratory depression, and other fatalities. The acute toxicity of zolpidem is less in severity than other short-acting benzodiazepines like triazolam and midazolam. However, in combined intoxication with other CNS depressant drugs, zolpidem can induce coma in patients even with a low concentration. Single-drug poisoning is benign and should not require therapeutic intervention.

If a patient shows any symptoms, gastric lavage should only be attempted within one hour of ingestion; benefits outweigh risks, and if the patient is conscious with a gag reflex or intubated. Patients can also benefit from administration with flumazenil and intravenous fluids as well. Flumazenil is a known reversal agent to benzodiazepine toxicity; however, it can contribute to the exacerbations of other neurological symptoms such as convulsive activity. In the event of drug toxicity, the patient's respiratory function, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, pulse, and other vitals should be monitored.
