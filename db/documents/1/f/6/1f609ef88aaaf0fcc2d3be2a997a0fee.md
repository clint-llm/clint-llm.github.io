Desmoids may occasionally be encountered by the nurse practitioner, primary care provider or the internist. Because the diagnosis and treatment is complex, it is important to consult with an oncologist, pathologist, and a radiologist. The treatment of desmoid can be divided broadly into asymptomatic resectable, symptomatic resectable, unresectable, and recurrent desmoids. These lesions do not normally respond well to chemotherapy and radiation and surgery is the only treatment. However, recurrences are common. The prognosis for most patients is guarded.
