Ocular hypertension (OHT) can occur after steroid use in susceptible individuals. Steroid-induced glaucoma (SIG), a form of secondary glaucoma, can occur when elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) gives rise to irreversible optic neuropathy. The term "steroid responder" (SR) is used to indicate individuals that show elevated IOP after steroid use, which has been defined in current literature as IOP above 21 mmHg to 24 mmHg and/or an increase of greater than 5 to 10 mmHg compared to baseline with clinical significance.

IOP elevations are seen most commonly after topical, periocular, or intraocular administration in steroid responders. OHT can also occur after intranasal, inhalational, systemic use, and dermatological applications.
