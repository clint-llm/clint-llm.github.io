Cardiac tumors are uncommon and can be primary or metastatic. Primary cardiac tumors are rare, and the incidence is from 0.001 to 0.3% by autopsy. They can be classified into three clinicopathological groups: 1. benign congenital tumors; 2. benign acquired tumors; and 3. malignant tumors. Nearly 90% of primary cardiac tumors are benign. This activity reviews the etiology, pathophysiology, presentation, and treatment options of cardiac tumors and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the different types of cardiac tumors and their etiologies.
- Discuss the histopathology of the different types of cardiac tumors.
- Summarize the evaluation process and diagnostic testing for the assessment of cardiac tumors.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve patient outcomes affected by cardiac tumors.
