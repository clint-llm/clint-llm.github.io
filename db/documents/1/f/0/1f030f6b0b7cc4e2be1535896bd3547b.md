Theories about autism etiology have evolved. The initial concept of “refrigerator mothers,” a theory attributing ASD to cold and unemotional mothers, is now considered obsolete. Also, factors such as family lifestyle and income and educational level are no longer considered risk factors in ASD onset.

**Genetic Factors**

Among factors associated with ASD pathogenesis, the genetic contribution is widely accepted.

**Environmental Factors**

The role of many potential environmental factors related to ASD etiology is an area of active ongoing researches. Identification of modifiable risk factors associated with ASD is essential, particularly for reducing exposure of children and pregnant women to known neurotoxicants. Environmental factors may act as an independent risk factor or may affect existing genetic factors in individuals with a genetic predisposition, and include parental age, perinatal and obstetric events, maternal factors, fetal environment, and exposure to toxins and teratogens.

It is important to note that, based on the systematic reviews of multiple large epidemiologic studies, there is no evidence to support an association between ASD and immunization as an environmental risk factor; thus, children with ASD should be vaccinated according to the routine recommended schedule.
