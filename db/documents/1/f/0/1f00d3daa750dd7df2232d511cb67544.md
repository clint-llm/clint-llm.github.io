- Tracheomalacia is a condition that is characterized by excessive collapsibility of the trachea.

- Depending on the cause of tracheomalacia, patients’ symptoms may spontaneously resolve over the natural history of the disease; however, those with co-existing pathologies may experience persistent respiratory distress.

- Bronchoscopy is the gold standard investigation for tracheomalacia.

- Subglottic airway pathology should be considered in children presenting with recurrent episodes of croup or atypical wheeze.

- Most mild cases can be managed conservatively, with surgery reserved for those with severe disease.

- Segmental (proximal) disease treatment is optimal with a tracheostomy. The distal and diffuse disease may benefit from aortopexy, while the short segmental disease may be amenable to tracheal resection and end-to-end anastomosis in experienced centers.
