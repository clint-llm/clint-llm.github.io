Urine studies may show an increased fractional excretion of uric acid, a urinary glucose level that is not explained by plasma concentration or pre-existing renal condition, and high levels of urinary beta2-microglobulin and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase. A blood test may show hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and hyperchloremic (non-anion-gap) metabolic acidosis. Higher levels of 24-hour urine excretion of amino acid, phosphate, bicarbonate, and glucose can point toward the diagnosis. Some fancy tests for diagnosis include measuring urinary retinol binding protein 4 and urinary lactate to creatinine ratio might help in diagnosis. Measuring enzyme levels can help in ruling out specific disorder like cystinosis and checking drug levels or heavy metal levels in blood or urine can help in finding the acquired cause of Fanconi syndrome.
