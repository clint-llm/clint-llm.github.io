Complications from IIC patterns stem from either overtreatment of interictal abnormalities or, less commonly, undertreatment of electrographic seizures. Overtreatment of interictal patterns may result in sedation, worsening encephalopathy, and adverse side effects directly related to antiseizure medications, including, but not limited to, respiratory suppression, hypersensitivity reactions, and tachyphylaxis. Aggressive treatment of these patterns may inadvertently result in a need for intubation and mechanical ventilation, which carry risks in and of themselves for ventilator-associated pneumonia, barotrauma, volutrauma, and hemodynamic collapse.  In contrast, undertreatment of IIC patterns may potentially increase the risk of neuronal injury from ongoing metabolic crisis or tissue hypoxia, augment resistance to pharmacotherapeutic interventions, and facilitate progression to unequivocal secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures, which confer high morbidity and mortality. Notably, several studies have shown good long-term functional and cognitive outcomes in patients who have experienced non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). Data suggests that NCSE does not lead to permanent damage unless an underlying medical issue exacerbates it.
