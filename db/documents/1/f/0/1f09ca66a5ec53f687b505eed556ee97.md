Prognosis of BCTs depends upon a variety of factors, including intrabronchial obstruction, ability to metastasize, and overall production of vasoactive amines. The 10-year survival rate of typical carcinoid tumors of the lung is as high as 87-97% in some studies. In contrast, atypical carcinoid tumors of the lung carry a poorer prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of 56% and a 10-year survival rate of 35%.

Important to note in prognosis is that those who underwent resection of typical carcinoid tumors have a much higher 10-year survival rate. Those who underwent surgical complete surgical resection have a significantly better prognosis. Recurrence is less common with typical carcinoids and is more likely with atypical carcinoid tumors contributing to the poorer prognosis, as mentioned previously above.
