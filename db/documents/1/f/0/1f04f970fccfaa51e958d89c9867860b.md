Shockwave intravascular lithotripsy is a novel device that modifies calcified lesions via calcium fracture to allow for effective stent deployment. This activity describes the procedure and reviews the role of the healthcare team in treating patients who undergo this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of coronary artery calcification.
- Identify the indications for shockwave intravascular lithotripsy.
- Review the technique for shockwave intravascular lithotripsy.
- Summarize the risks associated with shockwave intravascular lithotripsy.
