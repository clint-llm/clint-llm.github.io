The DTaP vaccine series is recommended to help protect against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis in infants and young children. Individuals susceptible to these vaccine-preventable diseases can develop life-threatening complications and even death. Since the development of universal vaccines in the 1940s, the number of reported cases of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis has declined in the United States.

Tetanus is an infectious disease caused by neurotoxins produced by the gram-positive bacillus, Clostridium tetani. The heat-resistant spores of the bacteria enter the body at mucous membranes or a breach in the skin. Toxins are formed, including a highly potent toxin called tetanospasmin. This toxin interferes with the release of neurotransmitters in the central nervous system leading to unopposed muscle contraction and spasms. There is no person-to-person transmission of C. tetani.

Moreover, diphtheria results from infection with toxin-producing strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae, a gram-positive bacillus. The disease is transmissible from person to person by droplets or close contact. The bacteria can multiply and produce the diphtheria toxin in the nasopharynx region, mucous membranes, or skin lesions. Early symptoms can include malaise, sore throat, and low-grade fever. A classic feature of respiratory diphtheria is a gray-colored pseudo-membrane that firmly adheres to the mucosal lining of the nasopharynx, tonsils, or larynx. This pseudo-membrane can extend further into the nasal cavity or larynx, obstructing the airways. Cardiac and neurological complications can occur once the toxin reaches the bloodstream. Respiratory droplets or close contact can transmit diphtheria.

Pertussis is a respiratory disease, also known colloquially as whooping cough, caused by the gram-negative bacillus, Bordetella pertussis. The disease characteristically has three stages: catarrhal, paroxysmal, and convalescent. The catarrhal stage includes symptoms of coryza, mild cough, and low-grade fever. Around one to two weeks, the infected person enters the paroxysmal stage with symptoms of spasmodic coughing, posttussive vomiting, and inspiratory whoop. Symptoms slowly improve in the convalescent stage but can last for weeks to months.Â B. pertussis is transmittable through aerosolized droplets generated by coughing or sneezing. People are most infectious at the catarrhal stage or the beginning of the paroxysmal stage.
