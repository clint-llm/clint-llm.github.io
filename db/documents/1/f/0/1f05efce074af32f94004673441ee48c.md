**History**: The history is non-specific, the patient will usually present with acute flu-like symptoms such as high fevers, headache, and vomiting. Depending on how severe the patient will have symptoms of hypotensive shock-like SOB, confusion, diaphoresis, and palpitations. If the patient has traveled to an endemic area, works in an occupation like farming or park ranger, has slept in a place infested with rodents, or was bitten by a rodent, then you can speculate you might be dealing with HFRS.

**Physical examination:**It varies depending on which stage of the disease the patient is in when coming to you. The disease has five stages: during the febrile and hypotensive stage, which tend to overlap, the patient can have signs of shock and hemorrhage such as petechiae or conjunctival hemorrhage. During the oliguric stage, there will be a decreased urine output and might have costovertebral angle tenderness (CVAT). In the polyuric stage, the patient’s appearance should be improving and have an increase in urine output.
