Fluoroquinolones have been associated with tendinopathy/tendon rupture. Ciprofloxacin is the most commonly reported fluoroquinolone associated with tendinopathy. Other risk factors are age older than 60 years, corticosteroid therapy, renal failure, diabetes mellitus, history of tendon rupture. It is noted that there is a 46-fold increase in the incidence of tendon rupture with fluoroquinolone use and concurrent corticosteroid exposure. Certain anesthetics have been found to cause injury to tenocytes. Bupivacaine has been found to be most toxic to tenocytes and fibroblasts when compared to ropivacaine. When ropivacaine and lidocaine were compared, lidocaine was found to be significantly toxic to tenocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Ropivacaine was not found to be toxic to tenocytes when used alone. This should be considered when doing interventional tendon procedures.
