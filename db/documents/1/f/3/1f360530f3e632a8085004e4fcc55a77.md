Simethicone is a silicone compound that functions as a non-systemic surfactant, decreasing the surface tension of gas bubbles in the GI tract. This action results in coalescence and dispersion of the gas bubbles allowing their removal from the GI tract as flatulence or belching. Simethicone causes the gas bubbles to accumulate and therefore pass more easily either through the upper GI or lower GI opening. Simethicone does not appear to reduce the actual production of gas in the GI tract.

Simethicone does not inhibit conditions such as lactose intolerance or medication side effects that increase the production of gas bubbles in the gastrointestinal tract.
