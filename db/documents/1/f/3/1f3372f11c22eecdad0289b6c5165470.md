A multidisciplinary team approach is essential for both prevention and timely recognition of POVL. From a surgeonâ€™s perspective, headrests that do not allow adequate assessment of the eyes during the procedure should be avoided, as well as Wilson frames for prone spine surgery if not contraindicated for surgical approach. The head should be positioned in the neutral position at or above the level of the heart.

If an operation in the prone position is anticipated, a staged approach should be considered. Operating room staff and anesthesia should be directly involved and encouraged to voice concerns regarding patient positioning. Anesthesia staff should be encouraged to perform periodic ocular checks throughout the operation. Post-operatively, vision should be examined as soon as the patient has awoken from anesthesia for early detection of POVL.
