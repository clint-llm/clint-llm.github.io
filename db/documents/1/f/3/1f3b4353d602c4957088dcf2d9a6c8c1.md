Cyclodiode laser has traditionally been reserved for patients who have failed previous drainage surgery or suffer from refractory glaucomatous conditions, including neovascular, traumatic, aphakic, silicone-oil induced, inflammatory, and congenital/developmental glaucoma. Furthermore, blind painful eyes or eyes with poor visual potential are also candidates. Cyclodiode laser is also recommended in eyes with significant conjunctival scarring from previous surgery, trauma, or inflammation.

Cyclodiode has also been described in cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma unresponsive to conventional medical and laser treatment allowing the IOP to stabilize and inflammation to subdue before more definitive surgical procedures are undertaken.

Cyclodiode can also be utilized in those non-surgical candidates and in those who display poor compliance to treatment.

Increasingly, cyclodiode is seen as a primary treatment option even in eyes with good visual potential. This is particularly more evident in developing countries as a viable long-term treatment option.

MP-TCP should be considered if available, especially in eyes at higher risk of post-operative complications due to its more favorable safety profile.

ECP is commonly combined with cataract extraction but can equally be used as a primary intraocular procedure.
