On the day of surgery, the patient comes into contact with many specialties, and even more, are involved during their cancer care. All caregivers should be aware of their other colleagues administering care, and should communicate with them frequently, functioning as an interprofessional team. Following surgery, a medical oncologist or surgeon typically spearheads treatment plans, ideally with the help of an interprofessional tumor board. Tumor board involves surgeons, medical and radiation oncologists, radiologists, pathologists, nursing staff, and care coordinators so that all members of the team are aware of the treatment options and plan. Nursing care will be crucial in the postoperative setting, administering medication, and closely monitoring patient status so they can inform the clinicians of any status changes. If the patient has any issues with arm mobility after surgery, physical therapy can be employed. A lymphedema clinic is useful if the patient develops lymphedema, though this is rare with just a sentinel lymph node biopsy. Finally, cancer support groups can be of great benefit to patients. The interprofessional team approach, as outlined above, will yield the best results in these cases. [Level 5]
