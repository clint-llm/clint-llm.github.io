It is vital to differentiate morphea from systemic sclerosis due to its systemic organ involvement and bad prognosis with delay in diagnosis. Patients should be evaluated for the presence of Raynaud's phenomenon, sclerodactyly, calcinosis cutis, and telangiectasia, which warrants further testing for systemic sclerosis with serologies, capillaroscopy, and pulmonary testing.

It is also important to differentiate morphea from other fibrotic skin conditions like scleromyxedema, lipodermatosclerosis, and post-irradiation morphea. Sclermyxedema is seen in patients with systemic diseases like plasma cell dyscrasias. Skin biopsy shows a diffuse deposit of mucin composed primarily of hyaluronic acid in the upper and mid reticular dermis.

Radiation-induced morphea is a rare and chronically progressive localized scleroderma after radiation.
