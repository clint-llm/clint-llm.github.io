Within healthcare education, human factors skills are often described as either technical or non-technical. Technical skills generally refer to the medical and procedural knowledge necessary for delivering competent patient care.

Medication prescribing is another healthcare delivery skill that is inherently error-prone, regardless of the clinical setting.  To assess the "communication- human information processing" model of HFE of medication prescribing, scenario-based simulations were integrated into a counterbalanced, crossover design study. Researchers assessed usability, perceived workload, and error frequency concerning system alerts triggered during this process.  After combining participant feedback with the efficiency linked to intrusive alerts,  the process was redesigned, and a modestly significant reduction in workload was attained.

The ability to recognize and integrate information regarding life-threatening conditions is paramount in the critical care setting.  Mixed methods studies have highlighted the benefit of utilizing simulation to evaluate clinical pattern recognition and intervention in these circumstances as well.

Recently, the following consensus definition of non-technical skills was published: "A set of social (communication and teamwork) and cognitive (analytical and personal behavior) skills that support high-quality, safe, effective, and efficient inter-professional care within the complex healthcare system."
