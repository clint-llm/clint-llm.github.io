The patient should be appropriately examined before surgical intervention and deemed appropriate for surgery by an ophthalmologist or a surgeon trained in entropion evaluation and repair. The patient should be educated about the associated risks and benefits of the intervention, including alternative therapies available. All possible complications should be discussed. Lastly, all questions from the patient should be answered.

The operation can be performed under general anesthesia or with topical and local anesthesia with or without additional intravenous sedation or oral sedatives. The anesthetic modality is dictated by surgeon experience and patient preference.
