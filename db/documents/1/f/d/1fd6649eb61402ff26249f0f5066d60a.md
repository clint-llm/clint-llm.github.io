The nerve innervation of the hypothenar eminence is entirely by the ulnar nerve (C8, T1 spinal roots). The ulnar will be travel in the Guyon canal (hook of the hamate and the pisiform). The ulnar nerve will travel superficially to the transverse carpal ligament but under the palmaris brevis muscle. The palmaris brevis muscle protects the ulnar nerve asÂ the nerve enters the hand.
