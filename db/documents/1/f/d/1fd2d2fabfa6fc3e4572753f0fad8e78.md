An adamantinoma is a rare low-grade malignant bone tumor typically found in the diaphyses and metaphyses of long bones in 20 to 40-year-olds. Adamantinomas are locally aggressive and have the potential to metastasize. The mortality rate associated with adamantinomas is estimated at six to eighteen percent, and the frequency of metastases at twelve to twenty-nine percent. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and treatment of adamantinomas and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.
