Pioglitazone is an oral antidiabetic from the thiazolidinedione drug class, FDA approved for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults, as an adjunct to diet and exercise.

Maintaining blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible is the main goal in diabetes management to prevent the complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines recommend HbA1C less than 7% in most non-pregnant patients, a stricter goal of less than 6.5% in younger patients with long life expectancy, or a less strict HbA1C goal of less than 8% in others with coexisting comorbidities, especially coronary heart disease and hypoglycemia unawareness among others and with limited life expectancy.

Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) target the fundamental problem of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Thiazolidinediones on the market include pioglitazone and rosiglitazone. Rosiglitazone is not widely available. A meta-analysis by Nissen and Wolski in 2017 suggested an increased risk of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death with rosiglitazone use.

In treatment guidelines, pioglitazone is recommended as third-line or sometimes second-line therapy if first-line and second-line anti-diabetics fail to achieve glycemic control. When a patient demonstrates prominent insulin resistance, a propensity to hypoglycemia, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or steatohepatitis, or issues with insurance coverage or payment for first- or second-line anti-diabetic agents, pioglitazone should be considered as a viable option.
