Chest X-ray can be helpful in cases of large PHH. Depending on its contents, the air-fluid level is pathognomonic to DH, and gaseous small or large bowel loops could be noticed.

Esophagogastroscopy on J-manoeuvre will show two openings, the normal oesophageal hiatus (thorough with the scope will be passing through) and laterally PHH opening, with an intervening band of tissue that differentiates it from its contemporary hiatal hernia (see Image 2). Sometimes it can be diagnosed as gastric diverticulum because of a similar endoscopic appearance.

A contrast swallow study would give evidence for any other concomitant oesophageal disorders (such as achalasia, gastroesophageal reflux disease) and confirm the presence of a diaphragmatic hernia but is not diagnostic for PHH.

Manometry and pH studies are recommended as a part of the routine workup for reflux disease to have an objective assessment through esophageal manometry and the De Meester score, respectively, to quantify the symptoms, which will imply the choice of surgical repair one could offer. Whereas in emergency cases, a decision has to be made based on the patient’s history and operative findings at the time of surgery.

Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and upper abdomen with 3-D reconstruction views is the preferred choice of investigation due to its ability to reveal and help us to understand the anatomy of the DH accurately. One would expect to see the left part of the right crus lateral to the esophagus, PHH would be identified lateral to this part of the right crus as its right border, and it is the identification of this band of tissue, which is the key to its diagnosis.
