The most common adverse reactions include nausea, vomiting, headache, and nervousness in an awake patient. Because of phenylephrineâ€™s sole alpha-receptor stimulation, it can cause baroreceptor-mediated reflex bradycardia. Clinicians should consider different classes of vasopressor medications in the bradycardic, hypotensive patient. In specific patient populations, primarily hypovolemic patients with cardiac dysfunction, phenylephrine can increase afterload more so than preload, causing decreased cardiac output and potentially an exacerbation of angina, heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension.
