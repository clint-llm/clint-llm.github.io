The nail unit of the lower extremity, the nails are innervated by the plantar digital nerves. These digital nerves are branches from the medial and lateral plantar nerve. The medial plantar nerve has three branches which provide the sensation for the great toe, second, third, and fourth toe. The lateral plantar nerve communicates with a distal branch of the medial plantar nerve to provide sensation for the fourth and fifth toes. Similar to the vascular supply of the digit, there are two dorsal and two ventral branches with overlapping sensory areas. There are several nerve fibers in the fingers due to their essential role of sensory perception. There are numerous type 1 fibers that transmit pain, Meissner, and Pacinian bodies that carry touch and temperature sensing fibers.
