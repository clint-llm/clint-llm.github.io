Congenital vertical talus is a foot deformity characterized by dorsal dislocation of the navicular resulting in equinus and hindfoot valgus. It is a relatively rare condition and may be associated with other anomalies. More than 50% of the cases are idiopathic, and the remaining are mainly associated with genetic or neuromuscular disorders. It may result in significant disability due to multiple bony deformities with a rocker-bottom appearance, callosities formation, and difficulty in wearing shoes if it is not managed properly. The management starts with nonoperative treatment in the form of serial casting. Minimally invasive surgeries have also shown promising results in the treatment after serial casting. Postoperative rehabilitation plays a significant role in preventing relapse of this rare foot condition after correcting the deformity. This activity examines congenital vertical talus from a diagnostic and therapeutic standpoint and covers how the interprofessional healthcare team should address this condition in patients to derive optimal outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of congenital vertical talus.
- Outline the common presentation of a patient with congenital vertical talus.
- Review the classification system of congenital vertical talus.
- Summarize the various treatment options for patients with congenital vertical talus and the anticipated complications.
