There are differences in treatment options between primary and secondary pneumatosis intestinalis. Other factors influencing treatment include laboratory values and clinical presentation of the patient. Since PI is not a disease in itself but a clinical sign, treatment begins with the underlying cause. A conservative, non-surgical approach is warranted in patients without signs of any life-threatening conditions such as peritonitis and sepsis. In addition, subsequent imaging is needed for patients who are at high risk of their PI worsening into a life-threatening condition.

Ling et al. state that conservative methods include observation, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, antibiotics to inhibit intestinal bacterial infection, and endoscopy. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy alleviates symptoms by decreasing the partial pressure of gases in the venous system and facilitating gas diffusion out of the bowel wall. It also acts as a toxin against anaerobic bacteria in the intestinal tract. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy can also be supplemented with humidified oxygen via a Venturi mask or nasal cannula (4 to 6 L/min). Oxygen therapy should be used for two days after cyst disappearance in order to reduce the risk of recurrence. An antibiotic regimen used to treat PI is metronidazole 500 mg PO three times a day for up to three months. Further long-term management of PI is an elemental diet or a digestible formula diet composed of a liquid/powder form of daily nutrients. An elemental diet is completely absorbed in the intestines and reduces the production of gas by bacterial flora.

The indications for surgical intervention for PI are elevated white blood cell count, definitive imaging revealing portal venous gas, and clinical signs of sepsis or acidosis. Another more specific intervention is endoscopy with sclerotherapy for patients suffering from intestinal obstruction due to PI. Endoscopic treatment involves fine-needle aspiration of the many cysts in an attempt to exhaust the gas and relieve the intestinal obstruction. It can also be used to diagnose PI as it confirms the presence of gas-filled cysts via direct observation. Some patients may experience recurrence of intestinal obstruction due to PI. In this case, sclerotherapy of the wall after puncture may be performed to prevent the recollection or reexpansion of the cysts.
