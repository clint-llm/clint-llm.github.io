The delicate development of the eye is sensitive to embryologic errors. Some examples of congenital eye malformations include anophthalmia, coloboma, cyclopia, cataract, aniridia, detached retina, hyaloid artery persistence, aphakia, and cryptophthalmos.

Understanding the components of normal embryology will guide disease management and treatment options. This point is evident by the advent ofÂ therapeutic stem cell technologies, such as those under development for retinal and lacrimal gland regeneration
