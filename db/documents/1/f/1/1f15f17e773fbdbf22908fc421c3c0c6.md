While there are two accrediting bodies in the domain of simulation, SSH and the American College of Surgeons (ACS), the primary organization referenced here will be SSH. The ACS focuses more on domain-specific expertise in the specialty of surgery, while SSH focuses on the recognition of simulation expertise.

Ultimately, simulation centers obtain accreditation to provide value to the program and to showcase its expertise. Such validation may lead to the recruitment of better instructors, outside learners, and contracts, with the potential of increasing revenue and sustainability to the Center. Additionally, accreditation ensures that a program has a clear mission, vision, strategic plan, and formalized policies and procedures.
