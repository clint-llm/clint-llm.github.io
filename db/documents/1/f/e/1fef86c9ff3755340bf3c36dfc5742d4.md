Disorders that mimic SIDS include aspiration, asphyxiation, anaphylaxis, poisoning, fatal child abuse, trauma, hyperthermia, metabolic disorders, cystic fibrosis, hepatitis, pancreatitis, encephalitis, AV malformation with hemorrhage, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, pulmonary hypertension, sickle cell crisis, cardiac disorders including congenital heart disease, subendocardial fibroelastosis and myocarditis, sepsis, and infections including bronchiolitis, pneumonia, tracheobronchitis, pyelonephritis, and enterocolitis with Salmonella, Shigella, or Escherichia Coli. Among these, fatal child abuse and metabolic disease deserve particular attention because they may affect other family members.

Fatal child abuse accounts for 1 to 5% of cases designated as SIDS.

The proportion of metabolic diseases was not higher among infants with sudden death compared to the general population.
