**Specialties to Involved after Diagnosis**

Physical therapy, developmental specialist, cardiology (age 6), and clinical genetics/counselor are consulted.

**Cardiomyopathy**

When left ventricle section fraction is below 55%, some institutions start angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or beta-blockers

Patients who develop scoliosis may require bracing and surgery (spinal fusion).

Corticosteroids have been proved to improve muscle strength and function. This is, therefore, the main therapy for children younger than 15 years of age, although not recommended for children below age 2.

**Prevention/Monitoring**

- Yearly influenza vaccine

- Pneumococcal vaccine (PPS 23)

- Assess for, in the presence of corticosteroid intake, weight gain, dysphagia, constipation, malnutrition or prior main surgeries

- Physical therapy to prevent muscle contractures. Promote daily or regular exercise, but if there is muscle pain, reduce activity intensity or frequency

- Monitor for serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (per semester), magnesium, PTH, urine calcium, and creatinine; Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at age three and annually; spine x-rays; bone age, especially if under corticosteroid therapy

- Consider biphosphonates if there is a history of symptomatic vertebral fractures, not as prophylaxis

- Cardiac evaluation every two years, from the time of diagnosis (electrocardiogram and echocardiogram or cardiac MRI)

- Baseline pulmonary function tests and biannually along with pediatric pulmonologist if the patient uses a wheelchair, age 12, or has a reduction of vital capacity of less than 80%

- Family members or caregivers should be educated regarding manual ventilation bag, mechanical insufflation-exsufflation device.

**Contraindications**

The use of botulinum toxin is contraindicated. Non-depolarizing anesthetics or succinylcholine are also contraindicated despite no increased risk for malignant hyperthermia; a small subset has been reported to show severe malignant hyperthermia-like reactions.
