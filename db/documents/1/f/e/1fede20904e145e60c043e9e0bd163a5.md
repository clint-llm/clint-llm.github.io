Osteitis condensans ilii (OCI) is associated with chronic lower back pain and sclerotic lesions on the radiographs but it is a self-limiting and nonprogressive disease. Most patients with OCI have an excellent outcome and symptoms regress in the majority of patients that's why OCI is rare in elderly patients.
