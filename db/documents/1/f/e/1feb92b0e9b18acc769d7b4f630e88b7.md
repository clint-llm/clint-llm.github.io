For a successful tissue/organ transplantation to occur, it requires an extraordinary amount of teamwork from all aspects of the healthcare system. Preoperatively, nurses are required to provide close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters outlined in current standard practices and offer interventions as necessary. Intraoperatively, it is known that various specialties of medicine participate in the operation, requiring extensive and clear communication for surgical success. Finally, allied health professionals play a critical role in maximizing the organ recipientâ€™s return to normal function postoperatively, leading to a happy and healthy life.
