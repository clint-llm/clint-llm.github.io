Surgical uterine evacuation (dilation and evacuation, suction curettage) is the mainstay of management for complete or partial moles. A hysterectomy is an option for patients who have completed childbearing. Medical management is controversial and not well studied. There is some concern that inducing uterine contractions with uterotonics may increase the risk of metastatic disease.

All patients with HM should be monitored with serial serum hCG testing values after evacuation to evaluate for post-molar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN).  Guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advise the following protocol:

- Every week until non-detectable for 3 weeks, then

- Every month for 6 months: If the hCG remains undetectable for six months, then the patient may resume trying to become pregnant.

Following the evacuation of a complete or partial molar pregnancy, if hCG levels rise or remain elevated over several weeks, the patient is classified as having GTN. The diagnosis of post-molar GTN is based upon the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) criteria:

- hCG levels plateau (remain within plus or minus 10% of the previous result) across four measurements over a 3-week period.

- hCG level increases more than 10% across three values over a 2-week duration

- Persistence of detectable serum hCG for more than 6 months after molar evacuation.
