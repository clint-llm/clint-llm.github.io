Excellent prognosis if diagnosed and treated appropriately in a timely fashion. Syphilis is easily treated with penicillin. However, there is an increased risk for worse outcomes and possible death in:

- Premature infants

- Those who have a delay or do not receive proper treatment

- Patients who display an extensive spread of the disease with multiple organ failure

- Infants with a severe Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction upon treatment
