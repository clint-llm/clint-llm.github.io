The 2 most commonly used diagnostic techniques for assessing cytopathology of thyroid nodules are FNA and fine-needle capillary sampling (FNC). The National Cancer Institute recommends using the Bethesda classification that stratifies cytologic findings into 6 major categories, each showing different subsequent evaluation and management.

The Bethesda system diagnostic categories for reporting thyroid cytopathology describes

- Non-diagnostic: Represents an inadequate sample with an insufficient number of follicular cells

- Benign, normal thyroid tissue, showing nodules of adenomatous or multinodular goiters, common entities include adenomatous nodules, Hashimoto thyroiditis, and subacute granulomatous thyroiditis.

- Follicular lesion of undetermined significance (FLUS) or atypia of undetermined significance (AUS): proposed for lesions that are not convincingly benign. AUS shows lesions with nuclear atypia and lesions with extensive oncocytic changes, although not enough to be classified as a Hürthle cell neoplasm. FLUS show a combined microfollicular and macrofollicular pattern.

- Follicular neoplasm or suspicion for follicular neoplasm includes microfollicular or cellular adenomas. Since FNA only samples a portion of the nodule, surgical excision is required to determine if a microfollicular lesion is benign or malignant; microfollicles are identified, the colloid is absent or scant, and cells are more crowded than in macrofollicular nodules.

- Suspicious for malignancy: Includes lesions with features of malignancy that are not definite for thyroid cancer

- Malignancy: Cytology will differ on the different types of possible thyroid malignancies. For papillary cancers, microscopy shows large cells with ground-glass cytoplasm, prominent nucleoli, and intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions. Medullary cancer shows disperse cells showing eccentrically displaced nuclei and slightly granular cytoplasm usually configured as a teardrop. Anaplastic cancer shows marked pleomorphism, bizarre giant cells, and spindle cells.
