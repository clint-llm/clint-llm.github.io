Chlamydia species are gram-negative obligate intracellular bacteria. They depend upon the host cell for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) required for growth and replication. They are visible under the light microscope after staining the specimen with the Giemsa stain. Chlamydia is basophilic and appears as typical cytoplasmic inclusion bodies or as free Chlamydia under the microscope.

Electron microscopy of C. pneumoniae reveals a characteristic pear-shaped EB surrounded by a periplasmic space, whereas C. trachomatis and C. psittaci have round EBs.

The organism primarily infects respiratory epithelium, and other cells like vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, monocytes/macrophages, and atheromatous tissues. Alveolar membrane (AM) plays an important role as a target cell in Chlamydia infection and elicits a marked inflammatory response to the infection by the organism. This includes an increased release of inflammatory cytokines within the alveoli, and the collection of interstitial infiltrates consisting of polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells. This results in local destructive effects on lung tissue.

Neutrophilic infiltrations are common in the early phase after infection, but distinct lymphocytic alveolitis has also been observed in those with subacute infections. Because of the intracellular survival of Chlamydia, AM may also act as a reservoir for the pathogen causing persistence of infection.
