Atherosclerosis causes occlusion of the arteries. Depending on the site of occlusion and involvement of the artery, collateral pathways can form. However, over time, the oxygen demand during exercise increases, which is insufficiently compensated, leading to intermittent claudication, i.e., calf pain and fatigue on walking or activity. As the severity of occlusion increases, the symptoms may present even at rest, leading to ischemic rest pain, minor and significant tissue loss, which includes ulcers and gangrene.

Acute occlusion is common in the infra-inguinal arteries. This condition leads to the atherosclerotic phenomenon of thrombosis and embolus. Thrombus is a localized clot that leads to impaired circulation. Emboli may travel toÂ bifurcations and cause occlusion and present more acutely with no collaterals. The most common site of embolus is the distal common femoral artery and popliteal arteries. The level of impalpable pulses helps locate the site of occlusion.

The six P's characteristic of arterial occlusion includes pain, pallor (color change), poikilothermia (coldness), pulselessness, paresthesia, and paralysis.
