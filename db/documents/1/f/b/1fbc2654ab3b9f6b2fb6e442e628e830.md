The etiology of chest wall tumors includes benign cellular or malignant overgrowth and proliferation, infectious, or inflammatory processes.

Primary chest wall tumors include tumors of the bone, muscle, fat, blood vessels, nerve sheaths, myositis ossificans, elastofibroma dorsi, and extra-abdominal desmoid tumors. Secondary chest wall tumors arise from metastases from other body organs.

It is currently unclear in the literature the precise cause of chest wall tumors; however, postulates are that genetics, diet, and lifestyle choices may have some effect in the development of these tumors.

Extra-abdominal desmoid tumors are aggressive fibromatosis, sometimes developing at the site of a previous thoracotomy.
