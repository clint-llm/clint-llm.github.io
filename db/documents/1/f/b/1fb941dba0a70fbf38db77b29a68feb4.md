Legg-Calve-Perthes disease usually occurs between the ages of 3 to 12 years old, with the highest rate of occurrence at 5 to 7 years. It affects 1 in 1200 children under the age of 15. Legg-Calve-Perthes disease occurs most commonly in male patients, with a male to female ratio between 4:1 and 5:1. It is bilateral in 10% to 20% of affected cases. When it occurs bilaterally, it is usually asymmetrical and discovered in different stages of the disease. If it is symmetrical, the examiner must consider multiple epiphyseal dysplasias as the culprit. Caucasians and Asians are more commonly affected. It is also more prevalent in urban areas in patients with lower socioeconomic status. Risk factors for Legg-Calve-Perthes disease include:

- Ten percent familial (there is a delayed bone age by about 2 years)

- HIV (Up to 5% of HIV patients have avascular necrosis of the hip)

- Factor V Leiden and other inherited coagulopathies

- Thrombophilias (increased clotting)

- Hypofibrinolysis (decreased ability to dissolve clots)

- Secondhand smoke exposure (OR=5)

- Low socioeconomic status

- Birth weight less than 2.5 kg in boys

- Short stature
