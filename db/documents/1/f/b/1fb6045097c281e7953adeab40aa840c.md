The management of the patient with HIV or AIDS is complex and lifelong.  Collaboration amongst primary care physicians and specialty-trained providers such as infectious disease, oncology, gastroenterology, neurology, cardiology, and dermatology will be required to handle the complications of long-term HIV infection, ART medication side effects and the complications of immunosuppression when the patient transitions to AIDS.  Interactions with pharmacists, social workers, mental health providers, and ancillary staff will be necessary to ensure patients are educated about their disease and treatment and also have access to their medications and the medical providers they will need to visit for the rest of their lives. The formation of an interprofessional team has been shown to have improved adherence and outcomes for patients living with HIV.
