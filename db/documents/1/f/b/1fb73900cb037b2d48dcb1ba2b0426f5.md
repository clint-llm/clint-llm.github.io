An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a useful ancillary and diagnostic test that detects electrical activity in the brain. The neonatal EEG can be quite challenging and may require additional skills and training, given that benign variants exist within the different stages of development and must be differentiated from abnormal discharges. This activity describes neonatal visual analysis on EEG and highlights the role of the healthcare team in evaluating patients who undergo EEG.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures, indications, and contraindications of neonatal visual analysis on EEG.
- Outine the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to neonatal visual analysis on EEG.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and clinical significance of neonatal visual analysis on EEG.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication during neonatal visual analysis on EEG and improve outcomes.
