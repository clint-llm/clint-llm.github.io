Ongoing infection of the middle ear (otitis media) is a contraindication to ossicular chain reconstruction. However, relative contraindications include factors that would result in suboptimal hearing improvement, such as a reduced middle ear space, repeated surgical failures using similar prostheses, stapes fixation/malformation, and an only hearing ear.

A stable, well-aerated middle ear environment is critical for optimal sound conduction. A contracted middle ear space can restrict the movement of the tympanic membrane, ossicular chain, and round window, resulting in a 35 to 55 dB conductive hearing loss.

Negative middle ear pressure, poor mastoid pneumatization, effusion, persistent Eustachian tube dysfunction, granulation tissue, middle ear fibrosis, and adhesive disease, and tympanic membrane perforations can all affect the efficiency of sound transmission and must be addressed prior or in conjunction with ossiculoplasty.

Reduced stapes footplate mobility, absence of stapes superstructure, or an improperly aligned stapes superstructure can result in the suboptimal ossicular coupling, increased risk of prosthesis displacement, and surgical failure.
