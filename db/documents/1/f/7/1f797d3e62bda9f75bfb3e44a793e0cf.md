There are three genes identified with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) Tp53 17p13, 1q23, and checkpoint kinase two genes CHEK2 locus at 22q12.1.

In TP53 mutations, one mutant allele is generally inherited by individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome; the other allele is deleted or somatically mutated, which leads to loss of functional P53 protein. Missense mutations are the most common to occur, usually in exons 5 to 8 which is the DNA binding region of the gene. When mutation testing is done targeting exons 5-8 (these are the usual targets for testing), nearly 70% of Li–Fraumeni families meeting the required diagnostic criteria harbor P53 mutations. Partial loss of alleles presents with less family history, decreased numbers of tumors, and late disease onset.

Not all individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome have TP53 mutations. It also can be due to an alteration in gene promoter which causes defective protein expression. It may also be due to new mutations that have not been described.
