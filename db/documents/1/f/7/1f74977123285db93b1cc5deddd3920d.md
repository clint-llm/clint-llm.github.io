Instead of examining specific cases that require neurosurgical intervention, this article will stress the important concepts of the surgical patient. A neurosurgical consult, as well as proper medical imaging, are the first crucial steps to determine the specific pathology and whether or not surgical intervention is required. Furthermore, the physician must account for the risk and benefits of the procedure(s), as patient autonomy. If surgical intervention is necessary and agreed upon, the exact procedure(s) may vary on a case-by-case basis depending upon the severity of the pathology and risk/benefits of the approach.
