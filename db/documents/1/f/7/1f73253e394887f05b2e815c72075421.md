The surgical timing for the treatment of BPI remains a topic of controversy. Urgent surgical exploration of the plexus is indicated if a root avulsion or laceration injury to the plexus is suspected or in cases of open injury, retained foreign body, or vascular injury requiring vessel repair. Sharp transections of the brachial plexus allow for primary repair of the transected ends to optimize nerve regeneration. Prognosis for low-energy mechanism BPI is more favorable compared to root avulsions or preganglionic injuries and can be treated conservatively to allow for spontaneous recovery.
