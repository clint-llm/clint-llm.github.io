The complexity of midgut development takes place with the help of the simultaneous development of the enteric plexus. Nitric oxide assists in the movement of the midgut during this embryological period. Without nitric oxide, the developing midgut experiences a dampened response to neuronal signals, which leads to a reduced frequency of contractions and potentially abnormal development.
