CVI is a potential space containing cerebrospinal fluid formed between the two layers of the tela choroidea of the third ventricle. The tela choroidea is composed of a dual-layer loose connective tissue of pia mater surmounted by the ependyma. A very rich arterial and venous vascularization characterizes the tela choroidea.
