The prevalence of all the types of hypophysitis is low, with an incidence of approximately 1 in 9 million.

Lymphocytic hypophysitis itself was initially thought to be an autoimmune condition that affected women in the third trimester and the postpartum stage (first six months after delivery), however, it has now been known to occur in non-pregnant females and males as well. It is a rare condition that still affects women more frequently than men at a ratio of 8Â to 1.

Although cases have been reported in children and the elderly, the mean age of diagnosis for men is 44.7 years, and the mean age of diagnosis for women is 34 years. It has also been associated with other autoimmune conditions in 20 percent to 50 percent of cases.
