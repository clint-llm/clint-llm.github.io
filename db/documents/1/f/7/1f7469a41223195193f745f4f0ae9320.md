Postoperative head positioning is an important factor determining the outcome of macular hole (MH) surgery. The aim is to isolate the MH area from fluid interaction to maintain the dehydrated state with the help of the gas tamponade. Usually face down position is not needed for small holes, provided that the gas bubble is large enough to isolate the hole area properly.

Post-operative facedown position may help to close the macular hole of less than 400 micrometer diameter significantly.

The patient should be counseled regarding the adverse effect of air-traveling on expansile gases. In those cases, silicone oil can be given.
