Knowing the actions of ghrelin and leptin has led to many therapeutic advances. With the rise of obesity in the past 50 years, researchers have attempted to find methods to treat and prevent this public health problem associated with many secondary diseases.

Understanding the roles of these hormones and the hypothalamic nuclei where they act has been crucial in developing potential treatments for multiple disorders. An imbalance or decreased sensitivity to ghrelin or leptin can lead to problems with anorexia or excessive eating. Specific pathophysiologies (discussed in a later section) can arise due to an imbalance of these two hormones. Therefore maintaining appropriate levels of ghrelin and leptin is critical in maintaining homeostasis. As the worldwide health problem of obesity increases, potentially leading to secondary diseases, therapeutic effects such as managing leptin levels are under investigation.
