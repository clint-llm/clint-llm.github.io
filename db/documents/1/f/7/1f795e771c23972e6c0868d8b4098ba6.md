- TX- Unable to assess the primary

- T2- Localization to the kidney, greater than 7 cm (T2a is less than 10 cm, and T2b is greater than 10 cm)

- T3- Invasion of the tumor into the blood vessels and perinephric region, but not beyond Gerota's fascia (T3a- when there is no spread beyond the Gerota's fascia: T3b- involves infra diaphragmatic vena cava; T3c- Invasion of the supradiaphragmatic vena cava or the vena cava wall)

- T4- Invasion of the tumor beyond Gerota's fascia into the ipsilateral adrenal gland

- NX- Unable to assess the regional lymph nodes
