Lipedema should be recognized prior to weight loss programs so knowledge of the disease and expectations can be discussed. Manual therapies, medicines, supplements, other conservative treatments, and bariatric surgery can be tried; if it fails, liposuction should be considered. A careful diagnosis should be performed to prevent unnecessary frustration and cost of therapy, and only thenÂ should therapy goals be formulated.

Associated co-morbidities, genetic and environmental factors should be considered, and each patient with lipedema should be considered on a different spectrum, and treatment should be personalized.
