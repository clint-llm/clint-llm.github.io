Carotid sinus massage with terminate approximatelyÂ 20% of episodes of re-entry supraventricular tachycardia. This vagal maneuver should be avoided or used with caution in the elderly as atherosclerotic plaque formations might become disrupted, and strokes may occur.

There have been propositions made for surgical procedures to treat carotid sinus syndrome, heart failure, hypertension, and insulin resistance. The proposals would be denervation of the carotid sinus for carotid sinus syndrome and carotid body removal for refractory hypertension and heart failure. It has also been suggested to produce baroreceptor electrical stimulation for refractory hypertension and heart failure.

A case study has found that head and neck radiation for treating squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue resulted in orthostatic hypotension due to baroreceptor failure.
