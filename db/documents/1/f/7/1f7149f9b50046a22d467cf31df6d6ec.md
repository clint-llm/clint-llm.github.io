It presents as hair loss in well-circumscribed patches of normal-appearing skin. Although any hair-bearing can be affected, this occurs most commonly on the scalp and beard.

The onset is usually fast, and it may progress and induce complete hair loss on the scalp, a condition termed alopecia areata totalis. Moreover, it may induce complete hair loss on the whole body (alopecia areata universalis) Other variants include ophiasis, in which hair loss affects the occipital region, diffuse forms of alopecia (alopecia incognito) and “sudden graying,” a variant which attacks pigmented hair follicles.

Exclamation-mark hairs are a key characteristic of alopecia areata. In exclamation-mark hairs, the hair root is narrowed and suggest defective anchoring of the hair within the follicle.  Exclamation point hairs can be found at the margins of the lesions during the active phases of the disease.

Alopecia areata can involve the nails, which occurs in about 10 to 15% of cases. Patients with nail involvement usually present the most severe forms of hair loss.

Alopecia areata carries associations with several comorbidities, including depression, anxiety, and several autoimmune diseases (thyroid disease, lupus erythematosus, vitiligo, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease). These autoimmune comorbidities suggest that patients with alopecia areata are at increased risk of developing various T cell-driven inflammatory skin diseases.
