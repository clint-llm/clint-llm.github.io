Patients with gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina usually present with night blindness and progressive visual field constriction in their first decade of life that occurs due to progressive peripheral chorioretinal degeneration.

On ophthalmoscopy, the peripheral chorioretinal degeneration appears as discrete scalloped areas of chorioretinal atrophy that progressively coalesce together and have pigmented edges with visible large choroidal vessels underneath.

Although ophthalmic features are the main manifestations of GA, several central nervous system manifestations may also be associated with the condition, including aggressive behavior, mental retardation, and epilepsy.
