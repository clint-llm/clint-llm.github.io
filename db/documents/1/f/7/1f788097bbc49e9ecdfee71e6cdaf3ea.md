Tearing is a symptom that can occur at any age (from several weeks after birth until the elderly) as a manifestation of different conditions.

In children, congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction at the valve of Hasner is the most common cause of epiphora.

Most studies have detected a female preponderance in low lacrimal drainage obstructions.

Regarding laterality, unilateral tearing is more common in cases of a lacrimal obstruction than other causes, whereas bilateral tearing is more frequent in cases of reflex tearing.
