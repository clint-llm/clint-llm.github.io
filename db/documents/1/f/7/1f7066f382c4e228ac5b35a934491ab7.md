EEG recording methods differ between adults and neonates due to smaller head circumference and a lack of significant activity in some cortical regions. Equipment modifications include the use of eight scalp electrodes (FP1, C3, T3, O1, FP2, C4, T4, O2), electrocardiogram (EKG), electromyography (EMG), eye movements, and respiration monitors. There is freedom for additional electrodes for electromagnetic field coverage in the midline (Fz,Â Pz, Cz). The neonatal montage provides coverage of the centrotemporal regions where most of the neonatal activity occurs.
