March fractures are metatarsal stress fractures, most commonly second and third metatarsal fractures caused by an overuse injury. The repetitive impact on the metatarsals with weight-bearing exercises causes microfractures, which consolidate into stress fracturesÂ and, therefore, are not a result of a single traumatic event

The most common location of metatarsal stress fractures is the second metatarsal neck, as it is less flexible and prone to torsional forces, given its strong ligamentous attachment to the 1 and 2 cuneiforms. In addition, the second metatarsal is the longest of the metatarsals, subjected to the most force.
