Pulmonary function tests should be performed to assess for restrictive lung disease, which is characterized by decreased lung volumes (especially decreased forced vital capacity, total lung capacity, and functional residual capacity) and decreased diffusion capacity. When IPF is suspected, laboratory tests to exclude autoimmune disease should be performed. Antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factors are commonly indicated, but if there is a high suspicion, then antisynthetase antibodies, aldolase, Sjogren, and scleroderma antibodies should also be sent.

Chest imaging is essential for diagnosis, but chest x-rays are not detailed enough to confirm IPF. High-resolution CT (HRCT) of the chest should be performed. The characteristic feature on HRCT is a “usual interstitial pneumonia” (UIP) pattern, which on imaging consists of bilateral subpleural basal predominant honeycombing or traction bronchiectasis or bronchiectasis. Peripheral reticular opacities are usually most notable in the lower lobes. Ground glass opacities and consolidation are atypical for a UIP pattern and, when present on imaging, should lead to suspicion for conditions other than IPF.

Histopathologic confirmation for IPF is not always necessary but should be considered if there are conflicting factors.  Such factors could include imaging with an atypical UIP pattern or suspicion for connective tissue disease causing the lung findings.  Many transplant centers often want confirmation by surgical lung biopsy prior to transplant as well. Additionally, if the patient is young, a biopsy may be warranted as most cases of IPF are later in life.  Bronchoscopic biopsy has a very low yield and is more useful when done to exclude other processes.  More recently, bronchoscopic cryo-biopsies have been used for pathologic diagnosis, but surgical lung biopsy remains the gold standard.

Characteristic histopathologic features for IPF is a UIP pattern which indicates the presence of temporal and spatial heterogeneity, the presence of fibroblastic foci, areas of subpleural honeycombing, and interstitial inflammation. There should also be an absence of other features like granulomas or giant cells.
