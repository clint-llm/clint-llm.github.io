The FDA first approved alogliptin in January 2013 to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor ("gliptin" class) used to improve glycemic control in conjunction with diet and exercise.

T2DM is a chronic illness that is becoming a common diagnosis among American children and adults. According to the CDC, in 2015, approximately 100 million US adults had either diabetes or prediabetes. It is the seventh leading cause of death and has a 2- to 4-fold increase in cardiovascular disease. The need for intensive glucose control is great. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) currently recommends a hemoglobin A1C target of less than 7% in most nonpregnant patients. However, some subsets of patients may have a more strict goal of less than 6.5%, while other subsets of patients may have a less stringent goal of less than 8%.

The ADAs Standards of Care currently consider DPP-4 inhibitors as add-on therapy if patients do not meet their A1C goal after three months of lifestyle modifications and metformin. DPP-4 inhibitors are a useful component of both dual and triple therapy. It is worth noting that current recommendations suggest selecting a second agent (after metformin) based on the patient’s atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk status. If they have ASCVD, the clinician should choose an agent proven to reduce cardiovascular (CV) risks and mortality. Alogliptin has not been shown to reduce CV risks or CV mortality; in fact, there are concerns about a potential risk of heart failure associated with DPP-4 inhibitors. Approximately half of all patients with T2DM will develop heart failure during their life, so this is a significant concern.

The EXAMINE trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study that assessed alogliptin versus placebo (in addition to standard of care) in 5380 patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome event. This trial showed that alogliptin improved glycemic control and did not increase the risk of hypoglycemia, which was associated with a risk of major adverse cardiovascular outcomes. A study of the same patients in the EXAMINE trial found that alogliptin did not increase the risk of heart failure in patients with T2DM and recent acute coronary syndromes. However, the SAVOR-TIMI 53 study showed that patients treated with saxagliptin (also a DPP-4 inhibitor) were more likely to be hospitalized for heart failure than those given a placebo. DPP-4 use and heart failure is an ongoing area of research due to mixed results from current trials.

Incretin therapies (including DPP-4 inhibitors) are research targets in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) due to their preserving effects on beta-cell mass. They currently do not have an approved indication for the treatment of T1DM.
