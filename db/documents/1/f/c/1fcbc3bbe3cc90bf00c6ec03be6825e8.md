C. tetani secretes the toxins, tetanospasmin, and tetanolysin, causing the characteristic “tetanic spasm,” a generalized contraction of agonist and antagonistic muscles. Specifically, tetanospasmin affects the nerve and muscle motor endplate interaction, causing the clinical syndrome of rigidity, muscle spasms, and autonomic instability. On the other hand, tetanolysin damages the tissues.

At the site of inoculation, tetanus spores enter the body and germinate in the wound.

The incubation period can last from one to 60 days but is, on average, around 7 to 10 days. Symptom severity depends on the distance from the central nervous system, with more severe symptoms associated with shorter incubation periods. Once the neurotoxin enters the brainstem, autonomic dysfunction occurs, typically in the second week of symptom onset. With the loss of autonomic control, patients can present with labile blood pressure and heart rate, diaphoresis, bradyarrhythmias, and cardiac arrest. Symptoms can last for weeks to months, with a mortality rate of 10% in those infected; it is even higher in those without prior vaccination. There have been frequent motor and long-term neuropsychiatric complications in survivors; however, many make full recoveries.
