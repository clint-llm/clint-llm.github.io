The incidence of bile duct injury increased with increasing adoption of the laparoscopic technique for cholecystectomy and treatment of other biliary pathologies. Bile duct injury occurs in 0.3 to 0.7% of the approximately 750000 laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed in the United States every year.

Risk factors of bile duct injury include anatomic variants, patient condition, gallbladder pathology, and surgeon related factors. A short cystic duct or cystic duct that runs parallel to the common bile duct can lead to the misidentification of the cystic duct. Other factors, such as variation of the cystic duct and common hepatic duct junction, a cystic duct that inserts onto the right hepatic duct, an accessory cystic duct, or presence of ducts of Luschka also contribute to injury or leak. Patients who have severe obesity, prior hepatobiliary surgery, or underlying liver disease can impair visualization and increase the rate of injury, though 80% of injuries occur in the absence of any risk factors. Acute cholecystitis increased the rate of bile duct injuries due to the associated inflammation, adhesions, gallbladder wall thickening, and increased bleeding.
