Pulmonary sleeve resection (PSR) is considered more technically difficult than pneumonectomy because of the reconstruction required. The preferred incision is an open thoracotomy approach with the patient in a lateral decubitus position. All patients should be intubated, require general anesthesia, Foley catheter placement, and adequate intravenous access. Arterial line placement is also preferred to measure arterial blood gases during the procedure. Lung isolation can be performed with a single-lumen endotracheal tube and bronchial blocker or double-lumen endotracheal tube.

SL and PSR require a few principles:

- Complete resection of the tumor with clear margins (for lung cancer)

- End-to-end re-anastomosis with absorbable braided or monofilament suture

- Covering anastomosis with some form of vascularized tissue

After resection of the affected lobe, bronchial margin tissue is sent for a frozen section to confirm a disease-free area before proceeding with bronchoplasty. After performing the bronchial anastomosis, it is also recommended to buttress the bronchoplasty with a vascularized flap. Various coverings can be harvested, including intercostal muscle flap, pericardial fat pad, or thymic fat wrap. Mediastinal lymphadenectomy should be performed. Usually, a chest tube will be left in place, and an intercostal nerve block is performed with a local anesthetic. Bronchoscopy is usually performed at the end of the procedure to evaluate the bronchial anastomosis and evacuate pulmonary secretions accumulated during the procedure.

Recently, minimally invasive thoracic surgical techniques have advanced in all facets of lung resection surgery. Although technically more challenging, these advanced thoracic surgical techniques can be applied to PSR as experience grows. Minimally invasive techniques include VATS or robotic thoracic surgery.
