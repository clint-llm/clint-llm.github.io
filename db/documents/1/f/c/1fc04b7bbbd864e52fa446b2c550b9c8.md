The ductus arteriosus will close in virtually all healthy term newborns by 72 hours of age. The incidence of PDA in premature infants is inversely proportional to gestational age. In infants who are > 30 weeks gestation at birth, 90% will have a closed ductus at day 4, and 98% will be closed by the time of discharge. Infants born weighing less than 1000 grams are at the highest risk for PDA. In this population, 70% will have a PDA on day 7.

In at least 10% of other congenital heart disorders, a patent ductus may be present.
