Scopolamine is used extensively to prevent PONV in the hospital setting and motion sickness outside of the hospital, and its use and administration should have the involvement of an interprofessional team. Nursing staff should be knowledgeable about proper placement and side effects of scopolamine. The most commonly occurring are mucosal dryness and visual disturbances. The latter is usually due to touching the patch and rubbing the eyes or not properly washing hands after patch administration. Patch formulation prevents systemic toxicity, but one should be aware of the side effects of a possible overdose and monitor closely in specific populations. Nursing can monitor the patient's progress with therapy and check for adverse events in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Pharmacists should check for drug-drug interactions and educate patients and team members regarding the proper use and potential side effects. With an interprofessional team paradigm, scopolamine can achieve maximum therapeutic benefit with minimal adverse events. [Level 5]
