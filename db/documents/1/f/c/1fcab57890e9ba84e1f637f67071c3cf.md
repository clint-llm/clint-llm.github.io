Spider angioma, also known as spider naevus or spider telangiectasia, is a vascular lesion characterized by anomalous dilatation of end vasculature found just beneath the skin surface. The lesion contains a central, red spot and reddish extensions which radiate outward like a spider's web. They may appear as multiple or solitary lesions. A spider angioma has 3 features: a body, legs, and surrounding erythema. The body appears as a 1 to 10 mm central arteriole visible as a punctum or eminence. It is typically painless, resembles a spider's body), and is surrounded by attenuated capillaries radiating in a spider-legged fashion, decreasing in size toward the margins. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of spider angiomas and the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the characteristic features of spider angiomas.
- Summarize the common level of pain associated with a spider angioma.
- Outline the treatment options available for a spider angioma.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the medical team to ensure provide the best management of spider angiomas.
