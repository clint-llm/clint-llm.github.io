A well-planned surgical incision is one of the most crucial steps in any surgical procedure. It is always essential to determine the proper location of the incision for optimal visualization and to always keep in mind anatomy, and blood supply that may harbinger complications. The exact placement and size of the incision utilized are also crucial for aesthetic reasons. If it is a small procedure that requires only minimal entrance into the abdomen, then smaller more strategically placed incisions are the best choice. However, if there is massive trauma, a large organ to be removed, or the surgery is exploratory, then a larger incision may be performed to gain the most exposure possible. This activity will explore different types of incisions, indications for each, as well as important anatomical considerations. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in recognizing which incision should be used to expose different organs in the body.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the different types of incisions used to access abdominal organs.
- Summarize the technique of introducing surgical instruments via the laparoscopic technique
- Describe the benefits of the midline abdominal incision.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to ensure that the patient with an abdominal pathology undergoes the appropriate surgical incision.
