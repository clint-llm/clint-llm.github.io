The falciform ligament serves as an anatomical landmark during abdominal surgery. The hepatic veins, which are hidden from view on the bare surface of the liver and drain into the inferior vena cava, are located immediately inferior to the falciform ligament. Additionally, the round ligament located in the free margin of the falciform ligament enters the umbilicus and serves as a significant landmark for the inner anterior abdominal wall. It also acts as an important landmark during gallbladder surgeries.
