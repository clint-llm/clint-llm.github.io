Creatine phosphokinase is an important enzyme in diagnosing rhabdomyolysis than AMI in the current medical setting. It is essential in patients with sickle cell anemia or sickle cell trait. It requires careful management with an interprofessional team consisting of a pediatrician and a geneticist. The geneticist should assess the type of sickle cell disease during newborn screening.

In a patient who already presents with rhabdomyolysis after an increased creatine phosphokinase level, an interprofessional team consisting of a nephrologist, surgeon, and nurse may manage the condition. The nephrologist would be working to increase kidney function in such patients, as acute kidney injury is the most common complication of rhabdomyolysis. The surgeon may need to surgically repair any damaged muscle or tissue that leads to the condition. The nurse should teach the patient about managing their condition and how to avoid having an attack of rhabdomyolysis again. The healthcare team can also consult with the pharmacist to verify that any patient's medications are not potential sources for elevated CPK.
