A single dose of albendazole or mebendazole or a 3-day dose of albendazole, mebendazole, or pyrantel pamoate is the recommended treatment for Ancylostoma infection. Ivermectin and pyrantel pamoate are the recommended treatment for A. ceylanicum infection, although benzimidazole drugs are effective as well. For pregnant women, deworming treatments are recommended during the second or third trimester of pregnancy after considering the risks and benefits of treatment. Iron replacement and nutritional support should be included in Ancylostoma management of infection to reduce the morbidity rates. After 2 to 3 weeks of treatment, stool examination and blood workup should be performed to evaluate treatment efficacy and to exclude the presence of any reinfection.

Although CLM is a self-limited disease, complications such as secondary bacterial infection may occur if the CLM is untreated. A single dose of ivermectin or a 3-day course of albendazole can be used to stop the movement of the larvae. The topical application of 10% to 15% thiabendazole is also proven effective for CLM. Domesticated animals should be treated as well with anthelminthic drugs such as pyrantel pamoate, dichlorvos, febantel, fenbendazole, and mebendazole to stop the transmission cycle of the zoonotic Ancylostoma species.
