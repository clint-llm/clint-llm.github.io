**Disease-related Concerns**

- Cardiovascular disease: Use requires caution in patients with hypotension, unstable angina, and/or recent MI; may enhance exercise-induced myocardial ischemia in patients with chronic stable angina.

- Hepatic impairment: Use requires caution in patients with hepatic impairment.

**Concurrent Drug Therapy Issues**

- Antiplatelet agents/anticoagulants: Use requires caution in patients on other antiplatelet agents or anticoagulation.

**Dosage Form Specific Issues**

- Injection: Severe adverse reactions have infrequently occurred with IV administration. Use the IV dosage form with caution in patients with bronchospastic disease or unstable angina. Testers should have aminophylline ready in case of urgency or emergency with IV use.
