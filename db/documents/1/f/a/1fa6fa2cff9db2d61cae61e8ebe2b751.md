There is insufficient research to ascertain if persistent postural-perceptual dizziness is a lifelong condition. Patients who receive vestibular balance rehabilitation therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy, along with pharmaceutical management, report a higher quality of life and return to normal activities sooner than those who donâ€™t receive any treatment.

Studies suggest that those with intervention acutely following a triggering event fare better than those that receive no intervention following an acute triggering event.
