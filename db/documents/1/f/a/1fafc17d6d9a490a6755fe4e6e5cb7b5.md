MRI is the standard imaging modality for the diagnosis of cavernous malformations. Cerebral angiography is typically not indicated unless exclusion of other cerebrovascular pathology is being considered.

- For an initial seizure thought to be related to a cavernoma, anti-epileptic medication is a reasonable first-line therapy (Class I, Level B). Surgical resection should be considered for medically refractory epilepsy when the epileptogenic focus is related to a cavernoma.

- Genetic counseling should be considered for those with familial or multiple cavernomas (Class I, Level C).

- Neurosurgical consultation is indicated for the management of cavernous malformations. Treatment options include observation with serial imaging, surgical resection, and stereotactic radiosurgery.
