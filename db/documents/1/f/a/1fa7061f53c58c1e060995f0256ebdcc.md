Visual acuity testing can have a large clinical impact. Vision loss may be a feature of ocular diseases or a clue to the diagnosis of a systemic disease or disease of other systems, including the central nervous system.

Visual acuity should be used in conjunction with other ophthalmologic tests such as pupillary examination, intraocular pressure measurement, visual field testing, refraction, slit-lamp examination, and the examination of the retina. The best-corrected visual acuity in healthy eyes may show variation with age.

When evaluating visual acuity in preverbal children, techniques other than vision charts are used. These include:

- Optokinetic nystagmus testing in infants involves passing a series of black and white stripes in front of the infant to elicit nystagmus.

- A preferential looking test can be used to evaluate visual acuity in infants. When an infant is presented with two visual stimuli, one striped and the other plain, the infant with normal visual acuity looks at the striped pattern for a greater amount of time. This is the basis of the Cardiff acuity test and Teller Acuity Cards II testing.

- Visual evoked response/potential (VER/VEP) testing evaluates the EEG response recorded from the occipital lobe in response to visual stimuli. A sweep-VEP is performed by showing the preverbal child a pattern of grids or bars. When the stripes are prominent enough for the child to see (discriminate), a response is noted. For smaller stripes, no impulse is generated.

Conversion of logMAR to Snellen equivalents is noted below.
