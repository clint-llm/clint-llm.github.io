The exact pathogenesis of malakoplakia is poorly understood. It is thought to be due to an acquired bactericidal defect in macrophages. Beta-glucuronidase and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) are required for normal microtubular function and phagolysosomal activity. Diminished release of beta-glucuronidase and decreased levels of cGMP have been demonstrated in patients with malakoplakia. This is believed to lead to decreased clearance of pathogenic organisms due to the persistence of phagolysosomes. The pathognomonic Michaelis-Gutman bodies (calcified intracytoplasmic inclusions) are thought to represent the phagolysosomes that have not been exocytosed.

The disease process is typically associated with acquired immunosuppression and has been described in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), organ transplants, malignancy, diabetes mellitus, connective tissue diseases, hepatitis C, and sarcoidosis.

Malakoplakia is typically caused by gram-negative rods. The most common causative species of bacteria is Escherichia coli, but many other bacterial organisms have been implicated, including Klebsiella, Proteus, Corynebacterium, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Aerobacter, Rhodococcus, Mycobacterium, Salmonella, and Burkholderia species.
