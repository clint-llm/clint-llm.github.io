The normal spleen is a versatile organ responsible for a variety of functions including filtering blood and producing immunity. Each function is carried out by specialized tissues in the spleen called red pulp and white pulp. Red pulp is made of connective tissue helping to form cords and sinuses containing white blood cells (WBCs). The sinuses create empty spaces which allow blood to flow through and be exposed to WBCs. This filtration helps to remove old and damaged red blood cells and destroy foreign microbes such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi. The white pulp, on the other hand, is more intricately divided than the red pulp. The white pulp consists of three areas including the periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths, lymph follicles, and marginal zone. The periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths are filled with T lymphocytes and surround the arteriole blood supply. The lymph follicles, on the other hand, are filled with B lymphocytes and are located between the periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths and the marginal zone. The marginal zone is filled with antigen-presenting cells. The white pulp as a whole is responsible for the production and maturation of WBCs.
