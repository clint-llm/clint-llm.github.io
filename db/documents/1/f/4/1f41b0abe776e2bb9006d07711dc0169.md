The antidote for beta-blocker overdose is glucagon. It is especially useful in beta-blocker-induced cardiotoxicity. The second line of treatment is cardiac pacing if glucagon fails, and this may include transcutaneous pacing or transvenous pacing.

Potential acute toxicity can be mitigated by using extended-release formulations as a preventative strategy, which will delay peak toxicity.
