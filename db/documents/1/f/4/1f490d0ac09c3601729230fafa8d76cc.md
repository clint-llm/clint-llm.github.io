The assessment and management of hearing loss in children involve a multidisciplinary approach. Healthcare providers should work together as part of a coordinated team to ensure the rapid diagnosis and initiation of appropriate interventions. Communication between specialists is crucial to ensure that appropriate care is being provided to each patient and patients do not become lost to follow-up. Without a patient-centered team approach, efforts to improveÂ the developmental potential for patients with hearing loss will falter.
