Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania (CPH) mimics other chronic headaches, it is essential to differentiate as treatment modalities are different for different headaches. Following differentials should be considered when assessing a patient of CPH:

- Trigeminal neuralgia involves paroxysms of pain in the trigeminal distribution; however, it does not have the associated autonomic features seen in chronic paroxysmal hemicrania.

- Temporal arteritis manifests as a temporally predominant headache with tenderness to palpation, monocular visual changes, and laboratory workup classically shows an elevated sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein.

- Trigeminal autonomic cephalgias, including CPH, are characterized by headache associated with cranial autonomic features

- Cluster headache differs from CPH in its frequency of every 1 to 8 days and response to sumatriptan and high flow oxygen and lack of response to indomethacin.
- Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection (SUNCT) also presents with unilateral headache and associated autonomic features, although attacks occur more frequently than CPH, withÂ shorter duration and response to lidocaine infusion and lack of response to indomethacin.
