Different environmental, infectious, and genetic factors have been identified, which predispose to lymphoma.

**Occupational exposure:**herbicides, pesticides

**Infectious organisms:**These includeHelicobacter pylori (MALT lymphoma), Borrelia burgdorferi, Chlamydia psittaci, Campylobacter jejuni, human T- cell lymphotropic virus (adult T- cell leukemia/lymphoma), hepatitis C ( lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma), human herpesvirus 8 (primary effusion lymphoma and Castleman disease). Chronic stimulation of lymphoid tissue also increases the risk of lymphoma development. Persistent infection with viruses like Epstein Barr virus and cytomegalovirus also predisposes to the development of lymphoma.

**Immunodeficiency:**HIV infection, transplant recipients, and those with genetic immunodeficiency disorders (severe combined immunodeficiency and common variable immunodeficiency).

**Drugs:**Tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors are associated in particular with T- cell lymphoma. Chronic immunosuppression in post-transplant patients (both solid organ transplant and bone marrow transplant recipients) increases the risk of lymphoma.

**Autoimmune diseases:**Inflammatory bowel disease (enteropathy associated lymphoma), rheumatoid arthritis and, Sjögren’s syndrome (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma)

**Geographic location:**Extranodal NK/T- cell lymphoma incidence is high in Southern Asia and some parts of Latin America.
