Management of symptomatic patients with congestive heart failure is with digoxin, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers and afterload reducing agents. Some patients undergo cardiac transplantation. Cardiac rhythm abnormalities are managed with standard protocol, while some patients may benefit from an implanted cardiac defibrillator for severe ventricular tachyarrhythmias to prevent sudden death.

Hypertrabeculation predisposed patients with reduced left the ventricular function are at risk for clot formation, which further contributes to cerebrovascular events, which certainly adds to comorbidity in patients with LVNC. It is recommended to put these patients on oral anticoagulation once the diagnosis of LV non-compaction is confirmed.
