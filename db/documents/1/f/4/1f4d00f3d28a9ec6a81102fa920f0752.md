**Risk Factors**

- Cognitive Neurologic impairment: This can be due to stroke, seizure, intoxication, developmental delay, or any other cognitive impairment

- Focal Neurologic impairment: This is related to aÂ history of stroke, cranial nerve injury, and pharyngeal muscle injury.

- Pulmonary disease: This includes patients who require mechanical ventilation for any reason, patients with a poor cough, or poor forced expiratory volume.

- Supraglottic disease: This includes patients with anatomic irregularities in the oropharynx, poor dental hygiene, or disease states which cause esophageal dysmotility and impaired swallowing.

- Other causes: Position changes can lead to aspiration even in healthy patients. Fifty percent of healthy individuals have silent aspiration during sleep identified by radio markers. Frequent, high-volume vomiting is another potential risk factor. Also, proton pump inhibition which changes the gastric pH, and subsequently the gastric flora, allowing overgrowth of potentially harmful microorganisms.

- Mechanical. When patients have an NG tube, tracheostomy, upper endoscopy, bronchoscopy, or a gastrostomy feeding tube, they are at a risk for aspiration.
