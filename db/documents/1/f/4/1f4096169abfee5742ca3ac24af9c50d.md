Colestipol is an FDA-approved antihyperlipidemic drug used for the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia. It is used as adjunctive therapy to dietary modifications and exercise. Daily doses of 4 to 16 grams are associated with a 12 to 24% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. It may also reduce the risk of coronary artery disease. Colestipol is also used off-label to treat cholestatic pruritus and irritable bowel syndrome. This activity reviews the indications, mechanism of action, adverse event profile, toxicity, dosing, pharmacodynamics, and monitoring of colestipol pertinent for interprofessional team members involved in managing primary hypercholesterolemia and associated conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of colestipol.
- Outline the approved and potential indications of colestipol.
- Identify the most common adverse events associated with colestipol therapy.
- Summarize the significance of interprofessional team strategies in improving treatment outcomes for patients undergoing treatment with colestipol.
