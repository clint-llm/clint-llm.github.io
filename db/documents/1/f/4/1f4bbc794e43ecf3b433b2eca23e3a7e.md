The heart has an electrical system that allows it to contract in a rhythm. A vital aspect of this electrical system is depolarization and repolarization. The focus of this activity is on the QT interval. It is measured from the Q wave until the T wave, and the QT interval clinically represents the repolarization of the ventricles. Many commonly used medications exhibit QT-prolonging effects. However, the degree of QT prolongation is not severe enough to warrant caution in healthy patients. This activity outlines the mechanism of action, significant adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of QT-prolonging medications, so the interprofessional team can direct patient therapy in treating conditions where patients are using these agents, in particular when they have multiple such agents.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the possible mechanisms by which drugs might prolong the QT interval.
- Summarize the at-risk patient populations for QT-prolonging medications.
- Review the necessary monitoring when patients are using medications that can cause QT prolongation.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance and monitor the delivery of care for patients who are using medications that can prolong the QT interval.
