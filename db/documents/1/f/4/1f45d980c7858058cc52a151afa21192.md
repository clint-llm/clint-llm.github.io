It is essential to note that sulindac toxicity is rare; few cases are reported in the literature. It is also important to note that though sulindac is an NSAID, the toxicity does not present similarly to salicylate (aspirin) toxicity with metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, and tinnitus. Cases in the literature have demonstrated hepatic and renal toxicity associated with sulindac overdose; a case of granulocytosis has also been shown secondary to sulindac toxicity. One of the cases with hepatorenal toxicity further resulted in ischemic skin changes and ulceration.

Since there have been exceedingly few cases of sulindac toxicity reported, many of the implications of overdose have not had a thorough investigation. Other research has demonstrated the utility of activated charcoal in the acute treatment of sulindac toxicity. Charcoal can help minimize absorption and some of the later sequelae associated with the drug's toxicity. However, other studies have demonstrated that once the drug has been in the system, proper treatment protocol involves supportive care, which includes aggressive hydration, fluid replacement, and hemodialysis in some instances.
