Conjunctivitis is easily treatable and usually benign and self-limiting. Symptom duration varies depending on the type. Viral conjunctivitis typically increases in severity until day 4 or 5 and resolves within the following 1 to 2 weeks for a total duration of 2 to 3 weeks. Bacterial conjunctivitis tends to last 7 to 10 days but can be shortened by early antibiotic administration within the first six days of onset.

Mortality in the cases of bacterial conjunctivitis is due to the failure to recognize and promptly treat the underlying disease. Meningitis and sepsis caused by N gonorrhoeae can be life-threatening.
