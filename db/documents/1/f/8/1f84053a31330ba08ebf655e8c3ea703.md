The oculomotor nerve controls several muscles:

- **Levator palpebrae superioris**- raises the upper eyelid

- **Superior rectus muscle**- rotates the eyeball backward, "looking up"

- **Medial rectus muscle**- adducts the eye, "looking towards your nose"

- **Inferior rectus muscle**- rotates the eyeball forwards, "looking down"

- **Inferior oblique muscle**- rotates the eyeball backward when the eye is adducted

- **Ciliary muscle**- controls lens shape to focus on up-close objects

- **Sphincter pupillae**- constricts the pupil

Control of other eye muscles is by the trochlear (CN IV) and abducens (CN VI) nerves.

The trochlear nerve (4th cranial nerve) controls:

- **Superior oblique muscle**- rotates the eyeball forward when the eye is adducted

The abducens nerve (6th cranial nerve) controls:

- **Lateral rectus muscle**- abducts the eye, "looking towards your ear on the same side"
