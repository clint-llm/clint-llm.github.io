Vaccine-related anaphylactic reactions are uncommon; however, anaphylaxis to a known ingredient of any vaccine is an absolute contraindication to immunization.Saccharomyces cerevisiae (brewer’s yeast).

Contraindications also include persons who have had hypersensitivity reactions to a previous dose of 9vHPV or 4vHPV (quadrivalent vaccine).

The safety of 9vHPV has not been a topic of study in pregnant human subjects; thus, 9vHPV is not currently recommended in pregnancy. A 2018 animal study assessed the general, reproductive, and developmental toxicity of 9vHPV in Sprague-Dawley rats. The study followed a 3-month repeat-dose toxicity study on rats reporting no effects on the reproductive ability of rats, no effects on offspring development, no vaccine-related fetal abnormalities, and no effect on male rat fertility.

These results add to the available data that 9vHPV does not increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in rats; however, more studies need to evaluate the safety profile in pregnant human subjects. Currently, standard protocol dictates that if a woman is found to be pregnant, the vaccination series should be halted and resumed after pregnancy.
