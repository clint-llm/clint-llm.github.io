If the patient does not trigger a breath, only the scheduled mandatory breaths will be delivered. Perceived benefits of SIMV include improved patient comfort on the ventilator, reduced work of breathing, reduction in ventilator dyssynchrony, and ease of ventilator weaning. Clinical trials evaluating some of these benefits have not overwhelmingly supported these benefits. SIMV, and specifically SIMV-PS, continues to be a commonly used ventilator mode in the many US intensive care units and especially in surgical ICUs. One of the newer modes of mechanical ventilation, airway pressure release ventilation (APRV), is a variant of SIMV-PS. In APRV, the inspiratory time is longer than the expiratory time, providing an inverse I to E ratio to improve oxygenation.

SIMV was a popular method of mechanical ventilation when it was initially invented. Newer studies demonstrate that it may not be the most effective mode of ventilation. A study of preterm infants shows that SIMV has significantly worse mean airway pressure, duration of time from the onset of weaning to extubation, duration of nasal continuous positive airway pressure support after extubation, and an extubation failure rate when compared to pressure support ventilation with volume guarantee.
