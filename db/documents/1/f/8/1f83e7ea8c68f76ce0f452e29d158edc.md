Ribosomes and fragments of ribosomal RNA/ribonuclear proteins can form aggregates in circulating reticulocytes and erythrocytes as a consequence of disease. These aggregates precipitate in the cytoplasm similar to other erythrocyte inclusionsÂ like Pappenheimer bodies and Howell-Jolly bodies, but the composition of basophilic stippling is distinctive. Further discussion of the functional, histochemical, and pathologic implications of basophilic stippling follows in subsequent sections.
