BS frequently poses a diagnostic dilemma because of the rarity of the condition, and the wide differential diagnosis. While the ophthalmologist is the main professional involved in the diagnosis and treatment of these patients, it is important to manage these cases with an interprofessional team. Other specialties, such as primary care, rheumatology, and dermatology, are important to rule out systemic associations of this syndrome. Radiologists may also help if neuroimaging is performed during the diagnostic evaluation, and pathologists are crucial if skin biopsy is done. Nurses are also an important member of the team, as they can help to assist with patient and family education about the disease.
