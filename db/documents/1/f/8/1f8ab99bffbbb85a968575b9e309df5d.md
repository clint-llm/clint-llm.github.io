Dermatofibromas are benign lesions with excellent prognosis. Some lesions even undergo spontaneous regression, which may lead to hypopigmented skin. Most dermatofibromas will remain static for years. With thorough excision, these lesionsÂ rarely recur, and only the most aggressive varieties show local recurrence in approximately 20% of patients. These lesions rarely metastasize.
