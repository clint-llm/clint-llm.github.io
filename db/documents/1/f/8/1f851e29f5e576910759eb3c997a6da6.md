Pericardial calcification is an anatomical finding with significance in the presence of constrictive physiology. This is why imaging for the same is two-pronged, involving the identification of calcification in the pericardium and hemodynamic consequences of the same.

CT provides excellent anatomic details of the heart and the pericardium. The normal pericardial thickness on the CT scan should be less than 2 mm.

To evaluate the functional significance of pericardial calcification, two-dimensional (2-D) echocardiography and tissue Doppler imaging are probably the essential tools for diagnosing CP. 2-D echocardiography demonstrates septal motion abnormalities, enhanced interventricular interdependence, and plethoric inferior vena cava. Tissue Doppler of the mitral annulus reveals increased medial early diastolic velocities (e').

While cardiac MRI is not as sensitive as CT in identifying pericardial calcification, it is a useful tool in assessing the extent of edema and scarring, which helps understand the progression of the disease and predict which patients are more likely to develop CP.

In the past, an endomyocardial biopsy was also used to differentiate CP from restrictive cardiomyopathy, although it was found to have a low yield.
