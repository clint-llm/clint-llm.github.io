Ventricular premature complexes (VPCs), or premature ventricular complexes/contractions (PVCs), are ectopic beats that arise from within the ventricles. They are common and can occur in a wide variety of clinical scenarios and a diverse population. They can present in patients both with and without preexisting cardiac disease.

The morphology of VPCs is highly variable, and it depends upon its place of origin, underlying structural disease, or the use of antiarrhythmic drugs. The VPCs usually originate from the ventricle that leads to a prolonged QRS complex duration greater than 120 ms because of the delay in the spread of activation to the contralateral ventricle through non-specialized myocardium. However, in certain instances, a QRS complex of duration less than 120 ms can occur, leading to activation of both ventricles "synchronously" because of electrical stimulus from one of the fascicles through a specific conduction system.

Premature ventricular contractions classify according to coupling interval (early and delayed), QRS duration (wide and narrow), morphology, and complexity. The 12-lead EKG helps to identify the precise location of the origin of VPCs only by the morphology of ectopic beats. Those VPCs that originates in the left ventricle are usually associated with a right bundle branch block (RBBB), and VPCs that arise in the right ventricle show a left bundle branch block (LBBB) pattern.
