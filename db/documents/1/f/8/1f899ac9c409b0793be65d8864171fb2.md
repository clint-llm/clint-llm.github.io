Mesenteric artery thrombosis (MAT) is a condition involving occlusion of the arterial vascular supply of the intestinal system. It is a severe and potentially fatal illness typically of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA),  which provides the primary arterial supply to the small intestine and ascending colon.

This articles will focus on acute arterial occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery. Other mesenteric vascular entities including chronic intestinal ischemia, mesenteric veno-occlusive disease, SMA syndrome, etc., are reviewed separately.
