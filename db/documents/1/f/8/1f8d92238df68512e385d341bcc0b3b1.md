Clinicians can use a range of methods and efficacies to prepare the bowel for colonoscopy. Colonoscopy is currently the gold standard for imaging the mucosa of the colon to identify any concerning lesions for excision or biopsy. Reviews have shown that rates of incomplete colonoscopies, defined as the inability to achieve cecal intubation and mucosal visualization effectively, have ranged between 10% to 20%.

Many studies have identified risk factors for poor bowel preparation. These risk factors include previous poor bowel preparation, non-English speaking, Medicaid insurance, single, inpatient status, polypharmacy, suffering from obesity, advanced age, male gender, and comorbidities such as diabetes, stroke, dementia, and Parkinson disease.
