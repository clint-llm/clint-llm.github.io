Based on autopsy studies, the frequency of these aneurysms varies from 0.5% to 3%. The incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysms increases after age 60 and peaks in the seventh and eighth decades of life. White men have the highest risk of developing abdominal aortic aneurysms. They are uncommon in Asian, African American, and Hispanic individuals.

With the increased use of ultrasound, diagnosing abdominal aortic aneurysms is quite common. They tend to be more common in smokers and elderly white males. Although autopsy studies may under-represent the incidence of AAA, one study from Malmo, Sweden, found a prevalence of 4.3% in men and 2.1% in women detected on ultrasound.
