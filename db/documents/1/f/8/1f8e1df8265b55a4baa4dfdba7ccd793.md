Anticonvulsants, or antiepileptics, are an ever-growing class of medications that act through multiple different mechanisms to control seizures. Antiepileptic toxicity commonly presents with a triad of symptoms, which include central nervous system depression, ataxia, and nystagmus. Certain antiepileptic agents are associated with more specific toxicities, including seizures. This activity examines when anticonvulsant toxicity should be considered on differential diagnosis and how to properly evaluate it. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mode of toxicity of anti-convulsants.
- Describe the presentation of patients with anticonvulsant toxicity.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for anticonvulsant toxicity.
- Explain the modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by anticonvulsant toxicity.
