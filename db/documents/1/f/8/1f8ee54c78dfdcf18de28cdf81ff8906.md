While it is unknown what explicitly causes histrionic personality disorder, it is likely a disorder that is multifactorial in its origin. Histrionic personality disorder probably develops as a conglomeration of both learned and inherited factors.

Parenting styles may also influence the likelihood of developing a histrionic personality disorder. Parenting which lacks boundaries is over-indulgent or inconsistent may predispose children to develop histrionic personality disorder.
