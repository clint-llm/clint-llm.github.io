As the population ages, physicians should pay careful attention to their elderly patient panel. Avoidance of polypharmacy, assessment of falls, frailty, mood, and function are some of the key topics to address at each clinic visit. A comprehensive geriatrics assessment can be broken down into multiple visits to account for time constraints.

Early detection of cognitive impairment opens the opportunity to initiate investigation and interventions to prevent progression to dementia. A holistic overview of the patientâ€™s care and treatment goals will prevent unnecessary medical interventions. Conservative measures such as restricted diets and screening procedures with frequent blood draws can often precipitate behavioral disturbances in the elderly population and are inappropriate for patients with advanced dementia.

Frequent counseling, access to community resources, and social support groups must be offered to the patient and the caregiver.
