Unfortunately, the diagnosis is often delayed since symptoms may be non-specific, intermittent or investigations fail to identify the cause of the obstruction due to the “tumbling phenomenon” as the stone tumbles through the variable portions of the GI tract. Patients typically present 4 to 8 days after symptoms start. The signs and symptoms are usually non-specific, including crampy, intermittent abdominal pain, variable abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, and constipation intermittently as the stone travels through the GI tract. The degree of obstruction will vary based on the location of the gallstone, and occasionally the gallstone passes through the rectum without notice. The physical examination may be non-specific, but a provider may appreciate abdominal distension, abdominal tenderness, high-pitched bowel sounds, and obstructive jaundice. Importantly, the intensity of the pain often does not correlate with the underlying anatomic alteration.
