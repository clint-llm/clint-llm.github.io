The outcomes after head trauma depend on many factors. The initial GCS score does provide some information on the outcome; the motor score is most predictive of outcome. Patients with a GCS of less than 8 at presentation have high mortality. Advanced age, comorbidity, respiratory distress, and a comatose state are also associated with poor outcomes.
