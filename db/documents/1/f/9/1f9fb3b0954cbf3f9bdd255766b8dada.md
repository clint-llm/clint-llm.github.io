- The side effect most commonly encountered with ACE inhibitors is cough. The cough is characteristically non-productive and stops with the discontinuation of the drug.

- Other adverse effects of enalapril are hypotension, hyperkalemia, angioedema, cholestatic jaundice, and hypersensitivity reaction.

- Vasodilation caused by enalapril to reduce the afterload of the heart and decrease the total peripheral resistance is also responsible for hypotension. At first, the patient may only complain of a feeling of light-headedness on standing (orthostatic hypotension), which may later progress to fainting spells.

- Aldosterone, the end product of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS), causes sodium and water absorption and potassium ions' excretion. The use of enalapril can reduce potassium excretion from the kidney, leading to the buildup of potassium in the blood: a condition known as hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia, if only mild or moderate, may be asymptomatic. Even chronic hyperkalemia can be completely asymptomatic with a normal ECG pattern. The following ECG changes suggest hyperkalemia: small or absent P wave, prolonged PR interval, augmented R wave, wide QRS complex, and peaked T waves.

- Angioedema may rarely occur with the use of ACE inhibitors. The incidence of angioedema is higher in African-American individuals.

- On rare occasions, ACE inhibitors can affect the hepatobiliary system causing cholestatic jaundice and fulminant hepatic necrosis.
