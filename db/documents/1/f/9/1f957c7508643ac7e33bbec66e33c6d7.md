The American Academy of Pediatrics published a clinical practice guideline in 2016 recommending replacing the term apparent life-threatening event (ALTE) with a new term named brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE)

The definition of a brief resolved unexplained event is an observed event occurring in an infant younger than one year of age where the observer reports a sudden, brief, yet resolved episode of one or more of the following:

- Cyanosis or pallor

- Absent, decreased, or irregular breathing

- Marked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)

- Altered level of responsiveness.

The diagnosis of brief resolved unexplained event can only be made when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after an appropriate history and physical examination.

A review of previous apparent life-threatening event literature reveals that a small subset of infants with a diagnosis compatible with a brief resolved unexplained event may have a serious underlying disease or are prone to recurrent episodes.

High-risk infants are those younger than two months of age, those with a history of prematurity (higher in less than 32 weeks gestation), and those with more than one event. Low-risk infants were those that are:

- Age older than 60 days

- Gestational age 32 weeks or older

- Postconceptional age greater than or equal to 45 weeks

- The first brief resolved unexplained event (no previous brief resolved unexplained event ever and not occurring in clusters)

- The event lasts less than one minute

- No CPR is required by the trained medical provider

- No concerning historical features or physical examination findings.

Patients who do not meet the criteria as low risk by default are considered high risk.
