The use of palliative sedation continues to be a controversial topic, given that its use can potentially hasten death. As such, the pros and cons of palliative sedation should be clearly outlined to the patient/family to manage expectations. Excess sedation can theoretically cause an increased risk of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory suppression. However, contrary to this belief, recent studies have demonstrated that palliative sedation can, in fact, be safely administered without any disproportionate increase in the incidence of aspiration pneumonia or respiratory failure.
