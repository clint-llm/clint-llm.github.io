Spontaneous: Spontaneous cerebral artery dissections, both carotid and vertebral, account for about 20% of strokes in young adults. Vertebral artery dissections are less common than carotid dissections, occurring in about 1 in 100000 individuals in population studies. The actual incidence may be higher since many may be asymptomatic. The mean age ranges from 44 to 46 years, and there is no evident racial or gender prevalence. Dissection may be more common in the winter but the reason for season variation is unclear.

Traumatic: Traumatic vertebral artery injury is a relatively rare condition, reported in less than 1% of trauma admissions. However, the incidence is increasing, most likely due to increased awareness and screening for this finding in high-risk patients. Â Vertebral artery injury may be as high as 11% in patients with blunt traumas that meet specific clinical and physical examination criteria. The modified Denver screening criteria are used to identify patients at high risk for cerebral artery injuries. Patients with cervical transverse foramen fractures or facet dislocations have an associated vertebral artery injury in 27.5% of cases.
