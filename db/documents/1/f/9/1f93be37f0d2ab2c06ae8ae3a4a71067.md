Healthcare workers including nurse practitioners who work in the emergency department should be aware that a ruptured AAA can presentÂ in many ways. The most obvious presentation is hypotension with a pulsatile abdominal mass. It is important to consult immediately with a vascular surgeon when there is a suspicion of a rAAA. Sending a such a patient to the radiology suite without monitoring can lead to legal liability.
