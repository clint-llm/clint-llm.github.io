**Indications and Techniques**

Surgical procedures play a very minute role in the management of this disease. Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt or intraventricular catheters can be placed for relieving symptomatic hydrocephalus and delivery of IT chemotherapy, respectively. In rare instances, resection of bulky CNS disease or biopsy of leptomeninges in the previously unknown primary may be done. However, there is no known survival benefit from surgical procedures.

**Adverse Effects**

Adverse effects include infection, shunt displacement, and catheter failure.
