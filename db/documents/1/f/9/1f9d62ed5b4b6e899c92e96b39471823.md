The femoral artery supplies the quadriceps muscle; the descending branch of the lateral femoral circumflex artery specifically nourishes the rectus femoris. The venous drainageÂ is by the femoral vein and its branches.

The lumbar aortic lymph nodes facilitate the lymphatic vessels of the lower limb, including the rectus femoris muscle, and the drainage will flow into the cisterna chyli.
