The LDL cholesterol estimation can proceed with two distinct methods; indirect and direct. The former approach utilizes the Friedewald cholesterol estimation formula. On the other hand, the latter method utilizes homogeneous assays. In unreliable conditions, such as triglyceride >400 mg/dL, the direct methods can be used to supplement the Friedewald calculation, which has shown to able to meet the standard requirements set by National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) for LDL-C testing. When used for non-fasting samples, the direct method was precise and accurate (CV <4% and bias <4%).

Nonetheless, there were several limitations to direct methods. A study of comparison between direct and indirect methods with the reference method of the ultracentrifugation in HIV patients, which hypertriglyceridemia are common, found that no adequate agreement between these two tests with the ultracentrifugation. When TG is more than 400 mg/dL, the direct method tends to overestimate the actual LDL, whereas the indirect method tends to underestimate the actual LDL levels.
