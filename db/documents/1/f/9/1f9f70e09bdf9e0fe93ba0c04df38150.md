Management of Fuchs uveitis syndrome could be improved with early recognition of signs and symptoms. TheÂ eye care specialist, nurse, and technician should always ask the patient if a decrease in visual acuity has occurred or floaters are noted. A thorough history and physical examination should be taken. The eye care team should take note of any significant difference in iris color between the eyes as well as perform a complete eye examination. The prognosis for most patients will be good with proper communication and patient education.
