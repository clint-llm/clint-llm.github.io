Erythema ab igne (EAI) is a cutaneous rash related to chronic long-term heat exposure under the level of heat required for thermal burns.

There are many reports ofÂ exposure to a variety of other electronics; however, the main uniting feature is that they all imply chronic exposure to a heat source, including virtual headsets and space heaters, which has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Patients will often report a history of some external source of contact, which will lead to vasodilation that is reticulated, which corresponds to the venous plexus pattern of the disease process.

Finally, the use of space heaters will often appear on the anterior legs.
