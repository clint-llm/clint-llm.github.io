The anatomy of the abdominal wall is of great importance when evaluating a patient for a hernia. The abdominal wall is formed by several layers of adipose tissue, fascia, and musculature. In the midline, the rectus abdominis muscle runs longitudinally from the pubic symphysis to the sternum and ribs. Laterally there are three layers of muscle that run in oblique patterns to prevent abdominal wall herniation. The external oblique, internal oblique, and transversus abdominus coalesce to form fascial sheaths surrounding the rectus abdominis.

There are weak points in the abdominal wall where the muscle and fascial layers are attenuated. In the inguinal canal, several anatomic boundaries will help delineate which type of hernia is present. Hasselbachâ€™s triangle is bounded by the rectus abdominis medially, the inguinal canal inferior laterally, and the inferior epigastric vessels superiorly. Direct inguinal hernias occur within this triangle. Hernias that occur lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels and along the inguinal ring are classified as indirect inguinal hernias. There is a weakness here due to the thinning of the external and internal oblique to form an aponeurosis. This weakness leaves the transversalis fascia and peritoneum without additional muscular support. Femoral hernias occur inferior to the inguinal canal within the femoral space and medial to the femoral vessels.
