There are 2 broad phases of the throwing motion. These are the arm-cocking phase followed by the acceleration phase. The pathophysiology leading to Little League shoulder is believed to be the significant external rotational torque on the humeral shaft during the final part of the arm-cocking phase, just before the acceleration phase. This torque likely leads to the deformation of the proximal humeral epiphysis cartilage, which eventually leads to proximal humeral epiphysiolysis.

As mentioned above, the distractional force has a lesser role than the rotational force. The distractional force that occurs during the throwing motion results in the rotator cuff muscles causing a force on the proximal humerus to keep the glenohumeral joint intact. The rotator cuff muscles exert a force on the proximal humerus because their insertion site is proximal to the proximal humeral epiphysis.
