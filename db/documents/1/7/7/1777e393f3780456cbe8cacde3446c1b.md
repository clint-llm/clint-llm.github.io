The Six Sigma method is a strategy used in quality management and improvement. Six Sigma is used to identify flaws and reduce errors and discrepancies in production processes.

This methodology has been shown to prevent falls and injuries and decrease adverse medical events such as infection rates.

Six Sigma consists of 2 primary improvement methodologies depending on the use case: Six Sigma DMAIC and Six Sigma DMADV. The term's name is derived from the significant steps in the process, and the last two steps vary depending on which method is used. Each term's name is derived from the important steps in each process, but each is used for a different purpose.

- DMAIC (define, measure, analyze, improve, control) is used to correct/improve an existing process, product, or service.

- DMADV (define, measure, analyze, design, validate) is used to design a new process, product, or service.

Six Sigma methodology, DMAIC, to improve an existing process follows the five basic steps or phases of Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control to reduce errors, inefficiencies, and process variability.

In the define phase, problems and issues within the process are outlined from both the business and client perspectives. This may include launching a team, gathering information, planning the project, and setting goals. For example, a project may define a medical error the organization wants to address. During the measure phase, further narrowing of the project focus occurs, and baseline data are collected. In the analyze phase, data are examined to help identify the root cause of an issue and help remove inefficiencies.

The improve phase establishes ways to improve the process and correct deficits. The improve phase may include solution brainstorming, evaluation, and optimization, as well as an implementation plan. Finally, the control phase provides monitoring and maintenance of the solution. Furthermore, the control phase often involves validating the project benefitsÂ and improving error rates.

Six Sigma relates to the Greek letter Sigma, used to denote a standard deviation from the mean.

A control chart may show the change in outcomes over a period, while ANOVA can show the difference in outcomes between groups.
