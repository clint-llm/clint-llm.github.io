Identifying and managing mediastinal germ cell tumors requires an interprofessional team of primary care clinicians, pulmonologists, radiologists, medical/surgical oncologists, thoracic surgeons, and oncology-specialized nurses and pharmacists. Mediastinal gem cell tumors have high malignant potential. Once an anterior mediastinal mass has been identified, the primary care clinician should begin screening with tumor markers. Referral to a pulmonologist is warranted if the mass affects pulmonary structures or creates respiratory complications. Discussion with radiologists is key to identifying vital structures that may be affected or any other sites of metastasis. After a diagnosis is made, medical oncologists can develop treatment plans that may involve chemotherapy and surgical intervention. All clinicians must maintain accurate and updated patient records so everyone involved in the case has the most up-to-date patient data from which to make treatment decisions.

Nursing plays a crucial role in the interprofessional management of these patients. They will assist with patient assessment and during surgery, counsel patients, and often serve as the liaison point for the various specialties involved in the case. Pharmacists will assist in chemotherapy regimen selection, verify dosing and perform medication reconciliation, alerting the care team of any discrepancies or concerns they may encounter. Prompt consultation and close communication between the interprofessional team are necessary to achieve the best patient outcomes. [Level 2]
