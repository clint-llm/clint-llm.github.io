Glycopyrrolate is a frequently prescribed agent by the nurse practitioner, primary care provider, anesthesiologist, and internist. However, all healthcare workers who prescribe this agent should be aware of its potential adverse effects. Glycopyrronium may cause hyperthermia and heat stroke in hot environments as it reduces the body's ability to sweat. Clinicians should monitor liver function tests in patients with hepatic impairment. Nursing staff should monitor and inform the prescriber if urinary retention occurs and existing renal impairment worsens. The use of glycopyrrolate in the general population may increase the risk of confusion, hallucinations, and other anticholinergic effects.
