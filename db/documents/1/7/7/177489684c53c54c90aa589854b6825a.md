Neurologic signs and symptoms can arise from 2 mechanisms:

- Direct compression of neurological structures against the surrounding foramen magnum and spinal canal

- Syringomyelia or syringobulbia development

- 
              
- The obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow eventually results in syrinx development. 
              
              
- Fluid-filled cavities (syrinx) develop within the spinal cord or brainstem, resulting in neurologic symptoms as the cavity expands.

In patients with the Chiari I malformation, the bones of the skull base often are underdeveloped, which results in a reduced volume of the posterior fossa, the volume of which is inadequate to contain the entire cerebellum; thus, cerebellar tonsils are displaced through the foramen magnum.

The posterior fossa in Chiari type II malformation is even smaller than in Chiari I malformation. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cisterns are poorly developed due to lack of fourth ventricular expansion as a consequence of in-utero derivation of CSF circulation to the neural tube defect, all of which results in hindbrain structures downward herniating with subsequent compression of these structures against the foramen magnum.

In both type I and II, there is CSF-flow obstruction by the foramen magnum crowding, and consequently, hydrocephalus and/or syringomyelia formation are possible over time.
