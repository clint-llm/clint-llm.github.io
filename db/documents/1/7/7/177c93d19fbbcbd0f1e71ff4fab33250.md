Stimulants have been abused for hundreds, if not thousands, of years because they can increase a person's ability to maintain focus and work for longer hours with less fatigue. The current use is very limited in the medical field, most notably in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and its recreational use is mostly seen in those seeking to get high or prolong their awake period.

The use and abuse of stimulants lead to frequent visits to the Emergency Department for evaluation of possible complications due to ingestion or co-ingestion. These complications cover the entire range of body systems, most notably central nervous system to cardiovascular. They can be acute or chronic in nature, but all lead to an increase in morbidity and mortality. The basic treatment for sympathomimetic toxicity is to stop the offending agent and treat the symptoms, mostly with benzodiazepines, cooling measures, and underlying acute disease.
