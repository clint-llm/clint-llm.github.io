Lead encephalopathy is a rare complication of lead intoxication, which has greatly decreased in incidence over recent years due to public health efforts to reduce the amount of lead in the environment. Currently, the CDC estimates that about 535,000 children ages 1to 5 years and approximately 1.2 million working adults in the U.S have whole blood lead levels in excess of 25 microgram/dL.

Common exposure sources in children are inhalation, ingestion, or absorption of lead paint dust, and exposure to lead in imported toys, imported spices, or imported naturopathic remedies. Children may also be exposed to lead from their parentsâ€™ occupation. Occupational exposures in adults may be encountered in construction, smelting, firearm, battery, and automotive industries.
