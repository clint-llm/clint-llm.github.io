It is important to reassure parents about the benign nature of papular acrodermatitis of childhood to avoid unnecessary invasive testing or treatments. Further laboratory work-up is only indicated in high-risk patients, including those who are immunocompromised or from hepatitis B endemic areas. Additional testing is also suggested in those with extracutaneous symptoms suggestive of an underlying viral etiology such as the Epstein-Barr virus.

It is not recommended to exclude children from daycare, school, or social activities.
