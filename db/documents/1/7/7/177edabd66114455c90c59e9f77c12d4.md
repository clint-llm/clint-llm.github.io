Care of the patient with mediastinal trauma often begins in the trauma bay. First responders can provide crucial information regarding the mechanism of injury that may help the clinician discern whether a mediastinal injury may exist. Trauma to the anterior chest may raise the suspicion of a possible mediastinal injury. As with all trauma patients, the evaluation must be guided with ATLS principles. The primary survey should be conducted to identify life-threatening injuries immediately. For patients with mediastinal injury, the primary survey should identify the presence of hypovolemic shock from bleeding or obstructive shock from cardiac tamponade. Vital sign changes present in hemorrhagic shock include a narrow pulse pressure, hypotension, and tachycardia. Pericardial tamponade can present with becks triad which includes hypotension, muffled heart sounds, and distended jugular veins. After the primary survey is completed, the secondary survey should be conducted by performing a head-to-toe exam to identify potential injuries.
