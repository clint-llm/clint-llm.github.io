The differential diagnosis for suspected arthropod bites and stings presenting with localized dermatological manifestations is extensive and includes contact dermatitis, drug eruption, mastocytosis, bullous diseases, dermatitis herpetiformis, tinea, eczema, vasculitis, pityriasis, erythema multiforme, viral exanthem, cellulitis, abscess, impetigo, folliculitis, erysipelas, necrotizing fasciitis, and many others.

In patients presenting with a necrotic ulcer following suspected brown recluse envenomation, clinicians should also consider diagnoses such as pyoderma gangrenosum, staphylococcus or streptococcus skin infection, diabetic ulcers, necrotizing fasciitis, fungal infections, leishmaniasis, and sporotrichosis.

The possibility of a black widow spider envenomation should be a consideration in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with findings of an acute abdomen.
