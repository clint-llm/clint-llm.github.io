Bile is a physiological aqueous solution produced and secreted by the liver. It consists mainly of bile salts, phospholipids, cholesterol, conjugated bilirubin, electrolytes, and water

**Formation**

**Bile**

Bile is produced by hepatocytes and it is then modified by the cholangiocytes lining the bile ducts. The production and secretion of bile require active transport systems within hepatocytes and cholangiocytes in addition to a structurally and functionally intact biliary tree. Initially, hepatocytes produce bile by secreting conjugated bilirubin, bile salts, cholesterol, phospholipids, proteins, ions, and water into their canaliculi (thin tubules between adjacent hepatocytes that eventually join to form bile ducts)

Canaliculi empty bile into ductules or cholangioles or canals of Hering. The ductules connect with interlobular bile ducts, which are accompanied by branches of the portal vein and hepatic artery forming portal triads. Bile is subsequently modified by ductular epithelial cells as it passes through the biliary tree. These cells, known as cholangiocytes, dilute, and alkalinize the bile through hormone-regulated absorptive and secretory processes. The cholangiocytes have receptors that modulate the bicarbonate-rich ductular bile flow, which is regulated by hormones. These receptors include receptors for secretin, somatostatin, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and chloride-bicarbonate exchanger. For example, when secretin stimulates receptors in the cholangiocyte, a cascade is initiated, which activates the CFTR chloride channel and allows the exchange of bicarbonate for chloride. In contrast, somatostatin inhibits the cAMP synthesis within the cholangiocytes, causing the opposite effect. While bombesin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, acetylcholine, and secretin enhance bile flow, somatostatin, gastrin, insulin, and endothelin inhibit the flow

**Bile Acids**

Cholesterol catabolism by hepatocytes results in the synthesis of the two major primary bile acids, cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid. This process involves multiple steps, with cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase acting as the rate-limiting enzyme. Primary bile acids undergo dehydroxylation by bacteria in the small intestine, forming the secondary bile acids deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid, respectively. Both primary and secondary bile acids are conjugated by the liver with an amino acid, either glycine or taurine. Conjugated bile acids are known as bile salts. Bile salts inhibit cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, decreasing the synthesis of bile acids. Despite the increased water solubility of bile salts, they are amphipathic molecules overall
