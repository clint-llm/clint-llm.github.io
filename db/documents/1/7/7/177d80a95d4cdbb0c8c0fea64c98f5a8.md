**Reproductive Cycle**

In the female reproductive cycle, there are two concurrent cycles, the ovarian cycle, and the uterine (menstrual) cycle. The ovarian cycle consists of a series of events that occur during and following oocyte maturation. The uterine cycle consists of a series of changes within the endometrium in preparation for the arrival of a fertilized ovum that will develop within the endometrium until birth.

The reproductive cycle can subdivide into the menstrual phase, preovulatory phase, ovulation, and postovulatory phase. The function of the uterus in each of these phases follows:

In the menstrual phase, a decline in estrogen and progesterone levels stimulates the release of prostaglandins, which results in vasoconstriction of arterioles within the uterus. The vasoconstriction eventually leads to hypoperfusion of these cells, which results in cell death. This process initiates the sloughing off of blood, fluid, and epithelial cells from the endometrial walls into the cervix and out through the vagina.

In the preovulatory phase, estrogen is released into the blood, which repairs the endometrium. The endometrium undergoes other changes and doubles in thickness.

During ovulation, the follicle ruptures and releases an oocyte that enters the uterine tube.

In the postovulatory phase, progesterone and estrogen stimulate further growth of endometrial glands and thickening of the endometrium in preparation for the implantation of a fertilized ovum. If fertilization does not occur, progesterone end estrogen levels decline, and the menstruation stage occurs.

If the egg becomes fertilized, the zygote is propelled down the fallopian tubes into the uterus. The zygote cells divide rapidly during this descent. The cells of the zygote continue to divide until it becomes a blastocyst. This blastocyst implants by invading the wall of the endometrium.

**Pregnancy**

When the blastocyst successfully implants into the endometrial lining, it develops over many weeks into an embryo and then a fetus. During the development of an embryo into a fetus, changes occur within the endometrium that leads to placental formation. The placenta provides a crossing point between the developing fetus and maternal circulation. In pregnancy, the uterus hypertrophies to accommodate the growing fetus. It typically reaches the height of the umbilicus at 20 weeks and the xiphoid process at 38 weeks.

**Labor**

The uterus undergoes many changes during labor due to the release of various hormones. Nearing the seventh month of pregnancy, progesterone levels begin to decline while estrogen levels steadily rise. The increasing ratio of estrogen to progesterone causes the myometrium to become more sensitive to stimuli that promote contractions. Additionally, fetal cortisol rises in the eighth month of pregnancy, which further reduces progesterone’s effects.

As true labor approaches, oxytocin and prostaglandins both play a role in further stimulating myometrial contractions and increasing contractile strength. The fetus causes the myometrium and cervix to stretch, which also stimulates uterine contractions.

During true labor, the release of oxytocin and prostaglandins stimulate a positive feedback loop which continues to increase uterine contractile strength. These uterine contractions dilate and efface the cervix. Again a positive feedback loop begins where the effacement and dilation of the cervix further promote uterine contractions. Contractions become more frequent and longer in duration as labor progresses. The next stage of labor begins when the fetal head enters the birth canal and completes when the infant is born. The myometrium continues to contract after birth, causing the placenta to shear from the back of the uterine wall for delivery through the birth canal.
