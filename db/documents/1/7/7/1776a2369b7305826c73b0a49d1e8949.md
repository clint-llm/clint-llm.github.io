The findings of gram-negative infections are non-specific, not distinguishing them from other infectious diseases on physical examination. A classic example is pneumonia; its symptoms include fever, chest pain, dyspnea, and purulent expectoration; these symptoms may correlate with tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxemia, and auscultatory signs of consolidation. However, these signs are not specific to the disease. Cultures are the only way to determine the organism.
