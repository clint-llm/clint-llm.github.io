The class of drugs most commonly employed for erectile dysfunction is known as PDE5 inhibitors. Phosphodiesterases (PDE) are enzymes that degrade cGMP and cAMP. The isoform present within penile tissues is PDE5, which exclusively degrades cGMP. As levels of cGMP decrease, the intracellular concertation of calcium ions increases, and smooth muscle contraction occurs. Thus the inhibition of PDE5 results in increased levels of cGMP decreased intracellular calcium and smooth muscle relaxation. The activity of a PDE5 inhibitor, such as sildenafil, leads to prolongation of smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. However, they only maintain preexisting levels of cGMP and require sexual stimulation to generate cGMP in penile tissues.
