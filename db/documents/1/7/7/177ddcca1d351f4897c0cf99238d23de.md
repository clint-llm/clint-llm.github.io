The most common cause for thoracic duct leak is surgical, typically after surgeries on the esophagus, lung, or heart.

Most are low output leaks and can be managed conservatively with a low-fat diet, and in symptomatic patients, thoracocentesis or sometimes a chest tube may be needed.

- Chyle leak should be suspected in the post-surgical period when there is a serosanguinous fluid or milky fluid in the drain.

- A triglyceride level >110 mg/dL in the fluid is indicative of a chyle leak.

- CT scan is useful in diagnosing a chyle leak.

- Lymphangiogrpahy and lymphoscintigraphy have a higher sensitivity in diagnosing a chyle leak.
