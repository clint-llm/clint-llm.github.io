Both on-pump and off-pump techniques have been employed with success.

Most surgeons undergo the same general approach for initial exposure, to include median sternotomy. Often, surgeons will attempt to retrace a patientâ€™s previous incisional scar. They will also need to remove sternal wires, sometimes with difficulty due to adhesions and scarring. In contrast to a primary sternotomy, most surgeons will not request for deflation of the lungs, as they anticipate a significantly longer period of time for dissection and exposure.

Minimally-invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) techniques are now being utilized more often. These include axillary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery graft via a small, intercostal thoracotomy, a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending coronary artery graft via a left, lateral thoracotomy, and a gastroepiploic artery to posterior descending artery graft via an inferior, subxiphoid approach.

Surgical access depends on the vessels requiring revascularization. Various techniques are described in the literature, including on and off-pump approach. The incision is usually in the form of a redo midline sternotomy, excluding the previous scar. Some surgeons opt to cut the stainless steel wires and leave them in place to prevent the oscillating saw from traveling deeper. The anesthetist will usually hyperinflate the lungs in an effort to get them to lie between the sternum and the heart during the sternal opening.

Once the sternum is opened, retraction is not attempted until careful dissection of the heart (right ventricle) of the sternum is achieved to release the tension, with extra care taken on the left side to identify the left internal mammary graft if it has been used previously. The dissection is extended upwards until the innominate vein is freed since it might be avulsed during the application of the retractor.

The sternal retractor is applied. Slow retraction with gradual dissection of the heart from the adhesions is performed. The ascending aorta is identified to allow for safe cannulation if an emergency arises. Dissection usually commences from the diaphragmatic surface of the pericardium extending around to free the right atrium to allow cannulation for venous access then finally the apex identifying any grafts in the process.

Once the heart is free of adhesions and cannulation is feasible, heparin is given prior to inserting the arterial and venous cannulae.

Enough space for the aortic cross-clamp should always be thought of to allow safe cardioplegia. A retrograde cardioplegia cannula may be inserted via the right atrium into the coronary sinus to compliment the antegrade root plegia.

Patients are usually cooled down on bypass, and any patent grafts should be isolated and clamped to avoid perfusing the heart with warmer blood, which will wash out and counteract the effect of cardioplegia.

Targets are identified, and coronary artery bypass grafting is performed in routine fashion. In case no space is available in the ascending aorta for more grafts to be anastomosed, sequential and Y-grafts could be used.

Top ends could be done on cross-clamp or on side occluding clamp to avoid extra dosages of cardioplegia if feasible.

Once rewarming commences, and cross-clamp is removed, the clamps on old patent grafts, especially the LIMA, should be removed to avoid ischemic injury to the heart.

Atrial and ventricular pacing wires are usually applied, and weaning off bypass is commenced. As hemostasis is achieved, protamine is administered, and the venous cannula is removed, followed by the arterial one after the establishment of stable hemodynamics.
