**Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)**

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is usually well-tolerated with gastrointestinal disturbances and rashes being the most common side effects. TMP-SMX is known to cause nephrotoxicity, usually, renal tubular acidosis, but it is uncommon. Usually, the increased creatinine after initiation of this antibiotic is due to its effect on the reduction of tubular secretion of creatinine. Other side effects include hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hepatitis. The most severe side effects of TMP-SMX are Steven-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, leukopenia, hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.

**Dapsone**

Dapsone is known to cause hemolytic anemia, especially in patients with G6PD deficiency, lupus-like syndrome, peripheral nephropathy, along with less severe side effects, usually of the GI tract and skin.
