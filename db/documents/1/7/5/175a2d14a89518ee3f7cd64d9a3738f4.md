The etiology of sarcoidosis remains unknown, but evidence has pointed to various infective, non-infective, and genetic factors.

**Infective etiology**– The presence of bacterial DNA fragments in sarcoid granulomas and regional granulomatous response following inoculation of sarcoid material in experimental animals suggests infective etiology.

The similarities in clinical features, epidemiology, immunological, and molecular link between the two diseases, and similar immune response may support the hypothesis.

**Non-infective etiology**– Sarcoidosis with pulmonary manifestation is known to occur as an occupational disease.

**Genetic factor**– Association between sarcoidosis and certain human leukocyte antigen haplotypes support the role of genetic factors. HLA-DRB1*1101 allele is associated with sarcoidosis and has a population-attributable risk of 9% in whites and 16% in blacks.
