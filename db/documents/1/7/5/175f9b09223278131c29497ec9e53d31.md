The incidence of globe injuries is quoted as 3.5 eye injuries per 100,000 persons, with males constituting about 80% of open globe injuries. Injuries in the pediatric population are more often with sharp objects directly penetrating the globe (e.g., writing utensils, scissors, or knives). The cause is often blunt trauma (e.g., motor vehicle collisions, altercations, or work-related injuries involving hammering). In the elderly, globe rupture is most often a result of falling.

A recent analysis from North India gave insights into nonoccupational and occupational. As per the study, nonoccupational trauma constituted 82.3%. There were 23.9% cases of sports-related trauma and 23.6% cases of road traffic accidents. Approximately 89.3% of cases constituted mechanical injuries. The various modes of trauma were wood injury 24.9%, and metallic object 20.9% for open globe injury. The incidence of blunt trauma was three times less than that of sharp objects (56%).

Landen et al., in their analysis, reported an annual incidence of 3.5 per 100000 cases of perforating injuries in the USA. Another study from Australia reported 2.4 and 7.9% per 1000 cases of nonindigenous and indigenous adults with monocular blindness due to blunt trauma.****As per another analysis by Negrel et al., three quarter million patients undergo hospitalization with ocular injuries globally.
