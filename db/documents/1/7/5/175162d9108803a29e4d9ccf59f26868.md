Motor mapping in sedated patients or sensorimotor and language mapping in awake anesthetized patients is utilized in frontal lobe neurosurgery. These techniques help surgeons to determine the discreet anatomy of a patient’s brain in an attempt to decrease the amount of surgical intrusion into areas which may cause dramatic neurologic deficits. However, it should be noted that these motor and language areas lie posterior to the PFC proper.
