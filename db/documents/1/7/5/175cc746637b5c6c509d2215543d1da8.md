Etiology of trauma in pregnancy may be multifactorial. The physics of the growing abdomen result in an imbalance, which increase frequency of maternal falls from standing or from height, such as stairs. Further the clinician must maintain a heightened suspicion for non-accidental causes either self-inflicted or other. Domestic violence increases during pregnancy, placing the mother and the fetus at obvious risk for injury. Domestic violence occurs in 4 to 8% of pregnancies and is associated with 5% risk of fetal death. The normal physiology of the pregnant mother complicates evaluation and management of trauma in pregnancy. The gravid uterus is particularly susceptible to penetrating and blunt force trauma to the abdomen. Motor vehicle accidents account for 50% of all traumatic injuries during pregnancy and 82% of trauma related fetal death. The main reason for this equates to the improper use of seat belts. The lap belt needs to be placed under the dome of the abdomen and across the pelvis to reduce pressure on the uterus during a motor vehicle collision. The shoulder harness should lay across the clavicle and between the breasts.
