Many patients with coccydynia experience relief of symptoms within weeks or months of onset, whether or not they receive medical treatment. The success of conservative treatment has been reported to be 90%.

**Acute Coccydynia**

- Oral or topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be helpful acutely to decrease both pain and inflammation.

- Cushions on the patient's chair can make sitting more comfortable. A cushion with a wedge-shaped cut-out beneath the coccyx can result in the coccyx hovering over the empty area, thus resulting in less coccygeal weight-bearing and less coccygeal pain. Other cushion options include U-shaped cushions and circular (donut) cushions.

- Pelvic floor physical therapy may be particularly helpful for patients who have substantial muscular pain within the adjacent para-coccygeal muscles.

- Modalities: cold or hot compresses may be helpful in some patients. However, be cautious to avoid injury to the skin by causing skin temperatures resulting in either freezing or burning injuries.

- Fluoroscopy-guided steroid injections: These anti-inflammatory injections can be especially helpful in patients with coccydynia that has been present for less than six months.

**Chronic and Refractory Coccydynia**

- Manipulation under anesthesia, with or without injection of local anesthetic and corticosteroid: Manipulation may help relieve ligamentous pain or pain due to muscular spasms. Different manual treatments have been reported in the literature, including levator ani massage, levator ani stretch, and joint mobilization.

- Ganglion impar sympathetic nerve block with local anesthetic (even without corticosteroid) can provide some patients with complete and sustained resolution of symptoms.

- Pelvic floor physical therapy can be helpful for coccydynia, including in patients who have persistent pain despite coccygectomy.

- Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (external using two cutaneous probes or internal using one cutaneous probe and one intrapelvic probe) may be used.

- Spinal cord stimulation may be worth considering for some coccydynia patients.

- Surgical intervention. Coccygectomy involves amputation (removal) of the coccyx. This treatment is usually reserved for the small percentage of patients who fail to get adequate relief from non-surgical care.

- Psychotherapy can be helpful when non-organic etiology is suspected.
