Classic Vohwinkel syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant (AD) fashion. It is caused by a mutation in the gap junction beta 2 (GJB2) gene located on chromosome 13q11-12, which encodes the protein connexin 26.

Loricrin keratoderma, the ichthyosiform variant of Vohwinkel syndrome, is caused by LOR mutations; this is the gene on the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) on chromosome 1q21 that encodes loricrin.
