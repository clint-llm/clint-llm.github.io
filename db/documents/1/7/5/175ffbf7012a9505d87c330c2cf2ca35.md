These implants have several advantages.

- Bypassing the blood-retinal barrier allows higher levels of intraocular drug versus systemic administration.

- Drug delivery is nearer to the target tissue, i.e., the retina and vitreous, thus reducing side effects on other sites in the body.

- It provides longer-lasting drug delivery.

- Ability to deliver drugs that cannot be administered by other routes or when compliance is a significant problem

- Ability to remove the drug immediately in case of development of adverse effects, unlike intravitreal injections

- Protective drugs that are not stable in vivo and would usually require frequent dosages.

- Reduced dosage due to localized delivery, hence the need for systemic administration can be eliminated, or the dose of a systemically given drug can be significantly reduced. This makes the therapy safer due to lesser side effects and more viable for a prolonged period.
