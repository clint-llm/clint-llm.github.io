Because retrosternal chest pain and dysphagia or odynophagia are common symptoms shared by many other diseases, differential diagnosis is usually broad. Usually, medication history is vital information in most cases, which helps in differentiating drug-induced esophagitis from other causes.

- Eosinophilic esophagitis: Eosinophilic infiltration presents in drug-induced esophagitis as well as eosinophilic esophagitis. The two are separated based on the clinical picture and pathological diagnostic criteria.

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy may show lesions such as small erosions or ulcers in the distal or mid esophagus. Twenty-six percent of the cases involve the entire esophagus. Diagnosis requires biopsies and a viral culture of the lesion.

- Infectious esophagitis such as esophageal candidiasis

- Malignancy

- Gastroesophageal reflux disease and peptic ulcer disease

- Achalasia and esophageal motility disorder

- Acute coronary syndrome with atypical chest pain

- Acute necrotizing esophagitis (black esophagus) in the elderly
