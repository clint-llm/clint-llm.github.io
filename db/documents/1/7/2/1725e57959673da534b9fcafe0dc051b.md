This condition requires a physical examination of the patient, including a head to toe examination of mucous membranes, conjunctiva for pallor, heart and lung exam, evaluation of fingers for changes in nail beds secondary to anemia, and evaluation for alternative causes of anemia. The clinician may want to review all potential social exposures, smoking, drinking, and work-related exposures and previous surgical procedures.Â  It is also essential to evaluate all systems for any past medical history of cancer, familial hematologic malignancies, and other idiopathic causes.
