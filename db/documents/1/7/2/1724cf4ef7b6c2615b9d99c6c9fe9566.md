- Overall, focal atrial tachycardia is a benign arrhythmia.

- Focal atrial tachycardia typically occurs secondary to an underlying disease process or acute illness.

- Focal atrial tachycardia is one form of atrial tachycardia. Atrial activation patterns in focal atrial tachycardia will be similar during the tachycardia, yet distinct from the normal sinus P wave. Focal atrial tachycardia can be regular or irregular if variable block exists. A “warm up” and “cool down” pattern can occur during initiation and termination, respectively.

- Patients can be asymptomatic or present with palpitations, chest pain, lightheadedness, dizziness, or presyncope. Focal atrial tachycardia often presents on telemetry on asymptomatic or sleeping patients.

- Ventricular rate control is achievable with calcium channel or beta blockers. If the patient remains persistently tachycardic or has uncontrolled symptoms, the patient may benefit from antiarrhythmic therapy with class IC or III antiarrhythmics.

- A possible significant cardiac sequella of prolonged atrial tachycardia (or any tachycardia) is tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. If there are concerns for high tachycardia burden, outpatient monitoring may be necessary.
