Identifying the signs and symptoms and accurate radiological assessment of patients with choledochal cysts plays a vital role in the initial management of this condition. The treatment of choledochal cyst is almost always surgical excision with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, exceptions being the rare type II and type III cysts. Most patients require long term post-operative monitoring for the development of malignancy. The largest metanalysis that included 18 observational studies showed that to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with CCs significantly and to achieve the best prognosis, early diagnosis, and early surgical removal of the cyst with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy (before the age of 1 month) dramatically lowered the risk of developing malignancy.

To achieve the best results in the care and management of patients with choledochal cysts, it is important to form an interprofessional group of specialists including pediatric surgeons, pediatric gastroenterologists, pathologists, physiotherapists, nutritionists, oncologists, and radiologists.
