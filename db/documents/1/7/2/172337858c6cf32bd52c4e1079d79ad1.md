The RDI of thiamin for adults is 1.2 mg/day for men and 1.1 mg/day for women. For children, the RDI of thiamin is 0.2 mg/day during early infancy and then steadily increases with age. Pregnant women should increase their daily intake of thiamin to 1.4 mg/day. In the US, the average daily thiamin intake among children from the food itself is 1.27 mg, 1.54 mg, and 1.68 mg among individuals of 2 to 5 years, 6 to 11 years, and 12 to 19 years of age, respectively. Among men and women ages 20 years and above, the average daily intake of thiamin is 1.95 mg and 1.39 mg, respectively. Parenteral multivitamins contain 3 to 3.5 mg of thiamin; the adult enteral formula contains 2.2 to 2.9 mg per 1500 kcal/day of feed. The American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition recommends thiamine intake of 1.2 mg to a max of 10 mg per day.

Thiamin can be administered by enteral, intravenous (IV), or intramuscular (IM) routes. The oral route is indicated in patients who do not have IV access. At present, the thiamin hydrochloride form has been used for the prevention and treatment of Wernicke encephalopathy (WE). However, there is a lack of evidence to suggest the route, dose, and duration of treatment for Wernicke encephalopathy. For patients at risk of deficiency or with confirmed deficiency, parenteral thiamin of 100 mg and 200 mg 3 times a day has been used, respectively, in clinical practice.
