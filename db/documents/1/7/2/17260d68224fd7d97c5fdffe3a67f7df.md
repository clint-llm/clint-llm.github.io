The pathophysiology is multifactorial and involves genetic predisposition, infectious, immunological, environmental, and dietary.Â The characteristic transmural inflammation can include the entire GI tract from mouth to the perianal area; although most frequently involve terminal ileum and right colon. The initial lesion starts out as an infiltrate around an intestinal crypt. This goes on to develop ulceration first in the superficial mucosa and involves deeper layers. As the inflammation progresses, non-caseating granulomas form involving all layers of the intestinal wall. It can develop into the classic cobblestone mucosal appearances and skip lesions along the length of the intestine sparing areas with normal mucosa. As the flare of Crohn settles, scarring replaces the inflamed areas of the intestines.

Granuloma formation is very common in Crohn disease but their absence does not exclude the diagnosis. The ongoing inflammation and scarring lead to bowel obstruction and stricture formation. Crohn disease is also associated with enterovesical, enteroenteral, enterocutaneous, and enterovaginal fistulas.
