Customizing reconstruction is necessary to provide the proper surgery for each patient. For example, eyelid laxity is a factor that can determine what procedures are possible and most beneficial for a patient. Other factors to consider are the age of the patient and status of the other eye. For example, a Hughes flap may be avoided in a child if possible, as blocking vision for 4 to 6 weeks may lead to deprivation amblyopia if a child is in the amblyogenic age. Similarly, if a patient is monocular, and is unable to see out of the contralateral eye, if possible, it may be important to not block the seeing eye for four to six weeks with a Hughes flap.

Finally, as with any cancer treatment, it is important to maintain surveillance to monitor for recurrence of carcinoma.
