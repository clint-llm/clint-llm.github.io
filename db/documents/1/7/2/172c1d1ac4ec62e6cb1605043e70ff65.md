Dexamethasone is widely prescribed by all clinicians (MD, DO, NP, and PA). However, it is essential to know that this potent steroid has many adverse effects and requires critical patient monitoring. In general, clinicians should avoid long-term prescriptions, and the drug is tapered quickly if the patient is improving. If chronic use is warranted, the clinician must educate the patient about the potential side effects of the steroid. Pharmacists should assist with medication reconciliation, explain the potential risks associated with long-term steroid therapy, and report any concerns to clinicians. In addition, nurses must monitor the patient for mood changes, development of osteoporosis, weight gain, hyperglycemia, electrolyte changes, and depression. Open communication among all healthcare team members will enhance patient outcomes and improve patient safety using dexamethasone. [Level 5]
