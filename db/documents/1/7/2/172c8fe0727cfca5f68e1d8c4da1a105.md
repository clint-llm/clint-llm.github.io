Ergotamine tartrate/caffeine is contraindicated in patients with peripheral vascular disorders, coronary artery disease, stroke, uncontrolled hypertension, impaired renal or hepatic function, sepsis, and pregnancy due to its vasoconstrictor effect. Additionally, because ergotamine metabolism occurs through cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 in the liver, it is contraindicated in patients taking medications that are CYP 3A4 inhibitors since these would slow the metabolism of ergotamine and cause toxic effects such as stroke, gangrene, or death. Such CYP 3A4 inhibitors include grapefruit juice, heparin, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, ampicillin, macrolide antibiotics, antifungals, protease inhibitors, and antidepressants.
