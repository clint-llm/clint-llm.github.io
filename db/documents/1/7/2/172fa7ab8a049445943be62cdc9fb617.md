Various genetic risk factors predispose patients to develop psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis.

Distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints are frequently involved in psoriatic arthritis but not so in rheumatoid arthritis because these joints have many entheses but very little synovial tissue.  In animal models of spondyloarthropathy, IL-23 stimulates resident T cells which are CD3+, CD4-, CD8-, IL-23R+, and ROR gamma-t+.

CD8+ T cells play a central role which is supported by the association of psoriatic arthritis with HLA Class I alleles, oligoclonal expansion of CD8+ T cells, and association with late-stage HIV infection.

This information about the basic pathophysiology has been used to develop therapies such as TNF inhibitors which were initially developed for rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease and are routinely used for psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis.  IL-17 inhibitors are FDA approved for treating psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis but are not effective for rheumatoid arthritis.  IL-12/23 inhibitors and IL-23 inhibitors are FDA approved for treating psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis.
