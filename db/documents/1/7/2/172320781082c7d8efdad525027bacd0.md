The only contraindication to the administration of daunorubicin is pre-existing hypersensitivity reactions. Though caution should be taken in patients with hepatic and renal impairment as this can increase the risk of toxicity and relative dose reduction is necessary.

Daunorubicin can cross the placenta, and it can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Although no human study is available, researchers found daunorubicin to cause multiple fetal abnormalities and spontaneous abortions in reproductive animal studies. Therefore, effective contraception is the recommendation in women of reproductive age. It is not known if daunorubicin is secreted in breast milk or not, but due to the potential harm, breastfeeding is generally not recommended during the ongoing therapy.
