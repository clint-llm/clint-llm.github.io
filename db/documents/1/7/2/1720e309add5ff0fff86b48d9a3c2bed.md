Cisatracurium is administered intravenously.Â The typical dose for intubation is 0.15 to 0.2 mg/kg. After this typical dose, ideal intubating conditions are generally achievable in between 1.5 and 2 minutes. The clinically effective duration of an intubating dose lasts 55 to 65 minutes. Maintenance dosing by bolus is 0.02 mg/kg. Maintaining paralysis via infusion with cisatracurium is at 1 to 3 mcg/kg/min, although it is important to adjust the dosing based on peripheral nerve monitoring.
