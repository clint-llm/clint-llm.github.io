Color flow imaging is a vascular technology used to assess the vascular anatomy and flow within blood vessels. It relies on ultrasonographic technology to determine the flow direction, volume, and turbulence through the vessels.

This modality is augmented with Doppler technology, which tracks the changes in soundwaves of particles passing the probe, which yields a flow pattern when transduced to an image. The technique enhances the information obtained using color to highlight the direction of blood flow. Typically, red and blue colors are used to highlight the blood flow in one direction or the other regarding the probe's position. The speed of the blood flow is shown with a color scale. Usually, blood flow away from the probe is shown in blue, while blood flow toward the probe is red.
