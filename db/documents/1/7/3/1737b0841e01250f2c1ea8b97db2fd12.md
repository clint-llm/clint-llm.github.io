Idioventicular rhythm has two similar pathophysiologies described leading to ectopic focus in the ventricle to take the role of a dominant pacemaker.

Ectopic automaticity generated by abnormal calcium-dependent automatism that affects the diastolic depolarization, i.e., phase 4 action potential, is the main electrophysiological mechanism affecting the AIVR. The trigger activity is the main arrhythmogenic mechanism involved in patients with digitalis toxicity.

Sinoatrial node and the atrioventricular node may get suppressed with structural damage or functional dysfunction potentiated by enhanced vagal tone. Subsequently, the ventricle may assume the role of a dominant pacemaker. With the slowing of the intrinsic sinus rate and ventricular takeover, idioventricular rhythm is generated. The idioventricular rhythm becomes accelerated when the ectopic focus generates impulses above its intrinsic rate leading to a heart rate between 50 to 110 beats per minute.

Isorhythmic dissociation, fusion or capture beats can occur when sinus and ectopic foci discharge at the same rate.

The rhythm has variable associations relative to bundle branch blocks depending on the foci site.

An incomplete left bundle branch block pattern presents if ventricular rhythm arises from the right bundle branch block. An incomplete right bundle branch block is seen when the pacemaker is in the left bundle branch. Rhythms arising in the anterior or posterior fascicle of the left bundle branch exhibit a pattern of incomplete right bundle branch block with left posterior fascicular block and left anterior fascicular block, respectively.

Ventricular rhythm arising more distally in the Purkinje plexus of the left ventricular myocardium displays the pattern of right bundle branch block, and those of right ventricular origin display the pattern of left bundle branch block.
