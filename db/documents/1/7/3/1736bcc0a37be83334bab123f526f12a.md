The differential diagnosis includes all noninfectious causes of the typical signs and symptoms associated with neonatal meningitis, such as seizures, irritability, poor feeding, and fever. If CNS bacterial and viral infection have been ruled out, the following should be considered:

- Neonatal seizure disorders

- Inborn errors of metabolism

- IntracranialÂ hemorrhage

- Cerebral aneurysm

- Central venous thrombosis

- Sepsis from non-neurologic foci
