The prognosis of neglect patients greatly depends on the timely identification of this disorder in patients because about 80% of patients are reportedly initially undiagnosed.

Identification tests can also give a clue regarding prognostic index of such candidates, for instance, the cancellation test can predict the mortality and functional activity of neglect patients six months after the stroke according to the results of Albert's experiment.

Patients with neglect can often recover from the post-stroke acute phase due to reperfusion and resolution of cerebral edema, increasing the activity of left prefrontal and right parietal regions.
