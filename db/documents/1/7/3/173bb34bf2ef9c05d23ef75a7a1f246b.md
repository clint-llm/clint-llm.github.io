Venomous snakebites generally occur when venomous snakes (most commonly pit vipers) are cornered or startled by humans. Increased interest in warm weather outdoor activities like hiking, backpacking, and fishing, as well as the increasing numbers of venomous snakes being kept as pets, has increased the number of venomous snakebites in recent decades. Many snakebites do not result in envenomation, although it is initially quite difficult to distinguish between an envenomated and non-envenomated bite.
