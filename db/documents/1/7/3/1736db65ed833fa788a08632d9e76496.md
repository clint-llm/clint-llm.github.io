The deep palmar arterial arch is the main blood supply to the adductor pollicis. The adductor pollicis is an important anatomical landmark for the radial artery. As the radial artery enters the hand, it passes through the two heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle and then proceeds to pass anteromedially between the two heads of the adductor pollicis. After passing between the two heads, the artery enters intoÂ the deep compartment of the hand to form the deep palmar arch.

Superficial lymphatic channels that travel alongside the basilic and cephalic veins drain the hand to the cubital, epitrochlear, and supratrochlear lymph nodes of the elbow. These nodes then drain into the deep brachial and deltopectoral lymph nodes and ultimately terminate at the infraclavicular and axillary lymph nodes.
