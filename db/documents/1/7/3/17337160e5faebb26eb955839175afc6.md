**Migraine Prophylaxis in Children**

Propranolol is commonly prescribed for migraine preventive treatment in children, although studies have shown conflicting results. Similarly, topiramate is commonly prescribed for children, but its efficacy is questionable.

Data is insufficient for other medications like cyproheptadine, amitriptyline, and valproic acid. Flunarizine is believed to be effective for preventing migraines in children but is not available in the United States.

**Migraine Prophylaxis in Pregnancy**

It is imperative to maintain a cautious approach. Risks and benefits should be discussed with the patient in detail. Labetalol at a dose of 150 mg twice per day has shown some benefit in pregnant women. Propranolol, topiramate, amitriptyline, fluoxetine, and gabapentin are pregnancy category C drugs. Valproic acid is teratogenic and contraindicated, and the use of lisinopril and candesartan is not recommended for pregnant women.
