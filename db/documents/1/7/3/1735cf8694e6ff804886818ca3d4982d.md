**Gastroscopes**

The standard gastroscopes have a diameter of 10 mm with an instrument channel of 2.8 mm. In children weighing less than 10 kg, endoscopes smaller than 6 mm in diameter for routine endoscopy should be used. A gastroscope with a large operating channel measuring 3.8 to 4.2 mm is useful in severe acute upper GI bleeding. High-definition gastroscopes with optical zoom should be available to screen for pre-malignant gastric or duodenal lesions.

**Accessories**

The biopsy forceps (standard and jumbo) are needed for tissue sampling. For retrieval of a foreign body during esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), rat tooth forceps, alligator forceps, retrieval net, polypectomy snare, overtubes of esophageal and gastric lengths, and a foreign body protector hood should be available. Additional equipment may be required if therapeutic procedures are anticipated.
