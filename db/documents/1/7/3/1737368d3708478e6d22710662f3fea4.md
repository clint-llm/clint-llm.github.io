The diagnostic evaluation of a patient with a palpable thyroid nodule first includes a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level measurement to assess the functional baseline status of the thyroid gland, and afterward, an ultrasound examination of the thyroid gland, and ultimately a fine needle aspiration biopsy. All patients with a palpable thyroid nodule should have their thyroid hormone levels (TSH and thyroxine) checked. A toxic adenoma is suspected in patients with low TSH levels. These patients should undergo an iodine-123 thyroid scan in order to differentiate a hyperfunctioning nodule (toxic adenoma) from a hypofunctioning nodule.

A hyperfunctioning nodule is considered a benign lesion, as there is less than a 1% probability of malignancy. On the other hand, hypofunctioning nodules have a 20% probability of malignancy (through malignant transformation). However, most patients with a thyroid nodule are euthyroid, which means that TSH levels are within normal limits.Â All patients should undergo an ultrasound (US) examination of the thyroid gland to differentiate a thyroid adenoma, which is considered a benign lesion, from thyroid carcinoma. Sonographic features associated with a higher risk of malignancy are hypoechogenicity, microcalcifications, irregular margins, absent halo sign, and increased intramodular blood flow.

Fine needle aspiration (FNA) has ultimately been used in evaluating a thyroid nodule with suspicious radiology features, especially in patients with a high risk of malignancy. It should be mentioned that fine-needle aspiration may not provide a definite diagnosis in all cases. In patients with thyroid adenoma, the cytological sample has organized follicular epithelial cells. On the other hand, aspiration can show follicular cells with abnormal architecture and atypia. These patients are characterized as having atypia of undetermined significance.
