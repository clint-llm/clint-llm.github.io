A left ventricular aneurysm can be associated with a variety of complications such as malignant arrhythmias, heart failure, cardiac ischemia, thromboembolism, and rupture of the ventricle. Almost one-third of the patients with ventricular aneurysms develop arrhythmias. The location of arrhythmogenic focus is usually between that of the normal myocardium and the affected myocardium.

The common complications associated with the in-hospital repair of ventricular aneurysm include

- Low cardiac output

- Ventricular arrhythmias

- Respiratory failure

- Bleeding

- Dialysis-dependent renal failure

- Stroke
