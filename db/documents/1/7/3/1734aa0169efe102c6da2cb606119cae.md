The history and physical examination of patients with suspected hypothalamic dysfunction must be tailored according to the patient's clinical manifestation since the signs and symptoms are typically non-specific. Family history for genetic disorders must be obtained.

A lesion affecting either the production or pulsatile secretion of GnRH, which occurs in the preoptic nucleus, can lead to anovulation and amenorrhea, as seen in hypothalamic amenorrhea in which a majority of women exhibit due to a persistent slow frequency of GnRH pulses.

Frohlich syndrome causes excessive eating associated with obesity and delayed puberty. It is caused by trauma or tumors affecting the eating centers and the secretion of GHRH and GnRH. Patients present short stature and small testes. The nuclei affected are the arcuate, preoptic, and ventromedial.

Kallmann syndrome produces delayed puberty and is associated with anosmia. It is caused by the reduced production of GnRH.

In patients with central hypothyroidism, symptoms include fatigue, weight loss, feeling cold all the time, and constipation. Those patients where the adrenal axis is affected have very similar symptoms, including fatigue, weakness, poor appetite, and weight loss.

Children with hypothalamic dysfunction will present short stature, obesity, hypothermia, hypodipsia, developmental delay, generalized seizures, gelastic seizures, and delayed puberty, although sometimes they have precocious puberty.
