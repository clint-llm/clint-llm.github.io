Although the exact etiology and inciting factor of spinal hemangiomas genesis are not well understood, a well-known characteristic of these benign lesions includes a vascular proliferation of capillaries similar to hemangiomas in other parts of the body. Proliferation subsequently causes a displacement of bone and in rarer cases erosion into the spinal canal. Unlike infantile hemangiomas, hemangiomas of the spine do not spontaneously regress.
