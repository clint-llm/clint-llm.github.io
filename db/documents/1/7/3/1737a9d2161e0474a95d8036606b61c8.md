2018 AHA/ASA guidelines address prehospital care, urgent and emergency evaluation, and treatment with intravenous (IV) and intra-arterial therapies for acute ischemic stroke (AIS).

A patient with AIS may present after a 4.5-hour window and might still be a candidate for endovascular treatment (EVT), which may include angioplasty, stenting, mechanical embolectomy, or intra-arterial thrombolysis. Randomized trials have shown the safety and efficacy of intra-arterial thrombolysis given within 6 hours of symptom onset of AIS. The DAWN and DEFUSE 3 trials selected patients presenting after 6 hours for treatment using imaging-based criteria.

The rest of the treatment should be focused on preventing further cerebrovascular accidents. Antiplatelet or anticoagulation should be started based on the etiology of the stroke. Other secondary risk factors should be addressed with better-controlled hypertension, cholesterol, and diabetes.
