**Medical Treatment**

No single medical therapy has been shown to be effective in treating keloids.  Intra-lesional corticosteroids injections are a common first-line therapy for keloids to reduce scar volume, height, and related symptoms of itching and pain. Since steroid treatment has recurrence rates (9%-50%) and a high frequency of side effects (hypopigmentation, skin atrophy, telangiectasias, injection pain), intra-lesional steroid injections are usually combined with other therapies to improve outcomes. Additional treatments that do not have strong evidence for decreased recurrence or efficacy but have had varying anecdotal success include massage therapy, pressure garments, adhesive tape support/silicone gel sheeting, cryotherapy, and laser/light therapy.

**Surgical Treatment**

Surgical excision is frequently used for the treatment of mature keloid scars but is considered ineffective as a monotherapy given the recurrence rate of 45% to 100%. To reduce the risk of recurrence, it is recommended to combine surgical excision with more conservative treatment options, such as radiotherapy, cryotherapy, or steroids. Regarding surgical technique, it is recommended to do an intramarginal fusiform excision (incomplete resection), using minimal tension and sutures to close the wound with everted borders. The use of subcutaneous/fascial tensile reduction sutures, z-plastics, and local flap transfer are thought to prevent keloid recurrence.
