Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), characterized by repeated or prolonged episodes of acute otitis media lasting for more than 12 weeks, can cause damage to the tympanic membrane (TM) and result in a non-healing perforation. Tympanoplasty is the surgical procedure performed to repair a perforated tympanic membrane, with/without reconstruction of the ossicles, with the aim of preventing reinfection and restoring hearing ability. Microscopic and endoscopic approaches are utilized for tympanoplasty. This activity reviews the indication for tympanoplasty and treatment options; it highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating tympanic membrane perforations.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the anatomy of the tympanic membrane.
- Identify the indications for a tympanoplasty.
- Summarize the most commonly used surgical approaches for tympanoplasty.
- Describe common postoperative complications of tympanoplasty.
