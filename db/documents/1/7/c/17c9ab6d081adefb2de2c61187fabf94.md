Like many other TCAs, the toxicity of nortriptyline can be very harmful to the body. During an overdose, there is a blockade of the following receptors: sodium channels (fast) in the heart, muscarinic Ach receptors (central and peripheral), alpha-1 receptors in the periphery, and H1 and GABA-A in the central nervous system. Therefore, the most crucial initial step when assessing a patient with toxicity is ensuring the patient can adequately breathe. Intubation is usually mandatory for airway protection and proper ventilation. In addition, the clinician can administer IV fluids for hypotension.

Additionally, sodium bicarbonate is the recommended treatment for patients with prolonged QRS (greater than 100 milliseconds) or ventricular arrhythmia. The sodium bicarbonate dosage depends on the patient's weight, usually 1 to 2 mEq/kg. Arrhythmias not responding to sodium bicarbonate therapy may need lidocaine, phenytoin, or bretylium. TCAs can also cause seizures. These can have treatment with benzodiazepines such as lorazepam 2 mg or diazepam 5 mg, administered through the intravenous (IV) route. Treatment with activated charcoal for gastrointestinal decontamination is only indicated in patients who present within 2 hours of overdose (1 g/kg). Although there is a strong blockage of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, physostigmine is contraindicated in the event of TCA toxicity as it can cause adverse cardiac effects such as cardiac arrest.
