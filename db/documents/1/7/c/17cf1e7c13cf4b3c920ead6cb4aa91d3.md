Adult T- cell leukemia (ATL) is a rare and aggressive peripheral T-cell neoplasm associated with human T-cell leukemia virus type -1 (HTLV-1) infection. It is classified into four different clinical variants that are acute, lymphomatous, chronic, and smoldering. ATL is associated with poor prognosis with short overall survival despite treatment. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of ATL and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
