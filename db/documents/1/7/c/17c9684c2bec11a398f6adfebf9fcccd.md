Providing medical care and support to individuals and families with incontinentia pigmenti requires a multidisciplinary approach. Follow-up with multiple specialties includes ophthalmology for annular eye exams throughout life and geneticist for risk assessment for older and younger at-risk relatives. Rare diseases likeÂ IP have an overall low incidence, so establishing treatment protocols is difficult. Support for families can also prove to be a challenge due to this.
