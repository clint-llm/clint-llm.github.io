In the United States, spinal stenosis if widely seen in outpatient clinics among the geriatric population. LSS in earlier ages is usually due to congenital malformations, while patients over the age of 50 years are likely due to degenerative causes. Studies have shown that 1/1000 persons over the age of 65 years and about 5/1000 persons over the age of 50 years are likely to get spinal stenosis.
