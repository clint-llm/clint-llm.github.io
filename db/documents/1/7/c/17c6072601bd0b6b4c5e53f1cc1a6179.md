Equipping patients with the proper knowledge to mitigate their risk of developing osteoporosis or the associated complications is critical. Nurses should assess the patientâ€™s knowledge of osteoporosis and provide education regarding dietary intake (such as increasing calcium and vitamin D intake, recognizing foods high in calcium, and limiting sodas or colas, which are usually high in phosphorus), and exercise. While providing patient education, the nurse should also assess any potential barriers such as limited access to healthy foods in the community, limited income, or language barriers. Nurses also are responsible for teaching the importance of regular screenings (such as bone density tests) and healthy lifestyle choices (such as smoking cessation and moderation in alcohol intake).
