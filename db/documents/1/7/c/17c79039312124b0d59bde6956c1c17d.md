**Airway Management**

Airway stenosis is the most common indication for tracheal and cricotracheal resection; it is common for patients to have a pre-existing tracheostomy. In that scenario, the patient can be endotracheally intubated via tracheostomy. Otherwise, the patient will need direct laryngoscopy and rigid bronchoscopy while maintaining spontaneous breathing.

**Rigid Bronchoscopy**

During the direct laryngoscopy and rigid bronchoscopy, the glottis, subglottis, trachea, and the stenotic segment are examined. It is recommended to carry out three measurements: 1) vocal cords to the carina, 2) distal tip of the lesion to the carina, and 3) proximal tip of the lesion to vocal cords) These three measurements will accurately depict the stenotic length for operative planning and determination of release maneuvers.

**Tracheal Resection**

Once the airway is secured, and general anesthesia is administered, the patient is placed supine, and a shoulder roll is placed to enhance neck extension. The neck and chest are draped in a sterile fashion. A horizontal collar incision is made through the skin and platysma. If the patient has a tracheostomy, the tracheostoma is incorporated into the incision in an elliptical fashion. Subplatysmal flaps are raised superiorly to the hyoid bone and inferiorly to the sternal notch. The strap muscles are divided along the median raphe and retracted laterally. The thyroid isthmus is divided, and the anterior border of the thyroid cartilage, cricoid, and trachea down to the sternal notch is defined.

Fine dissection is performed to isolate the tracheal stenosis region with care not to compromise the lateral blood supply and the recurrent laryngeal nerves. For patients with an existing tracheostomy, the anterior tracheal wall is exposed above and below the tracheostoma. The epithelized tract may be incised from the anterior tracheal cartilage or incorporated into the resection as the anterior wall of the trachea. Once the segment to be excised has been identified and isolated superiorly, laterally, and inferiorly, the airway is entered. It is essential to notify the anesthesiologist before entering the airway.  It is our general practice to enter the airway with a horizontal transverse intercartilaginous incision inferior to the stenosis between tracheal rings. A wire-reinforced endotracheal tube is then passed into the distal trachea and connected to the ventilator circuit. A suture is placed through the distal trachea to secure it to the endotracheal tube. Until continuity is re-established, the patient is ventilated through the distal tracheal intubation. If orotracheal or nasotracheal intubation was performed, the tube could be retracted.

A horizontal incision is made across the superior aspect of the desired resection. Both the inferior and superior incisions are extended through the posterior wall until the party wall fascia is identified. Dissection is performed along the party wall between the superior and inferior posterior party wall incisions. Placement of an esophageal bougie or nasogastric tube can help identify the esophagus. The stenotic segment is then dissected free from the esophagus posteriorly and the surrounding tissue laterally. Care must be taken to hug the tracheal wall during dissection to avoid injuring the esophagus and recurrent laryngeal nerves. For neoplastic disease, the tumor is resected to achieve the recommended disease negative margins microscopically before reanastomosis. It is vital to avoid extending circumferential skeletonization of the trachea beyond 1 cm of the resected edges to preserve the vasculature of the anastomosis.

The proximal and distal trachea is then reapproximated and reanastomosed. This starts by managing the endotracheal tube. If the patient was not intubated orotracheally at the start of the case, an ETT is passed through the glottis into the proximal tracheal segment. The surgeon has control of both the proximal and distal (circuited) airway. In short segment tracheal resection, primary anastomosis can be achieved with a limited tracheal release. Bracing sutures can be used to help reduce tension between the proximal and distal trachea during anastomosis. The authors favor using a 3-0 polydioxanone (PDS) or polypropylene (prolene) sutures, entering and exiting two tracheal rings above and below the anastomosis.

Once the posterior wall is repaired, the distal segment is extubated, and the circuit is connected to the proximal circuit as the endotracheal tube is advanced until the ETT cuff is below the anastomosis. The ETT should be secured, and the measurement at the lip or teeth recorded. The cartilaginous trachea is then reapproximated with interrupted 3-0 PDS and the knots cinched outside the lumen. Before sealing the anastomosis, it is important to confirm that the inflated cuff is not against the anastomosis. If bracing sutures were used, they could also be cinched after the anastomosis for added strength. It is imperative to create a tension-free anastomosis to prevent wound dehiscence and restenosis.

**Cricotracheal Resection**

For patients with severe subglottic stenosis high in the cervical trachea, resection may require partial excision of the cricoid cartilage. The procedure starts in a similar fashion to the procedure described above with airway management, laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, management of the tracheocutaneous fistula (which is usually the case in cricotracheal resection), and opening of the neck. Exposure of the thyroid cartilage, cricoid, and trachea is obtained. The area of stenosis is isolated superiorly, inferiorly, and laterally. It is important to update the anesthesiologist before entering the airway. Horizontal incisions are made at the inferior thyroid border. If the patient does not already have a tracheostomy, a wire-reinforced endotracheal tube is then passed into the distal trachea and connected to the ventilator circuit. A suture (silk or polyglycolic acid) is placed through the distal trachea to secure it to the endotracheal tube. Until continuity is re-established, the patient is ventilated through the distal tracheal intubation. The cricothyroid muscle is elevated off the anterior cricoid bilaterally. Lateral dissection of the cricoid bilaterally is carried out using cold dissection in the subperichondrial plane near the cricothyroid joint as the recurrent laryngeal nerve lies superficial to the perichondrial plane posterior to the cricothyroid joint.

Lateral incisions through the cricoid are made bilaterally, and the anterior arch of the cricoid is resected. Dissection is carried out along the inferior edge of the posterior cricoid until the party wall between the trachea and esophagus is entered. Placement of a nasogastric tube or esophageal bougie can help assist localizing the esophagus. The stenotic segment is then dissected free from the esophagus posteriorly along the parting wall and the surrounding tissue laterally, making sure to hug the trachea to avoid injuring the recurrent laryngeal nerves. Two issues need to be addressed during anastomosis: achieving a tension-free, leak-free anastomosis and management of airway caliber mismatch. There are various methods for placing traction sutures to reduce tension at the primary anastomosis. 2-0 or 3-0 Prolene traction sutures are placed from the thyroid cartilage to the distal end tracheal rings to re-approximate the anastomosis. Airway caliber mismatch has to be managed, as the distal tracheal lumen is usually larger than the subglottic lumen. If necessary, the subglottic lumen can be enlarged by drilling the posterior cricoid with a diamond burr and by performing an inferior midline thyrotomy up to the anterior commissure. The inferior triangular defect created by the thyrotomy is filled by a triangular wedge made from the first tracheal ring below the stenosis.

The anastomosis is performed first between the posterior cricoid and distal tracheal ring using simple, interrupted PDS placed 3 mm apart and 3-4 mm from the cut edge. These posterior wall sutures will span the posterior cricoid cartilage to the membranous trachea of the distal trachea. These sutures are cinched intraluminally. The remaining anterior and lateral anastomotic sutures are tied with knots placed outside the lumen. The reinforced endotracheal tube is then removed from the distal trach, and an orotracheal endotracheal tube is advanced until the cuff is past the area of the anastomosis. The ventilator circuit is switched over to the orotracheal ETT, and the balloon is inflated. The anterior and lateral anastomosis is then finished by placing simple, interrupted sutures, per surgeon preference, to seal the anastomosis between the inferior border of the thyroid cartilage and the distal tracheal rings.

**Release Maneuvers**

Various release maneuvers have been used to decrease tension. These include anterior and posterior blunt tracheal dissection, neck flexion, thyrohyoid, suprahyoid, hilar, and intrapericardial release techniques.

For cervical tracheal resections, neck flexion and blunt dissection along the avascular anterior and posterior trachea can be performed to avoid injuring the lateral tracheal blood supply.

The suprathyroid or thyrohyoid laryngeal (Dedo) release involves transecting the thyrohyoid muscle and dividing the thyrohyoid membrane. The superior cornu of the thyroid cartilage is then cut with care not to injury the superior laryngeal nerve and vessels, which penetrate the thyrohyoid membrane medial to the cornu.

The suprahyoid (Montgomery) release involves dissection on the superior edge of the hyoid. The superior muscles attached to the hyoid are divided, including the mylohyoid, geniohyoid, and genioglossi. The digastric sling remains attached to the hyoid. This muscular release alone can provide significant laxity. If needed, the hyoid bone can be divided with Mayo scissors on each side, lateral to the lesser cornua, and medial to the digastric sling. This will allow the body of the hyoid, thyroid cartilage, cricoid, and proximal tracheal segments to drop inferiorly.

For resection of distal tracheal lesions, intrathoracic release maneuvers can be utilized using median sternotomy, video-assisted thorascopic surgery (VATS), or bilateral lateral thoracotomies.

The hilum can be released through blunt dissection along the avascular plane anterior to the bilateral bronchi and division of the inferior pulmonary ligament, with care not to injury the bronchial arteries.

Intrapericardial release can provide another 2 cm of tracheal length by moving the carina rostrally. After the right inferior pulmonary ligament is divided, a U-shaped incision is made on the pericardium at the anterior, inferior, and posterior borders of the right inferior pulmonary vein, with care not to injury the phrenic nerve anteriorly. The intrapericardium septum that attaches the lateral atrium and vena cava to the pericardium is then divided and extended to circumscribe the right hilum completely.
