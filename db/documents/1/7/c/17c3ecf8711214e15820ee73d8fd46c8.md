Multimodal analgesia is the future for the alleviation of pain in many fields of medicine. The field of orthopedic surgery has been at the forefront of this new tool's clinical use and innovation for postoperative pain relief. This model shows benefit in many ways in the clinical setting. Orthopedic surgery can often be associated with significant pain in the early postoperative period. Balancing the need for pain control while mitigating risk for adverse effects such as opioid dependence and adverse effects of medication with comorbid conditions can be difficult. MMA provides a broad array of medications and strategies that can be combined to work synergistically with one another to help orthopedic surgeons treat their patients in the most efficacious and safe way possible. Recent studies corroborate the idea that this model helps decrease post-operative pain beyond the standard monotherapy opioid regimen. This leads to less opioid use and, therefore, less risk to the patient.

Individual surgeons often create their own regimens with respect to how they approach MMA. Hsu et al. have broken their pain regimens into classes based on the severity of the injury and the associated surgery. The classes include major musculoskeletal surgery, minor musculoskeletal surgery, and non-operative or closed treatment. These recommended regimens include opioid management as well as alternative or adjuvant non-opioid medications (NSAIDs, gabapentin, acetaminophen).
