The bony glabella does not have a significant difference between males and females, but glabella shows a significant difference between races.

Soft tissue thickness over glabella increases as the advancement of age and body mass index.

Corrugator supercilii muscle shows five different patterns rectangular shaped, corrugator supercilii with three bellies, corrugator supercilii with duplicate muscle, irregular flat, and hypoblastic type. CorrugatorÂ supercilii with frontalis muscle creates six different types of verticle lines on the forehead.

Variation in shapes of procerus muscle affects forehead lines. Nerve supply to the corrugator supercilii varies among individuals.

There have been some cases where the supratrochlear artery was absent. Another notable variation is when the supratrochlear artery pierces the frontalis muscle posteriorly in the middle third division of forehead and ascend superiorly on the periosteal level.
