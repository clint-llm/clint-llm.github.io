Before the operative intervention, patients are evaluated clinically and undergo diagnostic imaging studies. It is common for full-thickness cartilage lesions to be present in the setting of other ligamentous knee injuries. It is common for patients to report a traumatic event such as pivot-shift injury, fall, patellar dislocation, or direct impact to the injured knee. Radiographic workup consists of standard knee radiographs (AP and Lateral).

Radiographs are not sensitive or specific for detecting cartilage defects, so further imaging such as MRI is routinely used. MRI can detect the depth and size of the chondral defect.
