Papillomas take origin from an epithelial surface. Complex folds of proliferating epithelium can be observed and are accompanied by a growth of supporting connective tissue and blood vessels. Typical examples are found in the skin, e.g., the common wart. Under the light microscope, these benign tumors show:

- Normally arranged epithelial cells e.g., in skin papillomas, the surface cells are squamous, and proliferation is confined to the deepest layers.

- The inner layer is a fibrovascular core with well-formed blood vessels.

- The outer layer is the epithelium, which is infolded and characterized by acanthosis, papillomatosis, and hyperkeratosis.

- The relationship of the epithelium to connective tissue is normal. They show no evidence of infiltration or invasion of the underlying connective tissues.

- In the case of conjunctival papillomas, pedunculated papillomas are usually covered by conjunctival epithelium.
