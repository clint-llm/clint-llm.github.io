There has been a reduction in complications related to PVS due to technological advances. Chan et al. found a 19% PVS-related short-term complication that included but was not limited to urinary retention, wound infection, and intraoperative bladder laceration.

Other complications of PVS surgery include iatrogenic lower urinary tract or bowel perforation, significant hemorrhage, mesh exposure - erosion (urethra or bladder), implant infections, new-onset voiding dysfunction (urgency or bladder outlet obstruction), urinary retention, and UTIs.

While many complications are short-term and easy to resolve, a few, such as erosion and organ perforation, can be more difficult to treat, often requiring additional surgeries with increased morbidity.
