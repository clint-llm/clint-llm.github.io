The laminin-alpha2 subunit expresses in numerous tissues, including skeletal muscle, astrocytes, pericytes of capillaries in the brain, and Schwann cells.

Using thin-section fracture labeling, cryo ultramicrotomy, and immunohistochemistry, research has localized the laminin-alpha2 chain to the basal lamina of all cerebral blood vessels. However, localization signals were absent or non-reactive in the choroid plexus and meningeal blood vessels. Villanova et al. thus hypothesized that the laminin-alpha2 subunit might be significant in the selective filtration ability of the blood-brain barrier based on the chain's localized expression.

Additionally, mutations of the LAMA2 gene and merosin carry implications in the pathophysiology of merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy, which is also known as LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy. Over 100 mutations in this gene have links with this disorder, with most of these mutations arising in the early-onset variant of the disease.
