Most side effects occur when plasma concentrations rise to toxic levels. The drug reaches the intravascular compartment most rapidly when administered into the intercostal space, followed by the caudal, epidural, brachial plexus, femoral and subcutaneous spaces. The maximum safe dose by body weight may be taken to be 3 mg/kg, or 7 mg/kg when using preparations with epinephrine, although the literature quotes various other doses. Smaller amounts can still result in side effects and toxicity if given intravascularly.

Lidocaine is thought to be more neurotoxic than other local anesthetics, especially when high concentrations are applied directly to nervous tissue. Use of highly concentrated lidocaine (2.5 to 5%) for spinal anesthesia correlates with a greater incidence of transient radicular irritation syndrome, which is a self-limiting painful condition affecting the calves, thighs, and buttocks.
