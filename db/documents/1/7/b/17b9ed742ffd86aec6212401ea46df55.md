Arnold Chiari malformations are relatively common and represent a spectrum of hindbrain anomalies. The diagnosis and treatment of this condition require an interprofessional team consisting of primary care, neurologists, radiologists, neurosurgeons, and specialty trained nurses. [Level 5] Depending on the severity of the malformation, the individual may be asymptomatic or have severe neurological symptoms. While the patients are often managed with decompressive surgery, the nurses are responsible for looking after these individuals. Hence, the nurse must be aware of the potential post-surgical complications and their presentation. The prognosis for most patients with a Chiari I malformation is good, but it also depends on the initial neurological presentation. Those patients with mild neurological deficits tend to have good outcomes, but those with moderate to severe symptoms tend to have a guarded prognosis. The surgery is also associated with several complications, of which the most common are CSF leak and pseudomeningocele. A few individuals may have a persistent syrinx and may require a shunt.
