There are various clinical indications of keratometers in routine ophthalmic practice:

- **Astigmatism assessment:**Keratometers help to assess the corneal astigmatic error

- **Contact lens fitting:**Keratometers help to assess the anterior corneal surface, thus prove valuable for contact lens fitting

- **Corneal shape assessment:**Keratometers help to assess the shape in keratoconus and kertaoglobus

- **Contact lens flexure assessment:**Keratometers help assess the rigid gas permeable lens flexure.

- **Anisometropia:**Keratometers help to differentiate between axial versus curvatural anisometropia

- **Refractive error assessment:**Keratometers help to assess the refractive error in case of hazy media.

- **IOL power calculation:**Keratometer helps to know the K reading, an essential component of the SRK formula for IOL power calculation.

- **Astigmatism monitoring:**They help to assess the pre and post-surgical astigmatism
