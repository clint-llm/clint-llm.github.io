Throughout the history of arthroscopic surgery, open meniscal repair via an incision posterior to the collateral ligaments is rarely performed due to associated neurovascular injury. Currently, both inside-out and outside-in repair techniques are common choices. These techniques involve arthroscopically passing a suture from either the inside or the outside ofÂ the knee and tying it beyond the joint capsule via a small incision. Inside-out and outside-in repairs are useful for anterior and middle-third tears, but the saphenous nerve medially and the common peroneal nerve laterally are vulnerable when making the accessory incisions.
