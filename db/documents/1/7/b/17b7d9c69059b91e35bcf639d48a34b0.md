Keloid formation seems to have a genetic predisposition. A classical association is increased incidence of keloid in people with darker skin complexion than individuals with a fairer complexion. The highest prevalence is seen in the African population, followed by the Asian and Hispanic population, and less frequently in Caucasians. Some studies have shown keloid formation in twins, suggesting a genetic predisposition, as well as several generations of families that are affected by keloid formation.

Hypertrophic scars do not appear to have a genetic predisposition. Some studies suggest, however, that they are more common in populations with a darker complexion. Hypertrophic scars also appear on areas of skin subject to stretching due to the increased tension.

Both keloids and hypertrophic scars tend to occur in younger populations, ages 11 to 30 years old, which is thought to result from the increased rate of epidermal turnover in this younger population and increased collagen production.
