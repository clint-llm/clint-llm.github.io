Serum sickness is a self-limited disease process that is generally alleviatedÂ by the discontinuation of the offending agent. However, the differential diagnosis of serum sickness includes potentially life-threatening disease entities that need to be considered and excluded. It is the responsibility of the entire treatment team, including the physician or advanced practice provider, nurses and pharmacists, to ensure that the correct diagnosis is identified and the offending medication is discontinued indefinitely. Adjunctive therapies including NSAIDs, antihistamines, and corticosteroids may help alleviate symptom severity. For those patients in whom discontinuation of the causative agent is not possible, an interprofessional care team including, but not limited to, specialty trained nurses, assisting an allergist/immunologist, rheumatologist, and oncologist, is essential in the management of ongoing treatment and mitigation of side effects.
