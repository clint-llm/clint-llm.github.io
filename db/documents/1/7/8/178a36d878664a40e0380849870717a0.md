There are three chambers in the eye: the anterior chamber, the posterior chamber, and the vitreous chamber. The anterior chamber consists of ocular content behind the cornea. The posterior chamber consists of content from the iris to the anterior aspect of the lens. The vitreous chamber consists of eye content behind the lens and is the location of the vitreous floaters.

The vitreous gel, which consists of collagen fibers, fills the vitreous chamber undergoing syneresis and contraction (shrinking) due to age and mechanical factors. Fibers are intertwined within the vitreous and are attached to the surface of the retina. Over time, the vitreous shrinks, and these fibers pull on the retinal surface. Often these fibers break and allow the vitreous to separate and continue shrinking. Eventually, the vitreous cannot fill the volume of the cavity it sits within. This leads to the separation of the vitreous from the retina, creating vitreous floating in its chamber. If this process happens gradually, the symptoms are typically mild and can go unnoticed. If the process of separation is violent, on an isolated portion of the retina, or there is the presence of abnormal adhesion between the vitreous and retina, the PVD can tear retinal vessels or the retina itself.
