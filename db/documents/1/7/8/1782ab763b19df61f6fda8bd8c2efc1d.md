The majority of patients with EBV infection recover without sequelae and develop lifelong immunity to controlling the dormant virus. The acute phase of the illness resolves by the second week, but malaise symptoms may persist for months. In rare situations, malignancies have been linked with EBV infection, but additional study is needed to prove causation. Resumption of normal activity should be guided by the risk of splenic injury as well as other limitations that may be imposed by the fatigue that accompanies the illness.

Airway obstruction due to edema of the pharyngeal lymph nodes has also been reported. In addition, CNS complications include encephalitis, psychosis, cranial nerve palsies, peripheral neuritis, and Guillain barre syndrome.
