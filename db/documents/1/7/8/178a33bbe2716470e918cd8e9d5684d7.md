Galen initially described the ventricular system of the brain. As more information arose about the anatomy of the brain, anatomists described the cerebral aqueduct as a narrow communication duct between the third and fourth ventricles. The word aqueduct comes from the Latin word “aqueductus" which translates to a canal used for taking water through a structure to another location. It is unclear when the eponym ‘Aqueduct of Sylvius’ first appeared; it is believed to be traced back to the well-known anatomist Franciscus Sylvius.
