Indications for pharmacological SPECT stress test include patients who are unable to exercise or have disabling comorbidity for the following purposes

- To diagnose obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with intermediate to high pretest probability of ischemic heart disease (IHD) (Class I)

- For risk assessment in patients who are known to have stable IHD, especially with LBBB (Class I)

- To evaluate coronary stenosis with uncertain physiological significance before revascularization (Class I)

- To evaluate new or worsening symptoms not consistent with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients who have stable IHD (Class I)

- For follow-up assessment at 2-year or longer intervals in patients who have stable IHD with previous evidence of silent ischemia or with elevated risk for a recurrent cardiac event, who have a history of incomplete coronary revascularization with an uninterpretable EKG (Class IIa)

Pharmacological SPECT stress test is appropriate for patients who are unable to exercise or have disabling comorbidity for the following purposes

- For new-onset or newly diagnosed heart failure with LV systolic dysfunction

- For ventricular tachycardia regardless of the risk for CAD

- For syncope in patients with intermediate or high risk for CAD

- For elevated troponin in patients without additional evidence of ACS

- For patients with possible ACS with no evidence of ischemia in EKG and negative or minimally elevated troponin

- For patients with intermediate or high-risk Duke treadmill score

- For follow-up assessment at five years after CABG

- For asymptomatic patients with high IHD risk (ATP III risk criteria)

- If prior noninvasive evaluation equivocal, borderline, or discordant stress testing

- For coronary calcium Agatston score greater than 400 or greater than 100 with high risk for IHD

- Pre-operative risk assessment in intermediate-risk surgery or vascular surgery for patients with one or greater clinical risk factor and poor functional capacity (< 4 METs)

- Viability test for patients with severe LV systolic dysfunction before revascularization

- To evaluate for inducible ischemia within three months of an acute coronary syndrome in patients who are hemodynamically stable without recurrent symptoms or signs of heart failure
