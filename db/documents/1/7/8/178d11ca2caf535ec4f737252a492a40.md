The histopathology of sympathetic ophthalmia classically shows widespread bilateral uveal inflammation characterized by lymphocytes surrounding non-necrotizing granulomas composed of multinucleated giant cells and macrophages.

Immunohistochemical studies demonstrate lymphocytic granulomatous uveal inflammation where CD4+ T helper cells predominate during the early stages of the disease, followed by CD8+ T suppressor cells during later stages. More recent studies also unveiled B cells as potential contributors to the inflammatory process toward end-stage disease.

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), an inflammatory cytokine, may play a role in mediating oxidative stress in the outer retina during sympathetic ophthalmia, resulting in photoreceptor apoptosis and vision loss.

Dalen-Fuchs nodules are RPE lesions characteristically associated with sympathetic ophthalmia, but they are only seen in 25 to 35% of cases and are not pathognomonic to the disease.

- Focal RPE hyperplasia and aggregation,

- Classic Dalen-Fuchs nodules, described as lymphocytes and epithelioid cells that exist between RPE and Bruch's membrane, and

- Nodules with disruption of the overlying RPE resulting in potential eruption into the subretinal space.

Currently, there is no known correlation between the extent of histopathological findings and the final visual outcome in sympathetic ophthalmia.
