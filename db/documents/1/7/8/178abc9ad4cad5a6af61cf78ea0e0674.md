Epidural anesthesia has become the goal standard for pain management in obstetric anesthesia. The main advantage is adequate pain control without affecting the sensation of pressure allowing the parturient to feel the need to push. Epidural anesthesia is also very popular in general surgery since it can be used as a sole anesthetic during an operation and as a continuous infusion for postoperative pain control. The epidural technique offers adequate anesthesia and a reasonable safety profile. All these features make it a practical alternative when general anesthesia is not preferred.
