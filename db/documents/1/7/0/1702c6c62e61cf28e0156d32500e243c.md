Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is idiopathic up to 50% of the cases.  Infections and drugs are the most common triggers for secondary leukocytoclastic vasculitis.Mycobacterium, Staphylococcus aureus, Chlamydia, Neisseria, and HIV.  Chronic infections with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and syphilis can be associated with leukocytoclastic vasculitis as well. Several drugs have been associated with leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The onset is typically 1 to 3 weeks after drug initiation. These include, but are not limited to, beta-lactams, erythromycin, clindamycin, vancomycin, sulfonamides, furosemide, allopurinol, NSAIDs, amiodarone, gold, thiazides, phenytoin, beta-blockers, TNF-alpha inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, metformin, warfarin, valproic acid, among many others. Neoplastic or hematologic triggers of leukocytoclastic vasculitis include, but are not limited to lymphomas, leukemias, visceral tumors such as intestinal adenocarcinoma and lung cancer.  Systemic diseases including connective tissue diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren syndrome), inflammatory bowel disease, Behcet disease, and rheumatoid arthritis cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), Hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis, and Erythema elevatum diutinum are also associated with leukocytoclastic vasculitis.
