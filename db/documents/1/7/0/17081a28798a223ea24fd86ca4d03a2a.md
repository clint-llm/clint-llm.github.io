Marasmus is a manifestation of severe dietary malnutrition which occurs as a result of a calorie deficiency. Marasmus is associated with a better prognosis than kwashiorkor but it is still associated with relatively high mortality. As such, it is important to know how to prevent the development of marasmus and how to manage marasmus, and the complications of treatment such as refeeding syndrome. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of marasmus and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of marasmus.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of marasmus.
- Outline the management options available for marasmus.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to manage marasmus and improve outcomes.
