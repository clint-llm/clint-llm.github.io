Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening illness almost exclusively affecting neonates.  NEC has a mortality rate as high as 50%.  The pathophysiolgy of NEC is inflammation of the intestine leading to bacterial invasion causing cellular damage and death which causes necrosis of the colon and intestine. As NEC progresses, it can lead to intestinal perforation causing peritonitis, sepsis, and death.  The signs and symptoms of NEC, poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, abdominal tenderness, are nonspecific, so clinicians must remain suspicious when presented with these signs and symptoms in the neonatal population.
