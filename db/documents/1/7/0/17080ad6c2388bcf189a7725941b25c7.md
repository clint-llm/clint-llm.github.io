Overall, any beneficial clinical impact resulting from the elevation of HDL cholesterol content is not supported by research. A meta-analysis, in 2009, evaluating 108 randomized trials with patients at risk for coronary heart events failed to find an association, after adjustment for LDL cholesterol changes, between creases and HDL cholesterol from treatment with risk ratios for cardiovascular events, deaths from coronary disease or total deaths.

The VA HIT trial examined patients with coronary heart disease, HDL less than 40, LDL less than 140, and triglycerides less than 300. Subjects were divided randomly into two groups, gemfibrozil treatment, and placebo. After randomization, the beneficial effect first became apparent. After five years, nonfatal myocardial infarctions and cardiac death, the combined primary endpoint, was observed less often in the gemfibrozil group.

Infusion of apolipoprotein A-I has been tested in multiple studies for the potential benefit. Reduced risk for cardiovascular disease events has been strongly associated with ApoA1 levels in patients on statin therapy for LDL cholesterol.

Infusion of reconstituted HDL is examined in the erase trial were patients were randomized between placebo or dose of reconstituted human HDL. There was early study discontinuation in the higher dose HDL infusions due to increased incidence of liver function test abnormalities.  However, despite this, the vascular ultrasound taken a few weeks after the last infusion did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in the coronary atheroma volume change from baseline.

The ILLUMINATE trial, which investigated torcetrapib, was terminated early due to the increased risk of cardiovascular events. Both major studies for evacetrapib were terminated early due to futility. Lastly, anacetrapib is currently under investigation.

In patients with increased cardiovascular risk with low HDL cholesterol, the evidence does support a healthy diet, regular exercise, reaching target body weight, and smoking cessation to improve HDL cholesterol and decrease cardiovascular disease risk.
