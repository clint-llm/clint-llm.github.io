Depending on the severity of the trauma sustained and degree of pain, rib fractures may be managed either outpatient or inpatient. Isolated rib fractures tend to heal well and do not need any further interventions beyond pain control, rest, and ice. Multiple rib fractures, displaced rib fractures, or those with underlying concomitant injuries may require inpatient monitoring for respiratory failure or surgical correction. Elderly individuals with rib fractures tend to have a higher mortality rate than younger individuals and may require closer monitoring.
