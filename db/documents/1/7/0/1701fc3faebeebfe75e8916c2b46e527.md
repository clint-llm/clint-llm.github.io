At the molecular level, protein factors, such as ligands, receptors and transcription factors, play a critical role in the development of the limb. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and fibroblast growth factors are specific ligands and serve important roles in cell signaling. These ligand factors induce differentiation and proliferation of neighboring cell populations within the nascent limb. These ligands stimulate signal transduction to cause structural and functional changes in cell behavior. This causes transcription factors to travel into the nucleus of the cell and create new DNA.
