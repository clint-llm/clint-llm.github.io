Anterior mediastinotomy (the Chamberlain procedure) is surgical entry to the mediastinum via an incision in the parasternal 2nd left intercostal space, that is performed in order to biopsy and obtain a histologic diagnosis of enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes and mesothoracic masses. Mediastinotomy plays a particularly important role in defining the clinical stage of bronchogenic carcinoma. Although it is a minimally invasive procedure, it is done under general anesthesia and has specific contraindications and complications. This activity reviews the anterior mediastinotomy procedure and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in carrying out this procedure successfully.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications of mediastinotomy.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to mediastinotomy.
- Outline appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and clinical significance of mediastinotomy.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance mediastinotomy and improve outcomes.
