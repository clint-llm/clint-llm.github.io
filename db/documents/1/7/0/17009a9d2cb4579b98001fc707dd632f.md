The most common differential diagnosis is an aneurysmal bone cyst which closely mimics the radiographic, gross as well as microscopic features of telangiectatic osteosarcoma. This often delays the diagnosis leading to the delay in starting optimal treatment. Other differential diagnoses include:

- Giant cell tumor of bone

- Brodie abscess

- Blood clot

- Malignant fibrous histiocytoma

- Fibrosarcoma
