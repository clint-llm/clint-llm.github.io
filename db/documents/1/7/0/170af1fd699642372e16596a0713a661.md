Passive full range-of-motion exercises for paralyzed limbs should be started as early as possible( Within 24 hours, if possible). They should be referred to a physiotherapist or dedicated stroke rehabilitation team.

The clinical presentation, rather than the location of the stroke, should determine the rehabilitation focus for brainstem stroke patients.

As with any other stroke patients, other rehabilitative measures are also undertaken. Standard heparin (5000 units subcutaneous b.d.) or LMW heparin in order to prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism is advocated in bedridden patients.

Early bladder training with the removal of the indwelling catheters, laxatives, and stool softeners are also essential measures to be taken into considerations.
