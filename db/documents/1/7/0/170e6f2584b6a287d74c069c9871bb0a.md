The differential diagnoses for dysarthria include aphasia, apraxia of speech, and aphemia.

Apraxia, in general, is a dysfunction of a learned motor task. Patients need help initiating speech and transitioning between sounds; they speak through trial and error, and their errors are inconsistent. When patients are asked to repeat a phrase exactly, especially a polysyllabic word (eg, television), different errors are noted in each attempt. Isolated apraxia of speech is rare; it is usually seen with aphasia. Imaging might show lesions in the dominant insula and Brocaâ€™s area.

Aphasia is a language impairment. Depending on the location, language comprehension or production may be impaired. Patients also have difficulty writing and reading.

Aphemia is a motor speech disorder resulting in near muteness. Patients have normal comprehension, reading, and writing.
