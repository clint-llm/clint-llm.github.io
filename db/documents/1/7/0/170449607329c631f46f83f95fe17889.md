Some rare allergic reactions can occur and include but are not limited to erythema, rash, pruritis, nausea, vomit, tachycardia, dizziness, and syncope.

There are no contraindications to the gallium scan, but precautions should be taken to avoid complications:

- During pregnancy, whether suspected or confirmed, a clinical decision of risks vs. benefit must be made.

- Breastfeeding should be discontinued, with milk extraction post-procedure and breastfeeding resumed when the radiation dose to the child would be less than 1mSv. It is recommended to wait 8 hours after the 68Ga scan before milk extraction, and breastfeeding should resume.

- Pediatric cases should be carefully evaluated to avoid radiation exposure unless there is a clear suspicion of malignancy.

- It may be beneficial to cease somatostatin analog therapy before a DOTA scan.
