The Spurling test should be performed in the assessment of a patient with symptoms of cervical radiculopathy to help determine the patientâ€™s pathology and whether further imaging studies are indicated or alternative tests or diagnoses should be considered.

The Spurling test should be avoided in patients suspected of having cervical instability, such as those with cervical spondylotic myelopathy, infectious process, or malignancy (most commonly metastatic). It should also not be performed in an acute trauma setting.
