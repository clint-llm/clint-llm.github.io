Raloxifene's most common documented adverse effects are hot flashes, flu-like symptoms, muscle spasms, arthralgia, and infection. Less common effects are insomnia, vomiting, sinusitis, deep venous thrombosis (DVT), bronchitis, pharyngitis, breast pain.

The most serious adverse reaction related to raloxifene is venous thromboembolism  (pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis,  and retinal vein thrombosis). During the clinical trial, with raloxifene treatment for 2.6 years, venous thromboembolism (VTE) precipitated in about 1 out of 100 patients. A total of 26 raloxifene-exposed women had a VTE compared to 11 placebo-treated women, and the highest risk of VTE was in the initial four months of the treatment phase with raloxifene.
