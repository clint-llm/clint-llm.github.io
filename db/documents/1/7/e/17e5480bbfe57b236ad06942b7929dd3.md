Almost everyone at one time experiences tinnitus. The American Tinnitus Association estimates that 10 million people suffer from tinnitus. It is also common in non-industrialized countries.

Military personnel has a high incidence of tinnitus due to loud explosions and gunfire. It is also seen in the movie and stage workers who prepare scenes with explosions and gunfire. Musicians who are exposed to loud noise get tinnitus, for example, drummers and those who perform in front of loudspeakers. Children may have tinnitus, but it is mostly unrecognized because they do not recognize the disorder. The usual history is a worker who was exposed to very loud factory noise where workers had to shout to be heard. Many workers develop high-tone hearing loss, but only a small percentage also have tinnitus. Hyperacusis also can accompany tinnitus. In these cases, certain ordinary sounds like closing doors, moving chairs, and books dropping so loud and strong that they are extremely uncomfortable or sometimes unbearable.
