A detailed history and physical should be performed. The history and physical examination findings usually vary by the type of mediastinal cancer, its location, and the tumor's aggressiveness. Some people present with no symptoms, and cancers are typically found during imaging of the chest which is performed for other reasons. If symptoms are present, they are often a result of cancer compressing the surrounding structures or symptoms from a paraneoplastic syndrome. These symptoms may include a cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, chills, night sweat, coughing, hoarseness, unexplained weight loss, lymphadenopathy, coughing up blood, wheezing, or stridor. Mediastinal masses could also be associated with abnormalities in other parts of the body (such as testicular masses with germ cell tumors). Thus, a thorough historyÂ is necessary and includes a complete review of symptoms followed by a comprehensive physical examination. In general, malignant lesions tend to be symptomatic.
