Interprofessional team multidisciplinary collaboration is essential for optimal outcomes in low back pain treatment, and a risk/benefit analysis should always be completed before proceeding with this intervention, as any other spinal procedure, the standard of care should always be followed with conservative methods first, and a treatment plan embracing shared decision making between the patient and the health care team. Clinicians are responsible for proper diagnosis, perioperative assessment, surgical intervention, and postoperative follow-up.

In addition, in thisÂ interprofessional model, clinicians act as guides to patients along the healthcare continuum of the low back pain treatment algorithm. Nursing facilitates coordination of activities among therapists and other consultants that help patients achieve their maximum clinical improvement after the intervention and alongside the device representative and the physician educating patients on the expected pre and post-intervention course. This interprofessional, multidisciplinary model will lead to the optimization of patient outcomes. [Level 5]
