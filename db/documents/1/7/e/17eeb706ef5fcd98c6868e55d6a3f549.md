The differential diagnosis for renovascular hypertension includes potential causes of secondary hypertension, such as:

- Pheochromocytoma: Usually presents as a constellation of symptoms such as flushing, headache, tachycardia, and episodic uncontrolled hypertension.

- Primary hyperaldosteronism: Presents with persistent hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.

- Obstructive sleep apnea: Usually seen in obese males with increased neck circumference and a history of snoring. Diagnosed with polysomnography/sleep study.

- Coarctation of the aorta: Patients usually have a systolic murmur, radio-femoral delay, and upper extremity hypertension. The diagnosis is with MRA or CTA.

- Cushing syndrome: Associated with moon facies, buffalo hump, proximal myopathy, glucose intolerance, abdominal striae, and central obesity.
