Taking a detailed medical history is necessary to determine conditions like coagulopathy or respiratory compromise that may impact the decision to perform a block. A thorough physical exam is prudent as well to determine preexisting sensory or motor deficits in the distribution of the block. Studies show that patients with preexisting sensory or motor deficits may be more likely to develop new deficits following a block than patients without preexisting deficits. Following the history and physical, the patient should be made familiar with the risks, benefits, and care needed during the recovery phase of the block.

For patients that are receiving a nerve block for a surgical procedure, they should follow the same fasting guidelines for the surgery as it may be necessary for deep sedation to be used in cases of an inadequate block. Also, intravenous access should be obtained due to the risk of potential complications like vasovagal events, local anesthetic toxicity, and the possible use of general anesthetics.
