The therapeutic dosage range for inamrinone is 0.5 to 7.0 mcg/mL. The maximum daily dose of inamrinone should not exceed 10 mg/kg. The FDA recommends that the patient’s blood pressure, heart rate, electrocardiogram, electrolytes, renal function, and hepatic function be monitored carefully throughout inamrinone therapy.

Infusion of inamrinone should stop entirely if the patient experiences severe hypotension and arrhythmias or if there are signs of hepatic toxicity. It is not automatically necessary to stop administering inamrinone to patients who present with thrombocytopenia. However, it is essential to carefully monitor patients if their platelet count drops to less than 150,000 cells/mm^3.

Patients requiring inotropic support should have continuous telemetry monitoring, as patients risk developing arrhythmias.

In selected patients with heart failure with worsening clinical features, invasive hemodynamic monitoring can be useful to guide management.
