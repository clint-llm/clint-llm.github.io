Limb bud development of the lower extremity develops beginning in the fourth week of gestation. It follows upper extremity bud development by a few days. The lower extremity continues to lengthen into week 5 and undergoes a series of rotations and regional morphological development into the thigh, leg, and foot regions.  Somites give rise to dermatomes, sclerotomes, and myotomes which allow for full development of the structures within these extremities.
