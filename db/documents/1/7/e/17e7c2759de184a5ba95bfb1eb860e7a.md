Postoperative ileus is a surgical complication that requires a unified,Â interprofessional team approach to manage appropriately. Clinicians, nurses, dietitians, pharmacists, pain management team, and physiotherapists should remain in constant communication to identify the condition early and apply the management measures cordially.

Supportive management, when possible, includes electrolyte replacement, intravenous fluids, ambulation, pain control, and analgesics adjustment, as well as correcting the underlying causes. Therapists play an important role in early ambulation (regarding physical and occupational therapy) and progression of diet (regarding speech therapy). Pharmacists are also of utmost importance in medication review, limiting opioid exposure if possible, and assisting in providing alternative pain regimens.
