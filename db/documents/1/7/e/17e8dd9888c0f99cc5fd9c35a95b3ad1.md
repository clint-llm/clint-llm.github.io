Intake of nicotine from tobacco smoke or products produces stimulation and a decrease in a feeling of stress and anxiety. Thus smokers modulate their consumption to experience arousal and mood control day. Smoking may improve concentration, reaction time, and performance in specific areas. But when there is a cessation of smoking, there is the appearance of nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms may manifest as irritability, mood depression, anxiety, inability to socialize, increased appetite or desire to eat, and sleeplessness. If nicotine withdrawal is left untreated in habitual tobacco users, it may produce symptoms with similar intensity as psychiatric disorders.

The relative decrease in dopamine release following longstanding nicotine exposure is a possible explanation for many of the mood disturbances as well as tobacco craving experienced by smokers for a long time even after they have stopped smoking. The habituation to cigarette smoking is partly maintained because of conditioning. People habitually smoke cigarettes in specific situations such as after a meal, with a cup of coffee or an alcoholic drink, or in the company of friends who smoke.
