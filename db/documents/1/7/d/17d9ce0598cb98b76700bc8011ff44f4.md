Histopathologic diagnosis is by identifying microfilariae on a peripheral thick smear. Adult forms or eggs may also be seen aiding in the diagnosis. Microscopic examination of an affected tissue usually shows multiple adult filarial worms or microfilaria surrounded by dense eosinophilic infiltration and giant cells. Giemsa staining helps in recognizing microfilarial morphology. The absence or presence of a sheath and the pattern of nuclei in their tail are the key features used to differentiate among various species. Features pathognomonic of Wuchereria bancrofti are i) presence of sheath ii) absence of nuclei in the tail. Other distinctive features include cephalic space length: breadth ratio of 1 to 1, and spherical nuclei which are regularly placed and appear in a regular row, well separated without any overlapping.
