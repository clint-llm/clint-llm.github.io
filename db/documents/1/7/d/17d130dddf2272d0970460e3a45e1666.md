There are many disease states and conditions attributable to the development of pseudohyponatremia. The most common cause of pseudohyponatremia is due to severely elevated levels of cholesterol.

- Hypertriglyceridemia

- Hyperlipidemia

- Lipoprotein X accumulation (typically secondary to biliary obstruction or cholestasis such as primary biliary cirrhosis)

- Familial hypercholesterolemia

Abnormally high levels of protein, including native or exogenous immunoglobulins, may also result in pseudohyponatremia. There are a wide variety of medical conditions that can result in such accumulation of protein; notable examples include

- Chronic infectious disease states, such as the hepatitis C virus or HIV

- Malignant monoclonal gammopathies, such as multiple myeloma, POEMS syndrome, and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia

- Malignancy, particularly malignant lymphoproliferative disorders

- Myelodysplastic syndromes

- Heavy chain disease

- Light chain disease

- Immunoglobulin deposition diseases, such as amyloidosis

- Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG)
