Various purported chemical, mechanical, and infectious insults involve injury to and inflammation of the subarachnoid or subdural space. These possible causes include trauma, surgery, infection, ankylosing spondylitis, Guillain-barre syndrome, autoimmune vasculitis, and neurotoxic substances such as sulfite-containing preservatives, myelographic agents, blood, other contaminants, or local anesthetics. The injury to and inflammation of theÂ subarachnoid or subdural space precipitate collagen deposits, scar tissue encapsulation of nerve roots, fibrosis, decreased CSF flow, clumping of nerve roots, impaired blood supply, starvation of oxygen and nutrients and accumulation of waste products, nerve atrophy, nerve damage, and possibly tethered nerves. Arachnoiditis frequently results in pain and possible neurological deficits.
