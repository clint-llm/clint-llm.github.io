The diagnosis and management of PSS are best accomplished with an interprofessional team that consists of a primary care provider, sports medicine clinician, vascular surgeon, and radiologist. Patients with venous obstruction do need treatment or the arm will remain swollen and painful. After anticoagulation, decompression of the thoracic outlet is often required. Most patients do have a good outcome with treatment but depending on the state of the subclavian vein, some degree of arm swelling may persist. Today, for some cases of PSS, endovascular therapy is available.
