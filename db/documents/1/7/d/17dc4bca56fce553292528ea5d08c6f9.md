The FDA recommends celecoxib and other NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), along with acetaminophen, as first-line analgesics for patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Celecoxib also has an FDA indication for the management of acute pain in adult women and primary dysmenorrhea. Furthermore, the FDA also recommends using celecoxib as an adjunct therapy in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis to reduce the number of colorectal polyps. This activity reviews the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, toxicity, dosing, pharmacodynamics, and monitoring of celecoxib, pertinent for clinicians and other interprofessional team members to allow for appropriate utilization of celecoxib.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the mechanism of action of celecoxib.
- Identify the approved and off-label indications for celecoxib.
- Summarize the potential adverse effects of celecoxib.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to determine the appropriateness of celecoxib in the clinical setting.
