As plasma forms the liquid base of blood, the functions carried out by plasma and blood overlap. The multitude of functions include:

- Coagulation: fibrinogen plays a major role in blood clotting along with other procoagulants like thrombin and factor X.

- Defense: immunoglobulins and antibodies in plasma play an important role in the body’s defense against bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites.

- Maintenance of Osmotic Pressure: the colloidal osmotic pressure is maintained at around 25 mmHg by the plasma proteins like albumin synthesized by the liver.

- Nutrition: transportation of nutrients like glucose, amino acids, lipids, and vitamins absorbed from the digestive tract to different parts of the body act as a source of fuel for growth and development.

- Respiration: transportation of respiratory gases, i.e., carrying oxygen to the various organs and carrying carbon dioxide back to the lungs for excretion.

- Excretion: the blood removes nitrogenous waste products produced after cellular metabolism and transports them to the kidney, lungs, and skin for excretion.

- Hormones: hormones are released into the blood and transported to their target organs.

- Regulation of Acid-Base Balance: plasma proteins contribute to acid-base balance through their buffering action.

- Regulation of Body Temperature: this is maintained by balancing heat loss and heat gain in the body.

- Role in Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR): fibrinogen, an acute phase reactant, increases during acute inflammatory conditions and contributes to the increase in ESR, which is used as a diagnostic and prognostic tool.
