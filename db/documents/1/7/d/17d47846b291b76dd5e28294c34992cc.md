The long-term prognosis of ASAS is only briefly described in the literature. It is poor in general, but one study mentioned that spinal strokes have a better prognosis than cerebral strokes, which also involve cognitive damage.

Most survivors will have varying degrees of functional motor and sensory dysfunction.

Multiple factors have correlations with better or worse prognoses.

- Etiology: aortic dissection/rupture and high cervical lesions have a greater risk of death.

- Symptom severity at initial presentation: Those with more severe initial presenting symptoms have the worst outcomes.

- Improvement in the first 24 hours: Those with no improvement during the initial 24 hours have the worst outcomes.

- Female sex correlates with poorer outcomes.

- Old age is associated with poorer outcomes.
