As with all flap surgery, it is of the utmost importance to have cooperation and understanding of the flap's success. Postoperative bleeding and flap complications typically occur in the first 24-72 hours postoperatively. Intraoperatively, the surgeon needs to achieve appropriate hemostasis and protect the pedicle and prevent any postoperative complications. Postoperatively the nursing staff must be appropriately trained to understand the early signs of flap compromise.
