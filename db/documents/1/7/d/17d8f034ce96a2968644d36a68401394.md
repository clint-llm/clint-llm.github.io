A study of the pathophysiology of enuresis found decreased nocturnal antidiuretic hormone (ADH) production in patients withÂ enuresis. Due to the reduced ADH production, the patient has an increase in urine volume at night, leading to increased voiding. With this underlying pathophysiology in mind, treatments like desmopressin, an ADH analog, are used. Other theories for the pathophysiology of enuresis have included decreased bladder capacity or reduced arousal from sleep.
