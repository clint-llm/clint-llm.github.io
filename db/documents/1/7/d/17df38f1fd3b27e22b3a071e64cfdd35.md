There are limited surgical options in the dorsal column medial lemniscus pathway. Due to the abundance of nerve fibers and tracts contained in a minimal space, surgeons must focus the surgery on the particular area without disturbing the tracts around it. Even a minute error can affect the surrounding tracts and lead to severe conditions.

The advances in modern technology have led to the development of

- DTI - Diffuse tensor imaging

- DTT - Diffusion tensor tractography

These modalities better visualize the specific tracts and pathologies. The nucleus gracilis is thought to be the center where the visceral and cutaneous information integrates.

Hong et al. suggested the use of punctate midline myelotomy for the treatment of visceral pain when compared to analgesics in the treatment of cancer-related pain.
