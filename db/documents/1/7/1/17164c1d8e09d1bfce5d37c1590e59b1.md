In embryology, axial skeletal bones derive from sclerotomes and muscles are derived from myotomes.

The muscles in the body derive from mesenchymal tissue and neural crest cells. The mesenchymal tissue will differentiate into mesoderm. The mesoderm will further mature into myoblast. The myoblast is the immature cell of the muscle. Once the myoblast cluster and mature, it will become muscle tissue.
