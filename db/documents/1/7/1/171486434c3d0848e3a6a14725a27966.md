Although no significant large-scale studies have been performed about the overall incidence of this disease, it is believed that the prevalence is anywhere from 3.3 to 10%, depending on the sex and age of the patient. This disorder is associated with adult-acquired flatfoot deficiency which can cause it to be misdiagnosed, meaning the actual prevalence may be much higher than shown in the literature. The underreporting may also be due to early, asymptomatic stages of PTTD. The classic PTTD patient is an obese woman in her sixth decade of life.
