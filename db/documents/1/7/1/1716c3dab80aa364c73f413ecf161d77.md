PCM is based managed with an interprofessional team that includes a oncology nurse. PCM treatment depends on the risk stratification. Following risk stratification, all patients need to be assessed to determine their eligibility for autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). When compared with chemotherapy alone, intensified chemotherapy followed by HCT has been shown to improve both the disease-free survival and the overall survival. For high and intermediate risk groups, induction chemotherapy followed by HCT and maintenance therapy is recommended. If a patient is not a candidate for high dose chemotherapy and autologous HCT, the only treatment option is chemotherapy alone.
