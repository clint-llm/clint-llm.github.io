Unlike classic pemphigus, IgA pemphigus presents as a milder and more limited disease. With the use of appropriate treatment and follow-up, IgA pemphigus usually heals without scarring. Studies have shown recurrence of lesions with abrupt cessation of oral prednisone, thus a gradual reduction in dosage and weaning off is recommended. When IgA pemphigus isÂ associated with other diagnoses, including malignancies, gastrointestinal disease, and monoclonal gammopathy, the prognosis is based on the progression of these particular conditions.
