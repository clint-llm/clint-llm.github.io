Patients with permanent pacemakers should be educated that pacing devices can be the source of a variety of abnormal rhythms, which may result in deterioration of the patient's condition. As a result, patients should be advised to follow up regularly with their electrophysiologist to have routine device checks, which can identify any abnormal events and reprogram the device accordingly. Patients should also be advised that a fast heart rate that is higher than their usual, or that is associated with symptoms like lightheadedness or chest pain needs to be taken seriously, and they should seek medical care promptly.
