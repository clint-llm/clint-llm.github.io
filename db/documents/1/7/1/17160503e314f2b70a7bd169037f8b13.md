Conduct disorder (CD) lies on a spectrum of disruptive behavioral disorders, which also include oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). In some cases, ODD is a precursor to CD. CD is characterized by a pattern of behaviors that demonstrate aggression and violation of the rights of others and evolves over time. Conduct disorder often occurs comorbidly with other psychiatric conditions, including depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and learning disorders. Thus, a thorough psychiatric evaluation is required before initiating an appropriate treatment plan. This activity examines the presentation, evaluation, and management of conduct disorder and the role of an interprofessional team approach to the care of affected patients.
