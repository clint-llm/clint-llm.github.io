Excessive secretion of VIP from the tumor has multiple effects on different organ systems, with its primary effects being on the GI system.Â VIP is a neurotransmitter belonging to the secretin-glucagon family and consists of 28 amino acids. It is a potent stimulator of intestinal cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production and an inhibitor of gastric acid secretion. It promotes vasodilation, glycogenolysis, lipolysis, and bone resorption. Effects secondary to these actions of VIP include huge secretion of water and electrolytes from the GI epithelial cells, hypokalemia, facial flushing, decreased gastric acidity, elevated blood glucose, and hypercalcemia.
