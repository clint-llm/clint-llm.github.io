Early diagnosis and appropriate management are essential in obtaining a favorable outcome. Emergency department physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners may be the first clinicians to encounter the patient.

Postoperative patients may initially be pain-free secondary to a nerve block. The nursing staff should be aware of monitoring for a gradual expected return of pain and pre-medicate patients before the onset of unremitting pain. In any case, if the pain is out of proportion or the patient's extremity is cold or pulseless, the nursing staff should loosen the dressings, and the on-call physician should be informed.
