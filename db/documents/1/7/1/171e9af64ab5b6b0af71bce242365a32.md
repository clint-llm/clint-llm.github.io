The main contraindication is a known hypersensitivity reaction to caspofungin acetate or any other ingredients in the formulation.

There is currently inadequate data regarding the use of caspofungin in pregnancy; thus, clinicians should use it cautiously. When treatment of systemic fungal infections is necessary during pregnancy, Amphotericin B is the first-line therapy; other agents are alternatives.
