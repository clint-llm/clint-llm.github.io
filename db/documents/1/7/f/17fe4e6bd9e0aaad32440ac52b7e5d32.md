It is vital to educate the parent regarding the likelihood of survival; and what to expect regarding deformity, disability, and ambulatory capacity. Genetic counseling and prenatal screening (including ultrasonography) may be necessary during future pregnancies. The parents should also receive counseling that their children, despite their orthopedic impairments, have normal intelligence and social abilities. They should also receive information regarding the need for caution against falls to obviate recurrent fragility fractures.

Antenatal diagnosis:

Antenatal ultrasound can demonstrate OI Sillence type II by 16 weeks of fetal age. Based on the severity of disease expression, Sillence types I, III, and IV can also be diagnosable on imaging.

Parents with a history of a fetus affected by OI type II carry a 2% to 7% risk of a similarly affected fetus in future pregnancies. Antenatal diagnosis can be made in such scenarios by DNA analysis of chorionic villus samples obtained by ultrasonographic imaging.
