The lateral collateral ligament (LCL), also known as the fibular ligament serves as one of the key stabilizers of the knee joint. Originating on the lateral epicondyle of the femur and inserting on the fibular head, the lateral collateral ligament's primary purpose is to prevent excess varus stress and posterior-lateral rotation of the knee. This activity reviews the anatomy, evaluation, and treatment of lateral collateral ligament knee injuries, and highlights the role of an interprofessional team in improving care for these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of lateral collateral ligament knee injuries medical conditions and emergencies.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of lateral collateral ligament knee injuries.
- Outline the management options available for lateral collateral ligament knee injuries.
- Describe the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance lateral collateral ligament knee injuries treatment and improve outcomes.
