Any previous history of allergy to rifampin or other rifamycins (rifabutin/ rifaximin/ rifapentine) is a significant contraindication to its use. In the management of drug-resistant TB, especially rifampin-resistant TB or polydrug-resistant TB, rifampin should be avoided. TB antibiotic susceptibility should be determined in order to implement proper treatment.

It is also a potent inducer of many drug-metabolizing enzymes, notably cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and drug transporter proteins, such as hepatic P-glycoprotein. This property of rifampin reduces the efficacy of concomitantly administered drugs and thus can limit its administration. Commonly involved drugs include HIV protease inhibitors, antimycotics (itraconazole and ketoconazole), cyclosporine (can cause graft rejections), DHP CCBs, sulfonylureas, oral contraceptives, and warfarin. After starting rifampin, it takes around a week to induce drug-metabolizing enzymes and produce clinically significant interactions. Furthermore, it takes almost two weeks for this effect to wear off after stopping rifampin.
