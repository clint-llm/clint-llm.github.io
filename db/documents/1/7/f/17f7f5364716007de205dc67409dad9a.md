Tarantula venom is fatal in lab mice. However, it has not been shown to be fatal in humans.

- Polyamines

- Neurotransmitters

- Free amino acids

- Nucleotides

- Hyaluronidase

It is proposed that these components work synergistically with one another to propagate and spread the venom in order to enact a quick paralysis effect on prey.

More commonly, injury can occur from exposure to their urticating hairs, which can induce a local histamine reaction, causing irritation to the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract. These hairs have barbs along the shaft of the hair, which cause propagation deeper into tissue if not removed in a timely fashion. They can result in intense T-cell as well as IgE-mediated reactions. Anaphylaxis can occur in rare cases.
