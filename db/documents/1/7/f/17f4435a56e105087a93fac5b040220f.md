Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is caused by the measles virus, which is a single-stranded RNA virus of the Paramyxoviridae family. As one of the most contagious diseases, measles can be transmitted to 12Â to 18 persons from one infected individual. Transmission occurs through aerosols from person to person. Many complications can occur both acutely and chronically, some of which are neurological complications, like SSPE. Children less than five and adults over the age of 20 are at higher risk of death.
