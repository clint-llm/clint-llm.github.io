The worldwide incidence of PIVH ranges from 3.70 to 44.68%.

Generally, the incidence of PIVH has decreased since the 1980s. In Brazil, a progressive decline in incidence from 50.9% in 1991 to 11.9% in 2005 had been shown.

The incidence of PIVH varies based on gestational age and birth weight.Â Each additional week increase in gestational age of preterm infants with a weight of 1000 g or less decreased the probability of severe PIVH by 19%.

Based on weight, PIVH occurs in 25 to 30% of neonates less than 1500 g and occurs in up to 45% of neonates less than 1000 g.

Most patients with grade III or IV weight less than 1000 g or have a gestational age of 22 to 27 weeks; gestational age greater than 31 weeks or weight greater than 1500g rarely results in a grade III or IV (2.7%).
