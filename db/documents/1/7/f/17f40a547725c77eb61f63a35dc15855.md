In certain cases, a specimen could be taken from the neonate's vernix caseosa to check for maternal substance-use disorders and rule out related developmental abnormalities. The technique sees significant use for cocaine-misuse cases, in which traces and metabolites would exist in the vernix, but it could be useful in other cases such as in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). However, there are limited quantities available for sampling, putting the laboratories in quantitative difficulties measuring the different molecules within the specimen.

Additionally, in atopic eczema (AE) (a chronic, inflammatory skin disease, increasingly seen in children, affecting their quality of life adversely) a need for non-invasively extracted biomarkers that allow the investigation and early detection of AE to manage its development is being researched.

In forensic cases of abandoned neonates, bloody vernix caseosa could be of benefit in identifying the putative mother as the vernix can be the carrier of maternal blood.
