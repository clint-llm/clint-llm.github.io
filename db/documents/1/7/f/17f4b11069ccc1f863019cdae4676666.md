Standard hand radiographs include anteroposterior (AP), lateral, and oblique views.Â  Additional dedicated views of the thumb can be obtained to provide additional information about the injury, including Robert's view.

Based upon the radiographic appearance, Gredda classified Bennett fractures into three types, with type 1 being a fracture with a single ulnar fragment and subluxation of the metacarpal base, type 2 an impaction fracture without subluxation of the first metacarpal, and type 3 an injury with a small ulnar avulsion fragment in association with metacarpal dislocation.
