Factors such as total protein content, hormones, and total body volume status can biochemically influence electrolyte levels. Hypomagnesemia can lead to hypocalcemia due to its effects on parathyroid hormone activity. Intravenous insulin administration is associated with a spurious decrease in potassium levels as insulin shifts potassium intracellularly.

Most serum calcium is bound to proteins; albumin-bound calcium comprises about 80%. Therefore, a patient with hypoalbuminemia, as seen in liver cirrhosis or nephrotic syndrome, will demonstrate artificially abnormal serum calcium levels.
