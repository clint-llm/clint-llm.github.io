Microablative carbon-dioxide laser therapy has been noted to improve histologic changes in the lamina propria with the remodeling of collagen fibers and blood vessels and improve the vaginal flora with increased Lactobacillus spp.

Radiofrequency temperature therapy shows potential as an alternative treatment in atrophic vaginitis. However, due to the small study sizes, follow up studies are needed to evaluate the histological changes, which improved regeneration of collagen and blood vessels.
