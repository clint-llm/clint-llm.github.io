GnIH (aka RFamide-related peptide, RFRP) is a recently discovered hypothalamic neuropeptide that regulates reproduction by working on the gonadotropes, GnRH-I and II neurons, and the gonads via the GnIH receptor to exert its functions.

GnIH is believed to be involved in pubertal delay due to imbalances in the hypothalamic axes (HPT and HPG). The thyroid hormones are regulators of development and growth with an important role in pubertal onset.
