Reversal of apixaban or rivaroxaban with andexanet alfa in patients with anticoagulation therapy-induced bleeding requires coordination with an interprofessional team. Licensed independent practitioners should contact the pharmacy and nursing immediately to coordinate the process of drug preparation and administration. Nurses play a vital role in monitoring for signs and symptoms of thrombosis. Inform patients that thrombotic events may occur within 30 days after andexanet alfa treatment.

When clinicians prescribe or order factor Xa inhibitors, they should work collaboratively with the pharmacy staff to ensure proper dosing, the absence of drug interactions, and the availability of andexanet alfa.
