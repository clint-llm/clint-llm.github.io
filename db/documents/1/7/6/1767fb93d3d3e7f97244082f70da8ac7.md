Transmission of the virus has been most notably from rodent host to human host, however, the Andes virus which causes hemorrhagic fever renal syndrome has been the only strain noted to have human to human infection.

The country with the highest incidence is China with ~90% of cases (50,000 annually and in epidemic years up to 100,000).

The disease has very low morbidity however the mortality for HFRS can be anywhere from <1% to 15% (depending on the viral strain); in contrast, the mortality for HPS is up to 40%. Risk factors have not been widely studied however a study of Puumala infections noted smoking as a risk factor.
