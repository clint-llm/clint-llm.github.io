Radial nerve entrapment is an uncommon diagnosis that is prone to under-recognition. Compression or entrapment can occur at any location within the course of the nerve distribution, but the most frequent location of entrapment occurs in the proximal forearm. This most common location is typically in proximity to the supinator and often will involve the posterior interosseous nerve branch.

The radial nerve arises from C5 to C8 and provides a motor function to the extensors of the forearm, wrist, fingers, and thumb. The superficial radial nerve provides a sensory function to the posterior forearm. Depending on the location of entrapment, a patient may experience pain, numbness, weakness, and overall dysfunction, or any combination of these.
