Classically, appendicitis presents as an initial generalized or periumbilical abdominal pain that then localizes to the right lower quadrant.  As the appendix becomes more inflamed, and the adjacent parietal peritoneum is irritated, the pain becomes more localized to the right lower quadrant. Pain may or may not be accompanied by any of the following symptoms:

- Decreased appetite

- Nausea/vomiting

- Fever (40% of patients)

- Diarrhea or constipation

- Generalize malaise

- Urinary frequency or urgency

Physical exam findings are often subtle, especially in early appendicitis.

As inflammation progresses, signs of peritoneal inflammation develop. Signs include:

- Right lower quadrant guarding and rebound tenderness

- Right lower quadrant pain elicited by palpation of the left lower quadrant

- Increased abdominal pain with coughing or movement

- Rigid abdomen and involuntary guarding

The time course of symptoms is variable but typically progresses from early appendicitis at 12 to 24 hours to perforation at greater than 48 hours. Seventy-five percent of patients present within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms.

The risk of rupture is variable but is about 2% at 36 hours and increases about 5% every 12 hours after that.
