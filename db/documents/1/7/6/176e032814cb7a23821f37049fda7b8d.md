- Smoke inhalation injury occurs from either direct thermal injury, inhalation of irritants that damage respiratory tissues, or inhalation of chemicals with systemic effects/ asphyxiants.

- The majority of burn victim deaths are from respiratory failure.

- Smoke inhalation injury greatly increases mortality in burn patients.

- Longer exposure time is associated with more severe injury.

- Treatment is largely supportive, and a low threshold for intubation is important for patient survival.

- Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has shown some promise for inhalation injury, including carbon monoxide poisoning, but is not standard of care dueÂ and has limited availability.

- Primary prevention is the best deterrence of inhalation injury.
