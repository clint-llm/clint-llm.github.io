The diagnosis and management of bronchiolitis are with an interprofessional team that includes the emergency department physician, nurse practitioner, pediatrician, primary caregiver, and infectious disease consultant. The diagnosis is clinical, and in most cases, the treatment is supportive. While most children benefit from hydration, some may require antipyretics and a cool-mist humidifier. About 1-3% of children with severe bronchiolitis may require admission for more aggressive respiratory support. When the disorder is recognized and treated, the prognosis is excellent. The majority of children recover without any adverse effects. Past studies suggest that infants with severe bronchiolitis will develop wheezing in the future, but this has not been borne out by longitudinal studies.
