Patients (men and women) are reluctant or unable to adequately discuss urinary concerns, sexual dysfunction, and bowel function difficulties. In an attempt to standardize and facilitate obtaining the patientâ€™s sensitive information, the Pelvic Floor Disorders Consortium (PFDC) reviewed multiple symptoms, function, and quality of life questionnaires. The PFDC is composed of colorectal surgeons, urogynecologists, urologists, gynecologists, gastroenterologists, physiotherapists, and other advanced care practitioners indicative of the broad and complex concerns of PFD. The final IMPACT (**I**nitial**M**easurement of**Pa**tient-Reported Pelvic Floor**C**omplaints**T**ool) Long Form consists of 85 questions for men and 85 to 94 questions for women. An IMPACT Short Form reduces the questions to 34 for men and 45 for women.
