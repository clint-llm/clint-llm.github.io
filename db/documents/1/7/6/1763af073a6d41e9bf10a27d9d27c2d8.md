Although the primary function of AChE is to terminate neural transmission, investigators have found that AChE also plays a role in neural development. Embryologically, AChE is intricately involved in the development of the nervous system and is expressed by developing neurons and during periods of axonal growth (a time in which enzymatic activity does not seem to be most important). In the peripheral nervous system of chicks, transient AChE activity was found to be locally present in the dorsal root ganglions. These findings suggest that during fetal development, AChE contributes to morphogenesis in addition to its main enzymatic function.
