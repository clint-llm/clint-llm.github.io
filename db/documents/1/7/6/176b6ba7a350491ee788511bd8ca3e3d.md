Sympathetic ophthalmia is a clinical diagnosis requiring a carefully detailed history and physical exam to parse out the diagnosis from potential masqueraders. Ophthalmologists are almost always involved in caring for patients presenting with sudden onset eye pain or vision loss. Still, they may not be the first healthcare provider to evaluate the patient. Nurses, optometrists, and emergency medicine clinicians need a baseline understanding of this disease and know when to refer for subspecialty care. The patient will also require an interprofessional team that includes internal medicine clinicians and pharmacists to co-manage their disease, given the need for long-term steroid use or immunomodulator therapy.
