- Obtain adequate preoperative radiographs, especially a lateral view, to determine fracture morphology, comminution, and displacement.

- Fractures of the olecranon are intra-articular injuries and require anatomic reduction.  Be careful to reduce the bare area of the articular surface.

- Do not malreduce the fracture and narrow the distance between the coronoid process and the tip of the olecranon.

- Nondisplaced fractures may be treated with a short period of immobilization followed by a range of motion.  Close radiographic follow-up is necessary to monitor for displacement.

- The most common complication of TBW or plate fixation is hardware irritation.  Inform the patient that they may need a second general anesthetic to remove the hardware.
