The most important factors determining the prognosis are the severity and extent of mesenteric involvement at the presentation time. The underlying disorder and the extent of other organ systems involved are also vital in the overall prognosis. In most of these patients, mesenteric involvement is seen late during the disease course. Untreated, they have a very poor prognosis. Early recognition and treatment are pivotal in decreasing morbidity and mortality in patients with mesenteric vasculitis.
