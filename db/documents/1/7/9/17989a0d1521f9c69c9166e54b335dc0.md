Different biliary tree configurations have been identified through the study of cadavers, MRCP, and intraoperative cholangiogram. Most commonly, the unity of a horizontally traversed right posterior duct (RPD) and a vertically traversed right anterior duct (RAD) forms the RHD. The RHD then joins with the LHD to create a CHD. The second variant describes a trifurcated configuration where the RPD, RAD, and the LHD join at a single confluence to form a CHD. Rarely, one can see the presence of an accessory duct (Duct of Luschka) that extends from the liver and enters the gallbladder. Configurations such as abnormal emptying of the RPD or direct drainage from the RHD into the cystic duct exist but are less frequently seen.

The cystic duct typically originated from the gallbladder, joining with the CHD to form the CBD. The confluence is found in the middle third of the extrahepatic duct in the majority of the population. However, anatomical variants exist, and one must recognize them during biliary procedures. For example, a low fusion of a long cystic duct and the CHD is seen in approximately 8.6% of study subjects. In contrast, 2.1% of cystic duct fuses with proximal CHD near the liver edge. Other variants, such as the absence of cystic duct or duplicated ducts, have all been reported.
