**Deterrence**begins with awareness of the risk factors for obstetrical foot drop. Dealing with a short, obese patient with diabetes of pregnancy and a large baby should raise a concern about whether the delivery should be by cesarean section rather than vaginal delivery.

**Patient education**should be focused first of all on reassuring the patient that her condition is likely to have a good prognosis if she follows the treatment protocol. Psychological counseling should be made available to help the patient cope with this most distressing development in her delivery.

The patient should be informed of the nature of her condition. Some discussion of the mechanisms that produced her foot drop can be provided if the patient desires it, but care should be taken to reassure her that her condition is NOT her fault.

On a practical note, the patient should be counseled NEVER to sit with her legs crossed, as this may exacerbate her condition.
