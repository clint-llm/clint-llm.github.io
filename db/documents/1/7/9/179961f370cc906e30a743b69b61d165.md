**Asthma or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**

COPD is a chronic, inflammatory lung disease that results in airflow obstruction in the lungs. Muscarinic agonists cause bronchoconstriction, increase mucous secretion, and can exacerbate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma.

**Peptic Ulcer**

Peptic ulcers occur when acid erodes the protective mucous layer of the stomach and other parts of the digestive tract. Muscarinic agonists can cause an increase in gastric acid secretion and can worsen the complication of peptic ulcers.

**Coronary Vascular Disease**

Coronary vascular disease occurs when the blood vessels that supply the heart are damaged. Damaged vessels can build up cholesterol plaque that narrows the coronary arteries resulting in chest pain and shortness of breath.

**Hyperthyroidism**

Hyperthyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland produces excessive thyroxine hormone. Hyperthyroidism accelerates the body's metabolism resulting in weight loss and irregular heartbeat.
