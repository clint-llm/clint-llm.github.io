Conn syndrome was named after J. W. Conn who first described it in 1955, in a patient who had hypertension with an aldosterone-producing adenoma. The adenoma is characterized by increased aldosterone secretion from the adrenal glands, suppressed plasma renin, hypertension, and hypokalemia. Later, many other cases of adrenal hyperplasia with inappropriately elevated aldosterone secretion were described, and now the term primary hyperaldosteronism is used to describe Conn syndrome irrespective of whether the patient has an adenoma or not. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, cause and presentation of Conn syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Conn syndrome.
- Recall the laboratory features of Conn syndrome.
- List the treatment and management options available for Conn syndrome
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of Conn syndrome and improve outcomes.
