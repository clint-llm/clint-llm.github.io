MAOIs have a potent hypotensive effect, leading to almost half of their users experiencing dizziness.; this is an important adverse effect to watch for, especially in elderly patients.

A significant and potentially fatal side effect of MAOIs is the hypertensive crisis or the “cheese reaction.” This adverse event occurs when taking MAOIs along with sympathomimetic amines such as tyramine found in some fermented foods like cheese.

Serotonin syndrome, or serotonin toxicity, is another potentially life-threatening condition that can be precipitated by co-administration of MAOIs with other antidepressants or serotonergic agents. Clinical features include mental status changes such as delirium, autonomic manifestations such as tachycardia, hypertension, diarrhea, and neuromuscular hyperactivity, manifesting as tremors and hyperreflexia.

Also, abrupt cessation of MAOIs can result in antidepressant discontinuation syndrome; symptoms may include anxiety, agitation, insomnia, chills, diaphoresis, headache, irritability, malaise, and nausea.
