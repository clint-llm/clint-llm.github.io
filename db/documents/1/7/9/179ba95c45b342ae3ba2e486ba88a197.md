An autotransfusion is a tool that should be considered in every trauma patient while in the emergency department. It can also be used in patients undergoing surgery or with anticipated blood loss, provided there are no contraindications. It has the benefit of reduced risk to the patient for transfusion reactions as well as possible cost-saving benefits. Autotransfusion can be used in conjunction with cross-matched blood and can help provide a temporary measure while waiting for cross-matched blood to arrive. The setup is relatively straightforward and does not require significantly extra time or resources.
