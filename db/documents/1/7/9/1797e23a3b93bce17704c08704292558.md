Biopsies of ganglion cysts are not routinely indicated because of their inherently benign nature. Typical histopathological appearance is a mucin-filled synovial cell lined sac withoutÂ a true epithelial lining. Ganglion cysts can be single or multiloculated. When examined under electron microscopy, their walls contain sheets of collagen fibers arranged in multidirectional layers with intermittent flattened cells resembling fibroblasts. The thick mucinous material present in the majority of ganglion cysts is highly viscous, which is attributed to a high concentration of hyaluronic acid and mucopolysaccharides.
