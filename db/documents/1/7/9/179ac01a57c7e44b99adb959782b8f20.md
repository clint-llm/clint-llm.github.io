Neonatal patients with high bilirubin levels should be promptly treated to avoid kernicterus. Diagnostic workup should follow to determine the cause of hyperbilirubinemia, and hereditary spherocytosis should be a consideration as newborns do not typically present the same signs and symptoms as older infants.

As discussed above, the indication for splenectomy should focus on improving the quality of life. Particularly for patients with frequent aplastic crises, a decision should include a thorough discussion with patients or parents regarding the risks and benefits of surgical therapy.

Healthcare workers, including physicians, PAs, nurse practitioners, nurses, and pharmacists who see patients with anemia in young people should consider the possibility of hereditary spherocytosis and refer these patients to a hematologist for diagnostic workup. Even after hematologic referral, an interprofessional team approach including all of the above disciplines working collaboratively can help achieve the best patient outcomes, regardless of the therapeutic direction chosen in any specific case.
