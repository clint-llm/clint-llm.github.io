The process of angiogenesis for all blood vessels begins with the angioblast, which arises from the mesoderm.

The vertebral arteries, which give rise to the basilar artery, are a derivative from connections of the lateral branches of the dorsal intersegmental arteries. These are paired embryonic branches of the aorta part of which later become cervical intersegmental. The lateral branches of the cervical intersegmental join to become vertebral arteries.

The AICA develops as a branch of the longitudinal neural system.
