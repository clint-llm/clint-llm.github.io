Before placing an intragastric balloon, a patient should be seen in the office to review the procedure and obtain consent. The risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure must be explained. For a patient to be prepared for intragastric balloon placement, there are recommendations that a patient adheres to a clear liquid diet a few days before the procedure to empty the stomach.

A proton pump inhibitor should be started before insertion to reduce the amount of stomach acid secretion within the stomach. A nutritionist must evaluate a patient before and throughout the treatment process until at least six months post-balloon removal. The patient is made NPO at midnight the night before the procedure.
