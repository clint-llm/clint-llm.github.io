It is important to provide patient education regarding the expected natural history of symptoms, the strategies they should employ to manage symptoms at home, and the circumstances that should prompt them to seek additional medical care. This anticipatory guidance empowers patients to recognize and treat their symptoms earlier in the course of illness. Ideally, appropriate early management of symptoms will decrease the likelihood of symptom progression, thereby reducing the need for more aggressive and costly therapies. When patients require additional treatment, providing education about medication regimens, common adverse effects, and expected outcomes will help to increase patient satisfaction.
