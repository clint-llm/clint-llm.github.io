Evaluating the range of motion and stability are often difficultÂ due to pain.

The neurovascular exam is very important to assess the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis arteries. The soft tissues must be assessed to identify any signs or symptoms of compartment syndrome. The skin should be evaluated for lesions, abrasions, fractures blisters and the condition of the compartments. To appropriately diagnose compartment syndrome, a high threshold of suspicion is necessary. Recommended imaging includes full-length AP and lateral views of the affected area, AP, lateral and oblique views of the ipsilateral knee and ankle. CT scan is indicated to identify an intra-articular involvement and exclude posterior malleolar fracture in spiral distal third fractures.

**Classifications**

Some classifications help with treatment decisions.

**Oestern and Tscherne
**

This is a classification of closed fracture soft tissue injury and is as follows:

- Grade 0: Injuries from indirect forces with minimal soft tissue damage

- Grade 1: Superficial contusion/ abrasion, simple fractures

- Grade II: Deep abrasions, muscle/skin contusion, direct trauma, impending compartment syndrome

- Grade III: Excessive skin contusion, crushed skin or muscle destruction, subcutaneous degloving, acute compartment syndrome, and rupture of a major blood vessel or nerve

**The Gustilo-Anderson
**

This classification is used to assess open tibia fractures.

- Type I is limited periosteal stripping, clean wound less than 1 cm

- Type II mild to moderate periosteal stripping; wound greater than 1 cm in length

- Type IIIA significant soft tissue injury, significant periosteal stripping with a wound that is usually greater than 1 cm in length with no flap required

- Type IIIB is significant periosteal stripping and soft tissue injury with a flap required due to inadequate soft tissue coverage

- Type IIIC these are significant soft tissue injury with a vascular injury requiring repair
