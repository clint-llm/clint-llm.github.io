Chlorpromazine is a typical antipsychotic medication primarily used to treat psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, but it also has other indications.

- Schizophrenia (primarily the positive symptoms)

- Bipolar I acute manic type of manic-depressive illness

- Acute agitation marked by explosive hyperexcitable behavior out of proportion to the initial provocation

- To control nausea and vomiting, including intraoperative nausea and vomiting

- Persistent singultus (chronic hiccups)

- Relief of apprehension before surgery

- Adjunct treatment of tetanus

- Acute intermittent porphyria

- Adjunct treatment of serotonin syndrome (off-label)

- Migraine associated relief of nausea and vomiting (off-label)

The efficacy of chlorpromazine in bipolar disorder was mainly established to control the manic episode of bipolar illness, such as excessive energy, decreased need for sleep, increased excitability and impulsivity, and grandiose ideations. Chlorpromazine is the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for persistent singultus, a medical problem where hiccupping can last for more than 48 hours. Regarding acute psychosis, studies have shown that chlorpromazine has been effective as a short-term treatment in controlling combativeness and aggressive behavior in children.
