Although liver biopsy is not required for diagnosis, drug-induced hepatotoxicity can be classified based on histologic findings. The histological appearance can also assist in identifying an etiology, excluding other diagnoses, and thus drive management. It is also a tool that can assist in prognostication.

- Acute hepatocellular injury: severe inflammation with necrosis and apoptosis seen in isoniazid (INH), aspirin, and phenytoin

- Chronic hepatocellular injury: findings as above with fibrosis resembling other chronic liver disease seen in amoxicillin-clavulanate, valproic acid, amiodarone

- Acute cholestasis: bile plugging with hepatocellular cholestasis, commonly seen in anabolic steroid use

- Chronic cholestasis: bile stasis, portal inflammation, bile jury, bile plugs, and duct paucity seen in amoxicillin-clavulanate

- Steatosis: microvesicular often related to mitochondrial injury seen in tetracycline and valproic acid

- Zonal necrosis: usually in intrinsic DILI and associated with poor outcomes, seen in acetaminophen toxicity

- Granulomas: are associated with milder injury and can result from many drugs, or even talc exposure through the bloodstream
