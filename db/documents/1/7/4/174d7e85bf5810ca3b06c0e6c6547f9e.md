The DTaP vaccine is a combination vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. ItÂ consists of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids (inactivated toxins) and acellular pertussis antigens. The tetanus component of the vaccine is about 5 to 10 levels of flocculation (Lf) units of manufactured tetanus toxoid. The diphtheria component is a manufactured diphtheria toxoid of about 15 to 25 Lf units. The acellular pertussis component of a DTaP vaccine consists of manufactured pertussis antigens called pertussis toxin, filamentous haemagglutinin, pertactin, and fimbriae type 2 and 3.

The vaccine produces an active immune response of the body by developing antibodies and antitoxins against the toxoids and acellular pertussis antigens. There are two single DTaP vaccines available in the United States and approved by the FDA.
