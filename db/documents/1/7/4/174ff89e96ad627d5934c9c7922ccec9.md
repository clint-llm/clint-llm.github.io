No studies examine prevention strategies. Theoretically, proper cuff function can help decrease the risk of degenerative tears. In an observational study, rotator cuff tearsÂ were seen more predominately in those with specific postures. Also, another study looking at radiographically measured subacromial space found reduced acromiohumeral space correlated with hyperkyphotic posture.
