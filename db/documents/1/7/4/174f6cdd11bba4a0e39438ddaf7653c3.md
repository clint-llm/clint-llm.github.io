The majority of Cameron lesions cases go undiagnosed due to the absence of acute signs and symptoms, an occult bleeding pattern, and difficulty in visualization on endoscopy. The lesions are difficult to diagnose due to their location and small size. They often require multiple endoscopies before the diagnosis is made. The physicians and gastroenterologists should consider this condition in the differentials for intermittent or massive GI bleed. Once diagnosed, the patient should be started on appropriate medical therapy and have regular follow-ups to ensure resolution. If the lesions and the symptoms persist, the physician should refer the patient for endoscopic and surgical management.

An interprofessional healthcare team consisting of clinicians, NPS and PAs, nursing staff, and pharmacists operating as a collaborative unit is the best means to achieve optimal results in cases of Cameron lesions. [Level 5]
