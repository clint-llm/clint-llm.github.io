Although lesions in erythrokeratodermia variabilis may closely resemble in early stages those of urticaria, differentiating factors include the longer duration of the disease and the occasional presence of scales.

In Netherton syndrome, ichthyosis demonstrates migratory and serpiginous red plaques that are typical with double-edged scaly borders, and patients usually have other manifestations, including hair shaft abnormalities, eczematous lesions, and pruritus. Differential diagnosis also includes different rare types of ichthyosis such as erythrokeratolysis hiemalis, epidermolytic ichthyosis due to KRT1 and KRT10 mutations, and Greither syndrome.
