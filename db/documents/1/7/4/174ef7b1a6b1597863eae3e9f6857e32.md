Diagnosis is mainly clinical, and the primary managing team must maintain a high index of suspicion for tetramine toxicity. There are case reports of documented electroencephalography (EEG) changes, including diffuse slow waves, spike-and-slow waves, and sharp and slow waves in children.

MultipleÂ studies describe diagnostic testing; however, these tests are not readily available, limiting their benefit in the clinical setting. Gas chromatography with nitrogen phosphorous detection is described as a sensitive technique to detect tetramine.

No pathognomonic findings are reported on CT imaging or MRI for tetramine toxicity.

Findings on autopsy note lung edema and congestion in all documented cases.
