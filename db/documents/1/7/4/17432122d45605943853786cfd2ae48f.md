The most common differential diagnosis of trigonocephaly is a metopic ridge, which is physiological and does not need surgery. Trigonocephaly presents at a younger age, and the appearance of the lateral frontal bone and lateral orbit can help distinguish whether the condition is pathological.

The single metopic suture craniosynostosis has to be differentiated from syndromic craniosynostosis, which most commonly involves the coronal suture producing brachycephaly.
