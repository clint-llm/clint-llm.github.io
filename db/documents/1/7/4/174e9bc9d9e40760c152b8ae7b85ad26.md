Patients should receive counseling in all cases of the prolonged time course to symptomatic resolution. Even with strict adherence to a treatment regimen, immediate symptomatic relief is unusual. Purposeful discussion with patients or parents of patients regarding expectations may avoid unnecessary, time-consuming, and costly return visits to the primary care, urgent care, or emergency room setting. However, patients should also have specific counseling regarding warning signs; specifically, decrease in vision, worsening pain, increased photophobia, worsening discharge, or lack of response to therapy after 1 week of treatment.
