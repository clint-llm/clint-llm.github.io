Bladder diverticula are protrusions of the bladder urothelium and mucosa via muscle fibers of the bladder wall, the muscularis propria, which results in a thin-walled structure connected to the bladder lumen and poorly empties during micturition.Â Bladder diverticula occur either to congenital or acquired causes. They affect both adults and children. Unlike the acquired adult form, in which outlet obstruction or neurogenic dysfunction is virtually usually present, congenital bladder diverticula arise from hypoplasia of the muscular layer of the bladder wall.

They tend to be more prevalent in adults and affect males more than females.
