Familiarity with ethical principles on a basic level is necessary to practice medicine. However, most healthcare providers are unable to explain how or why medical ethics principles have come to be and justify how they apply medical ethics principles in a systematic fashion. Many different medical ethics guidelines are available, such as from the American Medical Association (AMA), American Osteopathic Association (AOA), and the American College of Physicians (ACP). Given the lack of definitive ethical standards and premises, let alone a hierarchy or algorithm for prioritizing them, clinicians still face challenges in achieving satisfactory solutions to ethical challenges for themselves, their patients, and other parties involved. Because medical ethics issues are not limited to physicians, this article is written to be useful for both physicians and non-physicians. The neutral term "healthcare provider" is used in circumstances that apply to both physicians and non-physicians.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the formation and functions of medical ethics principles.
- Summarize how law, science, religion, and non-medical ethics disciplines affect the discipline of medical ethics.
- Explain how to apply medical ethics principles when attempting to resolve a medical ethics dilemma.

- Outline how the interprofessional team can work together to advance medical ethics and patient outcomes.
