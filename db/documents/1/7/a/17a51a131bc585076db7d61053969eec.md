The gynecological exam traditionally includes an examination of the external and internal genitalia. Under some conditions, it may be necessary to perform a rectal examination as well. Gynecological exams are typically done for screening starting at the age of 21 and at regular intervals subsequent to that, and for patients with gynecological complaints. The exam may help with the early detection of tumors and improve outcomes.
