The surgical technique for extraction of unerupted teeth can be described into three main steps. First, reflect an adequately-sized flap to allow access. Then, remove the bone surrounding the impacted tooth. The surgical handpiece used for bone removal must exhaust air pressure away from the surgical site to avoid air embolism or tissue emphysema. If extracting mandibular impacted teeth, avoid removing lingual bone to avoid damaging lingual nerve.

Once the impacted tooth is exposed, section the tooth into appropriate pieces. Using the surgical handpiece and bur, section the tooth three-quarters of the way towards the lingual aspect, then split the remaining union using an elevator. For impacted molars, orient the surgical bur parallel to the buccal groove.

Full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap and split-thickness mucoperiosteal flap are the two basic surgical flap designs used in dentoalveolar surgery.

Releasing incisions are contraindicated in the palate, the lingual surface of the mandible, the canine eminence, and near the mental foramen. For impacted mandibular molars, the envelope flap is one of the more commonly used flap designs in dental surgery. It should extend from the first molar to the posterior aspect of the impacted tooth. The flap should also reflect laterally towards the external oblique ridge.
