It is noteworthy that not all DNA mutations will have an impact on protein synthesis or function. There are various types of mutations, such as silent, missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations.

A silent mutation is a nucleotide substitution that codes for the same amino acid; therefore, there is no change in the amino acid sequence or protein function.

A missense mutation is when a nucleotide substitution results in an amino acid change. Missense mutations have variable effects but can lead to a decreased or altered protein function (e.g., sickle cell disease).

A nonsense mutation is when a nucleotide substitution results in a new stop codon, which includes UGA, UAA, and UAG (remember the mnemonic "U Go Away, U Are Away, and U Are Gone," respectively). These protein products are truncated and frequently nonfunctional (e.g., cystic fibrosis).

A frameshift mutation occurs through the addition or deletion of nucleotides not divisible by 3, resulting in the misreading of the downstream nucleotides. These proteins may be shorter or longer, and protein function may be disrupted or altered (e.g., Duchenne muscular dystrophy).

Other types of mutations exist outside of the coding sequence. These include splice site, promoter or enhancer sequence, and termination site mutations.Â For example, in some forms of B-thalassemia, a mutated splice site results in the use of cryptic splice locations, causing impaired B-globin synthesis.
