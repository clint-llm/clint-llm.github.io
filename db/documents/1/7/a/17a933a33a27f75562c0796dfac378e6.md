Symptoms associated with piriformis syndrome occur from compression of the sciatic nerve by the piriformis muscle. The cause of compression and subsequent nerve irritation is variable. It can result from overuse or repetitive trauma where overtraining or sitting on hard surfaces can cause direct or indirect injury to the muscle or nerve.

Athletes and weightlifters are prone to intermittent symptom exacerbation secondary to increased training requirements and activities.  In these cases, the piriformis muscle itself becomes hypertrophied and causes direct pressure on the nerve.

Acute trauma like blunt forces can also result in hematoma formation and subsequent scarring between the sciatic nerve and the short external rotators (piriformis, superior and inferior gemelli, quadratus femoris). Anomalous anatomic relationships of the sciatic nerve with the piriformis muscle have also been implicated where the nerve is more susceptible to compression because of the variant anatomy.  Beaton and Anson originally described 6 different anatomic relationships between the sciatic nerve and piriformis muscle.  In >80% of the population, the sciatic nerve passes deep and exits inferiorly to the inferior edge of the muscle belly/tendon

There have also been numerous case reports that show that other conditions have been associated with piriformis syndrome which includes pyomyositis, aberrant fibrous bands, myositis ossificans, and pseudoaneurysms.
