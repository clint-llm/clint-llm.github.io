Pneumocystis was once considered an AIDS-defining illness, but due to prophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy, the incidence of disease in HIV-infected individuals has been drastically reduced.

Symptoms include fever, exertional dyspnea, and dry cough, and the diagnosis should be suspected in anyone with compromised immunity, such as cancer, transplant patients, or those on immunosuppressive therapies.

Treatment is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, although other lines of therapy exist for those with allergies or severe illness.

Prevention is also with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and recommended in certain populations such as HIV- infected individuals with CD4+ counts less than 200 cells/microL or CD4+ less than 14%, presence of oropharyngeal candidiasis, and a CD4+ of 200-250 cells/microL when ART cannot be started or if monitoring of CD4+ counts every three months is not possible.

The illness can be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe, and new recommendations suggest the use of glucocorticoids in HIV-infected patients with a room air arterial blood gas partial pressure of oxygen that is less than or equal to 70 mm Hg, an alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient greater than or equal to 35 mm Hg, or hypoxia on pulse oximetry should receive steroids.

Any patients needing corticosteroids should be admitted to the hospital for monitoring and into the ICU for respiratory failure and continued monitoring.
