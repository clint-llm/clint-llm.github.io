A sedentary lifestyle is associated with increased disease risk and all-cause mortality.

Patient questionnaires about physical activity should be provided at every preventive visit by the clinical nurse to identify those at the highest risk of inactivity-related adverse outcomes. The clinical nurse and medical provider should educate patients on ways to safely increase physical activity levels to ensure patient compliance. Occupational and physical therapists should implement safe and effective rehabilitation programs focused on strengthening and increasing the physical function of all patients.

The healthcare team should educate the patient about the incremental benefits of physical activity at every level. The patient should be taught that even a small increase in physical activity can provide health benefits and that no threshold level of action must be achieved before benefits begin.

The key message in all guidelines is that any amount of physical activity is better than inactivity. Moving more and sitting less throughout the day is the recommended motto and should be promoted by the healthcare team. A well-integrated interprofessional team of clinical providers can significantly reduce inactivity-related chronic diseases in the United States and improve health care outcomes. [Level 5]
