Seroma is the abnormal accumulation of serous fluid in a dead space containing plasma and lymphatic fluid.

The etiology of seroma formation remains unclear but is thought to be due to disruption of lymphatic and vascular drainage through extensive soft tissue dissection with an accumulation of serum, and possibly inflammatory exudate, in a dead space.

These fluid collections can cause pain and anxiety for the patient necessitating further outpatient and hospital visits, leading to increased cost of care. Local wound complications can occur, such as wound dehiscence and flap necrosis, requiring further surgical intervention.

Although current research trends are focussed on prevention, the mainstay of postoperative management of seroma includes conservative measures and fine needle aspirations.
