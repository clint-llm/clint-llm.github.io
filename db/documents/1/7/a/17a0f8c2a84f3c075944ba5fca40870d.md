Hypotension is a decrease in systemic blood pressure below accepted low values. While there is not an accepted standard hypotensive value, pressures less than 90/60 are recognized as hypotensive. Hypotension is a relatively benign condition that is under-recognized mainly because it is typically asymptomatic. It only becomes a concern once pumping pressure is not sufficient to perfuse key organs with oxygenated blood. This activity reviews the causes of hypotension and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the common causes of hypotension.
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with hypotension.
- Outline the treatment of hypotension.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by hypotension.
