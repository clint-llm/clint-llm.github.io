Clinical diagnosis of sialolithiasis can be challenging as patients may not be symptomatic unless the stone obstructs the salivary ducts, termed sialadenitis. Patients with obstructing stones will commonly present a history of unilateral salivary gland swelling and acute onset of pain that worsens with meals.

Salivary stones’ size and weight vary. Sialoliths’ diameter ranges between 2.1 and 10 mm, and only 7.6% exceeds 15 mm in diameter.
