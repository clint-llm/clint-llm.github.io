A heart-lung transplant is performed for unsalvagable dual cardiac and pulmonary failure. An organ transplant is an established life-saving therapy for these patients. The most common underlying conditions requiring heart-lung transplants are congenital cardiac diseases with Eisenmenger syndrome and certain pulmonary hypertension disorders. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of dual cardiac and pulmonary failure and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications and contraindications for heart-lung transplant surgery.
- Outline the technical steps of a successful heart-lung transplant.
- Describe early and late complications of dual heart-lung transplant surgery.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the heart-lung transplant outcomes.
