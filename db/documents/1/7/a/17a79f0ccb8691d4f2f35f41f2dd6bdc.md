Both eccrine and apocrine glands secrete in a merocrine manner such that substances are released by exocytosis without damage or loss of the secreting cell.

Eccrine sweat glands allow for temperature control. When body temperature rises during physical activity, increased ambient temperature, or fever, these glands respond by secreting sweat. This sweat is eventually evaporated from the surface of the skin, effectively cooling down body temperature. The initial sweat released by eccrine glands is made up of water as well as sodium and potassium ions; however, the epithelial lining of the ducts reabsorbs a majority of these ions, resulting in a larger water composition of sweat.

Apocrine glands present at birth do not become active until puberty. In some mammals, these glands act as the main thermoregulator; however, their function is unknown in humans. Some hypothesize that apocrine glands are responsible for body odor or pheromone production. While the initial secretion of apocrine glands is milky and odorless, bacteria on the skin surface eventually break down the fluid, releasing a distinctive odor.
