Reference intervals of amylase differ between the various available assays method because of differences in substrates used and reagent preparations.

Blood amylase activity of newborns is approximately 18% of adults. There are no significant differences between males and females in the serum activity of amylase. In healthy adults, P-AMY represents approximately 40% to 50% of total amylase activity in serum. Serum P-AMY activity is not demonstrable in most children younger than six months, but activity rises slowly after that to reach adult concentrations at five years of age, reflecting the postnatal development of the exocrine pancreatic function.

Currently, there is no internationally established reference range for amylase levels. The reference range can be as wide as 20 to 300 U/L. However, elevated amylase levels of more than three times the upper limit of normal strongly support the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.

A finding of persistently raised total amylase and normal lipase should raise the possibility of macroamylasemia. Amylase creatinine clearance ratio (ACCR) or polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation are useful screening tests for macroamylase.
