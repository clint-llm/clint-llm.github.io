**PAPVC**

Patients with a single anomalous vein and an intact atrial septum usually remain asymptomatic. The presence of untreated larger left to right shunts can lead to pulmonary vascular remodeling and subsequent development of pulmonary hypertension. Surgical corrections of PAPVC have good outcomes with a low complication rate and typically lead to an immediate resolution of symptoms. Infants with Scimitar syndrome have a poorer outcome due to complex anatomy and the presence of other co-existing cardiac anomalies.

**TAPVC**

In untreated patients, TAPVC is almost always fatal within the first few weeks of life. The long term survival in patients has increased with the improvement in medical management and surgical techniques.

**Postoperative Course**

The risk factors for increased mortality include younger age at surgery, associated cardiac lesions, hypoplastic pulmonary veins, postoperative pulmonary hypertension, and postoperative pulmonary venous obstruction (PVO).
