The method relies on the placement of a Clark-type polarographic oxygen electrode on the skin where it heats up, usually to 43.5 C, causes vasodilatation in the underlying arterioles and capillaries, improves oxygen diffusion towards the electrode, and eventually provides the reading of the partial oxygen pressure at that specific site. An adhesive ring filled with a specific solution provides the attachment of the electrode to the skin. Following the attachment of the electrode, the application requires a strict calibration prior to the measurement. The system incorporates a thermistor which keeps the temperature between 42 C to 45 C and avoids thermal trauma.
