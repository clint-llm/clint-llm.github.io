After a 400 mg oral dose of N-acetylcysteine, the maximum plasma concentration was calculated to be 3.47 mg/L, taking 30 minutes to achieve it. The volume of distribution for N-acetylcysteine varies from 0.33 to 0.47 L/kg. 4 hours after an intravenous dose, 50% of the drug was found to be bound to plasma proteins. N-acetylcysteine undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the gut wall and liver when administered orally, leading to about 6 to 10% bioavailability. A majority of the elimination of this drug is non-renal, and the kidneys eliminated only 30%.

Animal studies have shown a minimal systemic absorption after aerosol inhalation of dornase alfa. Inhalation of even very high doses (10mg three times a day) did not significantly increase the serum DNase concentration.

Carbocisteine shows one-compartment open model kinetics after absorption and achieves its peak plasma concentration in 1 to 1.7 hours. The drug undergoes partial metabolism in the liver, and up to 60% of the drug is excreted by the kidneys unchanged.

Following oral administration, Erdosteine reaches its peak plasma concentration in 1.4 hours and has a similar elimination half-life. It contains two sulfhydryl groups that are blocked. These are released only after its hepatic metabolism, which confers the valuable property of not affecting the mucus lining the stomach. No significant drug accumulation has been reported.

**Drug Interactions**

- Oral N-acetylcysteine must not be given with activated charcoal, as a 3 g preparation will adsorb 54.6% of the drug, and a 6 g preparation will adsorb 96.2% of the drug, markedly reducing its efficacy.

- N-Acetylcysteine provides local protection from the toxic metabolites of intravenous cyclophosphamide to the urethra, bladder, ureters, and kidneys when administered orally along with it.

- Evidence suggests that N-Acetylcysteine can prevent doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy in animal models when co-administered.

- Dornase alfa has been shown to greatly potentiate the antibiotic effect of tobramycin and amikacin against multiple strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.

- Administration of erdosteine with amoxicillin in patients with an acute infective exacerbation of chronic bronchitis resulted in higher concentrations of the antibiotic in the sputum, leading to earlier and more pronounced amelioration of clinical symptoms compared with placebo.

- A higher concentration of amoxicillin in the sputum of patients suffering from an acute infective exacerbation of chronic bronchitis was reported when it was co-administered with erdosteine.
