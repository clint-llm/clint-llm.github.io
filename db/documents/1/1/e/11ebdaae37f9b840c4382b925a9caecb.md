Following the resection of granular cell tumors, patients should monitor for metastatic and recurrent lesions. This is especially true with malignant tumors. They should also be reminded to keep their follow-up appointments for appropriate surveillance imaging of metastatic lesions or nodules which were not excised (small esophageal tumors). This will allow for the proper treatment of any newly discovered tumors.

Patients with multiple granular cell tumors should also be educated about the possible association with neurofibromatosis I, Noonan syndrome, and LEOPARD syndrome (**l**entigines,**e**lectrocardiogram (ECG) conduction abnormalities,**o**cular hypertelorism,**p**ulmonic stenosis,**a**bnormal genitalia,**r**etardation of growth, and sensorineural**d**eafness). They will likely need a thorough exam and additional studies to rule these out.
