Reflux esophagitis is considered one of the commonest diseases encountered by gastroenterologists and primary care providers. Reflux esophagitis is defined as inflammation of the esophageal mucosa secondary to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition in which the stomach contents reflux into the esophagus or beyond (oral cavity, larynx, or the lungs), causing troublesome symptoms and complications.

The American College of Gastroenterology defines GERD as “chronic symptoms or mucosal damage incurred by the abnormal reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus.”

The disease is primarily a disorder of the lower esophageal sphincter. It can be classified based on the presence of symptoms without erosions on endoscopic examination (non-erosive disease, NERD) or symptoms plus esophageal erosions (erosive reflux disease, ERD). While the disease is particularly more common in men, it is more likely to be NERD when it occurs in women. The diagnosis is usually established based on a combination of presenting symptoms, objective testing with endoscopy, ambulatory reflux monitoring, and response to a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy.

Esophageal reflux may result in several complications, including esophagitis, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, peptic ulcer, peptic stricture, dysphagia, cancer of gastric cardia, and Barrett esophagus.
