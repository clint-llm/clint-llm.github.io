Triamcinolone falls under the corticosteroid drug classâ€”specifically, it is a glucocorticoid. It exhibits anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant activity via inhibiting the phospholipase A2 enzyme on the cell membrane phospholipid layer, thereby hindering the breakdown of leukocyte lysosomal membranes and preventing the formation of arachidonic acid.

Triamcinolone metabolism is primarily hepatic, and elimination is via both renal and fecal pathways. The onset of action and duration of triamcinolone varies because it depends on the route of administration in the body. The medication has a rapid absorption rate in the body following oral intake. Triamcinolone has a half-life of between 18 to 36 hours, and peak triamcinolone concentrations occur within 1.5 to 2 hours following oral administration.
