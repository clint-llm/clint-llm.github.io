Macrocytic anemia is a special blood disorder in which the body is not able to form enough blood cells because it lacks necessary nutrients. Some patients do not eat enough foods with these nutrients (folate or vitamin B12), while others cannot absorb it or have an underlying condition that makes it difficult for the body to keep up with its needs. Patients may feel tired, have memory or mood disturbances, or notice tingling in the arms and legs. Physicians can diagnose the anemia during an office visit and lab work. Treatment involves addressing the underlying cause and nutrient supplementation.
