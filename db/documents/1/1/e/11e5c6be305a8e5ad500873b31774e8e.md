Fatal familial insomnia (FFI) remains neuropathologically ambiguous but is seen to manifest as a focal neuronal loss in the thalamus, inferior olivary nucleus, cerebellum, and varying degrees of spongiform changes in the cerebral cortex.

FFI is described to mainly affect the thalamus with a propensity for anterior ventral and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei. Other parts of the brain, including the inferior olives of the medulla oblongata and the cerebral cortex, have also been shown to be involved.

Parietal, temporal, and frontal lobes have shown higher degrees of involvement compared to the occipital lobe. Furthermore, the entorhinal cortex shows involvement in almost all cases, and the degree of spongiosis and astrogliosis is positively correlated to the duration of the disease. The prion protein’s deposition pattern favors the brainstem and thalamus earlier in the disease, but the thalamus is understood to be more vulnerable to subsequent degenerative changes. The reason for this involvement pattern is poorly understood but can explain the variety of symptoms seen in the disease.
