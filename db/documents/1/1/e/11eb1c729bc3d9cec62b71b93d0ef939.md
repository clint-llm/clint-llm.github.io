Preparation for surgery is key in subsequent patient outcomes. There are multiple components to preparing someone for an ileal conduit arising at first from the initial consultation involving their diagnosis and further discussing the operative procedure itself and what the creation of an ileal conduit involves. They may need to be referred to other multidisciplinary team members to optimize their cardiovascular status via focussed anesthetic assessment and exercise programs. The patient also needs to be prepared for both the practicalities and psychological impact of living with a stoma.

The stoma site should be chosen with care, and often after the patient has worn an appliance filled with water and tested lying down and sitting up and with and without clothes on. The operating surgeon should ensure not to place the stoma on a scar, skin crease, or under the beltline. The stoma nurses' input from early on in the patient journey is key so that patients know what to expect after their surgery is over, which helps them progress quickly with their recovery.
