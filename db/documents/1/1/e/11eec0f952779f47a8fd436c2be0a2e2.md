A simple bone cyst is a solitary, benign, fluid-filled, cyst that may be a single chamber or septated. The most common sites are the proximal humerus and proximal femur. An aneurysmal bone cyst is a locally destructive, rare, blood-filled, benign cystic bone tumor that involves the metaphysis of long bones in children and young adults. Although they can involve any bone, the most common sites are the distal femur, proximal humerus, proximal tibia, and spine. Most cases present with mild to moderate pain. The rapid growth of lesion may mimic malignancy. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of bone cysts and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of bone cysts.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with a bone cyst.
- Summarize the treatment options for bone cyst.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team in distinguishing bone cysts on clinical and radiological presentations, which will lead to better patient outcomes.
