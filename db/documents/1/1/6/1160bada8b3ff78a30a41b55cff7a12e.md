In the absence of associated malignancy or inflammatory bowel disease, Sweet syndrome is usually highly steroid-responsive and self-limiting. A 2 to 4-week tapering course of oral prednisone starting at a daily dose of 40 mg to 60 mg is usually effective. Intralesional corticosteroid injections and topical corticosteroids can also be used, especially in localized Sweet syndrome. In cases of recurrence of disease after corticosteroid tapering, several steroid-sparing agents have reportedly shown efficacy, including potassium iodide, colchicine, dapsone, isotretinoin, methotrexate, doxycycline, indomethacin, chlorambucil, and cyclosporine.
