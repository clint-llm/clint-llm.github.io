Many programs have been started by the WHO to help diagnose and manage ascariasis. However, this parasite affects close to 1.2 billion people, and an interprofessional approach is the only way to fight the infection. Besides infectious diseases, the primary care provider, including nurses and pharmacists, play a vital role in the education of the patient and their families on sanitation, washing food, and the importance of clean water.

**Outcomes**

Ascariasis needs to be tackled on a broader spectrum rather than just healthcare. There is a need for improvedÂ farming practices, food and personal hygiene, and the availability of clean drinking water. Also of importance is to remove cultural perceptions and improve compliance with medications. Ascariasis has enormous morbidity and affects many organs in the body. While the mortality rates are unknown, the numbers are not minuscule. The WHO has stepped in and is working with an interprofessional group of healthcare workers to lower the burden of this parasite.
