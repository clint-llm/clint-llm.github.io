Chronic pain is a leading chief complaint in an adult ambulatory care setting

In Europe, many studies reported a significant influence of CNCP on different aspects of quality of life. Chronic pain impairs the patientsâ€™ perception of their general health, interferes in daily activities which results in withdrawal and isolation from family and friends thus increasing the risk of depression. Chronic pain has a detrimental economic impact as well which includes lost workdays. In a 6-month study, the average lost workdays were 7.8 with about 22% of patients in this study having a minimum of 10 missed workdays. These numbers increased when the patient had a major depressive disorder.[4]

There are pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical treatments for CNCP. In the management of CNCP, physicians should always consider a multidisciplinary approach to providing treatment options as chronic pain does not respond to medical monotherapy alone

Management of CNCP ideally includes the involvement of different specialties to provide care including the primary care physician, pain specialist, psychologist, and physical therapist to provide education, therapy, and monitor progress[6].
