Graft-versus-host disease should be suspected after organ transplantation between genetically unrelated individuals. It is a complication of organ transplantation and clinically characterized by rash, fever, bloody diarrhea, hepatosplenomegaly, and breathlessness 7 to 14 days after transplantation. The rash can progress to exfoliative dermatitis.

Susceptibility to infection is also a complication of acute rejection that can be a cause of death. Infection may be bacterial, viral, fungal, protozoal, or mixed. It often relates infection with CMV with graft rejection.

A late complication of particular renal transplantation is the recurrence of the original disease that should be suspected when alternating functional deterioration with long periods of stable graft function. Malignancy in the recipient is another late complication, e.g., the incidence of lymphoma and skin cancer is higher in transplant recipients.
