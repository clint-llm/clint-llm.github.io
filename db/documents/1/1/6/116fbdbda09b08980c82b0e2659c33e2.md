Approximately 25,000 cases of rhabdomyolysis are reported each year in the USA. The prevalence of acute kidney injury in rhabdomyolysis is about 5 to 30%. There is a large variation in the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in rhabdomyolysis settings because of multiple definitions of KI And with varying severity of rhabdomyolysis.

The incidence of crush syndrome is between 30 to 50% with traumatic rhabdomyolysis. Children are at low risk for crush syndrome and have better mortality compared to adults. Crush injury-related acute kidney injury and dialysis requirement varied across multiple studies. 6 to 10% of patients with crush syndrome with acute kidney injury in survivors of the Bam earthquake in Iran required hemodialysis, and there is a correlation between the severity and duration of crush injury and the need for hemodialysis.

In 2002 the American College of Cardiology(ACC), the national heart-lung and Blood Institute, and the American Heart Association jointly released a clinical advisory. It defined Statin associated rhabdomyolysis as muscle symptoms with increased creatine kinase, typically more than 11 times the upper limit of normal (myonecrosis) with elevated serum creatinine consistent with pigment induced nephropathy and with myoglobinuria.

The incidence of rhabdomyolysis secondary to immobilization, alcohol intoxication, fractures, strenuous muscle exercises, insect bites is not precise as these are isolated and sporadic incidents.
