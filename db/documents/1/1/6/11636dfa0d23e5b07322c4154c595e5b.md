As with other elective procedures, prior to considering surgery, the patient should have attempted treatment with conservative measures, including activity modification, physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications, bracing, and/or injections. Surgical intervention can be considered only if these conservative measures fail to provide relief. The indications for UKA are controversial and have evolved since its introduction. Kozinn and Scott established a set of indications in 1989.

More recent evidence has shown improved outcomes and survivorship in younger (age less than 60 years) and obese patients.
