Treatment by an interprofessional healthcare team is beneficial for patients with e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI). Consultations with pulmonary, critical care, medical toxicology, infectious disease, psychology, psychiatry, and addiction medicine specialists should be considered, especially in hospitalized patients, to optimize patient care. Involving the pulmonologist is essential in commencing the judicious use of corticosteroids and later tapering them off. Intensivists should be onboard for patients requiring assisted ventilation.

Psychiatrists, psychologists, and addiction medicine specialists should discuss quitting vaping, including devising a cessation strategy and offering evidence-based tobacco product cessation interventions, including behavioral counseling and medications. Healthcare providers must ascertain whether these patients have strong social support and access to mental health and substance use disorder services. Patients requiring prolonged hospitalization, particularly those ending up in intensive care units, can benefit from physical therapy.
