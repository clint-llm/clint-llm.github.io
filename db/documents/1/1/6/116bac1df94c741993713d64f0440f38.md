The effects of ionizing radiation on soft tissues are permanent and ever-changing. Patients treated with radiation therapy for prostate cancer can develop post radiation cystitis and hematuria even 20 years after the completion of the radiation therapy. Patients treated for prostate and colon cancers can develop proctitis as well as cystitis due to late effects of ionizing radiation.
