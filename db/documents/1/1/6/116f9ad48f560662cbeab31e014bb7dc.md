Neurofibromas are benign tumors with mixed cell types, including Schwann cells, perineural cells, and fibroblasts. The tumors also contain mast cells, axonal processes, and a collagenous extracellular matrix.

Plexiform neurofibromas are similar to neurofibromas, but they arise from muscle nerve fascicles and can infiltrate into the surrounding structures.

Schwannomas arise from the eighth cranial nerve. They are composed of spindle cells with mixed Antoni A and Antoni B cellular arrangements, verocay bodies,Â and hyalinised vessels.
