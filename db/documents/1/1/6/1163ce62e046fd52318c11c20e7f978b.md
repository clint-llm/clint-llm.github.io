Bronchiolitis obliterans characteristically presents with dyspnea and cough that is persistent and progressive. Some may also have wheezing. Symptoms usually develop over weeks to months and are not episodic, unlike asthma. History may also elicit recent exposure to toxic fumes or gases, viral infections, symptoms of joint stiffness in cases of rheumatoid arthritis, prior lung, or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

A physical exam may reveal decreased breath sounds and a prolonged expiratory phase with or without wheeze, usually in the inspiratory and expiratory phase. Rales may also be noted in some cases. Cases of bronchiolitis obliterans associated with Castleman’s disease may also have paraneoplastic pemphigus, which may present with oral ulcers as well as lymphadenopathy.
