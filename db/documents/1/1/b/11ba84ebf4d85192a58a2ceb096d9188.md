Poroma typically presents as an asymptomatic mild solitary slow-growing papule, nodule, or plaque with colors varying from skin color to red to brown or bluish.

Although it is extremely rare, poroma arising within nevus sebaceous was also reported.

Multiple poromas are known as “poromatosis,” which can occur following chemo­therapy and/or radiotherapy.
