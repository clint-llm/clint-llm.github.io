The patient should be educated about compliance, as tuberculosis requires long term treatment. If non-compliance is a concern, "directly observed therapy" should be implemented as it is known to have better outcomes in patients, having difficulty adhering to the medication regimen.

Educating the patient about potential side effects of treatment is of utmost importance. They should be counseled about monitoring, which should be done at least once per monthÂ to ensure there are no signs of toxicity, such as liver injury. Signs of liver injury must also be discussed, which include loss of appetite, vomiting, dark-colored urine, jaundice, abdominal pain, or fatigue. The patient needs to immediately stop taking the medication if any of these signs develop and should notify their healthcare provider.

Post-partum women are at an increased risk of side effects.
