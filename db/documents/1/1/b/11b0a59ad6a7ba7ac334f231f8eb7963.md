Bilirubin is the byproduct of the degradation of oxyhemoglobin by the enzyme oxygenase. There are many causes of xanthochromia such as acute intracerebral hemorrhage, brain tumors, infection, increased protein, and severe systemic jaundice. The finding of xanthochromia in the CSF is most commonly used in the diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in the presence of a normal head computed tomography.
