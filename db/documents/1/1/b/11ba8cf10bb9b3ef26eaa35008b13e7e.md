On the opposite end of the spectrum, hypotension, i.e., persistently low blood pressure, can be life-threatening as well. When the MAP maintenance is inadequate, vital organs do not receive the required blood supply, hypotensive shock ensues, and organ failure quickly follows. Hypotension often results from severe bacteremia or hypovolemia. This condition is treatable pharmacologically with dopamine and other vasopressors.
