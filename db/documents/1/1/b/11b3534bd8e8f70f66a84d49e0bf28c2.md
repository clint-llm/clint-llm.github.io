The following are the primary symptoms of metoclopramide overdose:

- Sedation

- Diarrhea

- Extrapyramidal adverse effects (particularly tardive dyskinesia)

Tardive dyskinesia is an adverse effect, often seen in antipsychotic medications, that generallyÂ manifests as grimacing, lip-smacking, tongue flicking, and general choreoathetoid movements of the body.

Though there is no specific treatment for metoclopramide overdose, its extrapyramidal effects are among the most common adverse effects. They can be alleviated with anticholinergics like benztropine and antihistamines like diphenhydramine.
