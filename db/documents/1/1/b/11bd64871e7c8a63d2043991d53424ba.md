Several risk factors for shoulder dystocia have been identified. Fetal macrosomia is the most significant risk factor for shoulder dystocia.Â Other known risk factors include pregestational and gestational diabetes, prior history of shoulder dystocia, and operative vaginal delivery, particularly with the use of the vacuum. Other risk factors such as maternal obesity, excessive maternal weight gain, and labor dysfunction are controversial since studies have had conflicting results. Attempts to predict shoulder dystocia based on these risk factors have shown poor reliability and poor predictive value.

Of the obstetric brachial plexopathies, upper lesions are the most common. Upper lesions result from a lateral flexion of the head away from the affected shoulder, with depression of the ipsilateral shoulder resulting in a C5-6 deficiency. Lower lesions are caused by traction with the shoulder in full abduction at the time of delivery. Total brachial plexopathies are the rarest form of obstetric plexopathies and are caused by a severe stretch or avulsion type injury.
