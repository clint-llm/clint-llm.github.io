Neurapraxia frequently poses a diagnostic dilemma and should be differentiated from axonotmesis or neurotmesis. The causes of neurapraxia are many, but the prognosis is usually excellent.

While the neurosurgeon is almost always involved in the care of patients presenting with neurapraxia, it is essential to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that include a physiatrist and the rehabilitation team. The physiatrist will evaluate the patient and do the appropriate electrodiagnostic studies to enhance and restore functional ability and quality of life to the patient with physical impairments. Physical therapists will help patients in rehabilitation. Prompt consultation with an interprofessional group of specialists is recommended to improve outcomes. Periodic clinical and electrodiagnosis exams are recommended to evaluate for the improvement of nerve function.
