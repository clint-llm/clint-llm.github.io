Tracheostomy in children is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is believed that the majority of deaths after tracheostomy are not due to tracheostomy but are due to the patient's underlying chronic condition. Complications associated with tracheostomies are well documented, with approximately 20% of patients suffering from some form of tracheostomy-associated complication.

Various studies have demonstrated that tracheostomy related adverse events can be significantly reduced by the implementation of tracheostomy care teams.

The International Pediatric Otolaryngology Group, in the year 2016, published recommendations for taking care of pediatric patients with tracheostomy during the perioperative period.
