Allergy immunotherapy (AIT), which is also termed allergen desensitization or hypo-sensitization was first introduced by Leonard Noon and John Freeman in 1911. They proposed that people with hay fever were sensitive to grass pollen toxins. Desensitization is "a method, to develop a temporary state of tolerance to an agent responsible for an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction." This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and techniques for allergy immunotherapy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with allergies.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for allergy immunotherapy.
- Describe how allergy immunotherapy is done.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and coordination within the interprofessional team in optimizing the care of patients requiring allergy immunotherapy.
- Discuss future trends in allergy immunotherapy
