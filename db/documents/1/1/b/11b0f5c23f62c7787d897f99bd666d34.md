As previously mentioned, the Broca area is usually in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. Though not a certainty, the dominant hemisphere is commonly found to be opposite one’s handedness. A right-handed individual should have a dominant left hemisphere in most cases. Therefore, a right-handed person should theoretically vary from a left-handed in the location of their Broca area. Regardless of handedness, the Broca area is still on the left side the majority of the time.
