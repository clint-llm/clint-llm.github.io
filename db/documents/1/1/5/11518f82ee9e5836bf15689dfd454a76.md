Trauma to the facial nerve with resulting facial paralysis has been described in various scenarios.

- Basilar skull fracture (temporal bone, predominantly)

- Penetrating trauma to the extratemporal aspect of the facial nerve (such as a knife and gunshot wounds)

- Birth trauma (most often with forceps delivery)

- Iatrogenic (typically during tumor excision but also during facial or mastoid surgery)

- Barotrauma (generally from scuba diving or airplane travel)

- Lightning strike
