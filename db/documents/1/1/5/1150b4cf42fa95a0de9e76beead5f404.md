Understanding image production equipment and techniques are essential to understand the advantages, limitations, and quality control. A risk-benefit analysis must be performed before the use of imaging tests that utilize ionizing radiation. The risk of developing cancer from ionizing radiation depends on age, sex, target organ, and cumulative radiation dose.

These factors deserve consideration by an interprofessional team to ensure patient safety and improve outcomes. Imaging procedures should be performed when necessary and if benefits outweigh the risks. The ALARA principle, "as low as reasonably achievable," is used to emphasize safety and the importance of using the lowest radiation dose possible in imaging. Healthcare professionals, who are most at risk of radiation exposure, should also be trained in radiation safety to avoid excessive exposure.
