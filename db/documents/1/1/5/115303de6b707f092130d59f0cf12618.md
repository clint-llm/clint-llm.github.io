Septic arthritis is joint inflammation secondary to an infectious etiology, usually bacterial, but occasionally fungal, mycobacterial, viral, or other uncommon pathogens.  Septic arthritis is usually monoarticular involving one large joint such as the hip or knee; however, polyarticular septic arthritis involving multiple or smaller joints may also occur. Though uncommon, septic arthritis is an orthopedic emergency that can cause significant joint damage leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for preserving joint function. A study of the healthcare burden of septic arthritis in the United States between 2009 and 2012 showed a 26% increase in total charges and a 24% increase in inpatient charges for septic arthritis but no time trends in duration or outcomes of admissions.
