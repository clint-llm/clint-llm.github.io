There are a number of contraindications of lymphoscintigraphy, with most of them being relative contraindications. A patient with clinically positive lymph nodes should not obtain lymphoscintigraphy imaging. The examination should also not be performed or avoided if there is a history of hypersensitivity or allergy to the radiotracer. Pregnant or breastfeeding females need to consider the risks and benefits and take extra precautions when considering the examination because of the small amount of exposure to radiation.

If there is a recent surgical intervention within the region of concern, waiting two weeks is recommended for minor procedures and six weeks for major procedures because of concern for false positives from post-surgical reactive tissues. If a patient has a difficult time maintaining a certain position for a long period of time, the test will be less accurate, and the performance of the examination may not provide reliable results. Also, regarding the accuracy of the examination, patients with high body mass index may result in low-quality examinations.
