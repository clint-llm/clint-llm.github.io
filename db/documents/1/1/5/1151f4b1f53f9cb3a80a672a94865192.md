Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a common condition that typically involves lower extremity edema, trophic skin changes, and discomfort secondary to venous hypertension. Disability-related to chronic venous insufficiency can contribute to a significantly diminished quality of life and a loss of productivity. In most cases, this condition is caused by the incompetence of the valvular action of venous walls. This activity describes the pathophysiology, etiology, and presentation of chronic venous insufficiency and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of chronic venous insufficiency.
- Summarize the typical presentation of chronic venous insufficiency.
- Outline the treatment options available for chronic venous insufficiency.
- Explain some interprofessional team strategies to improve care and optimize outcomes for patients affected by chronic venous insufficiency.
