Lower eyelidÂ blepharoplasty is primarily done by the ophthalmologist and plastic surgeons. However, the patients may be referred by the primary care provider or nurse practitioner. Unlike upper eyelid blepharoplasty, lower eyelid blepharoplasty is more technically challenging and prone to complications. All patients must be warned of potential complications. When done well, the results are excellent.
