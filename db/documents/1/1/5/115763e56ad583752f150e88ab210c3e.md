Due to the pulsatile nature of HGH levels found in the blood, conventional measurements of serum HGH are almost useless because the values may vary from undetectable to extremely high depending on environmental stressors and conditions. If a clinician suspects HGH deficiency, it is best to evaluate insulin-like growth factor I and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 levels and to perform HGH stimulation tests.

In an HGH stimulation test, the patient fasts overnight, and a pharmacological challenge is added in the morning with either L-dopa, clonidine, propranolol, glucagon, arginine, or insulin-induced hypoglycemia. HGH serum levels are then evaluated hourly for a response to increased hormone levels. Failure of this test to increase HGH levels, therefore, indicates HGH deficiency.
