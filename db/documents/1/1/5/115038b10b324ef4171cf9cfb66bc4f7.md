Practitioners should be committed to understanding the unique challenges veterans and their families face and familiar with available military resources. Appropriate referrals are an essential aspect of continued care. Reasons to refer to military or VA-related organizations are wide-ranging; however, veterans often benefit from treatment plans, including providers and other veterans who understand their life experiences. The DoD and affiliated organizations provide programs to help with a broad range of concerns.

Military OneSource is one example that serves military members and families, with programs like non-medical counseling, financial coaching, employment resources. Coaching into Care is a VA telephone service connecting veterans and loved ones with relevant programs in local VA facilities or communities. It includes free coaching from licensed psychologists and social workers to help veterans adjust to civilian life and seek treatment. Community peer groups can be a valuable tool when available.

If there are no local VA services, veterans and family members can call the Vet Center Call Center, which provides twenty-four-hour readjustment counseling from staff who are also combating veterans or their family members. In moments of crisis, the VA offers the toll-free Veterans Crisis Line, which has trained responders, many of whom are veterans.
