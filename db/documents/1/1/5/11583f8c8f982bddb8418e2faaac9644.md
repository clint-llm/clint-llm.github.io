In chronic kidney diseases (CKD), the kidney is unable to produce and excrete an adequate quantity of ammonia which leads to retention of acid and formation of metabolic acidosis.

Hyperammonemia (elevated ammonia concentration in systemic circulation above the normal range of approximately greater than or equal to 65 micromoles) correlates with liver failure and other significant causes of toxicity of skeletal muscle. So liver disease associated with hyperammonemia is an apparent cause for muscle wasting disorders. A recent study showed that ammonia lowering therapy in hyperammonemic portocaval anastomosis rat models resulted in improvement of the phenotype of muscle and metabolic activity of the protein. Though it is not very clear what the exact mechanism of myopathy is; the assumption is that detoxification of ammonia takes precedence over protein synthesis in muscles. An elevated level of ammonia has also been proposed to increase muscle breakdown through the activation of autophagy, contributing to the loss of muscle mass associated with cirrhosis. Additionally, alcohol correlates with an elevated level of serum ammonia can exacerbate the muscle protein metabolism impairment and elevate the risk of associated hepatic myopathy. This hypothesis supports the observation that patients suffering from alcoholic liver disease have a higher incidence and degree of muscle wasting than hepatic disease due to toxic or other infective causes.

Hemorrhagic shock is also known to be a cause of elevated blood ammonia levels. Excessive hemorrhage reduces the total hepatic blood flow which causes ischemia in the periportal to the centrilobular area of the liver, and that leads to necrosis in patients in irreversible shock. The pericentral hepatocyte is responsible for the synthesis of glutamine, and the periportal hepatocyte is responsible for urea synthesis. High concentrations are the result of the decreased capacity of detoxication results due to dysoxia of these cells.
