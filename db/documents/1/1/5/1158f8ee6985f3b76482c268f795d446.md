Originally, actinic prurigo was thought to be a hereditary type of polymorphous light eruption (PMLE), more common idiopathic photodermatoses. Genetic testing and the unique clinical presentation of actinic prurigo now support two separate disease entities. The HLA-DR4 allele, specifically the DRB1*0407 subtype, is strongly associated with actinic prurigo and not PMLE. Actinic prurigo also has an earlier age of onset and frequently presents with cheilitis and sometimes conjunctivitis, which is never seen in patients with PMLE. When suspecting actinic prurigo, laboratory tests are also necessary to rule out systemic diseases such as lupus erythematosus or porphyria.
