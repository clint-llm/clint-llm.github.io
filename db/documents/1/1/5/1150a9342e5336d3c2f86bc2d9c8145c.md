**Management of EOMs During Globe Repair**

EOMs should be isolated and the sclera posterior to their insertion carefully examined for globe ruptures. During surgery, the surgeons must have excellent exposure, appropriate magnification, and adequate illumination. Surgical loupes or a zoom operating microscope are employed depending on the level of magnification and number of assistants during surgery (at least one). The surgical field is illuminated directly by the light microscope or by a separate headlamp.

If the surgeon is unfamiliar with the circulating operating room nurse, the surgeon should prepare the eye and surrounding area for surgery to avoid placing unnecessary pressure on the globe. An eyelid speculum that places minimal pressure on the globe, such as a Schott lid speculum or loose Jaffe speculum, is also positioned by the surgeon.

A 360-degree conjunctival peritomy is created to provide excellent exposure of the EOMs with minimal traction. Upon creation of the peritomy, blunt gentle dissection is carried out through adjacent, undamaged tissue quadrants (away from the suspected or injured EOM) so as not to cut residual EOM attachments inadvertently. Having a general idea of where the laceration or rupture is by clinical and radiographic exam is helpful. For example, if the wound is located posterior to the medial rectus muscle's insertion, dissection should be performed in the superonasal and inferonasal quadrants. Once this tissue is isolated from its superior and inferior attachments (or medial and lateral attachments if isolating vertical rectus muscle insertions), a muscle hook can be inserted through the quadrant dissections. Likewise, open wounds should be closed as they are encountered to reform the globe as expeditiously and judiciously as possible.

Using the Spiral of Tillaux as a geographic guide, the muscle hook is moved in the plane of the muscle, tangential to the globe and posterior to its insertion. If the muscle hook is passed too anteriorly, it may hook a pseudo-tendon or weaker connective tissue. If the EOM is attached, the more posterior dense muscle belly provides firm tactile feedback when the muscle is hooked. The surgeon should alert the anesthesia provider when hooking muscles to observe for an oculocardiac reflex. Once the muscle is hooked, blunt Westcott scissors or a cotton-tip applicator are used for gentle dissection of check ligaments and the intermuscular septum. The goal is to isolate the muscle without splitting or bruising it. Aggressive dissection is often not necessary.

Low-temperature or bipolar cautery on jeweler forceps may be necessary to achieve hemostasis but should be carefully considered near areas of exposed uveal tissue. If the EOM is bleeding because it is split, suture ligation is ideal for both hemostasis and muscle reformation.

Once the muscle is isolated, the sclera deep to it can be examined for lacerations. Most likely, the EOM will need to be detached for thorough evaluation and repair if a laceration is present. Next, a double-armed 5-0 or 6-0 absorbable polyglactin suture is placed in the middle of the muscle about 1 mm posterior to the muscle insertion. Each suture arm is passed within the muscle parallel to its insertion, exiting at the superior and inferior border if it is a horizontal rectus muscle or the medial and lateral border for a vertical rectus muscle. After the muscle is imbricated, the needle of each suture arm is reinserted back into the muscle and locked onto itself on both borders. These locking bites help to ensure the muscle does not slip.

The muscle can then be disinserted from its original insertion with blunt-tipped Westcott scissors, where the tips are placed between the muscle and suture lines. After disinsertion, the anterior and posterior muscle is inspected to ensure the muscle is contained in the suture. The globe is further examined and repaired if a laceration is present before reinsertion of the muscle. If the laceration extends more than 26 mm posterior to the muscle insertion, injury to the optic nerve should be considered.

Using a suture with a spatulated needle is helpful when reattaching the muscle. The spatulated needle is passed partial-thickness into the sclera. Oftentimes, the muscle stump of the previous insertion site leaves a suitable purchase point for reattachment. Otherwise, the muscle is reinserted 1 to 2 mm posterior to its previous insertion site barring the sclera is not compromised. Since the sclera is so thin here, the surgeon should be in a comfortable position and ensure that the patient or operating table does not move. The tip of the needle should be parallel to the sclera when starting the pass, and each arm should be about 10 mm apart in width to avoid sag in the middle of the muscle.

**Management of Anteriorly Transected, Avulsed, or Retracted EOMs**

Adopting the same principles above to ensure globe integrity, one should always attempt to determine if the EOM is attached to the globe. If the EOM is only partially attached to the sclera, the surgeon should survey the EOM insertion site and posterior sclera for any adherent muscle points, followed by inspection of the Tenon's capsule for the remainder of the transected muscle. If the EOM is not attached to the sclera because it is completely transected or avulsed, the surgeon should identify the anterior and posterior portions of the muscle. The EOM insertion site should be explored to determine if and how much of an anterior portion is present. If the posterior portion has retracted behind Tenon's capsule, the surgeon should locate the EOM capsule tunnel within Tenon's capsule. This can be accomplished by tracing the intermuscular septum from the adjacent rectus muscles toward the retracted EOM.

The assistant should maintain that the sleeve of the muscle pulley stays open while the surgeon searches for the retracted muscle within the sleeve. Fine, locking forceps can be used to grasp the recovered EOM and once isolated, secured, and imbricated per the technique described above. The suture bites should imbricate the axial length of the muscle and be secured with locking bites to ensure the muscle does not slip. Some surgeons may advocate for an adjustable suture to the sclera to account for the increased (from traumatic resection, contracture, or surrounding scar tissue) or decreased (from partial muscle tissue loss or palsy) new force of the recovered muscle. Adjusting the eye to orthotropia with a temporary knot can also be achieved by gauging the amount of traction or spring-back in the primary and opposing directions of the muscle when the eye is in the primary position. The extent of resistance or return can alert the surgeon to residual adhesions. These maneuvers should be performed with caution (if at all) before the primary closure of the globe.

The conjunctiva can be closed with a 6-0 plain gut or 8-0 polyglactin suture.

Antibiotic ointment with a mild steroid can be applied post-operatively.

**Management of Posteriorly Transected EOMs and EOM Entrapment**

Muscles that have been transected posteriorly can be difficult, if not futile, to retrieve from an anterior, transconjunctival approach described above. Access to the posterior orbit is also necessary for orbital fracture repairs and release of entrapped EOMs. The superior and lateral anterior orbit can be accessed via an upper eyelid skin crease incision, sub-brow incision, lateral canthotomy incision, or combination of these approaches where the eyelid crease or sub-brow incision is extended laterally (Stallard-Wright incision).

The medial orbit can be accessed via a transcaruncular incision, medial transcutaneous (modified Lynch incision or Gullwing incision), or vertical lid split incision (Byron-Smith incision).

Care should be taken to isolate and avoid damage to the fascial planes or entering orbital fat to prevent orbital fat adherence and scarring.

The degree of EOM restriction from scarring or palsy from the trauma can be unpredictable, so every effort should be made to recover and repair damaged EOMs at the time of initial repair. The patient should be counseled pre-operatively (in addition to the globe or orbital fracture repair consents) that future strabismus surgery on one or both eyes may be necessary. Even if the EOM can not be retrieved, binocular vision may still be possible with a transposition procedure, though this is typically reserved for a later date.

**Damage to the LPS**

Traumatic ptosis, or eyelid drooping, is generally observed for at least six months before repair.

Of note, in Asian populations, a thick subcutaneous fat layer and preaponeurotic fat pad protrusion preclude fibers from extending towards the skin. Thus, the orbital septum fuses to the levator aponeurosis below the superior tarsal border, and aponeurotic insertions to the eyelid skin are lower in Asian populations than their white counterparts.
