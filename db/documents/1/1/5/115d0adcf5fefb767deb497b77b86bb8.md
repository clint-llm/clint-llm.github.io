The patient is placed supine on the operating table, and general anesthesia or sedation may be induced if desired. While orotracheal intubation is most common for general anesthesia, many surgeons prefer nasotracheal intubation to improve surgical access to the neck and perioral region. In either case, securing the endotracheal tube with a 2-0 silk suture may help prevent inadvertent extubation with intraoperative manipulation of the head and neck. Local anesthetic or tumescent solution is injected, and a surgical prep is performed with 10% povidone-iodine or 70% isopropyl alcohol, depending on the surgeon's preference. If concomitant blepharoplasty is planned, the periocular scrub should be 5% povidone-iodine; otherwise, the eyes may be protected from the scrub with sterile adhesive film dressings to prevent corneal injury.
