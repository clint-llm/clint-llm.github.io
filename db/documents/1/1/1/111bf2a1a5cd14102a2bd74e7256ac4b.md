The importance of patient education is two folds. The first is the detection and management of preventable conditions causing short stature. An equally important aspect of patient education is the counseling of patients and family members to improve the quality of life in individuals who have already attained full maturation. Counseling can also help individuals deal with the effects of bullying, social isolation, and stress associated with short stature.
