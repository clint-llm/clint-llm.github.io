The use of IVL for management of calcified coronary lesions like other lithotripsy therapies may theoretically predispose to membrane depolarization; however, sufficient clinical data to support this is lacking at present. In addition, coronary artery perforation may occur due to barotrauma from either low-pressure balloon inflation or high energy acoustic wave emission, though rates have been low in clinical trials.
