Abdominal examination is an essential part of all routine physical examinations and a key step in the evaluation of any abdominal pathology. After taking a thorough history, a detailed physical examination is mandatory if no time constraints are present. Even in emergencies, a brief abdominal examination can help decide further management. A well-performed abdominal examination can give multiple clues to the final diagnosis and may greatly decrease the need for unnecessary laboratory and radiological investigations. In situations where the diagnosis is unclear, a detailed abdominal examination can help narrow down the diagnosis and help order focused investigations. This helps decrease the physicianâ€™s time, energy, and resources and subjects the patient to decreased mental stress and hospital costs.
