The majority of cases of primary amenorrhea are caused by anatomical defects, elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, hyperprolactinemia, hypothalamic amenorrhea, or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Gonadal dysgenesis includes most commonly Turner syndrome, which makes up to 43% of primary amenorrhea cases.

**Anatomical Defects**

When the uterus and vagina are partially or completely absent in the presence of otherwise normal female sexual characteristics, the diagnosis is typically Mullerian agenesis, which accounts for approximately 10% of primary amenorrhea cases. Other anatomical defects include imperforate hymen or transverse vaginal septum, both of which create a partial or complete vaginal blockage, and isolated absence of the vagina or cervix.

**Elevated FSH Levels**

Elevated follicle-stimulating hormone levels can indicate gonadal dysfunction. In individuals with XX chromosomes, gonadal failure refers to ovarian failure.

**Hyperprolactinemia**

Prolactin is a pituitary hormone that is involved in many reproductive functions. The secretion of prolactin causes an inhibition of the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, which negatively modulates the secretion of pituitary hormones responsible for the gonadal function.

**Hypothalamic Amenorrhea**

This condition causes cessation or absence of menses due to a functional disorder of the hypothalamus.

**Polycystic Ovary Syndrome**

PCOS is the most common cause of amenorrhea in females with evidence of androgen excess. It is a common reproductive and endocrinologic disorder. The three main characteristics of this syndrome are hyperandrogenism, polycystic ovaries, and ovulatory dysfunction.

Hypopituitarism, weight loss, anorexia nervosa, and isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency can also cause amenorrhea.

Constitutional delay of puberty and chronic systemic disease or acute illness can also lead to amenorrhea.

The World Health Organization (WHO) categorized amenorrhea into three groups. WHO group I includes females with no evidence of endogenous estrogen production, normal or low follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, normal prolactin levels, and no evidence of lesions in the hypothalamic-pituitary region. WHO group II includes females who can produce estrogen and have normal levels of prolactin and FSH. WHO group III includes females with increased serum FSH, which indicates gonadal insufficiency or failure.
