Allergy is a broad topic and speaks to the body’s immune response to foreign substances common in the environment, and triggers a reaction from the body’s immune response described as hypersensitivity. Hypersensitivity is an inappropriate immune response to common, typically harmless antigens, manifesting as a continuum from minor (atopic dermatitis and rhinitis) to severe manifestations (anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid and asthma). The focus here will be anaphylaxis; other topics of atopic dermatitis and allergic asthma involve many of the same modulators, responses, and treatments.

The most common triggers of anaphylaxis include foods, medications, insect stings, and allergen immunotherapies. Any substance that can trigger the degranulation of mast cells or basophils can induce anaphylaxis. The definition of allergy and anaphylaxis has varied in the past; in 2005, an interprofessional group of clinical experts was formed to improve recognition and designate criteria for the diagnosis of anaphylaxis. The incidence of anaphylaxis varies between 0.5 to 2% in the general population, and the rate has been increasing. The lifetime prevalence is 1.6%.
