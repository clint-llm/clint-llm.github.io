Surgical treatment of portal hypertension secondary to liver damage or portal vein thrombosis is achieved using a trans-hepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. This procedure involves forming a connection between the portal vein, which brings blood into the liver, and the inferior vena cava, which drains blood out of the liver. This provides a method by which blood can bypass the damaged hepatic system to alleviate portal venous congestion.
