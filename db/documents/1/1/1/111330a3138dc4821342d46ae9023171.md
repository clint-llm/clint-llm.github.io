During limb development in an embryo, the typical pattern of digit development is controlled by the interactions of multiple signaling molecules. When one or more of these signaling molecules has upregulation or downregulation, supernumerary digits can occur on one or both hands and/or feet. This up or down-regulation typically occurs due to genetic errors in a number of possible chromosomal regions. Most commonly, polydactyly of the hand occurs, involving the ulnar side of the hand more than the radial side.
