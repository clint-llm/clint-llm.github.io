The middle ear functions to connect the sound waves from the external environment and transfer them to the inner ear for auditory transduction. The auditory ossicles (malleus, incus, and stapes) play a key role in this function. The malleus connects to the tympanic membrane transferring auditory oscillations to the incus and then the stapes. The stapes connects to the oval window allowing for mechanical energy to be transferred to the fluid-filled inner ear. Middle ear anatomy consists of intricate relationships between nerves, blood supply, and muscles. The ossicles play a role in multiple clinical scenarios, including otosclerosis, choleastoma, and facial nerve palsy.
