Paget Schroetter syndrome (PSS) is effort-induced thrombosis of the axillary and subclavian veins associated with compression of the subclavian vein at the thoracic outlet. It is the venous variant of thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), the syndrome of symptoms associated with compression of the subclavian vein, subclavian artery, or brachial plexus as they pass through the thoracic outlet. The description of this entity dates back to 1875 when Sir James Paget reported a case of spontaneous thrombosis of the subclavian vein in a patient. In 1884, von Schroetter hypothesized that the condition was a consequence of injury to the vein from repetitive musculoskeletal motion.
