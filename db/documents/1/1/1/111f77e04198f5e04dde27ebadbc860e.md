Lactational mastitis occurs due to a combination of inadequate drainage of milk, and the introduction of bacteria. Common scenarios leading to poor milk drainage include infrequent feeding, an oversupply of milk, rapid weaning, illness in mother or child, and a clogged duct.

The pathophysiology of periductal mastitis remains unclear. Smoking is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis, by either directly or indirectly damaging the ducts leading to subsequent necrosis and infection.γ, and IL-12A in patients with periductal mastitis compared to the control.

The pathophysiology of IGM remains unclear, but the most widely accepted theory points to autoimmune destruction initiated by a specific trigger, such as trauma, bacteria, or extravasated milk.
