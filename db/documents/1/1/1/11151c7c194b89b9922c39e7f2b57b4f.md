Depending on the etiology and whether the condition required surgery, the patient must comply with conservative managementÂ through activity modification and rehabilitative exercise. Post-surgical management should include setting patient expectations based on the degree of nerve damage, and rehabilitation with a PT and/or OT will be necessary. Patients must adhere to their regimen in either instance to prevent further injury and allow healing and permanently cease offending activities.
