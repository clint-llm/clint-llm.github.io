Anticholinergic medications are used to manage and treat a wide range of diseases. This activity illustrates the indications, action, and contraindications for anticholinergic drugs as valuable agents in managing cholinergic toxicity, urinary incontinence, Parkinson disease, respiratory disorders, cardiovascular disease, and numerous other diseases. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with the disorders mentioned above and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of anticholinergic drugs.
- Describe the potential adverse effects f anticholinergic drugs.
- Review the need for monitoring patients when using anticholinergic drugs.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance anticholinergic drugs and improve outcomes.
