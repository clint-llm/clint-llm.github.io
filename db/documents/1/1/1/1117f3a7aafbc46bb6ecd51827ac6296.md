The majority of women with a UTI have an excellent outcome. Following treatment with an antibiotic, the duration of symptoms is 2-4 days. Unfortunately, nearly 30% of women will have a recurrence of the infection. Morbidity is usually seen in older debilitated patients, those with renal calculi and in patients. Other factors linked to recurrence include the presence of diabetes, underlying malignancy, chemotherapy and chronic catheterization of the bladder. The mortality after a UTI is close to zero, but the infection does have a significant impact on finance. Women often have to miss work, see the physician and purchase the antibiotic.
