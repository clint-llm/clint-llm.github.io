Danon disease is a rare X-linked dominant genetic disorder that manifests with the clinical triad of cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, and intellectual disability. It is caused by genetic mutations in the lysosome-associated membrane 2 (LAMP2) gene, with most mutations leading to an absence of LAMP2 protein. Most published data on this disease is abstracted from case reports, limited observational studies, and expert opinion. This activity describes the evaluation and management of Danon disease and highlights the role of an interprofessional team approach in managing and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Danon disease.
- Describe the evaluation of Danon disease.
- Review the treatment and management options available for Danon disease.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to manage Danon disease and improve outcomes.
