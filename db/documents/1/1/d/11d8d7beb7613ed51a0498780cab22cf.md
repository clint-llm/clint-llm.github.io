Since a high number of individuals with xanthelasma have a lipid disorder, measurement of serum lipid profile is recommended. Also, liver panel, thyroid function test, fasting blood glucose can be done, or if the patient has diabetes, the glycosylated hemoglobin level measures the blood sugar control over the last 3 months. In most of the cases, cholesterol and triglyceride levels are elevated, and the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level is reduced. To measure the lipid profile accurately, the patients should fast for at least 12 hours.
