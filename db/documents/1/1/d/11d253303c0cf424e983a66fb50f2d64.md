The echinococcal disease is a prevalent parasitic infection, particularly among farmers and shepherds, often seen by the primary care provider, nurse practitioner, or emergency department physician. These clinicians should always consult with the hepatobiliary surgeon and radiologist before starting any treatment. The disease needs to be dealt with in time to avoid morbidity and mortality. Coordination among healthcare professionals is vital for better patient outcomes.

The management and the evaluation of echinococcal disease requires an interprofessional approach as cysts resulting from this condition tend to form in different viscera of the body, thus requiring multiple consultant approaches accordingly. For instance, brain cysts require opinions from a neurologist as well as a neurosurgeon. Likewise, liver and lung cysts require consultant opinions from hepatologists and pulmonologists, respectively, other than the general surgeon. The role of radiologists is evident as imaging helps make the primary diagnosis and guides the treatment of choice. The nursing staff is also a vital segment of the interprofessional group as they assist in educating the patient and family members about the disease. Finally, pharmacists' roles are imperative, too, particularly when drug therapy is initiated and monitored. This type of interprofessional collaboration is the key to achieving optimal patient outcomes in the cases of echinococcosis. [Level 5]
