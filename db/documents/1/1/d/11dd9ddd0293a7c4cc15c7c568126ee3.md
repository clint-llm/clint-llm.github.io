A detailed history and physical examination are helpful in diagnosing lymphocytic hypophysitis. However, without a tissue biopsy and with evidence of pituitary mass along with symptoms of hypopituitarism, the differential diagnosis continues to be large.

The differential diagnosis can also include infectious and inflammatory conditions as well. These include IgG4 hypophysitis, granulomatous hypophysitis which can be idiopathic or due to tuberculosis, syphilis, or sarcoidosis, Wegnerâ€™s granulomatosis and Langerhans cell histiocytosis.
