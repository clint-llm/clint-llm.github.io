Inhalation of aerosols from an infected animal placenta at parturition, animal excreta, straw, or dust from a farm or farm vehicle is the suspected mode of transmission. The digestive route of transmission is another mode suspected in humans. The average incubation period is 20 days for acute Q fever. Inhaled Coxiella bacteria multiply in the lungs resulting in bacteremia, during which systemic manifestations occur. The virulence of the bacterial strain and the infecting dose determine illness severity, e.g., the QPH1 plasmid-containing strain is more virulent than the QPRS plasmid strain.

Based on the host's immune response, the primary infection can be symptomatic (Q fever) or asymptomatic. Both can progress to endocarditis, depending on host characteristics. Children and women, including the pregnant, are more likely to remain asymptomatic. Despite remaining asymptomatic pregnant women and those with preexisting valvular heart disease, arterial aneurysms, or cancer are at higher risk for endocarditis. Endocarditis is associated with elevated IL-10 and anticardiolipin IgG antibodies. Chronic infection results in an aberrant immune response, a possible explanation for Q fever fatigue syndrome (QFFS).
