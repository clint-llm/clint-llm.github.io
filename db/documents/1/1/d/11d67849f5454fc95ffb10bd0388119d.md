The axillary approach to the brachial plexus nerve block was first described by Dr. Halstead et al. in 1884. Before the prevalence of ultrasound, this approach was useful for patients undergoing outpatient hand surgery due to the superficial location and low risk of complications such as pneumothorax. Its superficial location allows for easier identification of the individual nerve branches with a nerve stimulator or ultrasound techniques. Of note, contrary to its name, this block does not block the axillary nerve and should not be confused with the relatively newer axillary nerve block. This activity reviews the indications and methodology for performing an axillary block and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients requiring regional anesthesia.

**Objectives:**
- Explain how to perform an axillary block.
- Describe how to position a patient for an axillary block.
- Outline the indications for an axillary block.
- Review the importance of clear communication and coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the care of patients requiring an axillary block.
