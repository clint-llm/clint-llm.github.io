Warfarin's anticoagulant effects help prevent clot formation and the extension of any current clots, but it has no direct impact on clot removal or reversing ischemic tissue damage. Warfarin exhibits its anticoagulation effects via the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways in the clotting cascade. This activity occurs through effects on vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, and X) and the anticoagulant proteins C and S. Warfarin interferes with the activation of clotting factors by blocking the vitamin K oxidation-reduction cycle needed for the carboxylation of clotting factors, which ultimately lessens the amount of active vitamin K reserves available to act as a cofactor in the formation of glutamic acid residues within the clotting factors mentioned above. These actions render clotting factors inactive and unable to participate in the clotting cascade.

Warfarin's hepatic metabolism and protein binding are the most common mechanisms for the occurrence of drug-drug interactions. Warfarin is metabolized via the cytochrome P450 system by CYP 2C9, 1A2, and 3A4. It is a racemic mixture, with the S-enantiomer being 2.7 to 3.8 times more potent than the R-enantiomer. Since the S-enantiomer is more potent and primarily metabolized by CYP 2C9, drug-drug interactions affecting this pathway may be more significant. Medications with a higher protein binding affinity than warfarin can displace warfarin creating more free warfarin within the bloodstream.
