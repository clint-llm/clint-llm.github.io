- RV infarction: Right ventricular infarction can cause heart failure, and patients present with hypotension, distended neck veins, and clear lung fields.

- Cardiogenic shock: Patients present with hypotension, absence of hypovolemia, and clinical signs of poor perfusion.

- Hemorrhagic shock: Patients present with hemodynamic instability such as hypotension, tachycardia, and also decreased urine output, and altered mental status.

- Cardiogenic pulmonary edema: It can present post-papillary rupture, or VSD can be seen on CXR. A high index of suspicion of papillary muscle rupture is needed in patients with pulmonary edema, even in asymptomatic patients.

- MR: MR can occur from papillary muscle rupture and can present with acute pulmonary edema with manifestations of tachycardia, tachypnea, respiratory distress, diffuse pulmonary rales, and hypotension along with MR signs.

- Cardiac tamponade: It can be a consequence of LV rupture. It is more common with stab wounds. Patients present with dyspnea, tachycardia, and elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP).
