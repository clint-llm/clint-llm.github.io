Renal involvement in lymphoma is commonly in the presence of widespread nodal or extranodal lymphoma. This is classified as secondary renal lymphoma (SRL). Rarely, lymphoma may involve the kidneys alone without evidence of disease elsewhere; this presentation is termed primary renal lymphoma (PRL). Although the diagnosis of renal lymphoma can be challenging, an awareness of the spectrum of imaging findings can help to differentiate lymphoma from other renal malignancies, such as renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and can lead to appropriate recommendations for biopsy. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of renal lymphoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of lymphoma of the kidney.
- Review the presentation of a renal lymphoma.
- Summarize the treatment options for renal lymphoma.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by lymphoma of the kidney.
