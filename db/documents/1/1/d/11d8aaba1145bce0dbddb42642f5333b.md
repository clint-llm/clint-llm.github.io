A study reviewed the interdisciplinary care of urinary incontinence between clinicians, nursing, physical therapy, and pharmacy. Advanced Practice Registered Nurses and physical therapists had a significant role in Long-term Care Facilities. “Prevention Focused Intervention: UI Based on the Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Model”  demonstrated that interdisciplinary team approaches are crucial to achieving better patient outcomes, as demonstrated by statistically significant reductions in urinary incontinence episodes.

According to one study, the rate of serious adverse effects of mirabegron was low and not directly related to the drug itself.
