Several pathological conditions impact the abdominal vasculature, including aneurysms, dissections, atherosclerotic disease, aneurysms, and flow-limiting states. Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), for instance, are a potentially life-threatening disease process that affects at least 2% of adults over the age of 50.

While ultrasound is an excellent method for detecting the presence of AAAs, its role is more limited in assessing other pathologies such as aneurysmal rupture, aortic dissection, abdominal aortic stenosis, major branch pathology, and IVC pathology.

There is no universal protocol for abdominal vascular imaging. This article's proposed protocol is a general guideline that can be used to evaluate the aorta, inferior vena cava, mesenteric arteries, and iliac arteries for sonographic findings consistent with pathology.
