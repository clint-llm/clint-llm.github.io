Infertility is usually defined as the inability of a couple to conceive even after one year of unprotected, frequent sexual intercourse. The male is solely responsible in about 20% of cases and is a contributing factor in another 30% to 40% of all infertility cases. As male and female causes often co-exist, it is important that both partners are investigated for infertility and managed together. This activity highlights the etiology and epidemiology of male infertility. It also reviews the evaluation and management of male infertility as well as the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of male infertility.
- Outline the evaluation of male infertility.
- Review the management options available for male infertility.
- Review optional therapeutic interventions that patients can institute on their own.
