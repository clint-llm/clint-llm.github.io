Before initiating the procedure, the practitioner should inspect the thrombolysis catheter delivery system thoroughly to ensure all pieces are present. They may administer intravenous antibiotics before the procedure to prevent infection. This procedure requires a fully operating catheterization laboratory. Healthcare professionals should use proper sterile techniques, including sterile drapes, gloves, and gowns.
