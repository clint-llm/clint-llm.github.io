**Heart Failure**

The strongest indication for BNP measurement is distinguishing between cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic causes of dyspnea in an emergent setting. Dyspnea is a symptom in nearly all cases of HF exacerbation. However, it is not specific to HF and may result from other pathologic processes.

BNP can also be a useful prognostic marker in patients with known chronic heart failure; elevated levels are found in patients with higher New York Heart Association functional class scores and correlate with mortality, morbidity, and recurrent hospital admission.

**Acute Coronary Syndrome**

Left ventricular dysfunction due to cardiac remodeling is a significant cause of mortality following myocardial infarction (MI). BNP monitoring can help assess prognosis following MI because it becomes elevated in patients with post-MI left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fractions less than 40%.

**Limitations**

While BNP is a useful tool in assessing prognosis in patients with cardiac disease, it has not been well established that BNP-guided therapy offers improved outcomes compared to symptom-guided therapies.

**Relevance**

Heart failure is a significant and growing cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States; it is the leading cause of hospitalization in those aged 65 and older and is responsible for 10% of all healthcare expenditures.
