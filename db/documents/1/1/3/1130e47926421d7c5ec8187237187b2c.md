Fracture of the proximal third of the shaft has a higher rate of nonunion compared to midshaft fractures. This is in combination due to the deforming forces in the proximal aspect of the tibia as well as limited soft tissue coverage. However, if managed and fixed appropriately, outcomes are typically good. Nonoperative management of tibia fracture has a high success rate if the alignment is maintained. The risks of this type of treatment increase with oblique fracture patterns. The most important predictor of eventual amputation is the severity of the ipsilateral extremity soft tissue injury. It has been shown that there is no significant difference in functional outcomes between amputation and salvage.
