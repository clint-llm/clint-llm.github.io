Congenital abnormalities like Chiari malformation show tonsillar descent below the foramen magnum and may be found incidentally on imaging. Though Chiari can be symptomatic, it is not an acute phenomenon and does not cause acute brainstem compression.

Autonomic dysreflexia can also cause high blood pressure with reflexive bradycardia; however, these patients are not comatose, and their breathing is unaffected.

Acute spinal injury with neurogenic shock, if cervical, can cause bradycardia, but with associated hypotension.
