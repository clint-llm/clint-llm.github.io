Percutaneous liver biopsy is a procedure where a needle is introduced through the skin and, eventually, liver tissue to obtain a specimen to help aid in the diagnosis, staging, and/or the development of treatment modalities for a variety of liver disorders. The first report of the procedure was in 1923.
