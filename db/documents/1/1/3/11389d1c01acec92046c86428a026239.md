Primary Sjogren patients have an increased relative risk for the development of B-cell non-Hodgkins lymphoma. Many of these lymphomas are extranodal and may involve the salivary glands. Risk factors include persistent salivary gland swelling, enlarging lymph nodes, leukopenia, palpable purpura and low complement C4 at presentation. These patients need to be carefully monitored and referred for oncologic evaluation when appropriate. Current guidelines by the Sjorgen Syndrome Foundation recommend 1) palliation of symptoms, 2) minimizing complications, and 3) proper patient selection when selecting immunosuppressive treatment.

Biological Therapies are used to treat severe cases of SjogrenÂ disease. Rituximab is an option for patients with keratoconjunctivitis sicca, vasculitis, xerostomia and severe parotid gland swelling. All patients on Rituximab must be closely monitored for tumor lysis syndrome (when patients have lymphoma), cytopenia, infusion reactions, hepatitis B reactivation and serious fungal, viral and bacterial infections.
