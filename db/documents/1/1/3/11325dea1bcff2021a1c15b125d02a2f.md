The teres major is innervated by the lower subscapular nerve, derived from C5, C6, and C7 nerve roots.

The lower subscapular nerve runs inferiorly off the brachial plexus to innervate the subscapularis in addition to the teres major. After the posterior cord gives rise to the thoracodorsal nerve and lower subscapular nerve, it branches into the axillary and radial nerves.
