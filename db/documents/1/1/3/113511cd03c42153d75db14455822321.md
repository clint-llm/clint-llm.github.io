Henry's law states that when a gaseous mixture (e.g., the atmosphere) is in contact with a solution, the amount of any gas in that mixture that dissolves in the solution is in direct proportion to the partial pressure of that gas. The partial pressure of a gas is the amount of pressure that the gas contributes to the total pressure of that gas mixture. Per Henry's law, if the pressure of a gas over liquid increases, the amount of gas dissolved in the liquid will increase proportionally. Conversely, as the gas pressure decreases, the amount of gas dissolved in the solution drops.

A person experiences Henry's law in action when they open a new bottle of soda pop. Upon removing the cap, the carbon dioxide gas "atmosphere" in contact with the soda rushes out, and the gas pressure drops precipitously. In turn, less of the gas in the soda stays dissolved; the gas comes out of solution as bubbles and foam. So long as adequate gas pressure is maintained over the liquid, the dissolved gases will remain in the solution.

Presented as a formula, Henry's law can be written as the following:

- P1 / A1 = P2 / A2

The left side shows the ratio of P1, the partial pressure of gas overlying a solution initially, to A1, the corresponding amount of gas dissolved in solution at that pressure. Likewise, the right side is the ratio of the same gas at different pressure, P2, and its corresponding amount of dissolved gas, A2, at this new pressure. Since the two sides are equal to each other, a change in the size of P2 accompanies a corresponding change in A2.

For example, your blood is a solution containing multiple gases. At sea level, those gases remain in solution (i.e., blood). This is because, at sea level, air and arterial blood contain approximately the same partial pressure of gases, primarily nitrogen. As one rises in the atmosphere, the partial pressure decreases, and the amount of these gases held in solution (i.e., blood) necessarily must decrease. This results in gas evolving in the bloodstream. As a result, the otherwise inert nitrogen supersaturates in the bloodstream or "bubbles out" like the soda pop example. While some oxygen can potentially evolve out of solution, the overwhelming majority of oxygen in the bloodstream is bound to hemoglobin, which prevents this occurrence.

The unbound nitrogen bubbles in the vascular system result in various forms of decompression illness, a catchall term referring to both the discomfort associated with decompression sickness as well as more severe conditions like an arterial gas embolism. This problem can be partly controlled with the pressurization of the cabin. Additionally, so long as the rate of ascent is relatively slow, the risk of a supersaturation resulting in bubble formation is relatively low. It is largely because of this ascent at a controlled rate and cabin pressurization that bubbles normally do not form during a commercial airline flight. In most commercial and military fixed-wing aircraft, pressurization typically is performed to maintain the partial pressure of a gas in the cabin to the equivalent of the pressure at 8000 feet (2438 meters). It is considered an acceptable risk to fly at elevations up to 12000 feet (3658 meters) unpressurized, though this practice is discouraged.

The applications Henry'sy's law, however, do have their limitations. At high concentrations of gas in the liquid phase, Henry's law is highly inaccurate. Low concentrations of gas in a solution can be accurately captured wiHenry'sy's law, as shown in the figure.
