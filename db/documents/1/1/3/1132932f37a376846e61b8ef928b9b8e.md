There are many causes of secondary amenorrhea, and thus it is important to have an interprofessional team involved in the investigation and management of this disorder. Apart from infertility, the biggest concern is the ongoing bone loss that occurs due to a lack of sex hormones. Healthcare workers, including nurse practitioners, should educate the patient on the importance of bone health while they are being worked up for the cause of secondary amenorrhea. Besides increasing calcium in the diet, the patient should participate in regular exercise. The loss of fertility in many women is also associated with significant emotional distress, and hence a referral to a mental health counselor is recommended. The outcomes of women with secondary amenorrhea depend on the cause.
