The resulting scalp defect should merit consideration and planning in advance, especially if a dermatome and general anesthetic are required. Well, designed flaps require preservation of the natural hairline, incorporation of major vascular pedicles, and closure without tension. There should be a complete workup done by the treating team including full medical history review, clinical examination, often photographs for the record (with appropriate consent and permission),  and a review and discussion of the treatment options, risks, benefits, alternatives, and procedures.
