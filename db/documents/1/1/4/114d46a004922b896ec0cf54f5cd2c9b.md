Although the criteria for AH/EIN are well defined, several conditions may mimic the cytological picture. Many of these lesions are interpreted by the pathologist as 'gland crowding.' Localized groups of altered and crowded endometrial glands may be misdiagnosed as premalignant or malignant lesions. In one study, follow-up outcomes of "gland-crowding" reports show 77% benign lesions (proliferative endometrium, secretory endometrium, endometrial polyp, etc.), 19% premalignant lesions, and 4% EC.

Other benign lesions that may mimic premalignant and malignant lesions when biopsies are examined may include mucinous metaplasia, papillary mucinous metaplasia, and endometrial polyps. If the history of pregnancy is not available, then the Arias-Stella reaction may be misinterpreted as the premalignant lesion. Endometrial hyperplasia with secretory changes may occasionally be difficult to distinguish from the "cork-screw" shaped extensive and proliferative glands of a late secretory endometrium.
