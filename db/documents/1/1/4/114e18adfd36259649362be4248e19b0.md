The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an enveloped retrovirus that can be categorized into two distinct subtypes - human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2). Although both viruses share similar transmission routes and can cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), there are important differences between them regarding epidemiology, diagnosis, and management.

Although HIV-2 is less common globally, it is an important cause of disease in many regions. It predominates in West Africa, but globalization has led to a sizeable number of cases in other parts of Africa, Europe, India, and the United States.

The first cases of HIV-2 were detected in the United States in the late 1980s, and currently, about 1% of persons living with HIV in the US are estimated to have HIV-2.

To date, the approach to HIV-2 has largely been extrapolated from studies in HIV-1 though notable differences exist. Its lower prevalence compared to HIV-1 has resulted in a paucity of drug trials or epidemiologic studies to address the current limitations in our understanding of HIV-2 management. However, given its global distribution, clinicians must become familiar with the differences between HIV-1 and HIV-2 while maintaining a high index of suspicion for HIV-2 in persons from endemic regions.
