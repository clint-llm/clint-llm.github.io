The visual prognosis in individuals with MGS is usually poor. These patients have high refractive errors and strabismus that cause amblyopia. The chances of retinal detachment are high as the optic disc is abnormal.

After a successful retinal surgery, final vision depends upon the duration of retinal detachment and preexisting amblyopia. Longstanding retinal schisis leads to atrophic changes, which further limit visual recovery. Visual acuity generally ranges from 20/200 to no perception of light. Even in patients without retinal detachments, vision is poor, usually 20/200 or worse.
