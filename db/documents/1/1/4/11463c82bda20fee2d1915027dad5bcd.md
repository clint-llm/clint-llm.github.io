The three illnesses associated with an ascent to altitudes 8,000 ft (high altitude) or more above sea level include:

- Acute mountain sickness (AMS)

- High-altitude cerebral edema (HACE)

- High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE)

These represent a spectrum of diseases with similar pathophysiology but increasing severity. Successful treatment of these conditions requires accurate recognition and prompt response.  The Wilderness Medical Society (WMS) publishes regularly updated evidence-based guidelines for treatment.
