Although neuromonitoring is generally safe, there are risks and contraindications associated with MEP monitoring that clinicians must understand to prevent or treat associated injuries. Transmission of electrical stimuli through the body can cause thermal burn injuries; although rare, scalp burns have been reported. Moreover, direct stimulation of neural pathways may cause electrochemical injury, and repeated stimulation can theoretically lead to excitotoxicity, accompanied by neuronal cell damage. Seizures and cardiac arrhythmias have also been reported, though these are rare.

Muscle contraction during motor evoked potentials may cause inadvertent movement and positioning-related injuries. Bite injuries of the lips or tongue occur in 0.2% of cases and constitute the most frequent MEP-related complication. Mandibular fracture has been reported, as have cases of damage to the endotracheal tube caused by biting during MEP stimulation.

Soft bite blocks are necessary to prevent biting the tongue or endotracheal tube during MEP monitoring. Appropriate positioning of the bite block should be confirmed throughout the case, particularly in surgeries that require patient repositioning or prone positioning, which can cause the bite block to become dislodged or malpositioned.

Most reported contraindications to motor evoked potential monitoring are relative; thus, a thorough risk-benefit analysis and discussion with the surgeon, neurophysiologist, and patient is necessary. Relative contraindications include epilepsy, increased intracranial pressure, cortical lesions, intracranial clips or shunts, cardiac pacemakers, or other implanted medical devices.
