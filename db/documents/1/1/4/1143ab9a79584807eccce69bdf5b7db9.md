Inflammatory myopathies are immune-mediated processes triggered by environmental factors in genetically susceptible people.

- Environmental factors: The best-known environmental risk factors are drugs, infections, ultraviolet (UV) light, vitamin D deficiency, and smoking. Few cases of myositis resembling polymyositis and dermatomyositis (PM/DM) have been reported after treatment with penicillamine, interferon (IFN)-alpha, and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. The detection of antibodies to the Coxsackie virus, more frequently in patients with juvenile diabetes mellitus than in controls, supports the hypothesis of an infectious trigger. However, solid evidence is lacking for any role of continuing viral infection as a cause of chronic muscle inflammation.

- Genetic susceptibility: The occurrence of myositis in monozygotic twins and first-degree relatives of affected individuals suggests a role for genetic factors in developing IIM. The genetic factors are complex because the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes associated with IIM vary in different populations worldwide. The strongest known risk factors are HLA DRB1 *0301 and the linked DQA1 *0501.
