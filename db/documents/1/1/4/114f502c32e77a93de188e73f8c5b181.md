The labyrinthine segment of the facial nerve and the geniculate ganglion are typically supplied by the petrosal artery, a small vessel with an internal diameter of about 0.24 mm. The artery stems from the middle meningeal artery (MMA) at its initial intracranial segment, right above the foramen spinosum and lateral to the trigeminal ganglion. Next, the petrosal artery courses alongside the greater petrosal nerve and enters the temporal bone with the nerve hiatus.

At the site of the ganglion, the petrosal artery delivers 1 to 3 twigs to its surface, forming two vascular plexuses, one superficial and the other within the ganglion tissue. The geniculate ganglion has the richest microvasculature of the intratemporal portion of the facial nerve.

Another point worthy of consideration is that the MMA derives from the maxillary artery; this implies that damage to the facial nerve or the geniculate ganglion can occur even from lesions affecting the latter. For instance, this could happen in the event of the embolization of the maxillary artery for the treatment of epistaxis or as a consequence of anticancer drug administration through the artery.
