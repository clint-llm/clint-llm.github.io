Healthcare workers in all capacities dealing with type 2 diabetes mellitus patients on pioglitazone should be aware of the benefits, mechanism of action, dosage, adverse effects,Â  indications, and contraindications of the drug. This medication requires an interprofessional team due to potential adverse effects and monitoring for therapeutic effectiveness. The team should educate the patient about the possible side effects and the importance of considering the drug to be an adjunct to lifestyle and dietary changes. Patients should be aware of regular monitoring with blood glucose, HbA1C, and liver function tests and encouraged to inform doctors of any signs of heart failure or dermatologic reactions.

A pharmacist should collaborate to verify that there are no drug interactions, that dosing is appropriate, and, as mentioned above, offer patient counseling. A certified diabetes educator nurse is also invaluable. They can help the patient coordinate the administration and monitoring of the diabetes drug regimen and report to the prescriber any issues that may arise. Pioglitazone therapy requires an interprofessional team approach, including clinicians, endocrinologists, nurses, and pharmacists, collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results.
