The most important management of a child born with a limb deficiency is to appropriately diagnose and treat any other associated abnormalities, particularly when they pertain to the heart, intestines, or other vital organs. Any time a congenital limb defect is noted, referral to pediatric cardiologists and gastroenterologists may be appropriate toÂ treat any abnormalities that may be encountered.

From the perspective of a hypoplastic limb, prosthetics may be used to increase cosmesis and function, however, most people function quite well without prosthetics, even with severe limb truncation. Families of children with severely deformed extremities may benefit from physical and/or occupational therapy to meet the unique needs of patients.

Additionally, caring for a disabled child can be traumatic for some parents. Therefore, counseling and mental health services should be available to families and children as needed in the setting of deformity that causes a serious disruption in day-to-day life.
