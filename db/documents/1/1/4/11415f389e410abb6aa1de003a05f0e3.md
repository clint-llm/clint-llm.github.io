Carotidynia or TIPIC syndrome, though rare, is underdiagnosed, and the cause for such pain remains hypothetical. Many reasons related to the autoimmune process, reaction to a drug, or an unknown inflammatory process are considered potential causes. It often presents with unilateral facial and neck pain. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication or aspirinÂ are the drugs of choice, which may lead to symptom resolution within two weeks.
