The myenteric plexus is a branch of the enteric nervous system, which is the most substantial subset of the autonomic nervous system. Innervation becomes primarily stimulated by vagal efferents that originate in the dorsal motor nucleus. The myenteric plexus also receives some innervation from the pelvic splanchnic nerves. These nerves form bead-chain-like terminals in the myenteric plexus but do not directly innervate the muscle.
