- Serum Drug level (therapeutic level for epilepsy: 50 to 100 mcg/ml; and for mania 50 to 125 mcg/ml) and toxic levels: >175 mcg/ml (before morning dose). As valproate is protein-bound, it is important to test the free levels in the presence of hypoalbuminemia. The concentration of the total may be inaccurate.
