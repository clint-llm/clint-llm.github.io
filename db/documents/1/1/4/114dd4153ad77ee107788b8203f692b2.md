There have been many studies researching the prognosis and outcomes for patients with sacral decubitus ulcers, but given the different treatment regimens, the prognosis varies. One showed that 53% of pressure ulcers healed within 42 days when "sheng-ji-san"-a Chinese herbal medicine, was used as a dressing.

Although outcomes have been difficult to study, there is general agreement that most of the time, lifelong treatment and prevention measures are necessary for these patients. Patients with sacral decubitus ulcers are at high risk of recurrence.
