Tethered cord syndrome (TCS) is a well-recognized cause of deterioration in patients with myelomeningocele, with an estimated one-third of patients requiring spinal cord untethering in childhood.

Stretch-induced functional changes to spinal cord function may result in neurologic, urologic, musculoskeletal, or gastrointestinal abnormalities.
