Arterial bleeding that comes from gingivae and dental damage to the lower jaw is usually originating from the inferior alveolar artery or the inferior alveolar artery's branches. Bleeding that occurs from the dental sockets are from the incisor branches of the inferior alveolar artery.

During dental procedures, the gingivae can easily suffer damage.Â Gingival damage may lead to bleeding. Bleeding from dental sockets is common during teeth extractions. Clinicians can control dental socket bleeding with packing and pressure. If conservative measures are ineffective, then cauterization can be done. The cauterization of the incisor branches will resolve the dental socket bleeding and achieve hemostasis. If the arterial bleeding is coming from the gingivae that do not involve the dental socket. It usually suggests damage to the inferior alveolar artery. If the inferior alveolar artery bleeding is uncontrollable, embolization of the artery may be warranted.
