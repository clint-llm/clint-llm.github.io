The practice of prehospital emergency medicine is a profession like any other career choice. Any profession that deals with people has a propensity to have legal impacts and ethical conundrums. The laws that govern the practice of emergency medical services (EMS) are highly dependent upon the state and county. There are a few federal regulations, but primarily, the states regulate EMS.
