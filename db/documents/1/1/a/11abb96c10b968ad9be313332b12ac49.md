The mandibular nerve is the third and largest division of the fifth cranial nerve, known as the trigeminal nerve. It innervates the skin of the lower face and lip, the muscles of mastication, the mandibular dentition, gingivae, and the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. It supplies both sensory and motor function.

The inferior alveolar nerve is the largest branch of the mandibular nerve. It supplies sensation to the skin of the lower cheek, chin, lip, tongue, teeth, and gingivae. The IAN is an important consideration in the extraction of lower third molars, as these two structures are often closely situated.

Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) can provide further information on the exact relationship between a mandibular third molar and the IAN and quantify the risk of iatrogenic nerve damage.

There are several radiographic features on plain film radiographs, such as orthopantomogram (OPG/DPT), which are suggestive of close proximity of a third molar to the IAN. (See figure 1).

These features include:

- Loss of cortication of the inferior dental canal (IDC) - this is seen as an absence of the white 'tram lines' on plain film radiographs.

- Darkening of third molar roots - this is seen as a dark 'banding' across the apical area of the lower third molar roots.

- Deviation of the IDC - the IDC typically deviates away from the roots of the lower third molar.

- Narrowing of the IDC - this is characterized by localized narrowing of the IDC around the region of the lower third molar root.

- Dilaceration of roots - This is classified as excess curvature of the lower third molar roots.

- Narrowing of the third molar roots - This is seen as an abnormal narrowing of the apical area of the lower third molar roots.

The presence of one or more of these radiographic features indicates the need for further imaging by way of CBCT, which can provide further information on the relationship between the lower third molar and the IAN.
