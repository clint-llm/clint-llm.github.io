The most common treatment is direct laryngoscopy with closed arytenoid reduction. The arytenoid cartilage should be repositioned on top of the cricoid while ensuring that the vocal process is placed as symmetrically as possible to the contralateral vocal process. The scheduling of this procedure must take place as soon as the diagnosis is made to improve the outcome.

With a delayed diagnosis, fibrosis and scarring may develop, making treatment more challenging. Open procedures such as thyroplasty and arytenoidopexy are options in selected cases.

Conservative management with voice therapy, which entails voice exercises, relaxation techniques of the larynx and voice compensation mechanisms have also shown good results.
