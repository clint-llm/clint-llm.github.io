The clinical consequences of infection are directly related to the intensity and duration of infection. The worm burden can be estimated by the number of eggs in feces which become detectable in stool after 3 to 4 weeks.

In the early phase of infection, most infected patients are considered to have an innocuous infection (less than 100 flukes) and rarely have symptoms. Patients with a very heavy parasitic load (>20 000) can present with symptoms compatible with acute cholangitis, including jaundice, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, malaise, and fevers. C. sinensis, predisposing to the formation of gallstones, especially calcium carbonate stones. C. sinensis induces hyperplastic changes of the gallbladder wall resulting in decreased gallbladder contractions and the subsequent precipitation of bilirubinate and mucin on the parasitic eggs.

Furthermore, pancreatitis and liver abscesses appear more frequently in patients with clonorchiasis.Escherichia coli.
