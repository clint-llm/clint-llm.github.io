Individuals with bipolar disorder show a markedly increased risk of premature death due to the increased risk of suicide and medical comorbidities, including cardiovascular, respiratory, and endocrine causes.

Psychiatric comorbidity is present in 50 to 70% of patients with BD. Of those diagnosed with the condition, 70 to 90% meet the criteria for generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, or panic disorder, and 30 to 50% for alcohol and other substance use disorders.
