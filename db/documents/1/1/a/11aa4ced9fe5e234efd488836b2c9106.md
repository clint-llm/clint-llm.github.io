Occlusion of the cystic duct or malfunction of the mechanics of the gallbladder emptying is the basic underlying pathologies of this disease. Over 90% of chronic cholecystitis is associated with the presence of gallstones. Gallstones, by causing intermittent obstruction of the bile flow, most commonly by blocking the cystic duct lead to inflammation and edema in the gall bladder wall. Occlusion of the common bile duct such as in neoplasms or strictures can also lead to stasis of the bile flow causing gallstone formation with resultant chronic cholecystitis.

It has been proposed that lithogenic bile leads to increased free radical-mediated damage from hydrophobic bile salts. That, in association with reduced mucosal protection due to lower levels of prostaglandin E2 results in a continuous inflammatory state. When the cholecystokinin receptors of the smooth muscle are affected, there is impaired gall bladder contraction that leads to stasis and worsens the permissive environment where lithogenic bile promotes inflammation.
