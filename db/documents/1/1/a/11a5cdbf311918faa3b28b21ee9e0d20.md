Amantadine causes permanent damage to the corneal endothelium and a decrease in corneal endothelial cell density by unknown mechanisms.

Because damage to the corneal endothelium is permanent, edema may persist even after discontinuation of the drug, and a corneal transplant may beÂ necessary to restore vision.

Another recent case study showed that the dopaminergic agonists ropinirole, methylphenidate, and resiniferatoxin induced corneal edema with a similar clinical presentation to amantadine keratopathy.

Endothelial cell size variation (CoV) demonstrates that some endothelial cells are enlarging to fill gaps and compensate for the loss of surrounding endothelial cells. The percentage of hexagonal cells decreases in response to chemical, mechanical, or hypoxic stress. These parameters are frequently used as markers of endothelial cell viability and pre-operative risk in patients with intrinsic disease of corneal endothelium such as Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD). Corneal endothelium damage may be present in eyes without corneal edema or decreased visual acuity in patients on amantadine therapy.
