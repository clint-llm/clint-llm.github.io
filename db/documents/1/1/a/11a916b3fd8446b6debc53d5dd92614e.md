Several guidelines have been developed to help prevent berylliosis in the workplace. However, an interprofessional approach is required to ensure that the diagnosis is not missed. Patients often present to the primary health care provider who may not be aware of the disorder, hence referral to a pulmonologist is recommended. The pharmacist should advise the patient to discontinue smoking, and the nurse should educate the patient and the family on the disease. A pulmonologist may help make the diagnosis and help monitor the disease. In industries that handle beryllium, the public health nurse should create awareness of the disorder and how to prevent it. Workers should be told to wear a mask and appropriate long-sleeved garments. Some industries also refer the workers for annual chest exams. Patients should be told to quit smoking and change occupation if the exposure is high. The pharmacist should discuss the potential side effects of steroids, and monitor the patient for complications, reporting to the healthcare team.

**Outcomes**

In the USA, berylliosis is declining, but outside North America, it is still a problem because of unregulated textile industries. A detailed work exposure, history, physical examination, radiography, pulmonary function test, selected lab studies, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid can be used to identify early stages of disease.
