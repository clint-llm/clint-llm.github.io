Trauma is a significant cause of morbidity and death in children.

Younger patients have more elastic cartilaginous and bony structures in the face and a larger cranium: face ratio; thus, fractures in very young children are rare. The growth patterns of the face dictate age-specific fracture patterns that differ from adults.

Though isolated facial fractures can occur, concurrent traumatic injuries to other nearby sites must always be considered, including injuries affecting the head, eyes, brain, neck, and airway.
