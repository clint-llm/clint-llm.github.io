Branchial cleft cysts represent incomplete involution of branchial cleft structures. A branchial cleft cyst has no opening in the skin or digestive tract. A branchial cleft sinus has a single opening to the skin or digestive tract versus a branchial cleft fistula which has an opening to skin and digestive tract. Stratified squamous epithelium lines branchial cleft cysts in 90% of cases.
