Type III hypersensitivity reactions can be associated with medications, autoimmune, or infectious conditions. Further, it can involve multiple organ systems that may require expertise from various specialties. It is vital to have interprofessional communication and care coordination by physicians, mid-level practitioners (NPs and PAs), nurses, pharmacists, and dieticians for the best clinical outcomes. Many patients suffering from autoimmune illnesses are on corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants; therefore, community clinicians, pharmacists, andÂ other ancillary staff become crucial in monitoring patients for short-term and long-term adverse effects.
