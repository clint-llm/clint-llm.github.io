There are approximately 4.9 million people with bilateral blindness secondary to corneal disease worldwide, accounting for 12% of total global blindness.

High-risk factors include recurrent and chronic inflammation of the ocular surface, glaucoma, and eyes with corneal vascularisation. Globally, the availability of donor cornea material can be limited due to donor supply and the need for eye banking facilities. An artificial cornea transplant can be considered for end-stage corneal diseases such as multiple graft failures or inflammatory ocular surface disease.

There have been many proposed artificial cornea transplant devices (keratoprosthesis; KPro). Pellier de Quengsy first described the initial concept in 1789.

More recently, soft polymers have been used to simulate the natural cornea. Poly-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate was used for the AlphaCor, which gained FDA approval in 2003.

**Current Keratoprostheses**

**Boston KPro Type I**

The most widely implanted artificial cornea transplant is the Boston KPro type 1, which was first introduced by Dohlman in 1965 and gained FDA approval in 1992.

**Osteo-odonto-Keratoprosthesis (OOKP)**

The OOKP utilizes an autologous tooth root-alveolar bone complex as the keratoprosthesis skirt material for better tissue integration. Invented by Strampelli and modified by Falcinelli et al., the principle of OOKP surgery is the bypass of the diseased ocular surface by a buccal mucous membrane patch and replacement of the anterior segment structures with the OOKP.

**Keratoprostheses in Development**

There are numerous alternative keratoprostheses in development.

Several different keratoprostheses for eyes with defective blinking and dry eyes or cicatrization are being evaluated. The Lux keratoprosthesis consists of a cone-shaped PMMA cylinder, titanium sleeve, and a 7.8mm titanium backplate. A donor cornea is double trephined centrally at 3 mm and 7.5 mm peripherally. The PMMA cylinder is secured in the titanium sleeve and placed through the central 3mm opening in the donor cornea. The backplate is secured and sutured into place in the host after removal of the patient's cornea with interrupted nylon sutures. A mucous membrane graft is sutured over with an opening for the PMMA cylinder optic. Short-term results with good retention and functional outcomes have been reported.

Improvements in skirt materials could further enhance keratoprosthesis development. OOKP is at risk of bone resorption, and a synthetic substitute with a hydrogel composite of nano-crystalline hydroxyapatite (nHAp) coated poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) microspheres have been evaluated in the lab. A graphene oxide titania-based biomaterial has been implanted in vivo in rabbit corneas without causing an immune or inflammatory reaction and can be a potential new skirt material for keratoprosthesis.
