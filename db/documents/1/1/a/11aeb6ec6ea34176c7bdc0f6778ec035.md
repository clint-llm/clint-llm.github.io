AR pupils are found in the tertiary and final stage of infection with syphilis. These patients are afflicted with neurologic and cardiovascular disease. Such complications include an aortic aneurysm and insufficiency of the aortic valve, meningitis, and tabetic disease. While treatment can arrest the progression of the disease, the resolution of symptoms is dependent on the extent of the underlying disease. For those with cardiac or nerve involvement, the damage is not reversible, and these patients carry the poorest prognosis.
