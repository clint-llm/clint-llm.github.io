The prognosis for Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) is excellent. This is usually asymptomatic and requires no intervention in asymptomatic patients.

The prognosis for Mobitz type II varies based on the cause of the rhythm. Patients require placement of implanted pacemaker devices to avoid complications of Mobitz type II AV blocks such as decreased cardiac output, symptomatic bradycardia, and sudden cardiac arrest.
