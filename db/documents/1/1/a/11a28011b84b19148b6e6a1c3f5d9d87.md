Cranial nerve IX is primarily sensory, receiving general visceral and special sensory input from tonsils, larynx, middle ear, posterior one-third of the tongue, and carotid bodies. It has a small general motor efferent to the stylopharyngeus muscle, which aids in the elevation of the larynx and pharynx. Cranial nerve X has a wide range of functions and controls heart rate, peristalsis, sweating, speech phonation, and elevation of the palate. Cranial nerve XI is a pure motor efferent supplying the ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. Derangement in the functions of these nerves occurs when they become compressed in jugular foramen syndrome.

Even though most cases of jugular foramen syndrome occur due to compression of structures within the jugular foramen, some other mechanisms act in viral infections. These factors can lead to the spread of the virus into the lower cranial nerves, which are as follows:

- Interconnections between upper and lower cranial nerves (spinal accessory nerve plexus)

- Simultaneous reactivation of VZV in multiple ganglia and inter-connecting nerves

- Viral spread through a common blood supply
