Heterotopic ossification is frequently observed in the rehabilitation population. It consists of the formation of mature, lamellar bone in extraskeletal soft tissue where bone does not usually exist. Patient populations at risk of developing heterotopic ossification include patients with burns, strokes, spinal cord injuries, traumatic amputations, joint replacements, and traumatic brain injuries. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of heterotopic ossification and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of heterotopic ossification.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with heterotopic ossification.
- Review the management options available for heterotopic ossification.
- Explain the importance of enhancing coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients with heterotopic ossification.
