Up to 90% of undifferentiated connective tissue disease cases occur in females, especially those between 32 and 44 years old, and the majority of these cases do not progress into a full-blown connective tissue disease. These patients tend to remain stable over time by only showing mild clinical symptoms with a sole autoantibody profile.

Due to the wide range of variations in the inclusion criteria, up to 50% of patients diagnosed with a connective tissue disease may have an underlying undifferentiated connective tissue disease.

In the United States, up to 72% of patients diagnosed with undifferentiated connective tissue disease were of the White race. Up to 78% of patients were females compared to 93 to 95% in Italy and 94% in Hungary.
