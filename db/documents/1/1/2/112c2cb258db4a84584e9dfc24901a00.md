Clinical trials showed no adverse drug reactions using very high doses of saxagliptin, alogliptin, linagliptin. However, high doses of sitagliptin were associated with an 8.0-millisecond mean increase in QTc in controlled clinical trials as labeled by the FDA. In case of overdose, hemodialysis removes approximately 13% of sitagliptin and approximately 23% of saxagliptin but did not affect alogliptin or linagliptin.
