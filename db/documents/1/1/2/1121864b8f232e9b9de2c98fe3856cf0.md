Cerebral autoregulation is the ability of the cerebral vasculature to maintain stable blood flow despite changes in blood pressure (or, more accurately, cerebral perfusion pressure).

Still, it is essential to differentiate carbon dioxide reactivity and flow-metabolism coupling from cerebral autoregulation.

With a working definition of autoregulation and an understanding of what it is not, researchers have developed technology that now boasts the ability to measure autoregulatory function in real-time, which may lead to the fine-tuning of long-established guidelines.

Autoregulation is assessable by examining changes in cerebral blood flow, or its surrogates, in response to changes in cerebral perfusion pressure or mean arterial pressure as its surrogate.
