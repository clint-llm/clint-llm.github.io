Penile cancer is a relatively uncommon malignancy in the United States. Unfortunately, its diagnosis is often delayed due to a number of factors including patient embarrassment, denial, and misdiagnosis by primary care practitioners and nurse practitioners. If there is any concern about a possible penile lesion, the patient should be seen by a urologist as early in the workup as possible. Management of penile cancer is primarily surgical, but there are indications for radiation therapy or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Early stage penile cancer has a good outcome but advanced stages have a very poor prognosis.

Urology nurses assist in patient and family education, monitor patients, and report issues to the team. They also arrange close follow when needed [Level 5]
