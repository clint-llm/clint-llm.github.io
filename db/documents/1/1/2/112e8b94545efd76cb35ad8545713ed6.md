Many immune and tumor-infiltrating cells express programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), that negatively regulates the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activation by binding to the programmed death-1 (PD-1) and B7.1 (CD80) receptors that cause suppression of T-cell migration, proliferation, and secretion of cytotoxic mediators leading to inhibited tumor cell killing.

Data from many clinical trials have shown that agents targeted at the PD-L1/PD-1 molecular pathway can induce antitumor activity early and across multiple neoplastic conditions. Atezolizumab is a humanized monoclonal anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody that inhibits PD-L1–programmed death 1 (PD-1) PD-L1–B7-1 signaling, thereby resulting in tumor-specific cytotoxic T-cell immunity.
