Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is an entrapment neuropathy caused by compression of the median nerve as it travels through the wrist's carpal tunnel. It is the most common nerve entrapment neuropathy, accounting for 90% of all neuropathies. Early symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome include pain, numbness, and paresthesias. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of carpal tunnel syndrome, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of carpal tunnel syndrome, including triggering and exacerbating factors and activities.
- Review the necessary elements for an examination to assess for carpal tunnel syndrome, including any necessary diagnostic imaging studies.
- Summarize the treatment options available for carpal tunnel syndrome, including both conservative and surgical care.
- Explain possible interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome and improve outcomes.
