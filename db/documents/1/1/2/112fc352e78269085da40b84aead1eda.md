Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), whether two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) remains the mainstay of assessing for a double orifice mitral valve(DOMV).

With the addition of color Doppler, one can gain important information about flow through the mitral valve and can add valuable information regarding valve regurgitation or stenosis. Preoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is generally unnecessary; however, an intraoperative approach is routinely used to confirm preoperative echocardiographic findings.
