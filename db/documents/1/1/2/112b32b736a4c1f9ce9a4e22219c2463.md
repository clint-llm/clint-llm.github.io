Intertrochanteric femur fractures are a very common injury seen in the elderly. Understanding the pathophysiology as well as the proper treatment options will significantly decrease the risk of mortality and morbidity of this injury. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of intertrochanteric femur fractures and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the most common mechanisms of injury that can result in intertrochanteric femur fractures.
- Summarize the diagnostic approach for an evaluation and assessment of a patient presenting with a potential intertrochanteric femur fracture, including any indicated imaging studies and potential differentials.
- Outline the treatment options for intertrochanteric femur fractures, depending on patient population and fracture severity and location.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes with intertrochanteric femur fracture treatment.
