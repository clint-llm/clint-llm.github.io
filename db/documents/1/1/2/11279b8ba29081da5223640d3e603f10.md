The initial lesions of EAC begin as asymptomatic, annular or polycyclic lesions that grow slowly (2 to 3 mm per day), rarely reaching more than 10 cm in diameter, then develop central clearing. An individual lesion can enlarge to greater than 6 cm in diameter over a period of 1 to 2 weeks. Characteristically, there is a trailing scale at the inner border of the annular erythema. If the expansion of the annular plaque is not uniform, incomplete arcs appear, as do polycyclic lesions, or simply festooned bands. In the superficial form, the lesions are minimally elevated, and there is desquamation at the inner margin, i.e., trailing scale. The scale may not be present in all the lesions. The surface of lesions is typically devoid of crusts or vesicles, although atypical cases with telangiectasia and purpura have been described. Occasionally, vesicles develop within the peripheral margin. There may be associated pruritus. Lesions usually occur on the trunk and proximal extremities.

In deep gyrate erythema, the advancing edges are obviously elevated, and there is usually no associated scale or pruritus. Resolving lesions do not have residual scarring, but postinflammatory hyperpigmentation can be seen. Although the lesions of EAC may be localized or generalized, they rarely, if ever, involve the scalp, mucous membranes, palms or soles. Individual lesions can persist for weeks to months, but usually without associated systemic manifestations. The total duration of EAC ranges from days to decades, and an unusual form of EAC has been described that recurs annually.
