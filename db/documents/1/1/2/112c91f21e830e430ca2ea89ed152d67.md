Duane retraction syndrome (DRS) is a congenital motility disorder caused by the absence or partial development of the abducent nucleus and nerve, having diverse clinical presentations, and challenging management. Though relatively rare, it is important to exclude this condition in patients presenting with abnormal ocular motility and strabismus. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of DRS and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the pathogenesis of Duane retraction syndrome (DRS).
- Summarize the evaluation of a case of Duane retraction syndrome (DRS).
- Describe the management options available for Duane retraction syndrome (DRS).
- Outline how interprofessional communication and care coordination can improve patient outcomes in cases of Duane retraction syndrome (DRS).
