It is imperative to educate parents and adult patients about the warning signs such as recurrent sinopulmonary infections, allergic diseases, and prolonged fevers as clues for the diagnosis of hypogammaglobulinemia. The severity of allergic diseases also warrants an investigation by an immunologist for an immunological workup. Patients with CVID whose family members have frequent infections should be evaluated, as they may have increased frequency of selective IgA deficiency and CVID.

Proper hand hygiene, sanitation, detection of infection in its early stages, and compliance to treatment can improve symptoms and long term outcomes. Medications and certain underlying diseases can be the cause of hypogammaglobulinemia, speaking to a physician regarding long term drugs like glucocorticoids, unintentional weight loss, malnutrition, or a strong family history of early deaths to infections or malignancy need to be discussed for proper assessment and management of the patient.
