There have been different procedures described for the treatment of cartilage defects. When the defect is full thickness, the chances of “self-repair” are small.

Other procedures utilizing autologous cells have been described. Autologous chondrocyte implantation, a procedure involving placement of cultured chondrocytes into the defect and sutured into place, has been described downfall being the technically demanding nature of the procedure; however, it can be a good option for larger lesions. Osteochondral autograft transplantation can consist of a single plug or multiple plugs used to fill a larger defect.

The use of multiple plugs to fill a defect is termed mosaicplasty.

Autogenous or allogenic osteochondral plugs have become popular due to the following reasons:

- They can be performed in a single procedure.

- They offer a chance at true hyaline cartilage resurfacing.

- No outside laboratory assistance required.

- It can be performed with reusable equipment.
