FODMAP is an acronym for fermentable oligo-, di- and monosaccharides, and polyols. These short-chain carbohydrates, arranged in descending order, are associated with worsening or induction of functional gastrointestinal symptoms such as cramping, bloating, and diarrhea. Such symptoms are at least partially attributable to the non-absorbable nature of osmotic carbohydrates, which undergo bacterial fermentation in the small intestine.
