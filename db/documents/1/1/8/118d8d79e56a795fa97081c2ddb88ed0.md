Considering the constant stress on the four valves of the human heart, beating an average 80 times per minute for over 70 years for over 3 billion beats, on the whole, human heart valves perform amazingly well. Less than 2% of the population is estimated to suffer valvular disease.

The history of the treatment of valvular disease is marked by daring innovation and multidisciplinary collaboration; from the days of closed digital commissurotomies (sticking a surgeon’s finger through a heart valve) to homemade balls in cages to the pathophysiologic connection between treating strep throat with antibiotics and preventing rheumatic heart disease decades into the future. These historical episodes have something to teach about progress in healthcare. However, this article will focus on surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for stenosis, insufficiency, or endocarditis using bioprosthetic valves.

The interested reader is invited to peruse closely related content, especially surgical aortic valve replacement, surgical aortic valve repair, stentless pulmonary autograft/homograft aortic valve replacement (Ross procedure), minimally invasive aortic valve surgery, and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), as well as more general treatments of aortic valve disease and prosthetic valves.
