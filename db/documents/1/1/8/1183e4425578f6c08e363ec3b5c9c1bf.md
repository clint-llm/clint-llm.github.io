**Flexor Digitorum Superficialis Tenodesis**, also known as the superficialis sling, is an operation that is used to treat swan neck deformity, a condition characterized by hypertension of the PIP joint of the finger and flexion posture of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint.

One complication this can arise with this procedure is the creation of a flexion contracture that is greater than the degree desired. However, there is no uniform agreement in the literature regarding an optimal angle of PIP joint flexion during tenodesis.

The **Carpal Tunnel Release**(CTR) procedure is an option when patients who are suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome do not respond to all non-operative therapies.
