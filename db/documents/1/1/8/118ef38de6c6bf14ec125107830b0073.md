Distal ulna fractures may warrant surgical consultation. At the discretion of the emergency physician, simple and nondisplaced distal ulna fractures can be immobilized and provided outpatient follow-up with an orthopedic or hand surgeon. However, an urgent evaluation is recommended for complex or irreducible fractures or concern for neurovascular compromise.
