Muscle energy is a well-established osteopathic technique used to address a variety of somatic dysfunctions. Somatic dysfunctions are defined as changes to the structure and function of the somatic system, composed of muscle, fascia, nerves, and vasculature. In the cervical region, this typically presents as "increased muscle tension, sensitivity changes, asymmetry, and restriction of range of motion" This activity describes and explains the role of the Osteopathic Physician in evaluating and treating patients who undergo cervical muscle energy.

**Objectives:**
