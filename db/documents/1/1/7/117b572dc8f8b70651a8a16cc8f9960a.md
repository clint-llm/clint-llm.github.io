Anasarca develops as a response to an elevation in capillary hydraulic pressure, increased capillary permeability, a lower plasma oncotic pressure, or a combination of these changes. Anasarca also can be secondary to lymphatic obstruction leading to retained fluid in the interstitial space. The following are the clinical conditions for the various mechanisms described.

- An elevation in capillary hydraulic pressure

- Heart failure, kidney disease, early cirrhosis, pregnancy, drugs (i.e. amlodipine)
- Venous obstruction or insufficiency states like DVT, hepatic venous congestion

- Increased capillary permeability

- Burns, trauma, sepsis, allergic reactions, malignant ascites

- Lymphatic obstruction

- Malignancy, Post lymph node dissection

- Hypoalbuminemia

- Nephrotic syndrome, liver disease, malnutrition

As a first step, when the fluid moves from the vascular space to the interstitium, it reduces the plasma volume. This reduces tissue perfusion which then causes retention of sodium and water by the kidneys which leads to a cascade of effects worsening fluid retention. Some of the excess fluid gained will be retained in the intravascular compartment. However, the alteration in capillary hemodynamics results in most of the retained fluid entering the interstitium and, eventually, becoming apparent as edema or anasarca.
