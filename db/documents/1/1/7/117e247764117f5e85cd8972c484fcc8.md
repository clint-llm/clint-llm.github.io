Both BNP and NT-proBNP levels can be tested through standard blood draws. There are also point-of-care BNP assays, which take approximately fifteen minutes for results and are often helpful in emergent settings.

Before introduction into clinical practice, BNP and NT-proBNP assays must be characterized with respect to the following pre-analytical and analytical issues:

**Pre-Analytical**

a. Effect of storage time and temperatureb. Influence of different anticoagulantsc. Influence of gel separator tubesd. Plastic blood collection tubes are necessary for BNP; for NT-proBNP, either glass or plastic is acceptable

**Analytical**

a. Identification of both antibody recognition epitopesb. Cross-reactivity characteristics with related natriuretic peptides, including NT-pro ANP, ANP, CNP, BNP, and glycosylated and nonglycosylated NTproBNP and proBNPc. Identification of interferences from heterophile antibodies, rheumatoid factors, and human antimouse antibodiesd. Description of calibration material used, how the material was defined, and the concentration value assignede. Clarification of dilution responses
