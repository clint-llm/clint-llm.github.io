The ECG findings consistent with this pattern, as proposed in the seminal article by De Winter et al., consist of an ST-segment upsloping depression at the J point of 1 to 3 mm in leads V1 to V6, associated with tall and symmetrical (positive) T waves.

However, it should be acknowledged that strict criteria remain elusive,

Interestingly, albeit initially described as comprising a static pattern,

Cardiac biomarkers, specifically high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) should be assessed, though (as stressed in contemporary guidelines) this should not delay the reperfusion strategy.
