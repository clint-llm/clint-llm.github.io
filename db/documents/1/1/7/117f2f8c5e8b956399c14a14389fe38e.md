During the preoperative HT consultation, the HT surgeon should identify patients who may not be candidates for surgery by eliciting the following information:

- Hair loss history: associated symptoms (fever, pruritus, scaling, erythema, rash) suggesting an inflammatory condition (e.g., frontal fibrosing alopecia, lichen planopilaris), hair trauma (excessive brushing, scratching, blow-drying)

- Medical History: skin conditions (i.e., vitiligo, pemphigus), thyroid disease, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, autoimmune-related conditions (e.g., lupus, sarcoidosis, scleroderma), systemic infections (i.e., HIV, tuberculosis, syphilis), local infections (i.e., tinea capitis, staphylococcal folliculitis), malnutrition and/or vitamin and mineral (iron) deficiency, recent childbirth, history of scar formation, chemotherapy and/or radiation exposure

- Medications: Several medications may affect hair growth (i.e., propranolol, coumadin, amphetamines). Additionally, antiplatelet and anticoagulation medications should be stopped to mitigate bleeding risk.

- Psychiatric History: stress, anxiety, eating disorders, trichotillomania, emotional trauma, body dysmorphic disorder (avoid operating on these patients due to low satisfaction rates and unrealistic expectations)

- Physical Exam: hair loss that is localized, scarring, or inflammatory suggests a diagnosis other than androgenic alopecia. Additionally, a positive hair pull test (this should be negative in androgenic alopecia) would suggest an alternate diagnosis.

- A scalp biopsy or KOH preparations may be warranted to rule out an inflammatory or infectious cause of hair loss, respectively. Hormonal studies also may be necessary, especially in women, if hyperandrogenemia is suspected (recalcitrant acne or virilization is often present).

Depending on the findings as obtained from the above examination, the surgeon should refer the patient to the appropriate physician or specialist (i.e., primary care, dermatology, rheumatology, endocrinology, psychiatry, pathologist) for further workup and/or management.

In summary, potential exclusionary criteria, or “red flags” for HT would include:

- Unrealistic expectations

- Mental illness

- Donor site miniaturization

- Unusual hair loss pattern

- Many broken hairs

- Excessive shedding

- Scalp inflammation

- Unexplained scarring

- Scalp or skin pain, burning, pruritus
