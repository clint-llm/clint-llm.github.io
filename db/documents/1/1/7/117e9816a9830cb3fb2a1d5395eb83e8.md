Though prisms have found a wide place in orthoptics' diagnostic and therapeutic world, there are no strict contraindications for prism prescription.

- Prism adaptation – If prism adaptation occurs, there occurs an increase in underlying deviation and thus needs to be closely observed by the prescribing orthoptist.

- If the underlying disease/mechanism causing original deviation is still progressive, the patient can adapt to the added prism and can redevelop the deviation.

- If the prism is added continuously, the deviation might increase over time and become permanent.

- Dragged fovea syndrome – In patients with pathology at the fovea like an epiretinal membrane, the patient's fovea might get displaced. This leads to a spatial disparity between the two foveae leading to central binocular diplopia. The prisms might reduce the central diplopia temporarily, but the diplopia reoccurs as the peripheral fusion takes over the central fusion.
