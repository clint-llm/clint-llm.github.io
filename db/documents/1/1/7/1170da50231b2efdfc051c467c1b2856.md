As currently understood, Meissner corpuscles play a relatively minor role in human disease. Meissner corpuscles are often noted as a benign accessory component in some cellular nevi, schwannomas, and neurofibromas. A single case report describes the presence of Meissner-like corpuscles within a mature ovarian cystic teratoma.

Occasional case reports describe benign tumors composed largely or entirely of Meissner corpuscles known as Wagner-Meissner neurilemmomas (WMNs).

Structures morphologically identical to Meissner corpuscles are identified in abnormal locations have been termed tactile corpuscle-like bodies, Wagner-Meissner bodies, pseudo-Meissner corpuscles, and Meissner-oid corpuscles. Several cases have been published detailing the identification of proliferation of these Meissner corpuscle-like structures within the lamina propria, the gastrointestinal mucosa, including the esophagus, stomach, and colorectum.

The origin of these lesions is unclear but may represent hamartomas, neural neoplasms, or a reactive process. Typically discovered incidentally during colonoscopy, these proliferations often resemble colonic polyps, leading to their biopsy and identification. Pathological examination of these lesions reveals discrete clusters of eosinophilic aggregates within the lamina propria. These structures are comprised of spindle-shaped cells, each with a single eccentric, oblong nucleus and lamellated, eosinophilic cytoplasm. Staining for S100 is positive while the histiocytic marker CD68 is negative, indicating the Schwannian or neural origin of the lesions. The differential diagnosis of these proliferations includes mucosal amyloid deposition and mucosal granulomas, although negative staining for Congo red and CD68, respectively, can be reliably used to differentiate these disorders. The presence of bodies within the gastrointestinal tract is benign.
