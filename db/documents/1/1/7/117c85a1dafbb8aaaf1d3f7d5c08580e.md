The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends lifestyle modifications and Metformin as the first line therapy. Lifestyle changes include moderate to vigorous exercise for 60 minutes per day, limiting screen time to less than two hours per day, and a dietary referral.

Metformin and/or insulin should be started at diagnosis. Metformin is first line and available as a liquid. Start at 500 mg/day and increase by 500 mg every one to two weeks to a maximum of 2000 mg twice a day. The gradual increase of the medication and taking it with food helps to prevent gastrointestinal side effects.

Insulin should be started for patients who are ketotic or in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), have a random blood glucose > 250 mg/dl, an A1C > 9.0%, or in whom the diagnosis of type 1 vs. type 2 is not clear. May use a basal/bolus regimen like in type 1 diabetes mellitus, but typically type 2 diabetes mellitus patients require higher doses (2 unit/kg/day - 3 unit/kg/day). Insulin should be initiated and managed by pediatric endocrinologists. Insulin takers have a risk of hypoglycemia; therefore frequent monitoring is required.

Home glucose monitoring is recommended for those who take insulin, have not met glucose control goals, are changing medications, or are sick.

A1C test goals vary by association. American Diabetes Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics list an A1C test goal of < 7%, while the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists places the goal at < 6.5%.
