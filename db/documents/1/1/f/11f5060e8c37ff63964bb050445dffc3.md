Chloramphenicol can be fatal in an overdose; this usually occurs with intravenous administration of the drug and is more likely to affect infants. Symptoms of poisoning include nausea and vomiting, abdominal distension, metabolic acidosis, hypotension, hypothermia, cardiovascular collapse, and coma.

Grey baby syndrome is a well-known condition that arises from chloramphenicol toxicity in infants, especially affecting preterm neonates. It can also affect breastfed infants whose mothers are taking oral chloramphenicol.
