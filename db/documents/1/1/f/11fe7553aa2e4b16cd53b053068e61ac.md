When the flexor retinaculum compresses the underlying median nerve, it undergoes a thickening, reducing its elastic capacity. According to a recent study, there is a difference in size between males and females. In women, the retinaculum is smaller; in the female sex, carpal tunnel syndrome has a higher prevalence.

In carpal tunnel syndrome, in the early stages of the disorder, the proliferation of myofibroblasts seems to play an important role, which not only increases inflammatory responses but reduces tissue elasticity.
