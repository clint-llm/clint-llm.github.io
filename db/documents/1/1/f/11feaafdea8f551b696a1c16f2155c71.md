Albendazole comes in a variety of formulations ranging from tablets to oral solutions. A limiting factorÂ in dosing albendazole is its poor solubility and absorption in the human body.

Care is necessary when albendazole is coadministered with medications that interact with the cytochrome P450 pathway as the CYP450 system of enzymes metabolizes albendazole. CYP450 inducing medications such as phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin, and carbamazepine can lower the concentration of albendazole by as much as 50%.

Commonly, clinicians coadminister steroids such as dexamethasone with albendazole to treat neuro-helminth infections to increase the bioavailability of albendazole, reduce inflammation, and decrease cerebral edema.
