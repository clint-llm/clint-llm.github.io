The World Health Organization has recommended two formulations for alcohol-based hand sanitizers keeping in mind its cost-effectiveness and microbicidal activity.

**Formulation I**

To make final concentrations of ethanol 80% v/v, glycerol 1.45% v/v, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) 0.125% v/v.

Take a 1000 mL graduated flask and add the following:

- Step 1: Add 833.3 mL of 96% ethanol to the flask

- Step 2: Add 41.7 mL of 3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)

- Step 3: Add 14.5 mL of 98% glycerol

- Step 4: Top up the flask to the 1000 mL mark with distilled water and gently mix.

**Formulation II**

To make final concentrations of isopropyl alcohol 75% v/v, glycerol 1.45% v/v, hydrogen peroxide 0.125% v/v.

Take a 1000 mL graduated flask and add the following

- Step 1: Add 751.5 mL of 99.8% isopropyl alcohol to the flask

- Step 2: Add 41.7 mL of 3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)

- Step 3: Add 14.5 mL of 98% glycerol

- Step 4: Top up the flask to the 1000 mL mark with distilled water and gently mix.
