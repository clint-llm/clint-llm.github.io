Over two decades of experience have demonstrated the effect of aldosterone antagonists on survival and hospitalizations in heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction. Therefore, one of the chief duties of the interprofessional healthcare team is to ensure that such patients receive aldosterone antagonists, including eplerenone, when appropriate, as part of guideline-directed medical therapy. Pharmacists should review the dose, check for drug interactions, and provide patient education. Specialty trained nurses such are cardiology nurses monitor patients, provide education, and report status changes to the team. These examples of interprofessional interaction and collaboration should lead to more effective use of eplerenone. [Level 5]

As regards safety, regular lab monitoring is of paramount importance for patients taking eplerenone. Following the release of the RALES trial, hospitalizations and deaths secondary to serious hyperkalemia significantly increased.

Finally, though eplerenone is now generic, it is more expensive than spironolactone.
