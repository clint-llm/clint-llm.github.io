PT and PTT evaluate the time it takes for the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways to take effect, respectively.

Mixing studies are done to determine whether a PT or PTT is elevated due to a factor deficiency or a factor inhibitor (antibodies to specific factors). It is done by mixing the patient's plasma with a control plasma. If the mixed plasma PT and PTT normalize, the PT and PTT prolongation is due to a factor deficiency. If they do not normalize, the prolongation is due to a factor inhibitor. An example of an inhibitor is lupus anticoagulant.

Vitamin K deficiency can lead to elevated PT and PTT. It can present as hemarthrosis, intramuscular bleeding, or gastrointestinal bleeding. Vitamin K deficiency is commonly seen in newborns due to the lack of gut colonization by bacteria. It also can be seen in malabsorption (cystic fibrosis, celiacs disease, Crohn disease).

Heparin is an anticoagulant used in hospital settings for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis. Heparin binds and activates AT. AT goes on to inactivate thrombin and factor Xa.

Warfarin is used for long-term therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation to prevent a thrombus from forming in the left atrium. It acts by inhibiting epoxide reductase. Epoxide reductase is a critical component in coagulation factor production because it helps recycle Vitamin K. Without vitamin K more coagulation factors cannot be produced by the liver.
