Fine needle aspiration (FNA) was initially performed in the 1930s when Martin and Ellis first described the procedure and the potential implications in the medical field.

The important aspects of the FNA procedure include:

- Minimizing patient discomfort

- Maintaining patient safety

- Maintaining proper ultrasound and needle technique in order to visualize needle entry to the target nodule

- Ensuring adequate acquisition of tissue sample
