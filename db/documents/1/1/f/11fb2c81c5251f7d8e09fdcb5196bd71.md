Prognosis is dependent on the onset of symptoms and the progressions of the patient's aortic insufficiency. Patients with asymptomatic aortic regurgitation have a good outlook unless their disease progresses acutely. Patients with severe AR and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction who undergo prompt aortic valve replacement tend to have good long-term outcomes.
