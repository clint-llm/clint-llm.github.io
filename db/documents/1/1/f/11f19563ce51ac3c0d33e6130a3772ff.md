The prognosis of surgery depends on the preoperative visual acuity of the patient. The lower the visual acuity, the poorer the surgical outcome. If the visual symptoms have been present for a long time, the likelihood of complete visual recovery is remote. The presence of foveal detachment and a full-thickness macular hole worsens the prognosis. High axial length, deep staphyloma, and the presence of choroidal thinning all make the surgical outcome less favorable with poor recovery of visual acuity and incomplete anatomical resolution.
