Diagnosing forearm compartment syndrome as well as treating the condition can be difficult for any clinician. Early diagnosis is fundamental, and patients can present with an array of signs and symptoms, which can be challenging. Early measures can be taken from the moment they come into the emergency department by the emergency care team. They involve administration of analgesia, removal of any splints or dressings, and elevation of the arm. Patients should be reviewed early in their presentation by a senior clinician. Where clinical suspicions are significant, the surgical team should be informed straight away. The theatre team, as well as the anesthetic team, should be involved early on as well in the management of these patients as often surgical intervention is required urgently. Where clinical findings indicate a pulseless limb, the vascular surgical team should be involved and ideally present during surgical intervention. Where time allows, early radiographs of the affected limb can be taken to aid diagnosis, and this should be in conjunction with the radiology team.

Following surgical intervention, it is essential patients have adequate pain relief, and close monitoring on the ward and pharmacy advice should be sought where necessary. The nursing team looking after the patient should be given a clear management plan following surgical intervention as their input is essential in the patient's recovery. In certain cases where secondary wound closures are difficult, the plastic surgery team's involvement is advisable to help with further management and wound healing.
