During endoscopic placement of a G-tube, a gastroscope is inserted, and air insufflation inflates the stomach. About 2.5 cm below the costal margin and medial to the xiphoid process, an area of maximal transillumination is identified while shining an endoscope light through the anterior gastric wall. A good 1:1 contact is confirmed by firmly applying pressure on this point and visualizing the stomach wall sliding off by this pressure at the same time. Once the site is confirmed, this area is marked with a surgical pen for the incision site. After the tube placement with an endoscope, the mechanism of track maturation includes the anterior gastric wall adhering to the abdominal wall forming a gastrocutaneous fistula.
