Patients are placed supine on the exam table. Electrodes are positioned on the right and left clavicle, as well as one below the costal margin. These electrodes will allow for ECG gating, which contributes to the accuracy of the images. Such accuracy is achieved by synchronizing the imaging with the cardiac cycle. A slower heart rate is ideal; thus, the reasoning of pre-procedural beta-blocker administration.

The patient will be instructed to keep gross body movements to a minimum and will be asked to hold respirations for a few seconds at a time. Non-compliance with these restrictions will impair adequate delineation of cardiac structures. Furthermore, severe agitation or claustrophobia can inhibit a patient from receiving CCT.
