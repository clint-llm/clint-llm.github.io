The suspected etiologies of bipolar disorders include genetic susceptibility, neurotransmitter dysregulation, and environmental triggers. Cyclothymia is thought to belong to this family of affective disorders and its etiology is regarded in kind.

Genetic factors have been robustly implicated in the etiology of cyclothymia. This influence is demonstrable by the concordance rate--57%--seen in monozygotic twins. Current genotypic studies are investigating several loci, including 18p11, 13q32, CLOCK genes, and ANK3.

Environmental factors play a large role in the development of bipolar disorders. Negative life events and negative cognitive styles are associated with an increased incidence of affective dysregulation and emotional instability.
