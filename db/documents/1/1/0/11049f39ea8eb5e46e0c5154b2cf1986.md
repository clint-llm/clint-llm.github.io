Outcomes of cervical epidural injections typically depend on the mechanism of injury and the degree of pathology. There is a recurrence of symptoms in up to one-third of patients with compressive cervical radiculopathy following initial treatment.

Interestingly corticosteroid injections did not have any significant reduction of pain at three weeks follow-up for the same study.
