The Florida Board of Nursing is a regulatory body that ensures individuals are qualified to practice nursing in the State of Florida in several vital ways; i.e., licenses, disciplines, educates, monitors, and rehabilitates. Nurses are held to a minimal standard to ensure safe, competent care delivered to all patients in a variety of healthcare settings.

Nurse Practice Acts, enacted by all territories and states of the United States beginning over 100Â years ago to protect the public, provide for established boards of nursing which have full authorization to create rules and regulations that ensure the laws are specific to the nursing profession and offer a sense of clarity. Board rules must follow the laws enacted by the legislature and adopted in the Nurse Practice Act of each state or territory. Rules and regulations promulgated by the board have the full effect of the law and are enforceable.
