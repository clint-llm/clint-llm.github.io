Fibric acids are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors alpha (PPAR-alpha) agonists. Fibric acids act as ligands that bind to PPAR-alpha. PPAR-alpha is a ligand-activated transcriptional factor that belongs to the family of nuclear receptors. Once activated, PPAR-alpha is in charge of several biological functions, including fatty acid beta-oxidation and lipid metabolism. By binding to PPAR-alpha, fibric acids reduce blood cholesterol by increasing fatty acid oxidation, eliminating triglyceride-rich particles, and the catabolism of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). The decrease in VLDL can cause plasma triglyceride levels to decrease by 30 to 60%. Additionally, fibric acids have been shown to work at the vascular wall in an anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic capacity. Fibric acids have pleiotropic effects that exert their effects to reduce atherosclerotic plaque formation and, thus, decrease the incidence of cardiovascular complications, including coronary heart disease (CHD).
