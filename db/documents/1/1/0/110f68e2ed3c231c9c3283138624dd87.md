Patients with SPS are at higher risk of developing orthopedic problems such as lumbar hyperlordosis, joint deformities, and muscle atrophies, leading to abnormal posturing and gait abnormalities with increased fall risk. As the disease progresses, unexpected tactile and auditory stimuli could trigger the occurrence of autonomic failure with tachycardia,  hypertension, and hyperthermia.
