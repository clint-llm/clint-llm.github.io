An atrioventricular block is a loss of the regular function of the cardiac electroconductive pathways linking the sinoatrial node (SA node) and the ventricles via conduction through the atrioventricular node (AV node). Third-degree AV block indicates a complete loss of communication between the atria and the ventricles. Without appropriate conduction through the AV node, the SA node cannot act to control the heart rate, and cardiac output can be diminished secondary to loss of coordination of the atria and the ventricles. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients with third-degree atrioventricular block and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, monitoring, and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe when a third-degree atrioventricular block should be in the differential diagnosis.
- Summarize the reversible and irreversible causes of third-degree atrioventricular block.
- Explain treatment considerations for patients with third-degree atrioventricular block.
- Review the importance of the interprofessional team in monitoring and evaluating patients in a third-degree atrioventricular block.
