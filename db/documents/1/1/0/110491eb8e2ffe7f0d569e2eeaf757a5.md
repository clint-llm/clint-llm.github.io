Many other neonatal conditions mimic the pentalogy of Cantrell. Following are the differential for this condition:

- Amniotic band syndrome presents similar to the pentalogy of Cantrell. The involvement of limbs and face favors amniotic band syndrome.

- Limb body wall complex

- Body stalk anomaly

- Isolated ectopia cordis

- Isolated omphalocele.

A detailed evaluation of the patient is required before diagnosis. In some cases, the diagnosis may not be clear until the surgery.
