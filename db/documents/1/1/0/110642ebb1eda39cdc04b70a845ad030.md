Coxiella burnetii is the causative agent of Q fever. Q fever is a zoonotic diseaseÂ seen mostly in people who work with farm animals. While most of the cases remain asymptomatic, the symptomatic patients most commonly develop a febrile illness. Effective treatment and vaccines are available for this condition. However, if not treated appropriately, it can become a chronic infection affecting multiple organs, including the heart, bones, and lungs. The workers in the animal industry should be educated about the risk of contracting this disease and the appropriate measures for prevention.
