Managing cinchonism requires an interprofessional team of healthcare providers that includesÂ clinicians in various specialties, nurses, pharmacists, and a toxicologist. Duties may include:

- Ordering drug levels in the serum

- Monitoring the patient for signs and symptoms of vision loss, cardiac arrhythmias, and hemodynamic instability

- Consulting with the pharmacist regarding drugs and drug synergies that may precipitate the condition

- Consulting with a toxicologist concerning the benefit of therapies to reduce serum levels

- Consulting with the ophthalmologist concerning vision loss

- Consulting with the cardiologist concerning the risk of cardiac arrhythmias

- Consulting with the hospitalist or intensivist about intensive care unit (ICU) care and monitoring while in the hospital

All interprofessional team members must immediately communicate with other specialists if they note any deterioration of the patient's condition. Communication also includes maintaining meticulous patient records so that all care team members can access the same accurate, updated patient data. These interprofessional strategies will help drive the best possible patient results. [Level 5]
