Many patients take PPIs, and it is crucial to recognize when the indication for use no longer exists or when they are not working effectively for a patient. For example, approximately 50% of patients taking PPIs for non-erosive GERD do not have their symptoms eradicated. In these cases, it becomes important to communicate to the patient that an increase in the PPI dosage may be a viable option. However, given the number of potential side-effects associated with long-term PPI, it is reasonable for clinicians to prescribe the lowest effective dose for the shortest period possible and maintain an adequate level of rapport with patients to adjust according to their needs.

This is why an interprofessional team approach to using PPIs is necessary. Clinicians prescribe the medications, but nursing staff should be able to answer any questions about the drug, including how to watch for potential adverse effects. Pharmacists will check for interactions and reinforce counseling points from the nurse. All team members need to contact the prescriber in the event of an adverse event or therapeutic insufficiency. This will result in optimal patient outcomes when using this drug class. [Level 5]
