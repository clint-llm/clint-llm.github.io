Syringomyelia is a neurologic condition caused by the presence of a fluid-filled cavity within the spinal cord parenchyma or central canal. It typically is seen in conjunction with type 1 Chiari malformations (CMs). Other known etiologies include spinal cord tumors, trauma, and post-traumatic or infectious adhesive arachnoiditis. Although syringomyelia may present with sensory symptoms such as pain and temperature insensitivity, it is more commonly found incidentally. The increased utilization of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the evaluation of neck or back pain has led to increased detection of syringomyelia. Syringomyelia accounts for up to 5 percent of paraplegia. This activity addresses the presentation, evaluation, and management of syringomyelia and examines the role of an interprofessional team approach to the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the common presentation of syringomyelia.
- Outline the clinical course of syringomyelia. 
- Review the complications of syringomyelia.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance outcomes for patients affected by syringomyelia.
