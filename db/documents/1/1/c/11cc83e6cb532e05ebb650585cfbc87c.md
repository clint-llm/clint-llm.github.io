Umbilical hernia presents as a bulge at the site of the umbilicus. It is a common finding during routine well-baby visits for the first few months of life. New parents who are not very familiar with this anomaly tend to be very worried when they see the bulge in their infant’s belly button. On the one hand, parents might be concerned with the idea that their child will suffer serious complications from an umbilical hernia, and they wonder if there are be any measures that they should take to avoid complications. It is important to understand the normal embryology and etiology of the umbilical hernia in order to answer these questions and when it is time to refer the patient for surgical evaluation.
