The retina is derived from ectodermal andÂ neural crest embryonic cells and starts development as two optic vesicles on the lateral sides of the embryonic forebrain that invaginate and form two optic grooves. The optic grooves continue to develop and by the eighth week of development the retina has formed into the precursor layers from outermost to innermost: the pigmented layer, outer limiting membrane, proliferation zone, external neuroblastic layer, transient fiber layer, internal neuroblastic layer, nerve fiber layer, and last but not least the internal limiting membrane. The internal neuroblastic layer will develop into the light-sensing rods and cones. The outer pigmented layer consists of cells that directly originate from the optic neuroepithelium. Neural crest cells migrate towards the eye and develop into choroidal melanocytes, which provide the pigment that will prevent the scatter of light once the eye is fully developed. These layers of the retina continue to develop in darkness until the child is born.
