The goal of surgery is the maximum safe resection to preserve neurological function with improved survival. Since GBM infiltrates surrounding structures, gross total resection is not always possible.

Most of the time, surgical resection is useful for definitive diagnosis and treatment. Postoperatively a repeat imaging should be done in 24 to 48 hours to assess the extent of resection.
