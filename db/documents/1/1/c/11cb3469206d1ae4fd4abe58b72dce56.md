There are multiple theories on the pathogenesis of alopecia areata. Central to these is the loss of the immune privilege of the hair follicle leading to attack of the follicle by the immune system. The loss of immune privilege may occur secondary to an environmental insult such as a virus, or it may be a spontaneous autoimmune phenomenon. In normal conditions, healthy anagen hair follicles express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I at low levels, which prevents molecular presentation as autoantigens. When this is disturbed, and MHC expression is increased, immune privilege is lost as previously hidden antigens may be presented to T-cells.

CD8+ T-cells, in particular, are known to play a key role in the pathogenesis. These T-cells produce interferon (IFN)-gamma, which activates interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7, IL-15, and IL-21 cytokines. IL-15  suppresses regulatory T-cells, promoting the proliferation of natural killer cells. Downstream, these cytokines signal the Janus kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway. JAK3 is overexpressed in patients with AA.
