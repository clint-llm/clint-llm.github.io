There are several concerns regarding informatics, their regulations, and ethics. One of the significant issues is the consideration of efficiency versus quality care. Specifically, when viewing decision-making across all layers of healthcare delivery, from initial in-person encounters to data storage and transfer, it is imperative to consider the reason behind each decision. An additional issue is patient access to care, and data which has several layers of regulation at the federal, state, and organizational level.
