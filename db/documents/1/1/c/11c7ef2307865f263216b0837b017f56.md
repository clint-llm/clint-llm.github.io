Plummer disease (toxic multinodular goiter) is considered to be the second most common cause of hyperthyroidism (the first being Graves disease). It is more common among females. It is also prevalent in the 50 years and above age group, both in males and females. In comparison to Plummer disease, Graves disease occurs among younger age groups.
