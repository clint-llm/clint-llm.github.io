Postoperative rehabilitation minimizes tendon gapping while reducing the chances of adhesions at the same time.

Traditionally extensor tendon lacerations have been splinted statically for 4 to 6 weeks, which often resulted in a loss of flexion due to adhesion formation.

Studies of dynamic and static splinting have shown that the former results in much-improved outcomes in the context of extensor tendon injuries.

There are now splinting methods which allow a degree of movement â€“ just enough to prevent stiffness, but not so much that it ruptures the repair. Relative motion splint (RM) is a compact splint where the injured tendon is placed in a 15 to 20 degree less relative motion than adjacent tendons from a common muscle. This means its particularly applicable in extensor tendons in zones IV to VII.
