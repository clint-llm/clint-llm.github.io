An interprofessional team is necessary to manage a patient with CdLS effectively. It may include:

- Primary care, otolaryngology, gastroenterology (e.g., for addressing GERD), ophthalmology, cardiology, urology, nephrology, dermatology, dentist, and orthodontist.

- Neurology: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are required to manage seizure disorders in CdLS.

- Psychiatry/Psychology: Medications can help to treat self-injurious or aggressive behaviors. Other therapeutic modalities include individual psychotherapy or applied behavioral analysis (ABA).

- Surgery: Surgical management for feeding difficulties, gastrointestinal complications (e.g., fundoplication if reflux is severe), vesicoureteral reflux, cryptorchidism, or skeletal abnormalities may be beneficial.

- Ancillary Services:****Children with CdLS require physical therapy (PT), speech therapy (ST), occupational therapy (OT), and special education programs due to delayed growth and intellectual disability. For all children with neurodevelopmental disorders, hearing and vision screening are highly recommended. Consult with a nutritionist may be necessary to address feeding difficulties.

Management of individuals affected by CdLS encompasses an annual gastrointestinal evaluation combined with monitoring of growth and psychomotor development. Furthermore, recommendations include routine eye and hearing evaluations and monitoring of heart and kidney functions.
