There is scarce data on the exact US prevalence of RVT in adults as it is often asymptomatic with spontaneous resolution. There is also a high degree of variability as the reported number of cases of RVT in patients with nephrotic syndrome, and membranous nephropathy is 5% to 60%.

In intrauterine life, RVT can occur mostly in the presence of factor V Leiden.

No specific numbers are available for the frequencies of RVT by gender. However, since RVT is commonly associated with membranous nephropathy, a male predominance is reported. This is because membranous nephropathy has a 2:1 male to female ratio. Similarly, age is a factor in RVT only to the extent as any age-related risk of glomerular disease, for example, membranous nephropathy peaks in the fourth through the sixth decade, making RVT likely in this specific age group). Lastly, there is no racial predilection.
