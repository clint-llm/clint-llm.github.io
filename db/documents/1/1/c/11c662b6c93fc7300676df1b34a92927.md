The true incidence of intracranial hypertension is unknown. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that in 2010, 2.5 million people sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI is associated with increased ICP. ICP monitoring is recommended for all patients with severe TBI. Studies of American-based populations have estimated that the incidence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) ranges from 0.9 to 1.0 per 100,000 in the general population, increasing in women that are overweight.
