When administering medications, one must fully understand the mechanism of action and elimination to reduce any unwanted adverse effects. Furthermore, when assessing a patient who may have either intentionally or accidentally ingested a toxic quantity of a substance, knowing that substance's elimination properties will aid treatment and the disease course.

For example, in the case of methanol ingestion, urgent treatment is necessary. Methanol itself results in sedation but is generally nontoxic. The toxicity of methanol is a function of its metabolites. As methanol follows zero-order kinetic elimination, a clinician can understand that the actual danger lies in the time from the ingestion, not the total amount. In contrast to methanol, other specific medications that show zero-order elimination are salicylates, omeprazole, fluoxetine, phenytoin, and cisplatin, which, when ingested at toxic levels, will achieve a higher concentration of the substance within the body over time versus the same amount of the substance that uses first-order elimination.

A firm understanding of the above-described concepts will help reduce the adverse effects of medications on patients and lead the practitioner to choose better treatments for patients experiencing toxicity symptoms.
