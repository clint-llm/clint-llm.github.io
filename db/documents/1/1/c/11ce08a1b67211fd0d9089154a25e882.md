The term Alport syndrome is used to describe a group of heterogeneous inherited disorders involving the basement membrane of the kidney and commonly affecting the cochlea and eye.

The type 4 collagen alpha chains are primarily located in the kidneys, eyes, and cochlea. Alport syndrome is X-linked (XLAS) and can be transmitted in an autosomal recessive (ARAS) or autosomal dominant fashion (ADAS). In 1927, the syndrome of hereditary nephritis and deafness was described by a British physician, A. Cecil Alport. It was observed that hematuria was the most common symptom, and males were affected more than females. In 1961, it was named Alport syndrome after having been observed in multiple family members.****
