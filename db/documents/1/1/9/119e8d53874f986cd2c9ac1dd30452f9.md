Guidelines pertaining to specific treatment modalities for sensory neuropathies generally do not exist. Much of the data regarding treatments are based on expert opinions, along with well-constructed research. Some treatments include injection of intravenous immunoglobulins, methotrexate, corticosteroids, infliximab, and plasma exchange, among others, depending on the etiology.

The efficacy of various oral drugs such as anticonvulsants (pregabalin and oxcarbazepine), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (duloxetine and venlafaxine), tricyclic antidepressants, opioids (tramadol and tapentadol), and botulinum toxin A (with and without chemodenervation) have demonstrated more effectiveness than a placebo in numerous randomized controlled trials.

Future clinical avenues for research are promising for the utility of physical exercise in sensory neuropathy secondary to diabetes mellitus. Some of the most current studies show increased nerve fiber density in patients with diabetes mellitus, as well as a measured pain response to exercise in those with established neuropathy.
