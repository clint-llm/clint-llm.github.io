Indications for obtaining a pregnancy test, urine or serum, include a female of child-bearing age with any of the following symptoms: amenorrhea/dysmenorrhea, abdominal/pelvic pain, nausea, vomiting, vaginal discharge, urinary symptoms, dizziness/lightheadedness/syncope, hypotension, or tachycardia. These are a sample of indications, and there are many more clinical scenarios where this information would be useful. Pregnancy status is essential to consider before the administration of potentially teratogenic mediations.

Indications for an emergent or urgent ultrasound in early pregnancy include a positive pregnancy test with abdominal pain, pelvic pain, or vaginal bleeding, as these may be the result of complications. Additionally, it should also be utilized in hemodynamically unstable females of child-bearing age to evaluate for sonographic evidence of ruptured ectopic pregnancy.

Also, ultrasound in the first trimester of pregnancy is routine for patients being followed by an obstetrician for dating and evaluation of viability.
