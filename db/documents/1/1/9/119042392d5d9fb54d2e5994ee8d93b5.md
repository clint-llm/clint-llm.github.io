Minimally invasive glaucoma surgery has revolutionized glaucoma management over the past few years. It is a relatively new modality of glaucoma management that is gaining popularity as large numbers of surgeons are opting for it. The postoperative outcomes and patient satisfaction rate are good with these procedures.

The safety profile and efficacy are also good. MIGS has opened a new door for mild to moderate glaucoma management, reducing the medication burden on the patients. Recent studies have provided highly encouraging results, and more large-scale studies with long-term follow-up will be needed to give better insight and understanding of MIGS.
