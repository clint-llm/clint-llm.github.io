The patient preparation begins with the preoperative installation of NSAIDs, and antibiotic eye drops 3-7 days before the surgery. The eye should be blocked to facilitate a smooth and safe surgery. The preferred block modalities are peribulbar, retrobulbar, and sub tenons anesthesia.Â Topical anesthesia has also been tried in MSICS with limited success.

The patient is given anesthesia in the block room and then taken to the operating theater. Once the patient is supine on the table, the right eye is identified, and the eye is cleaned with 10% povidone-iodine, and topical povidone-iodine is put in the eye. The eye is then draped, and a speculum is applied to keep the eye open for performing surgery.
