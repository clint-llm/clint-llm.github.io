The most prominent characteristic of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm is skin lesions, followed by involvement of the bone marrow and lymphadenopathy.

Skin is the most common and first affected organ, although blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm is rarely present without skin involvement. Skin lesions range from brown to violaceous bruise-like lesions, plaques, or nodules.

The production of skin-migration molecules such as cutaneous lymphoma-associated antigen (CLA) and CD56 by tumor cells has been associated with the dermatological phenotypic expression of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm.

The other signs and symptoms of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm include cytopenias, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly.
