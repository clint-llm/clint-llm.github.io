Once a patient has signs and symptoms of ETD and/or ear barotrauma, they should be evaluated via otoscopic examination to determine, and classify, the extent of the injury. This examination is important as it will help guide the diagnosis and treatment. Currently, there are three methods of evaluating and grading ETD and MEBT: the Teed, the Modified Teed, and the O’Neill grading systems.

**Teed Classification**

In 1944, Dr. Teed evaluated U.S. Navy diver trainees with otoscopic visualization following hyperbaric exposures in submarine escape training. TM pressure-related pathology became apparent during the course of those exercises and examinations, from which he developed the Teed classification.

Teed Grading involves a one-time evaluation by the same examiner, evaluating a person’s potential trauma to the TM.  Teed’s original classification included 5 grades:

- **Grade 0:**Normal TM

- **Grade 1:**Retraction of TM with redness along the manubrium of the malleus

- **Grade 2:**Same as Grade 1 plus retraction of the TM with redness of the entire TM

- **Grade 3:**Same as grade 2 plus fluid in the tympanum or hemotympanum

- **Grade 4:**Perforation of the eardrum

**Modified Teed Classification**

The original Teed classification was modified to include another TM grade totaling 6 possible Teed results:

- **Grade 0:**Symptoms with no ontological signs of trauma

- **Grade 1:**diffuse redness and retraction of the TM

- **Grade 2:**Grade 1 plus slight hemorrhage within the tympanic membrane

- **Grade 3:**Grade 1 plus gross hemorrhage within the TM

- **Grade 4:**Dark and slightly bulging TM due to free blood in the middle ear (a fluid level may also be present)

- **Grade 5:**Free hemorrhage into the middle ear, TM perforation with blood visible in the external auditory canal.

A “normal” tympanic membrane exhibits many different anatomical variations, as discussed earlier. As video otoscopy is not necessarily built into these classification systems, it may be difficult to compare a patient’s current score to their baseline based on description alone, and interpersonal assessment may not be standardized.

**O’Neill Grading System for ETD and MEBT**

The O’Neill Grading System employs the use of a video otoscope to take a baseline photo of the TM before any hyperbaric exposure. The photo maintains a permanent record of what the initial physician visualized during the baseline exam that may be referenced with any episode of ETD or MEBT, and assists in reducing interpersonal grading variation. This baseline may be useful in the realm of clinical hyperbaric medicine, although baseline images would likely not be available for unforeseen MEBT due to diving, air travel, or trauma.

The O’Neill Grades are assigned as follows:

- **Grade 0:**Symptoms with no otologic signs of trauma

- **Grade 1:**Any increased redness of the TM when compared to baseline, serous or slightly serosanguinous fluid and/or trapped air behind the TM

- **Grade 2:**Frank bleeding in any location and/or perforation of the TM

The authors propose that the O’Neill system allows for a more consistent diagnosis between practitioners. In addition, the O’Neill grading system encompasses treatment guidelines, whereby the authors suggest that grades 0 and 1 are easily managed by the hyperbaric team with reinforced equalization education or physician-prescribed medical therapy, and Grade 2 requires referral to an otolaryngologist for further evaluation.

**Differential Diagnosis**

While MEBT may be easily visualized and diagnosed based on history or direct otoscopy, any patient experiencing sensorineural hearing loss or new-onset vertigo following exposure to a change in ambient pressure should be referred for further evaluation by otolaryngology to rule out IEBT and PLF. These conditions may be diagnosed using pneumatic otoscopy that results in the production of nystagmus and electronystagmography, however, due to lower sensitivity, there are cases in which PLF is only demonstrated with exploratory surgery.

If IEBT is excluded, or in the event of a particularly provocative dive, inner ear decompression sickness (IEDCS) should be considered as it can occur with similar symptoms. While IEDCS is rare, it is important to consider it in the differential diagnosis as it requires recompression and hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). The HOOYAH criteria can assist in delineating IEBT versus IEDCS  based on difficulty in equalization, the onset of symptoms, otoscopic examination, dive profile, additional symptoms, and hearing.
