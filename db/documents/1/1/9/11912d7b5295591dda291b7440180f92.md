An estimated 26 million people suffer a stroke each year, making it a significant source of mortality and long-term disability. Up to two-thirds of strokes are ischemic in origin, and approximately 25 percent of all ischemic strokes are cardioembolic. Cardioembolic strokes are frequently more severe than atherothrombotic strokes. Additionally, they are more prone to both early and late recurrences. This activity reviews the etiology, evaluation, and management of cardioembolic strokes and highlights the role of interprofessional teams in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of cardioembolic stroke.
- Explain the evaluation of a cardioembolic stroke.
- Review the treatment options for cardioembolic strokes.
- Summarize the importance of improving coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care for patients affected by cardioembolic strokes.
