ONS is indicated in primary (without an underlying organic cause) and secondary (caused by an underlying condition, such as neck injuries, infections, or severe high blood pressure) intractable headache disorders including migraine and non-migrainous chronic headaches, and neuropathic pain in the occipital region.

Indications for occipital nerve stimulation include:

- Occipital neuralgia is a neuropathic pain condition featuring severe sharp, shooting, or electric shock pain involving the occipital or suboccipital region, probably due to long-term compression of the C2 nerve. It is the third most common headache syndrome following migraine and tension-type headaches.

- Chronic migraine. It is the third most prevalent ailment in the world, affecting approximately one billion people worldwide.

- Cluster headache: An excruciating attack of pain in 1 side of the head, often felt around the eye.

- Cervicogenic headache: A chronic headache that arises from the atlantooccipital and upper cervical joints.

- Hemicrania continua: It is a primary chronic daily headache disorder.

Recently, this approach has been successful in treating a case of chemotherapy-related headaches.
