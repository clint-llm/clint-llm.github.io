The general description of viral structure and its genome of CoVs is essential for addressing the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. As described earlier, CoVs are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses with a nucleocapsid, and the genomic structure is organized in a +ssRNA of approximately 30 kb in length and with a 5′-cap structure and 3′-poly-A tail making it the largest among RNA viruses. Upon entry into the host, replication of the viral RNA is initiated with the synthesis of polyprotein 1a/1ab (pp1a/pp1ab). The transcription occurs through the replication-transcription complex (RCT) organized in double-membrane vesicles and via the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) sequences. Conversely, transcription termination occurs at transcription regulatory sequences, located between the so-called open reading frames (ORFs) that work as templates for the production of subgenomic mRNAs. In an atypical CoV genome, at least six ORFs can be present. Among these, a frameshift between ORF1a and ORF1b guides the production of both pp1a and pp1ab polypeptides that are processed by virally encoded chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) or main protease (Mpro), as well as one or two papain-like proteases for producing 16 with known or predicted RNA synthesis and modification functions non-structural proteins (NSPs 1-16). Besides ORF1a and ORF1b, other ORFs encode structural proteins, including spike, membrane, envelope, and nucleocapsid proteins and accessory proteic chains.[3]. Different CoVs possess unique structural and accessory proteins translated by dedicated sgRNAs.The pathogenesis of CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is related to the function of the NSPs and structural proteins. For example, researchers have outlined the role of NSPs in blocking the host's innate immune response.**.**

**Pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2**

Structurally and phylogenetically, SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and is composed of four main structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E) glycoprotein, nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M) protein, along with 16 nonstructural proteins, and 5-8 accessory proteins.**.******The RBD is a fundamental peptide domain in the pathogenesis of infection as it represents a binding site for the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system(RAAS), as previously hypothesized, does not increase the risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 and severe disease.

SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into the hosts' cells by binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike or S protein (S1) to the ACE2 receptors abundantly on respiratory epithelium such as type II alveolar epithelial cells. Besides the respiratory epithelium, ACE2 receptors are also expressed by other organs such as the upper esophagus, enterocytes from the ileum, myocardial cells, proximal tubular cells of the kidney, and urothelial cells of the bladder.

In summary, the spike RBD allows the binding to the ACE2 receptor in the lungs and other tissues. The spike protein of an amino acid site (polybasic site) allows the functional processing of the same by the human enzyme furin (protease). This process enables the exposure of the fusion sequences and, therefore, the fusion of the viral and cell membranes, a necessary passage for the virus to enter the cell.

**Effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the Respiratory System/****Pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2-induced Pneumonia**

COVID-19 is primarily considered a viral respiratory and vascular illness as its causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, predominantly targets the respiratory and vascular systems.

The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 induced pneumonia is best explained by two stages, an early and a late phase. The early phase is characterized by viral replication resulting in direct virus-mediated tissue damage, which is followed by a late phase when the infected host cells trigger an immune response with the recruitment of T lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophil recruitment which releases cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF α), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), ), IL-1β, IL-8, IL-12 and interferon (IFN)-γ. In severe COVID-19, the immune system's overactivation results in a 'cytokine storm' characterized by the release of high levels of cytokines, especially IL-6 and TNF-α, into the circulation, causing a local and systemic inflammatory response.**.**

**Effect of SARS-CoV-2 on Extrapulmonary Organ Systems**

Although the respiratory system is the principal target for SARS-CoV-2 as described above, it can affect other major organ systems such as the gastrointestinal tract (GI), hepatobiliary, cardiovascular, renal, and central nervous system. SARS-CoV-2–induced organ dysfunction, in general, is possibly explained by either one or a combination of the proposed mechanisms such as direct viral toxicity, ischemic injury caused by vasculitis, thrombosis, or thrombo-inflammation, immune dysregulation, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) dysregulation.

- **Cardiovascular system (CVS)**: Although the exact mechanism of cardiac involvement in COVID-19 is unknown, it is likely multifactorial. ACE2 receptors are also exhibited by myocardial cells implicating direct cytotoxicity by the SARS-CoV-2 on the myocardium leading to myocarditis. Proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 can also lead to vascular inflammation, myocarditis, and cardiac arrhythmias.

- **Hematological:**SARS-CoV-2 has a significant effect on the hematological and hemostatic systems. The mechanism of leukopenia, one of the most common laboratory abnormalities encountered in COVID-19, is unknown. Several hypotheses have been postulated that include ACE 2 mediated lymphocyte destruction by direct invasion by the virus, lymphocyte apoptosis due to proinflammatory cytokines, and possible invasion of the virus of the lymphatic organs.

- **Central Nervous System (CNS):**There is emerging evidence of ACE2 receptors in human and mouse brains, implicating the potential infection of the brain by SARS-CoV-2.

- **Gastrointestinal (GI) Tract**: The pathogenesis of GI manifestations of COVID-19 is unknown and is likely considered to be multifactorial due to several potential mechanisms that include the direct ACE 2-mediated viral cytotoxicity of the intestinal mucosa, cytokine-induced inflammation, gut dysbiosis, and vascular abnormalities.

- **Hepatobiliary**: Although the pathogenesis of liver injury in COVID-19 patients is unknown, hepatic injury in COVID-19 is likely multifactorial and is explained by many mechanisms alone or in combination that includes ACE-2-mediated viral replication in the liver, direct virus-mediated damage, hypoxic or ischemic injury, immune-mediated inflammatory response, drug-induced liver injury (DILI), or worsening of preexisting liver disease

- **Renal:**The pathogenesis of COVID-19 associated kidney injury is unknown and is likely multifactorial explained by a single or a combination of many factors such as direct cytotoxic injury from the virus, imbalance in the RAAS, associated cytokine-induced hyperinflammatory state, microvascular injury, and the prothrombotic state associated with COVID-19. Other factors such as associated hypovolemia, potential nephrotoxic agents, and nosocomial sepsis can also potentially contribute to kidney injury.et.al reported that the deaths per 1,000 patients among ESRD patients during the pandemic exceeded the expected death rate among ESRD patients based on data from previous years prior to the start of the pandemic.
