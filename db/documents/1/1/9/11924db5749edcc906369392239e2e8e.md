Researchers have several prognostic factors, and there is controversy surrounding prognostic factors. Hematological parameters, prophylactic measurements, and individual patient risk factors have yielded inconsistent results. The MASCC risk-index score, originally designed to identify low-risk patients, showed a lower MASCC score correlated with a poorer prognosis of febrile neutropenia. Very low levels (<15) demonstrated a high rate of complications. Patients with severe sepsis and septic shock commonly had procalcitonin concentrations greater than 2.0 ng/ml, which merits consideration for an increased likelihood of poor prognosis.
