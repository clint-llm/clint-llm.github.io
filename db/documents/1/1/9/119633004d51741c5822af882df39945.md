Treatment options for SPS can be divided into two main categories: symptomatic and disease-modifying or immunotherapy.****These lines of therapy are commonly used in combinations, depending on the severity of the disease.

Symptomatic management is a standard of initial therapy and focuses on decreasing stiffness, rigidity, and painful muscle spasms. It is achieved using medications that promote GABA effects, such as benzodiazepines, baclofen, gabapentin, and vigabatrin. Diazepam is known to be a first-line symptomatic agent for patients with SPS. Still, it is not uncommon to develop a tolerance and addiction to benzodiazepines over time, resulting in a loss of its beneficial effects. Intrathecal baclofen is also effectively used in some patients. Other commonly used muscle relaxants include dantrolene and tizanidine.

Disease-modifying therapy is a specific immune-modulating treatment that aims at reducing or removing autoantibodies. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is proven to be the most effective immunotherapy in SPS, promoting a clinical improvement for up to 1 year after a standard course of five sessions. Unlike IVIG, the benefit of plasma exchange is not yet fully established, and most patients only demonstrate temporary or no improvement in symptoms.

Corticosteroid effectiveness is controversial in SPS. Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody against CD20 antigen on B-cells, has provided a long-lasting benefit in non-randomized trials.
