Though overall complications related to angiography remain low, the risk of complications following conventional angiography is higher in the elderly, patients with reduced cardiac reserve, calcified non-compliant arteries, renal disease, and multiple comorbidities.

**Minor Complications**

- Bruising

- Nausea

- Pain at the puncture site

- Minor allergic reactions like rash, itch, or hives

- Transient deterioration in renal function

- Transient hot flushes or burning sensation

**Major Complications**

- Significant bleeding, hematoma, or false aneurysm occur in <5% of angiograms, and 1 in 100 patients require overnight admission in the observation unit, while 1 in 500–1000 patients will require a second intervention or blood transfusion to correct the bleeding.

- Significant allergic reaction (anaphylactoid reaction)

- Acute renal failure

Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a substantial source of morbidity, which might require a brief period of renal replacement therapy. The essential preventive measures for contrast related complications include adequate peri-procedural hydration and use of minimal contrast volume.
