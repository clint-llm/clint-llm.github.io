The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published an update to their Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines in 2021. There are sections in this treatment guideline that direct specific care for select populations such as pregnant women, adolescents, persons in correctional facilities, men who have sex with men, women who have sex with women, and transgender men/women.

The treatment and management of the patient should be supported by the history and physical exam, whether the patient is evaluated in the Emergency Department, primary care, or infectious disease office. Primary preferred treatments will be discussed, and further reference articles will be cited for different management options for physicians.

The following recommendations are from the 2021 Centers for Disease Control (CDC) STD 2021 Treatment Guidelines.

**Acute Epididymitis**:****

- In younger men (<35 years) or most likely caused by sexual transmission of chlamydia and/or gonorrhea: 

- Ceftriaxone 500 mg IM one dose PLUS doxycycline 100 mg BID for 10 days.

- In older men (>35 years) or most likely caused by enteric organisms only:

- Levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 10 days.

- In men where the underlying etiology is uncertain or who practice insertive anal sex:

- Ceftriaxone 500 mg IM one dose PLUS levofloxacin 500 mg daily by mouth for 10 days

- For further details, see our companion reference StatPearls article on "Epididymitis."

**Chancroid**: Subjective and objective improvement are typically noted within 1 to 2 weeks. Failure to respond suggests an incorrect initial diagnosis, a coinfection such as HIV, treatment non-compliance, or drug resistance.

- Azithromycin 1 gm, orally as a single dose or

- Ceftriaxone 250 mg, intramuscularly (IM) as a single dose or

- Erythromycin 500 mg, orally 3 times per day for 7 days or

- Ciprofloxacin 500 mg, orally twice a day for 3 days

- (Azithromycin and ceftriaxone have the benefit of single-dose therapy.)

- Patients should be evaluated for treatment response 3 to 7 days after therapy.

- Some resistance to erythromycin and ciprofloxacin has been reported, but data on antimicrobial resistance is limited.

- For further details, see our companion reference StatPearls article on "Chancroid."

**Chlamydia**: Primary treatment and management should be supported by the history, physical exam, and clinical presentation. Consideration of coinfections with the most common STIs should be considered and treated simultaneously.

- Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily to be taken by mouth for seven days is preferred. Alternative therapy would be one dose of azithromycin 1 gram or levofloxacin 500 mg daily for seven days. In pregnancy, azithromycin 1 gram orally or amoxicillin 500 mg TID for seven days is recommended. Other formulations can be taken but should be evaluated on a case-by-case presentation along with the concerns of the patient.

- For persistent or recurrent nonspecific urethritis, specific Mycoplasma genitalium testing is recommended. If that is not available, repeat the course of doxycycline 100 mg BID for seven days, followed by oral moxifloxacin 400 mg daily for seven days.

- After initial treatment, follow-up testing should be discussed with the patient.

- For further details on treatment, see our companion reference StatPearls article on "Chlamydia."

**Genital Herpes**: Treatment and management of a primary infection should include systemic infection followed by symptomatic treatment and starting antiviral medications. The physician and patient should discuss medication options, including the financial strain that may hinder appropriate treatment. Treatment of reactivation herpes infection should be treated with whatever medication works best for the patient.

- Acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir are three primary antiviral treatments that can be started on patients for initial therapy.

- Acyclovir 400 mg TID for 7-10 days OR
- Famciclovir 250 mg TID for 7-10 days OR
- Valacyclovir 1 gram BID for 7–10 days

- There are various formulations and treatment courses that should be started after the best management plan is discussed with the patient.

- Suppressive therapy for recurrent outbreaks is effective at the following dosages:

- Acyclovir 400 mg BID OR
- Famciclovir 250 mg BID OR
- Valacyclovir 500 mg - 1 gram daily

- A higher dose schedule of these same agents is used for episodic outbreaks, and IV therapy is utilized for particularly severe cases.

- Topical antiviral therapy is not recommended due to its minimal proven clinical activity.

- Asymptomatic patients who test positive on serological testing do not need antiviral therapy.

- The efficacy of antiviral therapy in preventing viral transmission in asymptomatic individuals has not been adequately studied.

- Neonatal herpes is generally treated with systemic acyclovir at 20 mg/kg IV every 8 hours.

- For further details, see our companion reference StatPearls article on "Herpes Simplex."

**Gonorrhea**: Primary treatment and management should be supported by the history, physical exam, and clinical presentation. Consideration of coinfections with the most common sexually transmitted infections should be considered and treated simultaneously.

- One dose of a 3rd generation of cephalosporin, specifically ceftriaxone 500 milligrams, must be given by intramuscular injection.

- Complicated or disseminated infections will need ceftriaxone 1 gram either once or every 24 hours, depending on the clinical presentation.

- If allergic to ceftriaxone or cephalosporins, the recommended alternative regimen would be a single dose of gentamicin 240 mg IM plus a single oral dose of 2 grams of azithromycin.

- If ceftriaxone is not available, the recommended alternative is a single oral dose of cefixime 800 mg.

- Doxycycline 100 mg BID for one week is recommended for chlamydial coinfections.

- After initial treatment, follow-up tests should be discussed with the patient.

- For further details on treatment, see our companion reference StatPearls article on "Gonorrhea."

**Granuloma inguinale**: Treatment and management should be guided by the history, physical exam, and clinical presentation, as granuloma inguinale is not very common in the United States.

- Azithromycin 1 gram weekly or 500 mg daily should be taken by mouth for at least three weeks or until the lesions resolve completely.

- Other formulations and dosages can be taken depending on clinical presentation and the guidance of an infectious disease specialist.
- Doxycycline 100 mg orally BID for at least three weeks or until all lesions resolve completely OR
- Erythromycin base 500 mg orally 4 times/day for at least three weeks or until all lesions resolve completely OR
- Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole one double-strength (160 mg/800 mg) tablet orally BID for at least three weeks or until all lesions resolve completely, whichever is longer.

- For further details on treatment, see our companion reference StatPearls article on "Granuloma Inguinale."

**HIV**: Primary treatment and management consist of establishing viral load and CD4 count and starting a patient on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).

- Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is recommended for all high-risk, sexually active patients who test negative for HIV-1.

- Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) includes the following classes.

- 
              
- Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)
              
              
- NRTI fixed-dose combinations
              
              
- Integrase inhibitors
              
              
- Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)
              
              
- CC chemokine receptor five inhibitors (CCR5 Inhibitor)
              
              
- Protease Inhibitors

**HPV and Genital Warts**:

- The CDC recommends HPV vaccinations for all children starting at age 12 and up to age 21 in men and 26 in women.

- Treatment of genital warts depends on location, size, physician experience, and patient preference.

- The application of acetic acid will tend to make HPV-affected skin turn white.

- High-grade cervical dysplasia in older women or any persistent cervical dysplasia is treatable with cryotherapy, loop electrosurgical excision, or cold knife cone resection.

- If the lesion progresses to a malignancy, additional resection, surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation may be required.

- Accepted treatment methods for anogenital warts include surgical removal, cryotherapy (freezing the infected tissue), laser vaporization, and topical medications.

- Available topical therapies for venereal and anogenital warts include: 

- Imiquimod is a topical immunomodulating therapy that stimulates local interferon and cytokine production, inducing an inflammatory reaction.
- Podofilox causes wart necrosis by interfering with cell mitosis.
- Sinecatechins work in an unknown fashion but appear effective as a topical therapy. They are not recommended in pregnant or immunocompromised patients.
- Irritant (podophyllin) based topical therapy is no longer recommended by the CDC as safer topical alternatives are available.

- HPV testing can also be done on tissue samples of various squamous cancers (head and neck, penis) to help determine susceptibility to various treatment options such as radiation therapy.

- For further details on treatment, see our companion reference StatPearls articles on "Human Papillomavirus," "Colposcopy," "Cervical Cancer," and "Genital Warts."

**Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV)**: Treatment and management should be guided by the history, physical exam, and clinical presentation, as LGV is not very common in the United States.

- Doxycycline 100 milligrams, taken by mouth twice daily for at least 21 days or until there is a complete resolution of the presenting symptoms, is the preferred treatment.

- Alternative regimens would be azithromycin 1 gram orally per week for three weeks OR erythromycin base 500 mg 4 times daily for 21 days.

- Needle aspiration or incision and drainage may be needed from some buboes.

- For further details on treatment, see our companion reference StatPearls article on "Lymphogranuloma venereum."

**Mycoplasma genitalium**: Concern for an M. genitalium infection should be entertained if a patient is suspected of resistant chlamydia or gonorrhea infection, especially if recurrent or persistent.

- Doxycycline 100 mg BID for seven days FOLLOWED BY azithromycin 1 gm orally on the first day, FOLLOWED BY azithromycin 500 mg orally 1x/day for 3 days.

- If macrolide resistance testing is unavailable or not performed, add oral moxifloxacin 400 mg daily for 7 days after completing the above.

- Increasing macrolide resistance is being reported. A NAAT test for M. genitalium and macrolide resistance is currently available only outside the US.

- Fluoroquinolones are still >90% effective. Moxifloxacin and Sitafloxacin (not available in the US) have been the most utilized agents.

- A test-of-cure should be performed 21 days after the completion of therapy.

- If treating for pelvic inflammatory disease:

- Start with doxycycline 100 mg BID for 14 days.
- If the NAAT test is positive for M. genitalium, add moxifloxacin 400 mg daily for 14 days.

**Pelvic Inflammatory Disease**:****

- Ceftriaxone 1 gm IV every 24 hours PLUS doxycycline 100 mg orally or IV every 12 hours PLUS metronidazole 500 mg orally or IV every 12 hours

- Alternative therapies would be:

- Cefotetan 2 gm by IV every 12 hours PLUS doxycycline 100 mg orally or by IV every 12 hours OR
- Cefoxitin 2 gm by IV every 6 hours PLUS doxycycline 100 mg orally or by IV every 12 hours OR
- Clindamycin (900 mg IV every 8 hours) plus gentamicin (3 to 5 mg/kg by IV once daily).
- Metronidazole 500 mg orally or by IV every 12 hours for 14 days should be added if there is any suspicion of trichomonas.

- Consider NAAT testing and initiating treatment for Mycoplasma genitalium if the above measures fail.

- For further details on treatment, see our companion reference StatPearls article on "Pelvic Inflammatory Disease."

**Syphilis**: Treatment and management of secondary, latent, and tertiary syphilis should be independent of treatment of the primary syphilitic infection.

- Primary, secondary, and early syphilis infection can be treated with benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units to be given by a single intramuscular injection.

- Treatment for infants and children is also benzathine penicillin G 50,000 units/kg body weight IM as a single dose up to a maximum of 2.4 million units.

- Tertiary syphilis (including latent syphilis, HIV patients, and in pregnancy) should be treated with benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM once a week for a total of 3 weeks.

- Neurosyphilis should be treated as an inpatient with intravenous aqueous penicillin G 18-24 million units daily administered as 3 to 4 million units every 4 hours or a continuous infusion for a total of 14 days.
- Procaine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM once daily PLUS probenecid 500 mg orally four times/day for 10 to 14 days can be an acceptable alternative in highly reliable patients.

- After neurosyphilis treatment, normal RPR titers correlate well with negative CSF findings so that further lumbar punctures can be safely avoided in immunocompetent patients.

- Patients with a penicillin allergy should consider penicillin skin testing unless they have a history of anaphylaxis, hemolytic anemia, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, interstitial nephritis, or toxic epidermal necrolysis.

- If the skin testing is negative, this is usually followed by an oral penicillin challenge.

- Desensitization to penicillin can be considered in selected cases as penicillin remains the preferred antibiotic for syphilis, particularly during pregnancy and neurosyphilis, where no alternatives are recommended.

- Alternative therapies would include ceftriaxone or doxycycline. Azithromycin is no longer recommended due to increasing resistance in the US and elsewhere.

- Of these, doxycycline is usually preferred as it is inexpensive and easily administered. However, it cannot be used in pediatrics or during pregnancy.
- If azithromycin is used, the neonate would need treatment immediately after birth as azithromycin does not cross the placenta.

- Follow-up clinical examinations and serological testing is recommended at 6, 12, and 24 months after treatment or every three months for the first year and at 24 months in high-risk populations.

- A nontreponemal titer (VDRL or RPR) that has increased fourfold or more from previous levels suggests a reinfection or treatment failure.

- A high initial titer that does not fall fourfold by 24 months after therapy suggests a treatment failure, reinfection, and/or CNS involvement.

- For further details on treatment, see our companion reference StatPearls articles on "Syphilis", "Neurosyphilis", and "Congenital Syphilis".

**The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction**is an acute but self-limiting febrile syndrome characterized by headache, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, tachycardia, flushing, hyperventilation, hypotension, exacerbation of skin lesions, and rigors that occur within the first 24 hours after initiation of antimicrobial therapy for syphilis. It may also occur with other infections caused by spirochetes, such as Lyme disease, leptospirosis, tick-borne relapsing fever, and certain other infections. The most common symptoms are fever and skin changes.

It is caused by the sudden release of bacterial toxins, which induce an inflammatory cytokine response (interleukin-6. interleukin-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) that is the immediate cause of the noted symptoms. The severity of the reaction is directly related to the patient's individual bacterial load. The reaction typically starts about 2 hours after the initial administration of an antimicrobial, lasts an average of about 9 hours, and generally resolves without treatment by 24 hours. It is most frequently seen when starting treatment of seropositive primary and secondary syphilis, most likely from the high bacterial loads. More than 50% of such high-risk patients are likely to experience a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. It is least likely in patients with latent syphilis.

Patients should be informed of this possible reaction prior to initiating treatment, that it is a common, expected response to therapy and not a penicillin allergy.

NSAIDs and acetaminophen have been used for symptomatic treatment, but they will not prevent the reaction. Anti-TNF-alpha antibodies and steroids have been used to help mitigate symptoms but have not been well studied. In rare cases, the Jarisch Herxheimer reaction can be life-threatening, usually due to prolonged hypotension.

Early labor can be induced, and fetal distress has been reported when syphilis treatment is begun during pregnancy, and a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is precipitated. The incidence of the reaction in pregnancy has been estimated at 40%. Nevertheless, it is recommended that syphilis therapy not be delayed, although fetal monitoring is recommended in late pregnancy.

**Trichomoniasis**: Treatment and management should be established with that patient after diagnosis.

- For men, a single dose of metronidazole 2 grams is taken orally.

- For women, metronidazole 500 mg by mouth twice daily with food for seven days.

- Alternate therapy for both men and women is a single dose of tinidazole 2 grams to be taken by mouth.

- Desensitization therapy is recommended for patients who are allergic to nitroimidazoles (which includes both metronidazole and tinidazole.)

- Retesting all women (but not men) three months after therapy is recommended.

- For further details on treatment, see our companion reference StatPearls article on "Trichomoniasis."

**Evaluation and Treatment of Patients After a Sexual Assault**

Victims of sexual assault may be exposed to unknown potential infections. They also tend to have poor follow-up, so prophylactic antibiotics for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis are recommended. Emergency contraception, along with testing for hepatitis B, HIV, and HPV, is recommended by the CDC.

**Summary**

For Patients with Urethral or Vaginal Discharge and Women with Lower Abdominal and/or Pelvic Pain Suspicious of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease:

- Perform nucleic-acid amplification tests (NAAT) to identify Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis whenever such infections or coinfections are likely.

- Start treatment the same day, based on test results, whenever possible.

- If test results are unavailable, the WHO recommends treating symptomatic patients for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis. Treatment of their sexual partners will depend on test results.

- If a urethral discharge is present, but test results for Neisseria and chlamydia are negative, treat for Mycoplasma genitalium and/or Trichomonas vaginalis.

- Patients with persistent or recurrent discharge after three weeks should have repeat NAAT testing to include N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, M. genitalium, and T. vaginalis.

- If the test for Neisseria gonorrhoeae is positive, check for antibiotic resistance.

- HIV and syphilis testing is generally recommended for all STI patients regardless of other findings.

**For Patients with Genital Ulcerative Lesions**

- Perform nucleic-acid amplification tests (NAAT) to identify the Herpes simplex virus and Treponema pallidum, as well as serological tests for syphilis.

- Start treatment the same day for syphilis and/or herpes if test results are available.

- If test results are not available, start treatment immediately based on the clinical impression and revise later when the information is forthcoming.

- Obtain similar molecular assays on anogenital lesions to identify lymphogranuloma venereum, where this is endemic.

- Treat for lymphogranuloma venereum only when the test results for this disease are positive.

- Treat for chancroid only in those regions where the disease has been identified.

- HIV and syphilis testing is generally recommended for all STI patients regardless of other findings.
