Patients with positive findings on the Ottawa ankle test should be referred for X-ray of the ankle.Â  It is important to note that the prevalence of ankle fractures occur in less than 15% of cases.

Following physical examination, lateral ankle injury is classified into three grades:

- Grade I injuries are due to the stretching of the ligament.

- Grade II is a moderate sprain.

- Grade III involves severe sprain full ligament lesions.

The increased grade indicates the severity of the injury, and as such, each grade assists clinicians with appropriate treatment, prognosis, and anticipated complications.
