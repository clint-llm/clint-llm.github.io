Antiplatelets and anticoagulants are used to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism in patients at high risk. However, when these patients need gastrointestinal procedures like endoscopy, these agents increased the risk of bleeding related to the procedure. This activity reviews an interprofessional approach to holding antithrombotic therapy before different gastrointestinal procedures, and the resumption following the same.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the risk of bleeding associated with different gastrointestinal procedures.
- Summarize the risks of thromboembolism in different medical conditions.
- Describe the approach to the management of anticoagulants and antiplatelets before elective gastrointestinal procedures.
- Outline the approach to managing the risks of bleeding associated with antithrombotic agents in patients requiring emergent endoscopy by an interprofessional team.
