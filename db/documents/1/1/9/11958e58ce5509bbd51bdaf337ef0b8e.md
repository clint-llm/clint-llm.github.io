Temporal mandibular joint (TMJ) dislocation, or mandibular dislocation, can present as bilateral or unilateral displacement of the mandibular condyle from the articular surface of the temporal bone (the glenoid fossa). Anterior, posterior, superior, and lateral mandibular dislocations can occur. The anatomy of the TMJ is important to understand for the evaluation and treatment of the condition. The mandibular condyle is normally in its position in the glenoid fossa of the temporal bone. The joint is one of the few joints in the body with a dense fibrocartilagenous disc that lies between the glenoid fossa and the condyle; this allows the joint to function as both a hinge and as a gliding joint. The muscles which participate in jaw closure are the masseter, medial pterygoid, and temporalis muscles. Jaw opening is the function of the lateral pterygoid muscle. Ligaments that support the joint are the temporomandibular, sphenomandibular, and capsular ligaments. Blood is supplied to the joint by the superficial temporal branch of the external carotid artery. The joint receives sensory innervation from the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (V3) via the masseteric and auriculotemporal nerves.
