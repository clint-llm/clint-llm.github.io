Histopathologic examination of the tissue involved in the fistula reflects an acute inflammatory reaction besides the original pathology of the causative disease except in injuries. The acute inflammation is caused by a combination of more than one factor like the primary pathology causing the fistula (diverticular disease, malignancy, Crohn's, among others), tissue irritation by the flow of intestinal content, and the resulting infection.

Postsurgical intestinal fistulae are acute with a significant, infectious, inflammatory component that may infrequently lead to sepsis. Sudden deterioration of multiple organs can be the presenting clinical picture on some of these occasions. This is the most detrimental pathological component in patients' survival in these complications.
