An evidence-based approach to appendicitis in children

Pediatric appendicitis is managed by an interprofessional team of professionals that include a surgeon, nurse, emergency department physician, pediatrician, and radiologist.Â  Patients need to be educated that appendicitis in this age group has a higher risk of perforation and the hospital stay may be prolonged. Children often need pain medications after discharge and the pharmacist should educate the patient on dose and frequency. If the child is prescribed a prescription strength analgesic, the parents should be warned about constipation. In some children with perforation and a pelvic abscess, parenteral nutrition may be required and a dietitian consult should be made.

Outcomes

In the majority of children with appendicitis, the outcomes are excellent after surgery. However, the rate of perforation is much higher in children compared to adults. About 1-3% of children develop an intra-abdominal abscess and small bowel obstruction as a result of the perforation. Mortality rates of less than 1% are reported in children with appendicitis who are surgically treated. A number of studies show that administration of antibiotics is vital in children with appendicitis. This has been shown to lower the rates of perforation and the surgery can even be delayed until morning. Deaths are most common in neonates with appendicitis primarily because they are not verbal.
