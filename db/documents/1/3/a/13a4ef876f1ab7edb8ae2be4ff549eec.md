Clonidine has a black box warning for appropriate use:

- Prior to use, dilute 500 mcg/ml strength product in an appropriate solution.

**Obstetrical, Postpartum, or Perioperative Use**

- Weigh risk versus benefit

- Epidural clonidine is not recommended for obstetrical and postpartum perioperative pain control because of the increased risk of hemodynamic instabilities like hypotension and bradycardia.

**Clonidine Addiction**

Even though clonidine is a medication commonly used for withdrawal symptoms of opioid addiction, it has the potential to be a substance of misuse and needs monitoring in that regard.

Clonidine use, in many cases, does not typically fit the category of addiction stereotype, especially because most of the abusers do not feel like they are doing anything wrong as it is a prescription medication. Clonidine is not in a category of high potential for abuse medication by the United States government. As a result, it has fewer restrictions, and it is less risky to take it for abuse. Unfortunately, much of clonidine abuse starts in rehabilitation centers as it is a common medication for opioid and alcohol withdrawal treatment. Since it helps reduce withdrawal symptoms and cravings, clinicians should evaluate their concerns about the potential of trading addictions.

Also, the synergistic potential of clonidine, when mixed with other benzodiazepines, opioids, or alcohol, can give the individual more potent drowsiness and further detachment from reality. It is essential to notify the patients and try to screen for signs of dependency on clonidine as listed below:

- Feeling an intense urge for clonidine

- Feeling the need for the use of clonidine regularly

- Finding that one is taking more clonidine to achieve the same effect

- A patient who always wants to ensure that there is always a backup supply of clonidine

- Spending more on clonidine than one can afford

- The patient cannot picture quitting clonidine

- Experience withdrawal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, insomnia, restlessness, or anxiety when trying to stop taking clonidine
