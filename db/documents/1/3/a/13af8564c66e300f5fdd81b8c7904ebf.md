The ureter is made up of 3 layers: innermost mucosa, muscularis, and the outer adventitia.

The mucosa is lined with circular transitional epithelium. The keratin in this layer is responsible for the waterproof propereties.

The musclaris layer is made up of 2 longitudinal layers and a circular layer in the middle. The peristaltic motion of the ureter arises from the continuous smooth muscle layer from the ureter to the minor renal calyces, where the pacemaker for ureteric persitalsis is thought to arise

The adventitia is made up of dense collagen and elastic fibers
