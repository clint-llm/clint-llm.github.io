The presence of headache, high-grade fever, myalgias, and vomiting (might have hematemesis if in an acute state), which are very non-specific and seen in other diseases, are observed. Furthermore, the disease clinically varies from subclinical, mild, moderate to severe as it depends, which strain the patient acquired and how the host immune system reacts.

Severe HFRS is divided into 5 phases: febrile, hypotensive, oliguric, polyuric, and convalescent. Clinically it depends on which stage the patient is in. For example, in the febrile phase, some patients might have conjunctival hemorrhage and fine petechiae on the palate.

Thrombocytopenia is a key lab finding which is also associated with the increase in blood vessel permeability. Thrombocytopenia and high plasma IL-6 is also associated with the severity of the disease.

To confirm the diagnosis of HFRS, a serological test such as ELISA will detect antibodies against the virus, IgM on the 4th day, and IgG present on the 6th day. Western blot is another test that identifies the presence of viral antigens. PCR is not as reliable as the viral load is very short-lived. The most common serotypes in China are the hantavirus (HTNV) and Seoul virus (SEOV).
