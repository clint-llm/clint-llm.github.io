Placido Disc Topography

Placido disc was developed in the 1880s and was one of the first methods developed to measure the anterior corneal surface.

**Tomography**

Slit-Scanning Elevation Topography

Slit-scanning elevation can image both the anterior and posterior surfaces. A slit beam of light is directed onto the cornea, and the different refractions from the anterior and posterior surface create two reflections. These two reflections, plus the original beam of light, forms a triangle, called ray-tracing triangulation, which can be interpreted using mathematical equations to recreate the surfaces of the cornea. Also, because the light reflections have the same reference point, slit-scanning elevation topography can calculate the thickness of the cornea, called corneal pachymetry.

Scheimpflug Imaging

One limitation of slit-scanning topography is that the peripheral measurement of the cornea loses its accuracy because the object, light, and image planes are no longer parallel. This issue was addressed by taking into account the Scheimpflug principle. First used in photography, Scheimpflug noted that by extrapolating the plane on which the object and image lie, the planes would intersect at a point, producing better image resolution.

There are two types of devices operating with either one camera (e.g., Pentacam, Orbscan II) or with two cameras (e.g., Galilei Dual Scheimpflug Analyzer). Two cameras allow measurements to be averaged and minimize decentration, such as in the case of involuntary eye movement

Anterior-Segment Optical Coherence Tomography (AS-OCT)

Anterior-segment OCT produces cross-sectional images of the anterior segment, analogous to ultrasound, but instead of utilizing sound waves, it uses infrared light. A beam of light is split, one to the reference mirror at a known distance, and the second to the sample. Light scatters differently when it encounters various structures, and the OCT, called low-coherence interferometry, picks up the time delay.

Time-domain (TD) OCT has a reference mirror that moves around to scan the cornea, taking a series of light samples. Visante OCT and Heidelberg slit-lamp OCT are examples of time-domain OCTs.

Fourier-domain (FD) OCT, or spectral-domain, has a fixed reference mirror and takes all the measurements simultaneously.

A newer type of OCT, swept-source, scans faster and can penetrate more dense cataracts and measure axial length inaccessible to other OCTs.

It is standard of care to use OCT when requiring precise corneal measurements. OCT has reproducible central corneal thickness measurements but less consistent epithelial thickness.
