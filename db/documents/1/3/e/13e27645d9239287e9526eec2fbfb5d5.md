Albright hereditary osteodystrophy is a rare hereditary disorder. Patients withÂ AHO may exhibit various signs and symptoms such as a round face, short stature, brachydactyly, subcutaneous ossification, seizures, carpopedal spasms, developmental delay, obesity, dental anomalies, neuropsychiatric disturbances, and parkinsonism.

Children and adolescents with AHO should schedule an evaluation and follow-up by a pediatric endocrinologist. Presentation with seizure or carpopedal spasm requires care in liaison with health care providers from emergency services. Management of intervening unrelated illnesses needs care from the general pediatrician. Clinical psychologist and/or developmental pediatrician may be involved in assessing the development and intelligence quotient and offering the essential treatment options for the identified abnormalities. A dentist may be consulted to detect and treat the associated dental anomalies. Consultation with a nutritionist is essential to prevent/treat obesity and also to guide a low phosphorus diet in patients with PHP1A and PHP1C. A pharmacist will ensure that the patient is on the right dose of medications prescribed and there are no inadvertent interactions between medications. Consultation with a neuropsychiatrist may be essential for the management of neuropsychiatric disorders, whereas consultation with a neurologist may be needed if movement disorders or parkinsonian features develop. Rarely, consultation with a surgeon and orthopedist may be required in patients with symptomatic heterotopic ossification. [Level 5]
