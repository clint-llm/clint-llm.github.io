Current research is directed toward phosgene's potential as a bioterrorism weapon and in industrial settings where phosgene production is unregulated. Phosgene exists in the gaseous phase at room temperature but may be stored in the liquid phase below 8.2 degrees Celsius. Global estimates indicate more than 12 million metric tons of this chemical are produced annually.

Stratified by country, China produces 37% of the world's phosgene, followed by Europe (31%) and North America (20%). Recently, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) identified 123 sites in the United States that could expose millions of people to phosgene if the plant were to malfunction or become a target of bioterrorism. Phosgene is denser than air, and thus during exposure, it can be expected to accumulate in low-lying, poorly ventilated, or enclosed regions.

Characteristically, phosgene has a distinct odor. Reports have described it as musty or similar to freshly mowed grass or hay. However, only 10% of the population may appreciate this odor at concentrations reaching 2 ppm. The combination of its unassuming odor and poor detection by humans makes phosgene particularly dangerous.
