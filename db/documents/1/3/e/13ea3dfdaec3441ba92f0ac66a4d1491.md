Os peroneum is one of several accessory ossicles of the foot and ankle, located lateral to the cuboid within the distal peroneus longus tendon.

Routine foot radiographs are a common first step in assessing lateral midfoot pain. Abnormalities in the morphology and location of the os peroneum can easily be identified on radiographs, specifically the oblique view, thereby elevating clinical suspicion for a peroneus longus tendon injury.
