Congenital muscular dystrophy is one of the variants of muscle weakness disorders presenting early in life during infancy and soon after birth. The difference between congenital myopathies and muscular dystrophies is that dystrophies are gradually progressive and are associated with increased muscle breakdown with age. Congenital myopathies signify disorders associated with muscle weakness in the neonatal age group, which could be secondary to genetic, metabolic, or other disorders and usually have a non-progressive course. This activity reviews the classification, evaluation, and treatment of congenital muscular dystrophies and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify various causes of muscle weakness presenting early in infancy.
- Describe the different categories of muscular dystrophies on the basis of genetic patterns involved.
- Summarize the diagnosis and management of muscular dystrophies.
- Outline the role of various subspecialists and healthcare providers in managing these patients to provide improved quality of life and outcomes.
