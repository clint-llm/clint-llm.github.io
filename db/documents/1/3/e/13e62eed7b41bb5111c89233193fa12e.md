The landmark trial for empagliflozin is called the Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes mellitus patients (EMPA REG OUTCOME), which pooled a total of 7020 patients and found significantly lower rates of death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalizations for heart failure, and death from any co-transporter in the empagliflozin group.

The entire interprofessional healthcare team should participate in empagliflozin therapy. The family clinician or endocrinologist will make the initial prescribing decision. Nursing should understand the adverse event profile of this drug, and assist in monitoring at follow-up visits, for both side effects as well as therapeutic effectiveness. The pharmacist should weigh in with dosing verification, suggestions on dosing titration, and performing medication reconciliation to prevent drug interactions, and can suggest other agents if additional glucose control is necessary. These various disciplines collaborating as a cohesive interprofessional unit will optimize therapy with empagliflozin while minimizing risks. [Level 5]
