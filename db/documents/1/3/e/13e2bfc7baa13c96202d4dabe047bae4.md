The primary treatment of pancreatic panniculitis is to address the underlying cause.

In cases where pancreatic neoplasms are associated with pancreatic panniculitis, the tumor is often advanced by the time the cutaneous lesions appear. Nevertheless, early treatment may be beneficial. In pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma treated with a chemotherapy regimen of folinic acid, fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin, pancreatic panniculitis was resolved after multiple cycles.

While the subcutaneous nodules can resolve by treating pancreatic disease, hyperpigmented, atrophic scarring can remain.
