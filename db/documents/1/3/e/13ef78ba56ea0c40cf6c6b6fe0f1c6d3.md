Transmembrane Transport:Â The work of endopeptidases, chymotrypsin, elastase and carboxypeptidase and exopeptidases, carboxypeptidase and aminopeptidase, ultimately yields free amino acids. Facilitated diffusion and active transport mechanisms exist to absorb these compounds from the intestinal lumen through secondary active transport

The transporters on the apical surface of the muscle, liver, and other tissues absorb amino acids from the blood and concentrate them. Although similar to the luminal sodium-dependent amino acid transporters on the intestinal epithelium, these transporters differ in their genetic bases, protein composition, and specificities.

Lysosomal Degradation: Whether proteins are no longer needed or synthesized incorrectly, intracellular proteins are broken down using lysosomes and the proteasome complex. Proteins enter the lysosome through autophagy, a highly regulated process in which vesicles fuse with the lysosome membrane.

Ubiquitination is the process in which a ubiquitin molecule becomes covalently attached to the proteins to be degraded and interacts with a proteasome within the lysosome to break down said protein using an ATP-dependent process.

Once inside a lysosome, lysosomal proteases called cathepsins can also degrade cytosolic proteins labeled for catabolism. Cathepsins are another type of cysteine protease present within pericellular environments, cytosol nuclei, and mitochondria.
