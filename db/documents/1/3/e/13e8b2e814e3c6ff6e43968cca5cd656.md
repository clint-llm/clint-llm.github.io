An interprofessional team approach is necessary to deal with this dire complication. The healthcare personnel, including registered nurses, physicians, and cardiologists, should be appropriately trained to suspect any early symptoms and signs of CAP. This applies to the cardiology nursing staff and medical assistants who will monitor the patient following PCI, who can then alert the cardiac surgeon or other clinical staff immediately.Â This is why a cardiothoracic surgeon and anesthesiologist should be informed and readily available if the usual treatment strategies fail to contain the coronary artery perforation. WIth interprofessional effort, the rare complication can be addressed promptly and potentially save lives. [Level 5]
