Patients with viral encephalitis should be admitted to the hospital for supportive care and IV antiviral therapy. They may require intensive care for frequent neurologic exams and/or respiratory support. Early initiation of medical therapy is essential for HSV, the most common cause of viral encephalitis, so all patients with suspected encephalitis should be started empirically on acyclovir as soon as possible.
