In 1942, Seddon classified the severity of peripheral nerve injury (PNI) in three types; neurapraxia, axonotmesis, or neurotmesis.

Neurapraxia occurs when the myelin sheath of the nerve is damaged. If the nerve is stimulated distal to the injured area, conduction is preserved. Neurapraxic injuries generally have a good prognosis. Spontaneous clinical and electrodiagnostic recovery of this type of injury is expected in three months when the nerve completes remyelination.

Frequently, the word neuropraxia is incorrectly used in the literature.
