Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a progressive disease that, if left untreated, can be life-threatening and lead to failure of the right ventricle. The 6th world symposium on pulmonary hypertension (WSPH), held in 2019, defined PH as mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) > 20 mmHg.

Other groups ofÂ pulmonary hypertension include pulmonary arterial hypertension (group 1), PH due to left heart disease (group 2), PH due to chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) (group 4), and other miscellaneous disorders causing PH (group 5) will be discussed separately.
