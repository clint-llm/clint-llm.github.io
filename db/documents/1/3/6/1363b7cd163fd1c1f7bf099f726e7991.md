There is an inter and intraindividual variation in the location of the carotid sinus. This knowledge of variations of the carotid sinus is quite essential for a surgeon before going for any interventions (like carotid endarterectomy, carotid stenting, etc.) at this site, as accidental stimulating it might lead to severe hypotension, bradycardia and rarely cardiac arrest.

Four different sites of carotid sinus exist:

- Site 1 - starts in the distal common carotid artery and extends to the proximal internal carotid artery, which is the most common location (74.3%).

- Site 2 - starts in the distal common carotid artery and extends to both the proximal internal carotid artery and proximal external carotid artery (7.3%).

- Site 3 - starts in the distal common carotid artery with no extension after bifurcation (17.1%).

- Site 4 - starts in the distal common carotid artery and extends to the proximal external carotid artery, which is the least common location of all (1.22%).
