The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is a United States Department of Labor section that oversees worker safety while on the job. OSHA sets and enforces workplace safety guidelines that minimize the health risks associated with any profession, as well as providing safety education training to employees in many fields. OSHA sets these guidelines for all fields of work, but specific rules apply for high-risk professions, including healthcare that includes bloodborne pathogens, hazardous chemicals, infectious diseases, and personal protective equipment to eliminate exposure to hazardous materials.

One such safety concern overseen by OSHA is chemicals and the system in place to communicate the level of danger associated with various chemicals. Broadly speaking, chemicals are often involved in the design, development, prototyping, and manufacturing of products and general industrial use as disinfectants and machinery maintenance products. While many of these chemicals do not pose a significant threat to the health of a handler, particularly those involved in professions that make products for consumption or bodily use, many can be extremely dangerous and lead to injury or death if exposed.

OSHA's role in monitoring hazardous chemicals is establishing the Hazard Communication Standard (HCS), which was developed to standardize the communication of the dangers associated with exposure to a specific chemical that workers may handle. Further, the HCS aligns with the international standards set by the Globally Harmonized System (GHS), so similar communication standards for chemical hazards are present internationally. The goal of these hazard communication standards was to develop and spread the communication system so workers of any profession or workplace could see the container holding a chemical and understand the risks associated with the chemical.

OSHA enforces these rules for both chemical manufacturers and importers and requires them to evaluate the hazards prior to production to distribute the information to all downstream users. Additionally, the workplace using these products must have HCS labels for each chemical, safety data sheets available for employees, and provide appropriate education and training for employees who will work with the chemicals. Regulated under standard 29 CFR 1910.1200, OSHA establishes guidelines for chemical hazard and communication standards that reduce exposures to harmful chemicals. By establishing these guidelines, OSHA can hold employers accountable for maintaining these minimum requirements, especially those in high-risk industries, to optimize employee safety.
