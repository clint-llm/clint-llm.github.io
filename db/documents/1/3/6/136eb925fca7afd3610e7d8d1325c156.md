Factors such as young age, large IOFBs (mean length= 5.7mm) with high kinetic energy, best-corrected visual acuity < 20/200 at presentation, prolonged retention of FB, posterior segment IOFBs, and associated hyphema, vitreous hemorrhage, RD or endophthalmitis at presentation are associated with a poorer prognosis.

Multiple surgeries are associated with enhanced morbidity. Ocular trauma score (OTS), developed by Kuhn et al., can be used to prognosticate ocular siderosis and predict visual outcomes in penetrating ocular injuries.
