There are different types of robotic knee arthroplasty. Certain types actively do all steps of tibial and femoral bone resections, known as “fully active.” Other types enable the surgeons to do the surgery while giving feedback intraoperatively to assist in control resection of the tibia and femur to the pre-operative surgical plan, and this group is known as “semi-active.” The surgeon makes the approach, puts the retractors to protect the soft tissues. The robotic TKR then performs the bone resections according to the previous preoperative plan. This robotic TKR system has visual, audio, and tactile feedback that assists the surgeon in controlling his force and the direction of movement of the saw during the femoral and tibial bone resection.

Some robotic TKR provides software to convert two-dimension knee X-rays into a three-dimension bone model, and the role of the robotic device is to assist in applying the cutting blocks and perform the bone resections with better accuracy.
