The velum interpositum (VI) is a membrane resulting from the superposition of two layers of the tela choroidea of the third ventricle demarcating a potential space containing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) located in the region between the internal cerebral veins (ICV) and the posterior medial choroidal artery.

Kruse, in 1930 defined the dilatation of this space as “cavum veli interpositi” (CVI). Other names frequently used to describe this structure are “ventriculi tertii, “cisterna interventricularis,” “transverse fissure,” and “sub-trigonal fissure.”

CVI has a triangular shape with the wide base dorsally and the apex pointing anteriorly, reaching as far forward as the foramen of Monroe.
