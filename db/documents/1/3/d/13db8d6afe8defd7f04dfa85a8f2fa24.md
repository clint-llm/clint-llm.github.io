Humans are the primary reservoir for this parasitic disease, and mosquitoes are the vector. The mosquito deposits larvae into the bloodstream. They take up residence in the lymph nodes and grow into adult worms. The larvae have a predilection to deposit in femoral lymph nodes. They undergo sexual reproduction, and females give birth to countless microfilariae, which are dumped into circulation in a diurnal pattern. Females can give off eggs for approximately 5 years, and adults can live up to 9 years.
