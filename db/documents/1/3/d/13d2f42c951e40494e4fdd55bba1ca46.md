Hydronephrosis and hydroureter are frequently encountered in all age groups, and all types of practices and are best managed with an interprofessional team approach. Once identified on ultrasound or CT scan, prompt identification of etiological factors is of utmost importance. It can be found asymptomatically in pregnant women and can cause permanent renal damage if not relieved promptly. The involvement of nephrologists and urologists early in the diagnosis will improve outcomes.

Patients will also need close follow-up after placement of a ureteral stent to relieve obstruction due to high risk of infection, displacement of stents, etc. Timely removal of stents needs coordination in making follow up appointments by nurses or care coordinators. Clinic follow-ups for urine voiding trialsÂ should be arranged for patients with bladder outlet obstruction. Nephrologists play a role in preventing further episodes of hydronephrosis in the setting of renal stones by using management strategies to prevent further stone formation. Dieticians can play a role in stone prevention, as well.
