Nerve agent toxicity causes excessive cholinergic stimulation which leads to the classic DUMBELS symptomatology; defecation, urination, muscle weakness, miosis, bradycardia, bronchospasm, bronchorrhea, emesis, lacrimation, and salivation. ACH binding at nicotinic receptors results in muscle fasciculations, cramps, weakness, paralysis, and areflexia. ACh can also stimulate the brain where it can induce seizures and coma. Nerve agent toxicity affects all organ systems leading to a multitude of signs and symptoms often clouding the clinical picture and patients often present in extremis quickly after exposure.
