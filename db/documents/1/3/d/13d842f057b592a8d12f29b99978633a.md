Acute promyelocytic leukemia is a distinguished subset of acute myeloid leukemia which is characterized by fusion gene transcript PML-RAR-alpha and high cure rates with treatment. This entity was first described in 1957 in patients with severe bleeding tendencies, fibrinolysis, rapid deterioration of the clinical status, and presence of promyelocytes in peripheral blood and bone marrow. This activity illustrates the presentation, evaluation, and management of patients with promyelocytic leukemia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of acute promyelocytic leukemia.
- Outline the presentation of a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia.
- Describe the treatment options available for acute promyelocytic leukemia.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the diagnosis and treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia and improve outcomes.
