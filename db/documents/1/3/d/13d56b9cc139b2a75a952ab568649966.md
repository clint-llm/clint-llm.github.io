**Acute Exposure**

Symptoms include gastrointestinal, neurological, and dermatological.

**Chronic Exposure**

Results in continuation of the above; however, neurological symptoms persist even as blood thallium levels decrease.

**Gastrointestinal Symptoms**(presenting early within 3-4 hours)

- Abdominal pain

- Nausea/Vomiting

- Diarrhea or constipation

- Rarely vomitus or stool containing blood

**Neurologic Symptoms**(presenting later around 2-5 days post-exposure)

- Ascending peripheral neuropathies

- Distal motor weakness

- Ataxia

- Tremor

- Cranial nerve palsies

- Headache

- Seizures

- Insomnia

- Coma

- Death may occur

**Ocular Symptoms**

- Diplopia

- Ptosis

- Seventh cranial nerve palsy

- Nystagmus

- Optic neuropathy

- Lens opacities

**Dermatologic Symptoms**

At first nonspecific findings such as scaling and acneiform/pustular eruptions may occur. After 2 to 3 weeks, alopecia begins due to the cysteine disulfide bond disruption. One month after poisoning, Mees lines appear on the nails.

- Hypohidrosis

- Anhidrosis

- Painful glossitis

**Other Symptoms**

Patients may experience tachycardia or hypertension.

**Physical**

Though the exam should focus on the affected areas, a neurologic, ophthalmologic, and gastrointestinal examination is crucial.

- Abdominal/GI: A rectal examination and stool guaiac test should be performed with an abdominal examination.

- Neurological: All cranial nerves, nystagmus, and ptosis may be present. Lower extremity strength, as well as decreased sensation to pinprick, touch temperature, vibration, and proprioception, may be present.

- Ophthalmologic: Slit lamp and funduscopic exams while evaluating visual acuity and color vision are needed.
