Although rare, ASAS is a severe, incapacitating syndrome that usually affects multiple organs and produces poor outcomes. A team approach to managing this condition after the arrival in the emergency room results in the best possible outcome. The emergency room physician must do a rapid recognition of the problem and obtain imaging that confirms the diagnosis, which leads to early treatment.

The interprofessional team is necessary for the management of ASAS. Nurses are vital members whose role is crucial in identifying and preventing complications (pressure ulcers, urinary retention). Pharmacists, whose role is no less important since patients with ASAS, especially during the acute period, generally need multiple medications, resulting in polypharmacy. Physical and occupational therapists whose role is an essential factor in determining a patient's prognosis, especially for the long-term. Additionally, social workers and the different physicians treat the patient for mental, social, economic, and physical disabilities. In patients with spinal cord infarction, functional independence and overall lifespan have improved due to improvements in all healthcare fields.
