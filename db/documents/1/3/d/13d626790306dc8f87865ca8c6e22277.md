Serious, multisystem trauma may cause significant, long-term psychological and social difficulties for the patient and their family. Children are also at risk for depressive symptoms and posttraumatic stress disorder. Psychological and social support during the resuscitation period and afterward is important. A member of the resuscitation team should be made responsible for answering the family’s questions and supporting them in the trauma room.
