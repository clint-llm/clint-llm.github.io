The major limitation facing a much more abundant clinical use of hyperoxia is its probable toxicity and the relatively limited margin of safety that exists between its effective and toxic doses. However, an alertness of the toxic effects of oxygen and a familiarity with safe pressure and duration, limits its application.  Moreover, the capacity to carefully manage its dose provides a sufficient basis for broadening the current list of clinical indications for its use. The most obvious toxic manifestations of oxygen are those exerted on the respiratory system and central nervous system.
