Condoms function as barrier contraception preventing contact between semen and the opposite genitalia. It also prevents direct skin-to-skin contact of the penile glans and penis shaft and prevents contact from penile, vaginal, or anal secretions. Male condoms come in many different types, sizes, materials, colors, textures, odors, and flavors. Some include reservoir tips, special lubricants, or spermicides. Condoms come in various sizes, from snug to medium to large.

Reservoir tips are designed to allow for ejaculate pooling. Condoms without reservoir tips may carry the risk of semen leaking around the sides to the back of the condom.

The vast majority of condoms consist of rubber latex (80%). Other materials used are synthetic (mostly polyurethane) (15%) and natural membrane (mostly lamb intestinal cecum, 5%).

Condoms can come in a variety of textures such as ribbed, studded, located on the inside, outside, or both sides of the condom. Condoms can also come bulb-shaped. These different textures and shapes are proposed to provide extra sensation to either the male or female partners.
