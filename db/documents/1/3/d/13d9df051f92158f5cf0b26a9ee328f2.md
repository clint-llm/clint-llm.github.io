The sphincter of Oddi is a concentric ring of muscle originating from the mesenchyme surrounding the pre-ampullary portion of the bile and pancreatic ducts. Initially, it begins as a transverse slit in the circular smooth muscle at the junction between the duodenal wall and the bile and pancreatic ducts. The sequence ofÂ the sphincter of Oddi differentiation follows a timeline.

- Week 10: sphincter of Oddi begins differentiation

- Week 12: the bile and pancreatic ducts emerge through the transverse slit of the concentric smooth muscle of the duodenum

- Week 16: the muscularis propria extends outside the fenestra to the upper end of the ampulla

- Week 28: the muscularis propria is differentiated almost to the distal end of the ampulla
