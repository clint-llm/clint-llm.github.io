Postoperatively, patients should begin gentle range of motion of the knee to prevent stiffness. Depending on the intraoperative stability, the affected extremity may be made non-weight bearing, touchdown weight-bearing, or partial weight-bearing for 10 to 12 weeks.  Progressive weight-bearing as tolerated may begin after 12 weeks with the assistance of ambulatory devices if needed.
