Toxicities related to CAR-T cell therapy are diverse and still poorly understood. The evaluation of CAR-T-associated toxicities and their severity is based on clinical symptoms and signs, which are further aided by laboratory biomarkers and/or radiological findings.

**CRS**: It is a clinical diagnosis and usually presents with varying degrees of fever, tachycardia, hypotension, hypoxia, nausea, vomiting, etc. The vital signs are assessed frequently, depending on the institutional policies, with most centers mandating reevaluation every 4 hours for grades 1 and 2 and 1 to 2 hourly evaluations for grades 3 and 4 CRS.

Useful laboratory evaluation for CRS involves performing a CBC, renal and liver function test, coagulation profile, LDH, serum ferritin, IL-6, and CRP. These biomarkers are performed serially to determine the severity and response to the treatment. Some have also postulated checking IL-5,  IL-13, TNF-a, and IFN-γ levels.

**ICANS**: Like CRS, ICANS is diagnosed based on clinical symptoms, including headache, impaired attention and consciousness, lethargy, agitation, hallucinations, tremors, aphasia, encephalopathy, and seizures.

Laboratory evaluation of ICANS includes biomarkers similar to CRS in addition to a lumbar puncture to analyze cerebrospinal fluid, neuroimaging, and EEG to determine the extent of damage from ICANS and rule out other organic factors and/or sinister causes, including but not limited to infections.
