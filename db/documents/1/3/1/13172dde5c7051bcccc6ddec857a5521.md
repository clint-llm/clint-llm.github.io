**PUK Management Aims and Strategy**

A tailored approach is best, aiming to restore epithelial integrity, halt further stromal lysis, and prevent super-infections.

Systemic immunosuppressants can take 4 to 6 weeks to take effect; therefore, oral steroids will be necessary up to this point. Localized or systemic coexisting infection should be treated with the appropriate topical and/or systemic antimicrobials. Corneal scrapings should be undertaken at the initial presentation for gram staining, and microbiology evaluation and empirical therapy should be started, e.g., 4th generation fluoroquinolone monotherapy for bacterial keratitis. Once sensitivities have been established, the therapy can be adjusted as required. Topical steroids can be started to reduce the local inflammatory response after clinical improvement using antimicrobials. This should be delayed in cases of fungal infections. If suspecting herpetic cause, then topical acyclovir or ganciclovir are started. Systemic infection requires specific protocols and shared care with the relevant specialties.

**Treatment Due to Etiologies**

**Rheumatoid Arthritis**

Current first-line management is a systemic corticosteroid and a cytotoxic agent, e.g., methotrexate (MTX), along with topical lubricants to manage the ocular surface and encourage epithelial healing of peripheral corneal ulcers.

**Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis**

Aggressive treatment is needed for PUK patients secondary to GPA and PAN. The first-line immunosuppressant agents for GPA include cyclophosphamide along with systemic corticosteroids ideally started early in the disease course. Rituximab or cyclophosphamide with or without other agents is the most effective at inflammation control in GPA-associated PUK.

**Systemic Lupus Erythematosus**

Foster et al. have suggested that systemic vasculitis only develops in the latter stages of SLE. Systemic corticosteroids and a cytotoxic agent are used in SLE-associated PUK. SLE patients with evidence of systemic vasculitis have significantly higher mortality.

**Pediatric Patients**

MTX is considered a first-line immunosuppressant in PUK in pediatric patients with underlying systemic disease. If non-responsive, cyclosporine can be considered. There is a risk of teratogenicity during pregnancy, so these agents should be avoided. Oral steroids can be used with caution.

**Patients on existing Immunosuppression Regimes**

Firstly, infectious etiology should be excluded. Evaluation of potential systemic disease acute exacerbation should be undertaken. If there is a change in the systemic disease status, then the medical team can deploy a step up or maintenance strategy. Rheumatologists/immunologists will assess the clinical response to immunosuppression, which usually occurs after six months of initiation.

**Mooren Ulcer**

The diagnosis of Mooren's ulcer is one of exclusion. The management strategy is a stepladder approach, with topical corticosteroids and cyclosporine (0.05% to 2%) initially, then progressing to limbal conjunctival resection/excision, systemic immunosuppressants, e.g., oral corticosteroids, MTX, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, etc., surgery including astigmatism treatment. Surgery alone is unlikely to be curative due to the underlying autoimmune pathophysiology.

**Surgical Management**

There is a higher risk of PUK recurrence and graft melts with surgery, so this should be delayed until adequate control of inflammation is achieved.

The corneal defect size determines the surgical technique chosen. Multi-layered amniotic membrane transplant, conjunctival resection/recession/flaps could be an option in areas of corneal thinning.
