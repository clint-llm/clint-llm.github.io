While mid-face lifting is not a particularly invasive procedure liable to produce a significant physiological impact on the patient, certain conditions may make the procedure less desirable. Patients with bleeding disorders or the inability to discontinue anticoagulant therapy are at a higher risk for developing a postoperative hematoma, which can result in prolonged ecchymosis and edema, infection, and poor scarring.

Likewise, patients with a history of unfavorable scarring or other healing problems may not be ideal candidates. Common reasons for poor wound healing include diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, smoking, and autoimmune or collagen vascular diseases. Of course, patients at a high risk of cardiopulmonary complications from general anesthesia should be medically optimized before considering elective, aesthetic surgery.
