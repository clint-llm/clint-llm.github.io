Septic arthritis can develop either from hematogenous seeding due to bacteremia, direct inoculation of joint secondary to trauma or penetrating wounds (animal or human bite), or contiguous spread of infection from bone into the joint cavity. Gout and pseudogout are caused by deposition of crystals into the joint fluid. The most common findings for monoarticular arthritis includeÂ joint swelling, pain, warmth, and sometimes fever and periarticular erythema, joint stiffness, and total loss or decreased range of motion.
