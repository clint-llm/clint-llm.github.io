The diagnosis of stercoral colitis requires a high index of suspicion as it mimics other common intra-abdominal pathologies.Prompt recognition and proper management of this condition are crucial to prevent colonic perforation, ischemic colitis, sepsis, and subsequent morbidity and mortality.

Management is primarily determined by the presence or absence ofÂ sepsis, bowel ischemia, or bowel perforation.
