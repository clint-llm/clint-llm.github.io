The approach to taking care of the pregnant patient during the third trimester of pregnancy requires an interdisciplinary effort involving physicians, nurses, midwives, pharmacists, and other healthcare team members. There are multiple factors to consider during this period, and ultrasound has evolved as an essential tool to evaluate the progression of pregnancy. Even though there is no universal recommendation to obtain a routine ultrasound in the third trimester, its use can help identify pathology that can directly affect the outcome of both the patient and the pregnancy. Understanding the applications and limitations of this tool can help reduce maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.
