Although macrolides are a very safe class of antibiotics, proper healthcare administration by the entire interprofessional team should be done to minimize adverse events. All members of the interprofessional healthcare team should monitor patients for the common side effects as well as the uncommon ones. All members need education regarding common gastrointestinal side effects and the serious cardiac effects this drug has. Every healthcare team member shares the responsibility of providing top-notch care to their patients and should always be on the lookout for potential side effects.

When deciding to initiate macrolide therapy, the clinician (MD, DO, NP, or PA) would do well to include a pharmaceutical consult, which would consist of verifying the appropriateness of the agent chosen, verification of proper dosing, and checking for drug-drug interactions. Pharmacists can also assist the patient by answering their questions, warning of signs of adverse events, reinforcing prescriber directions, and reporting any concerns they may have to the clinician. Nursing can monitor and answer patient questions about their therapy and report to the prescriber on treatment progress or lack thereof or the presence of adverse effects. All interprofessional team members should know the most common uses of the macrolide class of antibiotics and exercise collaborative efforts to ensure optimal patient outcomes. [Level 5]
