During a neonatal EEG recording, the following steps are essential:

- Minimize movement or stimulation of the patient

- Appropriate equipment, electrodes, and tools are available

- Documentation of topography (head positioning), gestational age, conceptional age, state of the infant, among other relevant neonatal data.

- Minimize artifacts

- Adequate pasting of the skin to avoid breakdown; keep the impedance < 10Â kOhms
