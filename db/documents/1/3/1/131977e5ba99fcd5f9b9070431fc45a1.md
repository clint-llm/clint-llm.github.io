There are regional differences in the prevalence of VKH among patients presenting with uveitis â€“ it is the most common cause of uveitis in India (prevalence 21.08%) and the second most common in Thailand. In the United States, VKH is a relatively rare cause of uveitis, representing only 3 to 4% of referrals to tertiary care centers.

Genetic studies may explain the difference in prevalence, as the DRB1-04*01 allele is more prevalent in East Asian populations and that HLA-DRB4 and HLA-DRB1 alleles are more correlated to the presence of VKH disease in affected populations.

Patients diagnosed with VKH are typically in the third or fourth decade of life (range: 3 years old to 78 years old).
