Transgender patients have not only multiple different needs from a surgical perspective but also require medical management and behavioral health care in the vast majority of cases. Because of the number of different medical and surgical specialties involved in the management of gender dysphoria, as well as non-physician team members such as speech therapists, nurses, and psychologists, it is important to have a cohesive multidisciplinary team.

Patients may also benefit from well-defined institutional pathways that begin with primary care, proceed to behavioral health, then endocrinology, and after an appropriate period of time, surgical specialists as necessary. Institutions can further improve the environment of inclusion by asking patients to provide their preferred pronouns and gender identity and by ensuring clinical staff members do the same because misgendering can be a major source of stress and dissatisfaction for transgender patients.

Many university health centers have alsoÂ started providing non-gender-specific restrooms, which contributes to putting individuals who identify as gender non-binary at ease within the building. For many healthcare providers, the care of transgender patients is a new and unanticipated opportunity to broaden their horizons, and it is important to actively seek ways to be more inclusive in speech and action and to help colleagues to do the same in order to avoid further marginalizing a demographic group that has historically suffered a great deal of discrimination and difficulty accessing healthcare.
