Acute coronary syndromes are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis has a central role, as to allow a timely reperfusion strategy. The De Winter pattern consists of an electrocardiographic pattern which, in a proper setting, is highly suggestive of acute occlusion of the left anterior descending artery. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of patients who present with the De Winter pattern and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the epidemiology and the current state-of-the-art data concerning the pathophysiology of the De Winter pattern.
- Outline the typical presentation and the adequate evaluation of patients with the De Winter pattern.
- Review the differential diagnosis associated with the De Winter pattern.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients who present with the De Winter pattern in an appropriate clinical context.
