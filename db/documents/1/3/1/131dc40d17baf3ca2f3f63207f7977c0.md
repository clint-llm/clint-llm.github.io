The arrector pili muscles are bundles of smooth muscle fibers that attach to the connective tissue sheath of hair follicles. When the muscles contract, they pull the hair follicle outward resulting in the hair erecting up but also compresses the sebaceous glands, resulting in the secretion of their contents. Hair does not exit perpendicularly, but instead at an angle. This erection of hair also produces goosebumps, the bumpy appearance of the skin.
