The function of the kidneys is related to the cardiovascular system. Certain cardiac pathologies that cause systolic dysfunction and impaired forward flow lead to decreases in RBF. This, in turn, activates RAAS in an effort to maintain blood pressure. Long-standing activation of RAAS can lead to abnormally elevated blood pressure, excessive vasoconstriction, vascular hypertrophy, and fibrosis. It has been reported that the blockade of RAAS has been beneficial in patients with chronic systolic heart failure.Â Studies have shown that the administration of angiotensin II in mice models served as a protective mechanism in preventing kidney damage.
