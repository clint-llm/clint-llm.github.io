The complication rate for only percutaneous cholangiography is very low, with major complications being under 2%. There are four major complications described, and medical practitioners should be aware of potential complications that may arise.

1. Hemorrhage is the most concerning complication related to the technical difficulty of the procedure.

2. Infection and bacteremia, which include cellulitis, cholangitis, and sepsis. To reduce infection risk, patients should receive the appropriate preprocedural antibiotics before the procedure begins.

3. Biliary leaks are another complication, subdivided into peritoneal or pleural biliary leaks.

4. Pneumothorax can occur with a right-sided approach. Management includes sequential chest X-rays. If the patient remains stable, observation may be adequate; if not, a chest tube may be necessary.

Other significant complications may arise when performing percutaneous biliary work but are usually related to the management of biliary pathology.
