The assessment of depressive symptoms in dementia is confounded by numerous factors: overlapping symptoms, the issue of symptom continuation, communication problems in severe dementia, and reliability of caretaker opinions. A detailed history and a thorough mental status examination are required for adequate diagnosis.

Overlapping symptoms in history are decreased interest in pleasurable activities, altered sleep, decreased/increased appetite, increased/decreased psychomotor activity, difficulty concentrating, and decreased energy. The likelihood of a superimposed depression in neurocognitive dementia should be contemplated when the patient's symptoms, such as sleep alterations due to loss of diurnal rhythm or lack of motivation, become more serious over a short span of time. In severe dementia, a history of depressive symptoms may be hard to find secondary to aphasia. In such cases, the collection of history from the caregiver as well as detailed observation during the examination is required to formulate a diagnosis. Besides, sometimes patients with dementia have anosognosia (refusal of disability), which further complicates the reporting of symptoms suggestive of depression.

Collecting history from the caregiver can benefit, as well as complicate the diagnosis as they are themselves vulnerable to increased degrees of responsibility and sadness. The occurrence of depression in dementia has been strongly associated with the caretaker's burden and their own depression.

Clues in history that helps to diagnose depression are—

- Acute or subacute changes in symptoms

- Symptoms of hopelessness, helplessness, guilt, death wishes, and suicidal ideation. A detailed history should be taken to rule out active suicidal ideations, intent, or plans in any patient who expresses death wishes.

- In severe dementia, signs such as frequent moan, saddening appearance, sudden changes in psychomotor activity (agitation or retardation)

- Episodes of frequent screaming with depressive content, refusal to eat

- Past history and family history of depression

- Prominent complaints of memory loss and related feelings of distress, recent and long-term memory equally affected with a complete absence of language disturbance.

In addition to history, a detailed mental status examination, neurocognitive tests, and laboratory tests are required to rule out other medical causes. Observing the patient's behavior during examination is very critical and important. Depressed people lack adequate motivation to finish the task, take additional time to accomplish the task, and document frequent attention or concentration problems. They are usually apathetic and easily diverted. Patients with depression often document memory difficulties and associated distress repeatedly. On the other hand, patients with dementia seem to be less distressed and familiar with the magnitude of their own cognitive deficiencies.

On further questioning during the mental status examination: Patients with depression either do not respond or will reply," I don't know," to questions pertaining to orientation, attention, concentration, memory, calculation, abstraction, and judgment.
