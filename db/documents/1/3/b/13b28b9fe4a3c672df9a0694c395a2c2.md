The management of chronic wounds is done by an interprofessional team that consists of a general surgeon, vascular surgeon, wound care nurse, infectious disease expert, physical therapist, dietitian, and internist. There are many types of wounds caused by several factors. When wounds do not heal, it is important to consult with a wound care specialist. There are dozens of methods of treating wounds, but the key is to ensure that the wound remains free of contamination and bacteria. The outcome of chronic wounds depends on the cause. Many chronic wounds can take weeks, months, or years to finally close. At the same time, the patient's nutrition and functional ability must be continually assessed.
