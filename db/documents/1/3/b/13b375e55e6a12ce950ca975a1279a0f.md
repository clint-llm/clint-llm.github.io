Lead encephalopathy typically presents as primary CNS dysfunction. Therefore an appropriate differential includes all critical diagnoses in encephalopathic patients. Encephalitis, meningitis, and sepsis may present similarly but will generally be associated with fever. Alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal will often present with delirium, seizures, or abdominal pain. However, there will also be other associated signs of increased sympathetic tone, not common in lead encephalopathy.Â  Ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, or mass may also present with cerebral edema and/or lateralizing deficits, which may be found in acute lead encephalopathy. In any case, under the appropriate conditions, a whole blood lead level will help make the diagnosis of lead encephalopathy, while other appropriate diagnostic adjuncts will help to rule in or rule out other diseases.
