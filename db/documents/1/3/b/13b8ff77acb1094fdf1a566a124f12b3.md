Athetoid cerebral palsy, also known as dyskinetic cerebral palsy, is the second most common subtype of cerebral palsy. It is a non-progressive, permanent disorder that is a result of fetal or infant brain insult. It affects development and movement and has long term effects on patients' quality of life. To avoid the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition, it must be properly diagnosed and managed. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of athetoid cerebral palsy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of athetoid cerebral palsy.
- Review the appropriate steps for the evaluation of athetoid cerebral palsy.
- Outline the management options available for athetoid cerebral palsy.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of athetoid cerebral palsy and improve outcomes.
