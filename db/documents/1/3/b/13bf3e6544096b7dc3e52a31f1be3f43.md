Bladder diverticula do not often create distinct symptoms and are most commonly detected accidentally in investigating another unrelated ailment, including urinary tract infections. Because large bladder diverticula empty slowly or incompletely after voiding, symptoms and indications, if present, are frequently attributed to urine stasis inside the diverticulum or, potentially, to its mass effect in the lower abdominal area.

Retrospectively, when probed, patient complaints such as inadequate bladder emptying, lower abdominal fullness, and double voiding may be linked to certain major bladder diverticula. These symptoms, however, are vague and might be caused to prostatic growth, blockage, or a variety of other lower urinary tract disorders. The most frequent manifestation of congenital bladder diverticula is acute urinary tract infection arising from stasis. Less common presentations manifest as hematuria, abdominal discomfort, or a palpable abdominal mass.
