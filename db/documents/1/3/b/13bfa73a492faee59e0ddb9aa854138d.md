**Oral**– the oral medication can be given via a dry powder inhaler, a metered-dose inhaler, or a swallowed form. The dry powder should be administered at roughly the same time daily, and after inhalation, the patient should rinse their mouth and spit out the water to avoid oral thrush. To accurately receive the medication from the metered inhaler, one should shake the canister and spray upon inhalation. No spacer should be used for the dry powder but is an option for the metered-dose inhaler. The swallowed form, only for eosinophilic esophagitis, will be sprayed into the pharynx and swallowed. The patient should not eat or drink for the next 30 minutes following administration.

Patients who take fluticasone have a higher incidence of oral thrush than those taking beclomethasone.Candida spp. infection increases as the fluticasone amount increases. Gargling with amphotericin B is an effective treatment for fluticasone-associated thrush.

**Nasal**– the nasal spray is to be used at regular intervals and is not to be sprayed in the mouth or eyes. Shake the bottle gently before each use. While keeping the bottle upright, plug one nostril and press the pump to release spray into the other nostril. During the spraying of the medication, the patient should take a deep inhalation through the nose.

**Topical**– apply a thin layer and rub it into the skin. Avoid contact with eyes, and this medication should not be used on the face, armpits, or groin unless directed otherwise.
