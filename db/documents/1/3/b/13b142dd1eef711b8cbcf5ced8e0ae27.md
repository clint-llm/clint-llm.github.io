Treatment strategies in individuals with ASD may vary according to patient age, strengths, weaknesses, and needs, as well as modality of delivery and targets of intervention. The goal of treatment includes minimizing core deficits, maximizing functional independence, and decreasing problematic behaviors that may restrict functional skills.

**Behavioral Interventions**

Behavioral interventions are started early in life through an intensive delivery format and designed to target the core symptoms of ASD based on the principles of behavior modification and learning theory.

**Educational Interventions**

There is an agreement that children with ASD need a structured educational plan involving strategic, intensive, and individualized interventions.

**Speech and Language Interventions**

Communication is an essential focused intervention in ASD management. Speech-language therapy is the most common intervention provided for children with ASD, which includes strategies such as reinforcement of speech sounds, exaggerated imitation, enhancing communicative acts, and imitation of the sounds. Â Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) is introduced for children who do not speak spontaneously. AAC modalities include picture exchange communication systems, sign language, speech-generating devices, communication boards, and visual supports. There are also several methods to enhance pragmatic language skills available for individuals with fluent speech but impaired pragmatic language skills.

**Developmental Interventions**

Developmental interventions are designed based on developmental theory. Children learn social interaction, communication, and emotional regulation through interaction with others. Developmental interventions are focused on the relationship between patient and adult (parents or caregivers). These interventions teach adults to increase their level of responsiveness and educate them to engage in nondirective interactive strategies that can help the child to develop social and communication skills in the context of playing activities.

**Pharmacologic Interventions**

Currently, there is no medication for the core social and communication symptoms of ASD. There are only two medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of symptoms associated with ASD. Risperidone and Aripiprazole can be used for short-term symptomatic treatment of aggression, self-injury, irritability, and tantrums in children and adolescents with ASD.
