The prognosis of dysphagia depends upon underlying etiology. Dysphagia in stroke patients normalizes gradually andÂ may take from three weeks to approximately six months or longer. In the case of achalasia pneumatic dilatation and laparoscopic myotomy are effective. In the case of obstructive causes of dysphagia, like esophageal rings, webs, or tumors, surgical management leads to better outcomes.
