The differential diagnosis for gastrointestinal stromal tumors is quite broad and is largely determinant on a patient’s signs and symptoms as well as the diagnostic information obtained previously. In patients presenting with GI bleeding or anemia, the differential diagnoses include, but are not limited to: other malignancies of the alimentary tract, diverticular bleed, vascular lesions, inflammatory bowel disease, peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, or esophagitis. In patients whose presentation is consistent with the mass effects of an advanced tumor, the differential diagnoses would include other causes of intraabdominal malignancy. In patients found to have subepithelial mass lesions on endoscopy, the differential diagnosis would include leiomyomas, leiomyosarcomas, schwannomas, lipomas, and melanomas.
