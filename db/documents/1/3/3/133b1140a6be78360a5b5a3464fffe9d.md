The first priority while treating caustic ingestions is airway management. If there are any signs suggestive of respiratory distress, intubation may be required. The airway after a caustic ingestion is considered a problematic airway secondary to oropharyngeal edema, friable tissue, and bleeding. Thus it is ideal to evaluate the airway with a fiberoptic device when possible. Direct laryngoscopy is the first line for a definitive airway. Blind nasotracheal intubations is an absolute contraindication. Laryngeal mask airways, combination tubes, retrograde intubation, and bougies are relatively contraindicated given the risk of perforation.

Decontamination and dilution are other vital steps in the treatment of caustic ingestions. Medical staff must take precautions to prevent self-exposure of the suspected caustic agent by utilizing gowns, gloves, and mask with face shields. Patients should also undergo decontamination by removal of soiled garments and copious irrigation.

For alkali injuries caused by ingestion, immediate dilution with drinking a glass of water is the recommendation in the prehospital setting. Charcoal and ipecac syrup are contraindicated; charcoal will prevent adequate visualization during endoscopy and vomiting, which will re-expose upper GI tissue to the caustic agent. The one exception for the use of charcoal is when co-ingestion is suspected, and the healthcare provider has concern for severe toxicity.

Fluid resuscitation if often indicated. Central venous access may be necessary for refractory shock and accurate blood pressure monitoring. Steroids are not indicated in caustic ingestions as there has yet to be any proven benefits for its use.

Prompt endoscopy is necessary for grading the extent of a caustic injury in symptomatic patients.  Also, if an ingested disk battery appears on radiographic studies, immediate endoscopy is warranted for removal.

All patients with symptomatic ingestions should be admitted to a monitored setting. Grade 1 injury patients can usually be discharged once they can tolerate oral intake. Grade 2a injury patients rewquire observation for injury progression and symptomatic treatment. Grade 2b and 3a injury patients require intensive care unit admission for enteral or parenteral nutrition, continuous monitoring, and symptomatic treatment.
