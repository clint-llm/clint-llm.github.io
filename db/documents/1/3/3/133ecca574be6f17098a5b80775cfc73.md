Although rare, anatomical variants of the deltoid have been described in the literature. Several case reports have reported the posterior part of the deltoid having separate facial sheaths.

Other noted anatomical variations include abnormal insertion into the medial epicondyle of the humerus. Here, the fibers insert in a way that passes superficially to the brachial artery, ulnar nerve, and median nerve. Therefore, surgeons should be mindful if this variation is present and appreciate the neurovascular proximities. The literature has also reported aberrant straps of the deltoid. These straps traveled perpendicular to the posterior deltoid fibers. Surgeons should likewise know aberrant muscles as they can confuse them with other muscle fibers.

Variations of the thoracoacromial artery are also reported in the literature. As previously described, the thoracoacromial artery supplies the deltoid muscle as it runs within the deltopectoral groove with the cephalic vein. Two types of variations have been noted. In type I, it crosses the interval and tunnels into the deltoid muscle. In type II, it crosses the interval and runs with the cephalic vein. However, it will then cross back and toward the pectoralis major.
