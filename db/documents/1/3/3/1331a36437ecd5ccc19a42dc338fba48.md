An absolute contraindication to aortofemoral bypass includes any patient who is too unfit for general anesthesia. Some patients who are ineligible for aortofemoral bypass, are candidates to undergo axillofemoral bypass. However, the discussion of that surgery is outside the scope of this article.

Relative contraindications or patients who are at increased risk of complications from having the aortofemoral bypass surgery include those with significant heart disease, recent cerebrovascular accident, recent myocardial infarction, multiple previous abdominal surgeries, retroperitoneal fibrosis, or horseshoe kidney. Also, end-stage renal disease patients are a high-risk operative group.
