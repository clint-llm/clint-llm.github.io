In the recent past, congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy was classified in either of two categories: Autosomal dominant, progressive (CHED1), and Autosomal recessive, nonprogressive (CHED2). CHED1 is extremely rare, only found in five family pedigrees, and was later re-classified as a form of posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD) after clinical, histopathological, and electron microscopy showed more consistency with PPCD.

The CHED mutation is due to an affected gene, SLC4A11, on chromosome 20p13.SLC4A11 codes for a transmembrane protein that acts as a bicarbonate transporter, actively countering the osmotic gradient by pumping fluid from the stroma into the aqueous humor.SLC4A11 in CHED most commonly result in a truncated BTR1 protein that is unable to reach the cellular membrane and perform appropriately.

The gene SLC4A11 is also expressed in fibrocytes of the inner ear and renal epithelium, suggesting possible comorbidities.SLC4A11 gene is not strictly related to CHED, as mutations can also result in Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) and Harboyan Syndrome.SLC4A11 mutation.SLC4A11 more often progress to Harboyan Syndrome.

Studies have found that CHED is associated with mutation heterogeneity, such that a variety of mutations in the SLC4A11 gene may result in the disease.SLC4A11, which suggests genetic heterogeneity.SLC4A11 mutation.  Instead, an MPDZ mutation was identified, which was similarly found in her mother, who had Fuchs Dystrophy.SLC4A11 promoter region in 20 families affected with CHED resulted in no pathogenic SLC4A11 variants.

In 2016, a novel variant of CHED was reported in a 45-year-old woman that resulted in delayed onset of the disease. She reported poor bilateral vision since childhood and rapid decline of vision the past 5-years. CHED was confirmed by slit-lamp examination, histopathology, genetic screening, and clinical correlation. Genetic testing confirmed new compound heterozygous mutations affecting the SLC4A11 gene.SLC4A11 may only mildly affect BTR function, resulting in delayed onset of CHED signs and symptoms.

**Risk Factors**

Family history positive for CHED and consanguineous parents increases a neonates’ risk of being born with the disease. It is recommended that families with children diagnosed with CHED be offered genetic counseling due to a 25% risk of recurring in future offspring.
