There are currently two forms of low-molecular-weight iron dextran available on the market in North American. Both come as injectable solutions [intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM)] containing 50 mg/mL of elemental iron. The incidence of toxicity relative to high-molecular-weight preparations is lower with low-molecular-weight iron dextran. As per the manufacturer, a test dose of 25 mg (0.5 mL) followed by 1 hour of observation is necessary before administering the remainder of the calculated required dose to monitor for anaphylactoid reactions. Intramuscular injections should be administered to the upper outer quadrant of the buttock using the Z - track technique (lateral displacement of skin prior to injection).

- Total Dose (mL) = 0.0442 (Desired Hb – Observed Hb) x LBW + (0.26 x LBW)

- LBW = lean body weight; Hb = hemoglobin

- For adult males or male children over 15 kg (33 lbs): LBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg / inch of patient height over 5 feet; normal Hb = 14.8 g/dL

- For adult females or female children over 15 kg (33 lbs): LBW = 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg / inch of patient height over 5 feet; normal Hb = 14.8 g/dL

- For children 4 months or older weighing 5-15 kg (11-33 lbs): use actual body weight (kg) instead of LBW; normal Hb = 12 g/dL

**The total dose for iron replacement due to blood loss can be calculated as follows:**

- Total dose (mg) = blood loss (mL) x Hct

- Daily Allowance:

- IV: 100 mg (2 mL) / day

- IM: Children over 4 months weighing less than 5 kg: 25 mg (0.5 mL) / day

- Children over 4 months weighing between 5 and 10 kg: 50 mg (1 mL) / day
- More than 10 kg: 100 mg (2 mL) / day

If total dose calculations exceed the daily allowance of administration, smaller incremental daily doses may be used until the patient achieves the total dose requirement. All doses require administration at a maximum rate of 50 mg (1 mL) per minute. No dosage adjustments are necessary for renal and/or hepatic impairment.

**Off-label Clinical Use**

Cancer / Chemotherapy-related anemia:

Auerbach's multicenter randomized clinical trial demonstrated that iron dextran (INFeD) administration is useful in optimizing the effects of recombinant human erythropoietin in patients with chemotherapy-associated anemia.

Total-dose infusion:

A retrospective analysis conducted by Auerbach found that a total dose of 1000 mg of iron dextran (INFeD) over 1 hour is safe and effective in patients with iron deficiency anemia.

**Considerations During Pregnancy**

There is limited data regarding the safety of iron dextran during early pregnancy; therefore, Pavord et al. have suggested refraining from using intravenous iron dextran until the second or third trimesters.
