Patients avoid significant physical exertion after an episode of alcohol-related arrhythmia. Excessive catecholamine release can trigger recurrent episodes in some cases. Most patients without underlying heart disease (normal electrocardiogram and echocardiogram) can gradually resume their normal physical activity within a few days.

Patients should be counseled that there is no recommended "safe" dosage of alcohol to prevent the occurrence of atrial fibrillation. In general, it is advisable to avoid alcohol consumption, particularly in light of the increased risk of atrial fibrillation.

Patients finding it difficult to quit alcohol should be provided with pharmacological and nonpharmacological resources. Referrals can be provided to deaddiction clinics and local support groups (alcoholic anonyms).
