Pityriasis is a common skin disorder which is best managed by an interprofessional team, because of the huge differential diagnosis.

Pityriasis alba is a common skin disorder managed by the primary care provider, nurse practitioner, dermatologist, and specially trained nurses.

The key is to educate the patient on the benign nature of the disorder. No treatment is required, and the condition spontaneously regresses in 12-24 months. For those who seek treatment for cosmesis, referral to a dermatologist is recommended. Many treatments are available, but there is no evidence to suggest that one is better than the other.Â  Moreover, some treatments are also more likely to cause more harm than good.

Patients should be told to avoid the sun and wear a wide-brimmed hat and long-sleeved garments. Sometimes the UV light can worsen the scaling.

The outcomes in most patients are excellent, but the recovery may take months or years.
