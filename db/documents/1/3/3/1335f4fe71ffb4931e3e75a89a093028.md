**History**

Since ITP is mainly a diagnosis of exclusion, it is mainly seen in well-appearing patients with a history of mucocutaneous bleeding, the sudden appearance of a petechial rash, and/or bruising. The history should focus on any secondary causes of thrombocytopenia, bleeding, or bruising. About sixty percent of children diagnosed with ITP have a preceding viral illness within the past month.

Other secondary causes of thrombocytopenia should be explored in the history, including any systemic symptoms (i.e., fever, weight loss, anorexia, night sweats, or bone pain), exposure to any medications that can induce thrombocytopenia, any personal bleeding history, family history of bleeding or platelet disorders, recent infections, and any underlying conditions including rheumatologic diseases or liver disease. It is essential to ask about the medications used for shorter periods and beverages like "tonic water" and "jello shots" that contain quinine. Questions about bleeding symptoms, bruising, and petechiae should also be explored.

**Physical Exam**

Most children are well-appearing other than presenting with the classic petechial rash, which does not blanch when pressure is applied. In adults, about two-thirds may present with bleeding, ranging from a petechial rash, mucosal bleeding, or rarely hemorrhage.
