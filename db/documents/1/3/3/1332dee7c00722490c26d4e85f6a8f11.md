When dealing with an infant with macrocephaly, it is important to differentiate isolated macrocephaly from other possible head shapes. Plagiocephaly refers to a flattening of one area of the skull and is often seen in children with a history of lying with the head in one position. Craniosynostosis results from the early closure of cranial sutures, resulting in several other types of head shapes. Brachycephaly results from the premature closure of the coronal suture and results in a broad head with a recessed forehead. Trigonocephaly is the result of premature closure of the metopic suture and gives the forehead a triangular appearance. Scaphocephaly comes from the early closure of the sagittal suture, which has a clinical presentation of anterior-posterior elongation with bitemporal narrowing. Other congenital deformities of the skull can be results of trauma or forces applied to the head while in utero due to multiple gestation, abnormal fetal position, or oligohydramnios.
