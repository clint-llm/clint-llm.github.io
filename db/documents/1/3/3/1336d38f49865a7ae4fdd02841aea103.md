With primary iris cysts, they are often found incidentally. Many are asymptomatic unless they have enlarged to obscure the visual axis or cause other secondary complications.

Central posterior pigment cysts are found between the pupillary margin and the iris root. Midzonal cysts can present between the iris root and the ciliary body. Peripheral cysts occur in the iridociliary sulcus.

Stromal cysts arise inside the iris tissue and often cause iris deformation. Congenital cysts are present before ten years of age and are usually unilateral and solitary. Acquired cysts present later in life and seldom require treatment.

Free-floating cysts may appear in the anterior chamber or the vitreous cavity.

Secondary cysts may have clues in the history, which may aid in classifying the lesion. It is not uncommon for patients to present with symptoms from secondary iritis, glaucoma (open and closed-angle), and cataract.

Parasitic cysts may be asymptomatic or have low-grade iritis. These cysts may contain clear fluid or suspended particles or freely moving scolex.
