Interprofessional partnerships between healthcare professionals are key to ensuring a healthy work environment that emphasizes safety as a top priority within the healthcare workplace; this aligns with the focus and mission of OSHA which protects all healthcare employees as a group without differentiating amongst their independent roles within the workplace, just as policies of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) are enforced. Healthcare professionals can work together to identify potential threats and hazards in the workplace, find ways to mitigate these threats, develop management training programs in collaboration to promote workplace health and safety and enhance the accuracy of OSHA-related recordkeeping.

The coordination of care amongst all healthcare providers can translate into coordinating health and safety measures for the entire workforce. In addition to working together in collaboration between all members of the interprofessional healthcare workforce, these professionals can also plan routine screenings and inspections of workplace facilities to ensure safety standards and develop programs to promote better health and safety for the workplace.
