Ranson criteria are used to predict the severity and mortality of acute pancreatitis. Five parameters are assessed on admission, and the other six are assessed at 48 hours post-admission. One point is given for each positive parameter for a maximum score of 11. The modified criteria have a max score of 10. Five parameters are assessed on admission and the other 5 at the 48-hour mark.

The criteria with 11 parameters are used to assess the severity of alcoholic pancreatitis. The 5 parameters on admission are age older than 55 years, WBC count greater than 16,000 cells/cmm, blood glucose greater than 200 mg/dL (11 mmol/L), serum AST greater than 250 IU/L, and serum LDH greater than 350 IU/L. At 48 hours, the remaining 6 parameters are: serum calcium less than 8.0 mg/dL (less than 2.0 mmol/L), hematocrit fall greater than 10%, PaO2 less than 60 mmHg, BUN increased by 5 mg/dL or more (1.8 mmol/L or more) despite intravenous (IV) fluid hydration, base deficit greater than 4 mEq/L, and sequestration of fluids greater than 6 L.

The modified Ranson criteria are used to assess gallstone pancreatitis. The five parameters on admission are age older than 70 years, WBC greater than 18,000 cells/cmm, blood glucose greater than 220 mg/dL (greater than 12.2 mmol/L), serum AST greater than 250 IU/L, and serum LDH greater than 400 IU/L. At 48 hours, the remaining 5 parameters are serum calcium less than 8.0 mg/dL (less than 2.0 mmol/L), hematocrit fall greater than 10%, BUN increased by 2 or more mg/dL (0.7 or more mmol/L) despite IV fluid hydration, base deficit greater than 5 mEq/L, and sequestration of fluids greater than 4 L.

**Score Interpretation**

- 0 to 2 points: Mortality 0% to 3%

- 3 to 4 points: 15%

- 5 to 6 points: 40%

- 7 to 11: nearly 100%
