ASC-US could represent different pathologies NILM, LSIL/CIN 1, HSIL/CIN 2+, or even early invasive cervical carcinoma. On the other hand, ASC-US could be just a cytologic mimic caused by inflammation (cervicitis), air drying, atrophy with degeneration, and other artifacts. True differentiation is best achieved with HPV DNA testing, colposcopy, and biopsy, particularly in persistent ASC-US.
