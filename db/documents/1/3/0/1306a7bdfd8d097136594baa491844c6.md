Simulation has become an integral component of modern medical education. As healthcare simulation has become a mainstream educational modality for adult learners, simulation centers are faced with the challenge of financial sustainability. Simulation centers and simulation-based training programs can be costly to build and maintain and require substantial long-term investment from their affiliated organization(s). While simulation has been shown to improve patient outcomes, funding for training and education is finite, and understanding and justifying these costs can be challenging.
