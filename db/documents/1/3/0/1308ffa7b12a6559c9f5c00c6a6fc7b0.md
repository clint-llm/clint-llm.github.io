The role of physical therapy in the elderly population is still a debate. At least one clinical -Â ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02475941- is studying this topic: "Early Weight Bearing on Supracondylar Distal Femur Fractures in Elderly Patients."

From the surgical treatment properly speaking, several studies are on-going comparing the management of locked compression plating to retrograde intramedullary nailing in patients with distal femur fractures or distal peri-prosthetic femur fractures. One study focuses on the comparison between distal femur fixation to replacement in the geriatric population - ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04076735.
