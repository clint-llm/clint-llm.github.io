A routine electroencephalogram is performed in a quiet room with controllable lighting levels. The test should be performed by an EEG technician with appropriate and relevant training. The 10 to 20 international system is most widely used for scalp electrodes placement.

The EEG channels are displayed following different montages, and each channel records the electrical potential difference between the two components (electrodes) of each channel. EEGs should be reviewed using different types of montages (mainly bipolar and referential montages) in order to accurately isolate and localize abnormal discharges.

Commonly used montages are:

- Referential montages (ex. ear reference, average reference)

- Bipolar montages (longitudinal and transverse)

- Laplacian montages

**Referential Montages**

The channels display the potential difference between the recording/active electrode and a preselected reference (another electrode over a body area or the average of a certain number of selected electrodes).

**Bipolar Montages**

The channels, arranged in a longitudinal or transverse manner, display the potential difference between two contiguous electrodes. These montages easily detect asymmetry between the two brain hemispheres.

**Laplacian Montages**

In this montage, the reference is a combined weighted average of the potentials surrounding a particular electrode or region of interest. It is typically useful to study or assess focal discharges that have a minimal field.
