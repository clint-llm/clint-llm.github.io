Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) were introduced to establish central venous access for extended administration of medication and nutrition. Their widespread adoption into clinical practice as an alternative to central venous catheters (CVCs) inserted into the jugular vein is based upon their reduced risk of intraprocedural complications, maintenance cost, functionality in an outpatient setting, and a lower rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).

A PICC may be inserted at the bedside by several practitioners or by a radiologist who may opt in the use of fluoroscopic guidance to ensure intraoperative safety and correct catheter positioning.Â A PICC is a 50 cm to 60 cm long catheter with up to three lumens placed into a peripheral vein in the arm and terminates in proximity to the cavoatrial junction (CAJ).
