Six-month mortality rates recorded in the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE)  for patients with STEMI were estimated close to 17%, 13% for patients with NSTEMI ACS, and 8% for those with unstable angina. These numbers have continued to decline as percutaneous coronary intervention continues to evolve and operator experience increases. Additionally, the broad adoption of transradial PCI has continued the trend in the decrease in mortality in both NSTEMI and STEMI. This adoption has support from the results of the MATRIX, STEMI-RADIAL, and numerous other studies in the past decade.
