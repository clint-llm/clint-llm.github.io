While stress fractures of the lower extremities are common within the athletic population, cuboid stress fractures are a relatively rare entity. In a review of 196 cases of stress fractures (125 fractures in males and 71 in females), the most common site was the tibial shaft (44.4%), followed by the foot (15%), metatarsals (9.7%), and the tarsals (1%). Another study detailed 113 stress fractures in soldiers, of which the majority were in the metatarsals, and only 1 of the 113 was in the cuboid bone.
