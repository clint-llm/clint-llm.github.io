Injuries to the spleen are one of the most common injuries in abdominal trauma. Unrecognized injury can be a cause of preventable traumatic death.

The spleen is the most vascular organ in the body. Since bleeding in splenic injuries is mainly arterial, significant hemoperitoneum can occur. Also, bleeding from injuries to the spleen is mainly intraperitoneal.

Because of the immunological functions of the spleen, there is a trend toward salvaging the spleen rather than removing it in traumatic cases. The development of CT scans has made conservative management of splenic injuries possible today.
