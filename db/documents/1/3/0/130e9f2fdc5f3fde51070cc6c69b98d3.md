Carbidopa, 1-α-methyldopahydrazine, acts by irreversibly binding pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP), inhibiting l-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), a PLP-dependent enzyme. AACD acts to metabolize 5-HTP to serotonin and L-dopa to dopamine. Whereas the central nervous system takes up levodopa, carbidopa cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, and therefore its effects on enzymatic activity act only peripherally.

Decreasing levodopa metabolism peripherally allows for more L-dopa to be taken up by the CNS. This increased potency reduces the dose of levodopa necessary for the effective treatment of parkinsonian motor symptoms by up to 75%.

Additionally, the lack of peripheral conversion of levodopa to dopamine decreases gastrointestinal (GI) absorption, preventing excess dopamine in the GI tract, and decreasing levodopa side effects, including diarrhea, nausea, and/or vomiting.
