Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) results from diminished ventilatory drive and capacity related to obesity. The load on the respiratory mechanics and blunting of the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide (CO2) in obese individuals (body-mass index-BMI of >30 kg/m2) results in daytime hypercapnia. OHS is considered a diagnosis of exclusion, i.e., in the absence of an alternative neuromuscular, mechanical, or metabolic explanation for hypoventilation.

OHS is commonly associated with OSA (defined by an apnea-hypopnea index-AHI ≥ five events/hour). However, not every patient with OHS usually has OSA (approximately 10% do not have comorbid OSA and OHS or non-obstructive sleep hypoventilation), suggesting a different phenotype. The majority of patients (about 70%) have severe OSA (AHI ≥ 30 events/hour).
