The diagnosis and management of gastric perforation necessitate an interprofessional team that consists of a surgeon, an emergency department physician, a radiologist, a gastroenterologist, and a nurse practitioner. Once the diagnosis is made, the only curative treatment is surgery. Gastric perforationÂ can be managed via an omental patch or wedge resection in the setting of ulcer disease or with primary repair in the setting of trauma. In the postoperative period, the patient must be continued on PPI to prevent recurrence. Untreated or delayed cases carry a very high mortality.
