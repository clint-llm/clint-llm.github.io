SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects the respiratory system; however, it can affect other major organ systems such as the gastrointestinal tract (GI) and the liver. This activity illustrates the incidence, evaluation, and management of the GI and liver manifestations of COVID-19. It also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this illness.

**Objectives:**
- Review the epidemiology, etiology, and comprehensively explain the pathophysiology of the GI and liver manifestations of COVID-19.
- Describe the GI and liver-related clinical manifestations of COVID-19.
- Describe the laboratory, radiologic, and endoscopic investigations in the management of GI and liver manifestations of COVID-19.
- Describe the management of GI and liver manifestations of COVID-19 and also discuss the importance of patientâ€™s education in limiting the transmission of this virus. This review also describes the importance of having a holistic and interprofessional team approach that would enhance delivery of care for patients with GI and liver manifestations in COVID-19 leading to improved outcomes
