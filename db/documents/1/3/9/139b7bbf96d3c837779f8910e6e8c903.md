Response to treatment and management is variable among patients. In those whose symptoms cannot be completely eliminated, optimal symptom control should be sought by multiple treatment modalities. Median cure rates for stress, urge, and mixed urinary incontinence by select modalities can be seen below:

- Stress urinary incontinence

- 84.4% at 12 months for women that received surgical interventions
- 53% after 3 years for males that received slings
- 58.8% at 12 months for women that used supervised pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT)
- 78% at 6 months for men that used PFMT

- Urge urinary incontinence

- 49% at 12 months for women that used antimuscarinics
- 17% at 10 years for women that used sacral neuromodulation
- 15.9% to 50.9% at 3 months in women that used onabotulinumtoxinA
- 24% to 35% at 12 months for men that used supervised PFMT

- Mixed urinary incontinence

- 82.3% for women that received surgical interventions
- 47% for men that used supervised PFMT
- 28% at 6 months for women with supervised PFMT

Several inventories and tools exist that may be used to monitor symptoms and treatment effectiveness:

- Michigan incontinence symptom index (M-ISI) - This questionnaire assesses the frequency of urinary incontinence, the amount of protection used, and the impact of urinary incontinence on daily activities.

- International consultation on incontinence questionnaire-short form (ICIQ-UI short form) - The questionnaire has high intra and interobserver reliability.

- Sandvik questionnaire (incontinence severity index) - This questionnaire assesses frequency and amount of leakage, and has a high correlation with the ICIQ-UI short form.
