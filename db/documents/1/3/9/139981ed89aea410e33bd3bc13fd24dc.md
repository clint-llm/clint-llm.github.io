To enhance the outcome of hemorrhagic fever renal syndrome is first to educate the public about this zoonotic disease, and its transmission should be the main goal. Since rodents are the vectors, patients need to avoid contact, store food properly to prevent rats’ contamination, and avoid sleeping outside or in infested areas. In severe cases, HFRS has a 15% mortality rate, therefore in cases with severe disease management by an interprofessional team that includes intensivist, nephrologist, and infectious disease specialists will provide a better outcome.
