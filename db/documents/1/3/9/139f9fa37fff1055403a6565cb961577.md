The diagnosis of most cheilitis is based on clinical signs and a careful anamnesis. The diagnosis of allergic contact cheilitis is confirmed by history of allergy and a relevant patch test reaction. Patients with negative patch testing are diagnosed with irritant contact cheilitis or atopic cheilitis. A biopsy is required in cheilitis granulomatosa to confirm the diagnosis. Once the diagnosis of granulomatous cheilitis is made, a thorough etiological assessment is necessary. A biopsy is also important in chronic actinic cheilitis if there is suspicion of malignant transformation. Finally, in the case of allergic cheilitis, an allergy survey is required. It includes a careful history and appropriate allergy tests.
