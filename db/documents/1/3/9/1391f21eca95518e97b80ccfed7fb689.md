The DSN is a motor nerve that innervates the levator scapulae, rhomboid major, and rhomboid minor muscles. These muscles work dynamically and collectively are considered periscapular stabilizing muscles.  Individually they can retract and elevate the scapula. The DSN does not possess any sensory fibers, although cadaveric and anatomical studies have reported variable contributions to the DSN from any or all combination of C4 to T1 nerve roots.

Variations in DSN motor function have included an absence of levator scapulae innervation and a rare innervation of the serratus posterior superior muscle.
