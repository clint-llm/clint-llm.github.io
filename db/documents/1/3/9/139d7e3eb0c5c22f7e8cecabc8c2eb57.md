FMF is an autosomal recessive disease. The gene responsible for FMF is the MEFV gene, which is located on the short arm of chromosome 16 (16 p13.3). MEFV gene encodes the 781 amino acid protein pyrin. Around 300 different mutations of the MEFV gene have been identified, which could lead to FMF. Mutations commonly occur in exons 2, 3, 5, and 10. Out of these mutations, V726A, M680I, E148Q, M694V, AND M694I mutations are responsible for around 70 to 80 percent of cases.

Although predominantly an autosomal recessive disease, some reports of the possible autosomal dominant pattern of transmission have also been described. M694V deletion mutation has been the most common mutation found during the analysis of families showing a dominant pattern of transmission of FMF. M694V and M680I mutations are associated with the most severe phenotypic expression of FMF with more risk of complications.
