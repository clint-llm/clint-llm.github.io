Patients may report a sensation of "plugged ear" or "fullness of the ear" often acute pain and hearing loss.  Sometimes hemotympanum occurs (with or without tympanic membrane perforation).  Alternobaric vertigo can occur concomitantly: a unilateral overpressure in the tympanic chamber stimulates the labyrinthine system, causing vertigo. Peripheral facial paralysis can occur in water (near the surface) or soon after emergence. Examination shows unilateral facial paralysis sometimes accompanied by altered taste sensation.  The otoscopic examination may find a bulge of the tympanum.  Recall that peripheral facial nerve palsy should affect the entire ipsilateral side of the face with no "central sparing" of the forehead muscles.  Sparing of the forehead should suggest a central rather than peripheral cause and is not consistent with alternobaric facial palsy.
