For both conditions, simple epilation of the lash usually cures the patient. Having removed such lashes in 12 patients over the last 20 years, we have never had a patient return with a recurrence of the condition. However, some physicians state that treatment with cryotherapy or radiofrequency cautery may be necessary if the lash returns. The reason most of these patients do not need a more definitive treatment with the radiofrequency treatment or cryotherapy is that the problem is with the misdirection of the lash, and the root is in a normal position. Based on our experience, the chance of the lash facing "resistance" again and growing again in this abnormal fashion is low.

In cilium incarnatum externum, it is sometimes necessary to incise the overlying eyelid skin to get access to the buried eyelash, after which epilation is simple. In cilium incarnatum internum, it may be difficult to grasp the tip of the lash if only a small end is protruding. Usually, with an injection of local anesthetic, the lash and the root can be traced and the lash removed. Again, sometimes it is necessary to make a small incision on the tarsal conjunctiva or the tarsus to allow access to the buried lash. The use of radiofrequency or cryotherapy is rarely needed.
