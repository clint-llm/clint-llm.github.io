When patients present to the outpatient department with diminished or blurred vision, they should be examined in detail to pinpoint the pathology. A reduced CS should be suspected if the patient complains of reduced visual acuity despite 20/20 vision. The optometrist plays a crucial role in assessing the contrast sensitivity of the subject with the available charts. The examining ophthalmology should also keep a high suspicion of reduced CS in these cases. In case of reduced CS, the patient should be counseled well regarding the ocular condition and all symptoms the patient can have during nighttime. The patient should be explained the prognosis based on the ocular pathology.
