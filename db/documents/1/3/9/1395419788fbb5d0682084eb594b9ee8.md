Lateral ankle instability is a relatively common condition that is mainly treated by podiatrists, orthopedic surgeons, and physical therapists. A close relationship is formed between the patient, the surgeon and the therapist to gauge the progress of therapy and deem if surgery does become necessary.  While not every patient will need surgery, it is beneficial for all involved to have an understanding of the treatment plan. If an operation is pursued, rather than other options, healthcare providers will join the team such as perioperative nurses, anesthesia staff, and pharmacists.
