While most patients in the emergency room are manageable without a neurological consultation, consider neurology consult for the following:

- If the patient meets the definition of status epilepticus: Status epilepticus is defined as 2 or more subsequent seizures without regaining of consciousness or 30 minutes or more of continuous seizure activity.

- Any patient with a known diagnosis of epilepsy who has a breakthrough seizure: Non-adherence with anticonvulsants is a leading cause of the emergence of breakthrough seizures.

- Prolonged postictal state: Patients are usually admitted to a telemetry floor with close monitoring and further workup.
