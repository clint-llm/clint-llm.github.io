In patients with suspected subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, a detailed neurological examination may show spastic paraparesis, impaired Romberg's sign, loss of vibration sense, proprioception, and two-point discrimination, ataxic gait, and reduced sensation.

Specific risk factors should be investigated while the history of Crohn's or celiac disease, medication use, history of autoimmune diseases, and details of the patient's dietÂ is being obtained.

The hematological implications of this disease would indicate that most patients will present with symptoms of fatigue, pallor, and generalized malaise, which could be correlated to the underlying megaloblastic anemia. Physical examination findings of note include pallor and jaundice as a product of hemolysis triggered by increased red blood cell turnover, and glossitis as impairment in DNA synthesis affects the rapidly dividing cells.
