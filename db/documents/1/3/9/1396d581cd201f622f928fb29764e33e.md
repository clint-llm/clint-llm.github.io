Riboflavin is involved in the metabolism of macronutrients and the production of some other B complex vitamins. It is known to participate in redox reactions in the metabolic pathways through cofactors flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN), derived from riboflavin, by acting as electron carriers.

It is also known for its role as an antioxidant due to its involvement in the regeneration of glutathione, a free radical scavenger.

Additionally, it is involved in growth and development, especially during fetal life, reproduction, and lactation.
