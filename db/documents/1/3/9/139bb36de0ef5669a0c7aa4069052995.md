The calculation used to determine resistance in blood vessels (and all other liquid flow) is R = (change in pressure across the circulatory loop) / flow.

Concerning systemic vascular resistance, this would be: (pressure immediately leaving the left ventricle – pressure immediately upon entering the right atrium)/cardiac output.

Blood pressure is calculated by multiplying the cardiac output by the systemic vascular resistance.

The mean arterial pressure (MAP) can be calculated by the following:

**[(2/3) x (diastolic blood pressure)] + [(1/3) x (systolic blood pressure)]**

Mean arterial pressure is normally between 65 and 110 mmHg, with a MAP of over 70mmHg needed for basic organ function.

In septic shock, a MAP of 65 mmHg is considered sufficient for end-organ perfusion.
