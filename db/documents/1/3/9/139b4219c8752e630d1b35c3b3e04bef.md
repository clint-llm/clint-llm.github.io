Life-threatening toxicities can occur even in patients who are in relatively good conditions. When a patient is unable to manage the side effect profile of irinotecan, it limits the therapeutic advantages that come with its use. Most of the irinotecan's side effect profile is due to its active metabolite, SN-38. Researchers have noted higher incidences of toxicity with genetic polymorphisms to the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 gene. A particular polymorphism, UDP1A1*28, decreases the inactivation of SN-38, causing adverse toxic effects.

Among the most common dose-limiting toxicities of irinotecan, commonly shared with the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor group of chemotherapeutic agents, is diarrhea. Diarrhea is most widely noted withinÂ 7 to 10 days after treatment and can be life-threatening. High-dose loperamide, a dopamine agonist that does not cross the blood-brain barrier, is effective against diarrhea caused by irinotecan. It allows the ability to increase doses during chemotherapy to levels that patients can tolerate.
