Aneuploidy is most commonly the result of a failure to segregate chromosomes in cell division, meiosis I or II. This outcome includes non-disjunction, premature disjunction, or anaphase lag.

Several factors share links to human aneuploidies: motherâ€™s age, the occurrence of a previous trisomy, aberrant recombination, and, although less strongly associated, apparently folic acid deficiency, obesity, smoking, and radiation may have some connection.
