Follow up for coarctation of the aorta should be lifelong with a congenital heart specialist. Even after effective treatment, the risk of developing hypertension increases. Regardless of the chosen therapy, there is aÂ risk of developing aortic aneurysms, and periodic aorta imaging is required. Aneurysm development is highest after balloon angioplasty alone, but it also is associated with surgical repair and stent implantation. Cerebral imaging could be recommended to screen for aneurysms in adults.
