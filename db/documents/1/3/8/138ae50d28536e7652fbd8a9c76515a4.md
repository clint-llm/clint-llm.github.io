Down syndrome was first described by an English physician John Langdon Down in 1866, but its association with chromosome 21 was established almost 100 years later by Dr. Jerome Lejeune in Paris. It is the presence ofÂ all or part of the third copy of chromosome 21 which causes Down syndrome, the most common chromosomal abnormality occurring in humans.
