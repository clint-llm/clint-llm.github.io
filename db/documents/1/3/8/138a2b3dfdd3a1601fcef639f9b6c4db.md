As mentioned in the introduction, the science of transfusion medicine, including the transfusion of red blood cells, has evolved significantly over the past century. The field of transfusion medicine has evolved as well and includes representation from multiple medical specialties. The ability to transfuse red cells into patients safely and rapidly has revolutionized the care of trauma patients, surgical patients, and patients with gastrointestinal bleeding, among other conditions. Transfusion medicine will continue to evolve, and science is continuing to improve this process, as well as working on alternative methods to carry oxygen to cells, which would potentially reduce the risk of reactions and infection and ease storage.
