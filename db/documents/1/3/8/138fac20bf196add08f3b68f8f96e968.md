An interprofessional approach to catheter ablation of the pulmonary vein is recommended. Effective communication among specialty trained nurses and clinicians will produce the best outcomes. [Level 5]

AF is associated with enormous morbidity and mortality, costing billions of healthcare dollars each year. Catheter ablation of the pulmonary vein is one way to manage symptomatic AF. Primary care providers and nurse practitioners should consult with a cardiologist about the options for treatment of AF patients. Today, catheter ablation has shown good results but a significant number of patients do develop recurrences, and the procedure is not benign. In any case, catheter ablation remains the choice of symptomatic patients who do not respond to antiarrhythmic drugs.
