Anemia is a condition with decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Anemia is very common and caused by different conditions ranging from simple nutritional deficiencies (iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid) to blood loss to other complicated causes.

Anemia is a common medical condition and easily diagnosed with a simple blood work CBC. Treatment can be simple like nutritional supplements (iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid) to blood transfusion to treating complex underlying conditions.

It is very important to follow up with the doctor and sometimes with a specialist to treat anemia because untreated anemia can be life-threatening and may even cause death.
