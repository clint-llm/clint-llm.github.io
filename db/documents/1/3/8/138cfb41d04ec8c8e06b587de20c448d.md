Patients who develop diarrheal illness are at an increased risk for dehydration, but this can often be prevented through adequate hydration and early symptomatic intervention. Long-term complications include chronic diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome, but these occur in a small number of patients. Patients with EHEC/STEC diarrheal illness are at risk for developing hemolytic uremic syndrome, which is more common in children less than five years old and adults older than 60.

The risk of developing HUS is dependent on a number of factors, including Stx gene expression, and in infections caused by Stx2-expressing EHEC/STEC, the risk of HUS may be as high as 24%. Children who develop EHEC/STEC induced HUS are the greatest risk for long-term sequelae. As previously mentioned, approximately five percent will develop end-stage renal disease or stroke, and another 20 to 30 percent will develop sequelae, including hypertension, proteinuria, and subclinical decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Complications associated with extraintestinal E. coli infections are disease-specific and out of the scope of this review.
