In every case of ectopia lentis, a history of trauma should be ruled out. These patients usually present with redness, pain, defective vision, monocular diplopia, and difficulty reading fine prints due to poor near vision secondary to loss of accommodation. A detailed systemic history is critical to rule out cardiac, skeletal neurological involvement, family history of consanguinity, and unexplained death at a young age due to syndromic features. All patients with ectopia lentis must undergo a detailed ophthalmic evaluation which includes an external ocular examination to rule out hereditary ocular malformations like enophthalmos, tall, long myopathic face as in Marfan's syndrome, white to white corneal diameter to check for megalocornea in Marfan's and squint evaluation to rule out amblyopia.

A detailed anterior segment examination to look for blue sclera, corneal diameter, cornea plana, Â corneal endothelial damage, anterior chamber depth, cells, flare, presence of dislocated lens, vitreous prolapse, presence or absence of peripheral anterior synechiae, iridodonesis, iris transillumination defects, pupillary margin and shape in case of ectopia lentis et pupillae, adequacy of the pupil to check for aphakic correction, cataractous changes in the lens, phacodonesis, appearance of zonules, subluxation or dislocation of the lens, aphakia, lens in the vitreous cavity or on the retinal surface, clear lens dislocated in the anterior chamber (oil droplet sign) and mature cataractous lens in the anterior chamber (white disc). A detailed dilated fundus examination to rule out pathological myopia, myopic macular degeneration, posterior vitreous detachment, lattice, holes, and retinal detachment.
