Transfusion iron overload is a major concern in the management of patients with severe anemic syndromes like thalassemia. Because of the close monitoring of iron homeostasis, excess iron from multiple blood transfusions deposits in different organs of the body and causes organ damage. Early iron-chelation therapy can prevent severe life-threatening consequences.
