Colestipol is a large basic anion-exchange resin copolymer.

As part of normal digestion, bile acids are responsible for emulsifying and solubilizing lipids in the intestinal lumen. The rate-limiting step in bile acid synthesis involves hydroxylation of the steroid nucleus of cholesterol by cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase.

Increased fecal excretion of bile acids leads to a reduction in the total circulating bile acid pool available for enterohepatic circulation. As a result, upregulation of cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase leads to increased conversion of cholesterol into bile acids, reducing serum total cholesterol levels. Further upregulation of hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) to replenish intrahepatic cholesterol stores available for bile acid synthesis leads to increased uptake of LDL-C and an overall reduction in plasma LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels.

In cases of thyrotoxicosis, enterohepatic circulation of thyroid hormones, including thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), is increased.
