Despite being commonly asymptomatic or with minimal symptoms, orthostatic hypotension increases mortality and the possibility of myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and atrial fibrillation. The cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases may explain the raised vascular mortality found because myocardial infarctions, transient ischemic attacks, electrocardiographic abnormalities, and carotid stenosis are associated with orthostatic hypotension.
