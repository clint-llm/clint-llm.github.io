The technologies behind drug testing as well as the clinical application of this technology are rapidly evolving. It is important that clinicians understand the proper use of current methods and stay informed about emerging techniques. One of the biggest challenges facing clinicians is the accurate detection of drugs that have relevance to clinical outcomes.

As with all testing, false negatives and false positives are a possibility. False negatives are defined as a negative test result despite the presence of a given xenobiotic. A false positive is defined as a positive test result despite no xenobiotic present in a sample. Common false positives are described in the testing of amphetamines and include medications such as selegiline, bupropion, and pseudoephedrine.

False negatives are well described when testing for opioids and benzodiazepines. The opiate screen on the UDT specifically detects morphine. As a result, this screen would not detect synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl and methadone, or other opioids that are structurally dissimilar such as buprenorphine, oxycodone, and hydrocodone. Similarly, the benzodiazepine screen tests for a metabolite, oxazepam. It would be expected to test negative for benzodiazepines such as lorazepam, clonazepam, and alprazolam as these are not metabolized to oxazepam.

Depending on the xenobiotic being tested for, there can be multiple other xenobiotics that can crossreact and cause a false positive result. These are commonly described in testing for amphetamines, PCP, cannabinoids, and methadone.

The protocols in place when performing drug testing in the workplace vs a clinical setting vary in several important aspects. Confirmatory testing is not standard procedure in the clinical setting, as the results from a presumptive test are often enough to direct clinical decisions. In the workplace, when a presumptive test is positive, it is routinely sent off for confirmatory testing so that an appropriate decision can be made concerning employment. By extension, in workplace testing, the chain of custody is important to maintain the validity of testing. It is not uncommon for results to be disputed, and so maintenance of the chain of custody will make it more difficult to invalidate results due to a procedural problem.

A major concern in testing, particularly in UDT is the possibility of sample tampering. One common method is dilution, either by dilution by adding an adulterant or by increasing fluid intake prior to the test. Common adulterants include household items, such as bleach, laundry detergent, and table salt. Commercial products directed at bypassing UDT also exist, such as UrinAid (glutaraldehyde), Stealth (containing peroxidase and peroxide), Urine Luck (pyridinium chlorochromate), and Klear (potassium nitrite). These products are easily obtained through various internet sources. Synthetic urine is another common adulterant. These adulterants can be used to bypass both presumptive and confirmatory tests. For example, glutaraldehyde is commonly used to create a false negative for cannabinoids. Oxidative additives can react with drug and drug metabolites and make them undetectable with common immunoassays. Fortunately, there have been advancements in laboratory testing to detect common adulterants.

The current drug landscape is continually changing. New synthetic drugs continue to be made and enter the current drug supply. Many of these drugs are structurally unlike any current existing drugs and as a result, are not detectable with current testing. This can make it difficult to determine if someone is using a particular substance. Continued research and development are needed to keep pace with new synthetic drugs and to address continued attempts at test adulteration.
