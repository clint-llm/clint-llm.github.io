The corrugator supercilii muscles receive blood supply from the supraorbital and supratrochlear arteries of the ophthalmic artery, which is a branch of the internal carotid artery.

On the right side of the body, the common carotid arteries originate from the brachiocephalic trunk, and on the left side of the body, they come from the aortic arch. In the neck, at the upper margin of the thyroid cartilage, each common carotid artery runs within the carotid sheath and bifurcates into the internal and external carotid arteries.

In the temporal bone, the internal carotid artery enters the skull through the carotid canal and divides into the ophthalmic artery, which travels through the orbit through the optic canal. Inside the orbit, the ophthalmic artery divides into many branches, including the supraorbital artery, supratrochlear artery, lacrimal artery, central retinal artery, ethmoidal arteries, ciliary arteries, and inferior and superior muscular arteries. The supraorbital and supratrochlear arteries of the ophthalmic artery supply the corrugator supercilii muscles. The supratrochlear artery, which first traverses underneath the frontalis and corrugator supercilii muscles, gradually appears more superficial. The supratrochlear neuromuscular bundle passes through the corrugator supercilii muscles and provides sensation and vascularity to the forehead.
