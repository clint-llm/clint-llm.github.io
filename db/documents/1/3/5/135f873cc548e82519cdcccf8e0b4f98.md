Complications of type 2 diabetes in children are similar to that of adults. Complications tend to occur after a person has had the disease for many years. Those who are diagnosed in childhood have the disease for longer periods of time. Therefore, strict control and management of blood glucose are crucial to help prevent these complications. All people with diabetes should have regular dilated eye exams (to examine for diabetic retinopathy), urine microalbumin screening at appropriate intervals (evaluated for renal involvement), hyperlipidemia screens/treatment, hypertension screening/treatment, and regular monitoring.
