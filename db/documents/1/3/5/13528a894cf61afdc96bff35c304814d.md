Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) occurs due to germ-line mutations in TP53. TP53 is a tumor suppressor gene, which is located on band 17p13.1, which codes for a 53-kD nuclear protein transcription factor that has important regulatory control over cell proliferation and homeostasis, specifically apoptosis, DNA repair, and cell cycle. Mutations can arise in one of the parent's germ cells, de novo during embryogenesis, or can be inherited. Changes in P53 function results from either increased or aberrant protein function or loss of function of wild-type P53. Most Li-Fraumeni syndrome TP53 mutations occur as missense point mutations in a hot-spot region of exons 5-8.

The cell loses protection against genetic alterations when P53 mutations occur. Ubiquitin ligase HDM2 and P53 interact with E3 and E4 proteins, which induce polyubiquitination and degradation of P53, which prevents apoptosis.

**Mutations Associated with Younger Age of Onset in Li-Fraumeni Syndrome**

- Short telomeres

- Genetic modifiers, including the MDM2-SNP309 polymorphism, and genetic anticipation

- P53-related cancers, usually breast cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, osteosarcoma (bone cancer), leukemia, brain tumors, adrenocortical carcinoma (cancer of the adrenal glands), and other cancers
