Anterior, blunt chest trauma is the most frequent cause of sternal fractures. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, athletic injuries, falls, and assaults result in most of the remaining traumatic cases. Patients with severe thoracic kyphosis, osteoporosis, or osteopenia can develop insufficiency fractures of the sternum. Patients on long-term steroid therapy, postmenopausal women, and elderly patients are at increased risk. Stress fractures of the sternum have also been reported secondary to repetitive upper body use in such sports as weightlifting and golf.
