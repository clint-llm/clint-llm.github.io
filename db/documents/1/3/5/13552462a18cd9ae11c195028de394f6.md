Prolactin-secreting tumors of the pituitary gland, also known as prolactinomas, are the most common secretory tumors of the pituitary gland, accounting for up to 40 percent of pituitary adenomas. Prolactinomas can lead to a wide variety of symptoms, either due to mass effect or hypersecretion of prolactin. This activity illustrates the evaluation, treatment, and complications of prolactinomas and the importance of an interprofessional team approach to its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the common presentations of prolactinomas. 
- Outline the evaluation of prolactinomas.
- Review the management of prolactinomas. 
- Explain the role of collaboration among interprofessional team members to improve care coordination and minimize oversight, leading to earlier diagnosis and treatment and better outcomes for patients with prolactinomas.
