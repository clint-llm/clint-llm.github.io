Early literature on alternobaric vertigo holds the prevalence to be between 10 and 17% among participants in at-risk activities. A recent study involving Portuguese Air Force pilots in which 29% of the pilots experienced vertiginous symptoms with changing ambient pressure suggests that the true prevalence is likely higher. Current estimates are presumed to be low due to under-reporting, as this is largely a benign condition. Regarding prevalence among gender, observational reports with relatively small sample sizes suggest that females experience alternobaric vertigo at higher rates than males.
