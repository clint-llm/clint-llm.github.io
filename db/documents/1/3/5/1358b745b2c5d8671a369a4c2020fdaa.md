Immediate care by a medical professional should be sought if an overdose is suspected. Overdose symptoms include central nervous system overactivity, fever, cardiac arrhythmias, vomiting, respiratory failure, paralysis, and coma. Treatment includes supportive care. Activated charcoal may be administered as well as a cathartic agent. Two overdoses of 100 mg ingestions were reported, one in a 13-year-old boy and another in a 34-year-old woman. There was a report of simultaneous alcohol ingestions. Both patients received supportive care, which resulted in complete recovery.
