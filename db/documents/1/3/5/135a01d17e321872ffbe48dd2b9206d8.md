Mini dental implants can be compared to conventional implant systems. They are made of one piece; however, conventional implants usually consist of two parts, the implant, and the abutment. Mini implants have a one-piece titanium screw with a ball-shaped head for denture stabilization or a square prosthetic head for fixed applications, instead of the classic abutment. A bracket like head design can aid in orthodontic treatment and serve as indirect anchorage. Mini implants are protruded over the gum surface when they are placed into the bone; conventional implants are placed under the gums. Transmucosal portion of the neck of mini-implant should be smooth and varies in length depending upon the mucosal thickness of the implant site.
