Patients experiencing or having experienced a mediastinal seminoma should be encouraged to resume physical activity, eat a healthy diet, and refrain from any sort of anabolic steroid. In addition, patients should pay special attention to any symptoms that may symbolize the recurrence of the disease, such as dyspnea, cough, pressure in the chest, or weight loss. They should also attend follow-up appointments with their physician.
