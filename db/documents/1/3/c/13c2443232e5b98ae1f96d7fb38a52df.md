Tricuspid valve infective endocarditis is uncommon compared to left-sided infective endocarditis. Right-sided infected infective endocarditis accounts for approximately 5 to 10 percent of all cases of infective endocarditis (IE). The overwhelming majority of cases of right-sided infective endocarditis involve the tricuspid valve and the majority of tricuspid valve infective endocarditis is associated with intravenous drug use. With the rise of intravenous drug use in the United States, rates of tricuspid valve infective endocarditis have increased significantly since 2006. In addition to intravenous drug users, patients with hemodialysis catheters, pacemakers, and defibrillator leads are also at increased risk for tricuspid valve infective endocarditis. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of tricuspid valve endocarditis and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of tricuspid valve endocarditis.
- Describe the presentation of tricuspid valve endocarditis.
- Summarize the treatment options for tricuspid valve endocarditis. 
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by tricuspid valve endocarditis.
