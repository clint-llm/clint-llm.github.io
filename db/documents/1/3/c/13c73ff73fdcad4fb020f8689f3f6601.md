Technetium 99m sestamibi (MIBI), also known as 99m Tc-methoxy isobutyl isonitrile, is a radiopharmaceutical used to evaluate pathology within the cardiac, breast, and parathyroid tissues. Sestamibi is part of the radioactive diagnostic agents class of medications, characterized as a lipophilic cationic radiotracer. This activity illustrates the indications, mechanism of action, and contraindications for sestamibi as a valuable diagnostic agent. Furthermore, this activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the diagnosis of patients with cardiac conditions, hyperparathyroidism, and breast cancer.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the mechanism of action of technetium 99m sestamibi.
- Identify the indications for the use of technetium 99m sestamibi.
- Outline the common adverse events associated with technetium 99m sestamibi.
- Describe the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to ensure appropriate selection of candidates for the use of technetium 99m sestamibi to enhance the delivery of care and improve outcomes for patients experiencing cardiovascular events.
