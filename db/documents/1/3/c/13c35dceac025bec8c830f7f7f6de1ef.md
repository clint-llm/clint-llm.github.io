The special feature of Peyer's patches is that these lymphoid follicles are surrounded by an epithelium known as the follicle-associated epithelium(FAE).

The Peyer's patches contain a significant number of dendritic cells, macrophages, and lymphocytes. Since the gastrointestinal system has exposure to a significant number of pathogens, it is vital for immune surveillance. Once a pathogen is encountered by the M cells in the epithelium, they are presented to the dendritic cells and the macrophages across the membrane via the porous basal lamina, primarily via the transcellular M cell-specific pores.

T cells n Peyer's patches function similarly to LPLs (lipoprotein lipase) and other circulating T cells. However, the distinct feature of these T cells is to secrete tolerogenic cytokines like TGF-beta and  IL-10 on exposure to common food allergens, as seen in some animal experiments.
