Bivalirudin is a medication used to manage and treat patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention for acute myocardial infarction. It is in the direct thrombin inhibitor class of drugs. This activity reviews the indications, action, and contraindications for bivalirudin as a valuable agent in the therapy of acute myocardial infarction, in addition to its broader applications in thromboembolic disease, cardiopulmonary bypass, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for the management team members of the patients, as previously mentioned.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the mechanism of action of bivalirudin therapy.
- Describe the indications for bivalirudin therapy, including some of the off-label uses. 
- Outline the interprofessional approach among proceduralists, physicians, pharmacists, and nurses that is necessary to ensure optimal patient outcomes in patients undergoing therapy with bivalirudin. 
- Highlight the importance of bivalirudin in patients with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
