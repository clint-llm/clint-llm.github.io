An interprofessional approach is crucial to the success of gastric cancer patients and should involve collaboration between primary care physicians, surgical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and oncologic surgeons to determine surgical resectability, preoperative planning, and the role for neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation. Because gastric cancer may manifest in a variety of histologic, anatomic, and genetic patterns, a customized treatment plan for each patient leads to the best outcomes.

Similarly, for patients who undergo gastric resection for weight loss, an interprofessional approach is paramount to their success and should include a bariatric surgeon, gastroenterologist, primary care physician, dietician, nursing supervisor, and mental health professionals. Due to the physiologic and psychological changes that occur with bariatric surgery, these patients require long-term follow-up and management.
