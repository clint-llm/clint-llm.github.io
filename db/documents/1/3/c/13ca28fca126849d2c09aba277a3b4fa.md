Dermatomyositis is a rare condition. A retrospective study conducted between 1967 and 2007 in Olmsted county, Minnesota, estimated an incidence rate of 9.63 per 1,000,000 people. The same study also found that 21% of all cases were of the amyopathic subtype. Dermatomyositis commonly affects persons between the ages of 40 and 50 with a mean age at diagnosis of 44.0 Â± 18.3 years. The condition is more common in women than in men, with incidence rates being 3.98 and 4.68 per 1,000,000, respectively.

In Europe, a higher prevalence of dermatomyositis has been noted in Southern Europe compared to Northern Europe.
