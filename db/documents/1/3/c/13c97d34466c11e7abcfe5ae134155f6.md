Defective closure of the pulmonary valve prevents forward flow and causes blood to regurgitate back into the right ventricle during diastole. Flow in the heart is determined by pressure gradients. Pressure in the right ventricle during diastole, right ventricular end-diastolic pressure (RVDP), is initially lower than the pressure in the pulmonary arteries in diastole. Physiologically the volume of blood ejected during systole into the pulmonary circulation is prevented from regurgitating back into the right ventricle despite the drop in its pressures due to a functioning pulmonary valve. In pathological pulmonary regurgitation, the valve is defective and allows blood to regurgitate into the right ventricle.

The ventricles experience volume overload, which is initially accommodated for. Hence at this stage, patients do not show symptoms. However, progressively over time, the ventricles undergo eccentric hypertrophy (sarcomeres laid in series), resulting in ventricular dilation.

If pulmonary regurgitation is left untreated, chronic volume overload to the right ventricle can lead to right heart failure. Essentially the eccentric ventricular remodeling can no longer compensate and results in systolic dysfunction of the heart. There are two consequences that occur as a result. Systolic dysfunction can result in a reduced cardiac output leading to symptoms such as lightheadedness and syncope.
