Differential diagnoses for CRS are mainly related to its clinical manifestations and laboratory findings, such as fever and/or hypoxia and hypotension, elevated CRP, ferritin, and IL-6 levels.

These patients are usually required to undergo extensive evaluation and investigations to rule out other causes and often require empirical treatments until proven otherwise.

ICANS can be frequently confused with uncommon viral infections, stroke, chemotherapy-related toxicity, and the CNS involvement of malignancy.
