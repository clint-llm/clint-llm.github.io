Posterior tibial tendon dysfunction is a progressive disorder that will continue to deteriorate without treatment. Early detection and intervention will help to slow progression. Patients provided with custom orthotics and rehabilitation have been shown to have significant improvement. In a recent study by Alvarez et al., about 89% of their patients with stage I and II PTTD responded to orthotics and PT. Nearly all of these patients were back to full strength by 4 months.
