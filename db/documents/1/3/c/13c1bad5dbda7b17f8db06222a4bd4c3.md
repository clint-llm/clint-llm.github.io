ANCA binds explicitly toÂ two proteins in the cytoplasm of neutrophils in ANCA associated vasculitis, named proteinase-3 (PR3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO).

Small vessel damage caused by ANCA occurs when these autoantibodies bind to granules in neutrophils, the mechanism of pathogenesis is given below

- Neutrophils and monocytes activation by ANCA

- Subsequent activation of the alternative complement pathway

- Neutrophils migration through blood vessel walls and the release of inflammatory mediators

- Release of chemoattractant and recruitment of more inflammatory mediators

- Inflammation, apoptosis, necrosis, and damage to small blood vessel walls

Recently it has been discovered that few medications can cause drug-induced anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV). The drug-induced AAV is seen with propylthiouracil, hydralazine, and D-penicillamine.

There are two following subtypes/patterns of ANCA

- c-ANCA (cytoplasmic pattern on IIF), which targets PR3 (proteinase 3) in neutrophilic cytoplasm

- p-ANCA (perinuclear pattern on IIF), which targets MPO (myeloperoxidase) in neutrophilic cytoplasm

ANCA lab testing shows which type of antibody is present, which then narrows down the differential diagnosis.
