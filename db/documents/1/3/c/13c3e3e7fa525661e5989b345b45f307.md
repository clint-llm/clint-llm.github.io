In acute ingestion, the clinician should obtain digoxin/digitoxin levels at the time of presentation and more than six hours after the time of ingestion. Given the distribution phase, levels six hours post-ingestion better correlate with digoxin effects. For patients suspected of chronic toxicity, one group should suffice. Levels above 2 ng/ml for digoxin and above 40 ng/ml for digitoxin 6 hours after the last dose are often clinically toxic.

Electrolytes should require early monitoring to look for hyperkalemia. Prompt determination of hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia is crucial, as they may contribute to cardiac toxicity. Assessment of renal function is of paramount importance given the renal clearance. In addition to basic lab workup, acetaminophen levels should be checked in cases involving intentional ingestion since acetaminophen among the most common over-the-counter medication, and the toxicity associated with it is initially subtle. Serial EKGs and cardiac monitoring are necessary to detect arrhythmias early and treat as it occurs.
