As most cases of PDPH's resolve spontaneously within 7 to 10 days, some patients may opt for conservative treatment rather than EBP. These include limiting upright position, hydration, oral analgesics, and intravenous or oral caffeine. Caffeine is a cerebral vasoconstrictor. It is administered as 500 mg sodium caffeine benzoate in 1000 mL of NS or LR over 1 to 2 hours. This, however, generally produces short-term relief. A patient who chooses conservative therapy should keep well hydrated and consume caffeine-containing beverages and oral analgesics as necessary at home.

The majority of patients who elect to have EBP are those that cannot minimize activity, for example, recent parturients with newborns or younger patients. Also, those patients that are extremely symptomatic (some cephalgia even when supine and cannot tolerate any degree of upright positioning, tearful or crying at rest, photophobia) will likely consent to EBP with or without conservative treatment.

It is important to keep in mind that not all headaches, even if the patient is a post-dural puncture, are PDPHs, and this must be considered in the workup before performing EBP. Furthermore, in mildly symptomatic patients, for example, mild cephalgia when standing 15 to 20 minutes will spontaneously resolve with conservative therapy, and may be preferable to risking a second, large-bore (17-gauge) dural puncture, back pain, and the possibility of infection.

An epidural blood patch is a highly effective way to treat a specific subset of post-dural puncture headache patients. It is an elective procedure that carries a relatively low degree of risk.
