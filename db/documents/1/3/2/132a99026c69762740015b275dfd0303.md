Patient education remains a pivotal component in the prevention of hypoglycemic episodes. Focus on the prevention of hypoglycemia should include patient education on signs and symptoms that constitute hypoglycemia and early recognition of these signs and symptoms. Patient education should be individualized to each patient depending on the circumstances and should consist of self-monitoring and management of glucose. Proper diet, exercise, management of medications and limiting alcohol intake are also important in the prevention of hypoglycemia. It is vital that the patient is educated on when to contact the caregiver, health care provider and when to activate the emergency medical system.
