The deep brain stimulation (DBS) apparatus consists of electrodes implanted adjacent to specific deep brain structures, which are then connected to a pacemaker-like machine (pulse generator) that is implanted on the chest wall, via a subcutaneous wire. Stimulation parameters are then relayed by a computer to the pulse generator, appropriating proper amplitudes, frequencies, and pulse width. Common structures targeted by DBS include the subthalamic nucleus (STN), globus pallidus interna (GPi), and the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus (VIM).

The precise mechanism of the resultant therapeutic effects of deep brain stimulation remains unclear; however, theories are plenty. As implied by the recounting of the surplus of possible applications, stimulation of the deep brain structures influences a variety of circuits involved in neuronal functioning. Therapeutic effects are incumbent upon physiologic properties of cells, surface areas of stimulated structures, the amplitude and temporal properties of the stimulation, and lastly, the characteristics of the underlying pathophysiology of different disease states. Imaging and physiologic studies corroborate the hypothesis that the ultimate effect of deep brain stimulation is the increase of the firing of the targeted neurons.
