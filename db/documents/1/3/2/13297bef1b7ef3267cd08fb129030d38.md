Classically, frostbite injuries were common in military personnel. However, with the increase in technology and accessibility, recreational sports have become a significant repository for frostbite cases. Homeless populations, children, and the elderly are especially vulnerable to frostbite. Risk factors include behavioral (lack of clothing, alcohol/drug consumption, access to shelter), physiological (dehydration, high altitudes, hypoxia), and other comorbidities with a predilection for tissue hypoxia (diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, Raynaud phenomenon).
