The small intestine comes from the primitive gut, which forms from the endodermal lining. The endodermal layer gives rise to the inner epithelial lining of the digestive tract, which is surrounded by the splanchnic mesoderm that makes up the muscular connective tissue and all the other layers of the small intestine. The jejunum and ileum come from the midgut, whereas the duodenum derives from the foregut.

Villi and crypts make up the lining of the small intestine. Originally, the small intestine is lined by cuboidal cells up until the ninth week of gestation; then, villi begin to form. Crypt formation begins between the 10th to 12th weeks of gestation.
