The classic triad of AEFs rarely seen in clinical practice includes GI bleeding, abdominal pain, and a palpable abdominal mass.

Not all AEFs bleed during their initial presentation, and many will never bleed during the course of a patientâ€™s illness.

AEF must be kept in the differential diagnosis for any patient with a known history of aortic aneurysm or aortic repair who presents with GI bleeding, sepsis, abdominal pain, or hemorrhagic shock, even if an alternative source of GI bleeding has been identified.
