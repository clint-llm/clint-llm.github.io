Favus or tinea favosa is a severe and chronic inflammatory dermatophyte infection, due in most cases to Trichophyton schoenleinii. Historically, the term ‘favus’ had been used, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, to characterize the honey-like exudate in some scalp infections. Then, in 1839, the fungal etiology of this condition was discovered by Johann Lucas Schoenlein.

Clinically, favus is characterized by scutula (yellow saucer-shaped crusts consisting of hyphae and scales) around hair follicles and severe scarring alopecia, which can lead to considerable psychosocial problems.
