A detailed history and physical with particular attention to the sexual and surgical history is essential. Any association of the pain with voiding, bowel movements, strenuous physical activities, sexual intercourse, or prolonged sitting should be explored and documented. The history should include very specific details of the pain including exact location, quality, timing, aggravating factors, acuity of onset, and radiation to other organs or areas. For example, prolonged sitting and constipation often worsen pain in patients with idiopathic chronic orchialgia while interstitial cystitis patients would tend to have suprapubic pain associated with bladder function.

The physical examination should focus on the scrotum and genitals. Examining the patient in both the standing and sitting position is helpful. Always begin by examining the non-painful side. Each portion of the testicle (testis, epididymis, and vas) should be carefully examined for pain on palpation, swelling, and abnormal nodules. A digital rectal examination should be performed to evaluate for possible prostatitis and abnormal pelvic floor muscle tension. An attempt should be made to try and identify the specific anatomical source of the pain, if possible.

Pelvic floor pain or muscular weakness may play a role in chronic orchialgia in some men. In one study, 93% of 41 men with chronic idiopathic orchialgia had at least one symptom of pelvic floor dysfunction and 88% of these demonstrated increased pelvic floor muscle tension on electromyographic testing. Men with pelvic floor pain or tightness on DRE are likely to demonstrate improvement with pelvic floor physical therapy.

Psychological factors appear to play an important role in chronic testicular pain, especially when no organic cause can be identified. Psychological issues that may affect chronic genital pain include sexual dysfunction, anxiety, history of sexual abuse, major depression, and somatization disorder.

**Types of Pain: Nociceptive versus Neuropathic**

Nociceptive pain is usually described as dull or aching. It is usually elicited by gentle compression of the testis and may be associated with anatomical testicular changes such as enlargement or shrinkage and atrophy. Nociceptive pain is the typical type which would be expected from a common pain stimulus.

Neuropathic testicular pain is characterized by a burning sensation, hyperesthesia or hypoesthesia, and radiation to the scrotal skin. It is typically caused by a lesion in the nervous system away from the area affected by the pain, usually the central or peripheral nervous system. Symptoms may be triggered by walking, stooping or hyperextending the hip. Relief may be noted by lying down and thigh flexion.

Allodynia refers to an exaggerated perception of pain to the point where a typically non-painful stimulus is perceived as painful.
