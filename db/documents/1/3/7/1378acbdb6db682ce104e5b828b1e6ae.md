**Rifampin**

Rifampin exerts its effects by reversibly inhibiting DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which further inhibits bacterial protein synthesis and transcription.

**Isoniazid**

Isoniazid is a pro-drug that is converted to its active form metabolite by catalase-peroxidase and exerts its action by further inhibiting the biosynthesis of mycolic acid.

**Pyrazinamide**

Pyrazinamide's mechanism of action remains unknown and not fully understood.

**Ethambutol**

Ethambutol inhibits the enzyme arabinosyltransferases and prevents the biosynthesis of the mycobacterial cell wall.****

****Aminoglycosides (Strep**tomycin, Kanamycin, Amikacin)**

Aminoglycosides exert their action by binding to the 30S subunit of ribosomes and inhibiting the protein synthesis of the mycobacteria.

****Fluoroquinolones (Levofloxacin**, Moxifloxacin, Gatifloxacin)**

Fluoroquinolones exert their effects by inhibiting DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, further inhibiting DNA synthesis within the bacteria.
