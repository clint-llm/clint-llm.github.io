Carbonic anhydrase in the lumen of the proximal tubule of the kidney converts carbonic acid to water and carbon dioxide. Water and carbonic dioxide enter the intracellular space via diffusion. The intracellular carbonic anhydrase enzyme converts water and carbon dioxide back to carbonic acid, which dissociates into H+ and bicarbonate. By inhibition of the enzyme, CAI medications result in the inhibition of the resorption of bicarbonate by the tubular cells, leading to retention of bicarbonate in the tubular lumen. The overall effect is the alkalization of urine as there is greater bicarbonate in the urine, and the blood becomes more acidic, given the excretion of bicarbonate. The diuretic effect causes increased water excretion and a decrease in blood pressure. The resulting changes in acid-base balance make CAIs useful in treating altitude sickness by counteracting respiratory alkalosis due to hyperventilation.

In the eyes, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors reduce the production of aqueous humor by the epithelium of the ciliary body by reducing the production of bicarbonate ions and presumably reducing fluid flow. The reduction in aqueous humor production lowers the intraocular pressure, making these drugs favorable in patients with glaucoma.
