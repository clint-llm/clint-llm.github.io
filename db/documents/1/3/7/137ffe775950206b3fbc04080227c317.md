**Esophagus and Gastroesophageal Junction (GOJ)**

Optimum treatment planning of esophageal cancers requires an accurate description of cancer location in upper GI tumors, which is impossible without a clear understanding of the segmental esophageal anatomy. Anatomical levels for these cancers are reported relative to anatomical landmarks set by the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system (AJCC). The esophagus is divided into four segments. This delineation is vital to ensure that the tumor is covered in its entirety in the radiotherapy field. If surgical resection is planned, the choice of approach is appropriate for the tumor's location. For the localization of gastroesophageal junction (GOJ) tumors, the Siewert-Stein classification divides these cancers into three groups based on their epicenter relative to GOJ. Regional lymph nodes for the esophagus include supraclavicular, peri-esophageal, and celiac nodes.

**Large Intestine**

The large intestine extends from the cecum to the anal verge, where the stratified squamous epithelium of the anal canal meets the anal skin. For colorectal cancers, the relation of the tumor with peritoneal reflection has high prognostic implications as the involvement of the peritoneum makes it a T4a disease and increases the incidence of peritoneal metastases.

The parietal peritoneum covering the abdominal wall reflects anteriorly on the cecum, ascending and descending colon as visceral peritoneum, leaving their posterior circumference uncovered. The transverse and sigmoid colon are near completely intraperitoneal except for the area along the route of mesenteric vessels. The reflection of the peritoneum on the pelvic structures forms the rectouterine pouch in females and rectovesical pouch in males and partially covers the pelvic sidewall on either side. The rectum is thus covered anteriorly and laterally by the peritoneum in the upper part and only anteriorly in the middle part. The lower part of the rectum is entirely free of the peritoneum.

The anal canal is the terminal part of the GI tract and extends from the anorectal junction above (where the rectum passes through the pelvic diaphragm) to the anal verge below. It approximately measures 4 cm and has two crucial muscle layers. The inner layer, which is the continuation of the GI tract's circular muscle, forms the internal sphincter. The outer layer from the downward continuation of the levator ani and puborectalis forms the external sphincter with a small inter-sphincteric space between the two.

Nodal metastases from the colon follow the mesenteric vessels to either the SMA origin in the right colonic tumors or the IMA origin in the left colonic tumors and can then involve the para-aortic nodes. Rectal tumors drain in the mesorectal nodes to the superior rectal artery nodes, and then along the root of sigmoid mesentery can reach para-aortic nodes. They can also drain into internal iliac nodes.

Anal cancer spread has a greater predilection for the lymphatic system than the bloodstream.

**Neuroendocrine Tumors**

The Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) are a group of heterogeneous neoplasms that arise from embryonal neural crest cells. These can arise from virtually any part of the GI tract, but the small intestine is the most common location. These tumors can exhibit broad clinical behavior ranging from indolent, slow-growing to highly aggressive behavior. This clinical behavior correlates with their cellular proliferation rate measured through immunohistochemical staining of a unique Ki67 protein.

Based on the Ki67 index, these tumors are divided into three grades according to the European Neuroendocrine Tumour Society and World Health Organization 2010 Classification Systems for NETs. Grade 1 tumors are well-differentiated with a ki67 index of <2% and show indolent behavior. Grade 3 tumors are poorly differentiated with a ki67 index of >20% and show aggressive clinical behavior. The Grade 2 moderately differentiated tumors have a behavior and proliferation profile between these two extremes.

**Radiotracers for PET/CT Imaging**

Fluorine-18 combined with deoxyglucose is the most common radiotracer used in PET/CT imaging. The activity detection comes from multiple collisions of a positron in the radioactive material with surrounding electrons in the biological environment until it loses its kinetic energy and combines with an electron to form a short-lived positronium molecule. The positronium eventually annihilates, converting all its mass into two gamma-ray photons, 511 KeV each, that travel 180 degrees in the opposite direction. If both annihilation photons are detected within a short time interval, it is called a coincidence event and assumed to have originated from positronium annihilation somewhere along the line drawn between the two points. This obviates the need for a physical lead collimator and results in much better sensitivity than SPECT imaging, as no extrinsic collimation is required.

For Gallium imaging, the conjugated version of octreotide is bound via 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) molecule ligand to Gallium 68 radiotracer, which then effectively binds with somatostatin receptors (SSTR) expressed by well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors. The more aggressive, poorly differentiated tumors may not show uptake on Gallium PET and can sometimes be better evaluated with FDG-PET due to less expression of SSTR and increased glucose metabolism.
