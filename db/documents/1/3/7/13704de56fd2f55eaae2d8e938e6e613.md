Early recognition of the signs and symptoms of LGV is key to improving outcomes. Delays in diagnosis may be related to disease mimicry or failure to elicit an adequate sexual history from patients on intake. High-risk individuals should receive education on early signs and symptoms, means of transmission, prevention of transmission through safe sexual practices, and risks associated with having multiple sexual partners. Also, testing should be offered and considered in high-risk, asymptomatic patients, or those who present with other STIs.
