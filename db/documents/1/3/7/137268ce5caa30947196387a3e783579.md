Laboratory testing of urine, blood, saliva, or hair can be useful to detect cannabis use, but results should be considered along with a clinical rationale. Assays typically rely on the detection of the most common active metabolite, delta-9-tetrahydrocannibinolic acid. It has been studied thoroughly, and this abundant acid metabolite has become an established urinary marker of cannabis consumption in forensic, clinical, and environmental analyses.

Also, other tests to rule out additional conditions may be of benefit. These include head imaging or laboratory testing of heavy metals, infection and immunological markers, electrolyte disturbances, or hormones.
