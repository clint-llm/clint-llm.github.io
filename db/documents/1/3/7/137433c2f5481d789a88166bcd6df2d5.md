Within the snail venom, there are various “conotoxins” in combinations specific to the species. These toxins have a variety of neuromuscular effects through glutamate, adrenergic (chi conotoxin), serotonin, and cholinergic pathways. Some conotoxins exert their effects on sodium (delta conotoxin), potassium, and calcium ion channels. Additionally, more obscure targets exist, such as toxins that act on hormonal receptors, simulating the effects of oxytocin and vasopressin (conopressins). Another integral part of cone snail venom is various alpha-conotoxins. These toxins specifically act on nicotinic receptors, which are responsible for skeletal muscle contraction. This mechanism is similar to botulinum toxin in that they act on the same pathway. Alpha-conotoxins block nicotinic receptors, which results in paralysis that may eventually involve the diaphragm. Due to the wide range of molecular targets and the variation in the venom of each Conus species, it is virtually impossible to create effective anti-venom.
