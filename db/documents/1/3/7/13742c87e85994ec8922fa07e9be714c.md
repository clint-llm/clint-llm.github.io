The substance-induced mood disorder will mimic its corresponding independent affective disorder. Thus, substance-induced depression will follow diagnostic criteria used to evaluate for depressive disorders, and substance-induced bipolar disorder will reflect that of the bipolar spectrum disorders. As implied by the title 'substance-induced', either admission of the ingestion of a substance or a positive laboratory test is necessary for a valid diagnosis. Temporality is the easiest feature to differentiate an independent affective disorder from a substance-induced one. As mentioned previously, symptoms of a substance-induced mood disorder will resolve following the cessation of severe intoxication or acute withdrawal (up to 1 month).

Laboratory results and imaging, as well as a detailed history, should rule out other etiologies of the ongoing affective disorder.
