An inverted nipple is a condition defined as the nipple, which is retracted inwards, rather than pointing outwards, as is seen in normal anatomy. It can occur in both sexes and can be congenital or acquired. The projection of the inverted nipple lies beneath the areolar plane, as opposed to the normal anatomic position where it projects beyond the plane of the areolar breast. The appearance can be psychologically disturbing, as well as being problematic during breastfeeding in nursing women. As many as 10%Â to 20% of females are born with one or more inverted nipples, and they may be completely asymptomatic until breastfeeding.
