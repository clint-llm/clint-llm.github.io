Electroencephalogram of a newborn shows unique features compared to older children and adults. The principles employed in the identification of abnormalities emphasize the polyphasic sleep activity of newborns and the maturation of the brain. This activity covers essential features of abnormal EEGs in the newborn and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe how to detect neonatal EEG abnormalities. 
- Describe the most concerning neonatal EEG abnormalities. 
- Describe the appropriate evaluation of a patient with an abnormal neonatal EEG.
- Employ interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication for patients diagnosed with an abnormal neonatal EEG.
