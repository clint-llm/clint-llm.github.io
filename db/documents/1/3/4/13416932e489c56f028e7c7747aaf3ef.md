The definitive treatment of adrenal crisis is the administration of glucocorticoids, specifically hydrocortisone. In patients with known adrenal insufficiency, symptoms typical for the adrenal crisis should be sufficient to start treatment.  If the patient is medically unstable and the diagnosis is concerning for adrenal insufficiency or crisis, treatment with stress dose steroids should not be delayed.

**Guidelines for Managing Adrenal Crisis During an Emergency**

- Continuous infusion has been shown to be a better delivery method for hydrocortisone in adrenal crisis compared to intermittent boluses

- Involve an endocrinologist as soon as possible in the patient's care.

- Gradually taper steroids after there is a clinical improvement

- If the dose of glucocorticoids being administered exceeds 50 mg, mineralocorticoid replacement is not necessary

- In case hydrocortisone is unavailable, another parenteral glucocorticoid can be used 
- Prednisolone (Preferred alternative) 25 mg given as a bolus. The patient should then receive another two 25-mg doses in the first 24 hours. This should be followed by prednisone 50 mg every 24 hours.
- Methylprednisolone 40 mg every 24 hours
- Dexamethasone (least preferred alternative) 4 mg every 24 hours

- Prompt administration of antibiotics is necessary in patients in whom an infectious process was the precipitating event for adrenal crisis.
