**Anesthesia**: Closed rhinoplasty can be performed either with general anesthesia or local anesthesia and sedation, both with similar results in experienced hands.The patient is placed in the supine position, with a slight reverse Trendelenburg, to minimize bleeding.

Whether using general anesthesia or sedation, infiltration anesthesia is the first step of the procedure, and it has to be done in a very meticulous way in order to produce not only numbness in the nasal region but also a bloodless operative field. Prior to the injection, a local vasoconstrictor like oxymetazoline can be applied to the nasal mucosa.

For the anesthetic solution, 1% lidocaine with epinephrine in a dilution of 1:100,000 is preferred. About 5 ml to 10 ml of the solution should suffice to infiltrate the nasal area and septal mucosa if needed.

Infiltration may start in the nasal root and descend to the lateral nasal walls, the columellar region, and the maxillary arch in order to constrict the main vessels and nerves without much distortion of the nose. Mucosal infiltration can be performed in the incision areas. If septal reconstruction or cartilage harvesting is planned, infiltration in the septal mucosa helps to prevent bleeding when elevating the flaps and produces hydraulic dissection.

Posterior to infiltration, nasal vibrissae are shaved, and a povidone-iodine solution is applied to the nasal mucosa, the whole face is then prepped and draped. If ear cartilage harvesting is planned, ears should be included in the surgical field.

**Incisions and Exposure**: A retractor is placed holding the alar rim superiorly, and slight pressure is performed in order to evert the mucosa and visualize the intercartilaginous groove. Depending on the surgical planning, an approach to the tip area could be done via delivery or non-delivery of the lower lateral cartilages. Non-delivery approach can be done by performing a trans-cartilaginous (incising through the lower lateral cartilage) or intercartilaginous incision (in the junction of the upper and lower lateral cartilages), connected to a transfixion incision running through the membranous septum.

The trans-cartilaginous incision is usually performed in the context of a patient with a bulbous or boxy tip, and the cephalic trim of the lower lateral cartilages is planned. After the incision, with the use of a hook, eversion of the nasal mucosa is performed, and excess cartilage is detached using scissors. At least a 5 mm rim strip should be maintained in order to avoid a pinched tip or an external valve collapse.

The delivery technique is used when more complex tip modifications are planned. It allows for better visualization as an open approach would provide. It is performed by making a marginal incision from lateral crus to medial crus and an intercartilaginous incision bilaterally, which connect in the midline and can continue to a hemitransfixion incision. The soft tissue between the marginal and the intercartilaginous incision is dissected so that the lower lateral cartilages can be “delivered out” of the incisions in order to modify them. These modifications can include trimming of the cephalic portion of upper lateral cartilages, inter or intradomal sutures, tip grafts, and controlled weakening of the cartilages.After this step, using a periosteal elevator, soft tissues are separated from the cartilaginous and bony dorsum in a subperichondrial and subperiosteal plane.

**Treatment of the Dorsum**: If a dorsal hump exists, an objective evaluation should be made in order to differentiate whether there is a cartilaginous hump, osseous, or combined. These patients will generally require dorsal reduction techniques. In other patients, there is a need for augmentation of the dorsum rather than for reduction.

The **reduction of the bony dorsum**can be performed by using a rasp, an osteotome, or an ultrasonic device, according to the surgeon’s preference. When finished, the dorsum should feel smooth and straight, or there might be asymmetries afterward.

Cartilaginous dorsum can be trimmed with scissors or scalpel, either detaching the superior lateral cartilages from the septum or not. The surgeon should be extremely careful in this step to avoid over resection and the possible collapse of the middle vault. Trimming of thin strips of cartilage and reassessment after each trim is the author’s recommendation in order to prevent these complications.

**Augmentation of the Dorsum**is usually performed to strengthen this area and improve contour imperfections. It’s especially important in the context of a secondary rhinoplasty with loss of dorsal support and other structural deficiencies produced by congenital or traumatic etiologies. There are many techniques described, the most popular being the use of homologous or autologous tissue like bone or cartilage. Synthetic implants are also an option, and they can be made from different materials like silicone and Gore-Tex. The use of these implants is controversial when autologous tissue is available, as there have been reports of implant extrusion, skin loss, and infection.

**Lateral Osteotomies**: If the patient has a wide bony vault or if the surgeon needs to correct the open roof deformity created by surgical maneuvers or a deviated nose, unilateral or bilateral lateral osteotomies are necessary in order to maintain aesthetic dorsal lines. Osteotomies can be internal through the nasal mucosa or external by incising the skin and inserting a thin osteotome from the outside. Some authors favor the external approach because it minimizes edema and hemorrhage, and permits a more controlled fracture pattern.

Depending on the level of the osteotomy, they can be classified as low-to-high, low-to-low, or double level. Lateral osteotomies are carried out generally in the junction between the frontal process of the maxilla and the nasal bone, where the bone is thinner. Once the osteotomy pattern is completed, gentle pressure is applied to perform a greenstick fracture and reposition of the nasal bones. Relative contraindications for lateral osteotomies are mostly patients with very thin or short nasal bones.

**Septoplasty**: In favor of correcting a septal deviation or if cartilage harvesting is needed, septoplasty might be performed. The technique involves elevating bilateral mucoperichondrial flaps to expose the septum. Once the anterior septal angle is identified, an incision on the cartilage is performed to reveal the subperichondrial plane, which should be not hard to recognize because of its white-blueish color. Once into the plane, a Cottle elevator is used to separate the mucoperichondrial flaps off the septal cartilage. Cartilage can be harvested by using a scalpel and a Ballenger swivel knife. Care should be taken to leave at least a 1 cm segment of the dorsal and caudal septal cartilage strut (L strut) in order to prevent septal collapse. Depending on the type of septal deviation encountered, techniques to correct it involves either scoring of the cartilage, resecting the deviated portion, or in the case of a septal tilt, remotion of the postero-caudal part of the septum, which can be later reattached or not (swinging door technique).

If there is impairment of the internal nasal valve, spreader grafts may be needed. These grafts, described by Sheen,

**Tip Modifications**: The nasal tip approach requires careful planning and execution. Tip projection, definition, symmetry, and morphology may be altered and can be corrected by the use of different techniques. Treatment of the tip area has evolved over time from destructive and sometimes irreversible to a less aggressive strategy, using cartilage shaping procedures and better placement of grafts.

- **Tip Projection**: It refers to the distance that the nose protrudes from the face. A tip can be over projected or under projected. Techniques for decreasing projection usually involve shortening the length of the lateral and/or medial crura. This is regularly done by cartilage overlapping. Some of these techniques may also modify the tip rotation. The methods described for****increasing tip projection are many, and the one to use depends mainly on the amount of projection needed. Placement of a columellar strut will increase projection slightly by enhancing the medial crura. It involves dissection of a pocket between the medial crura and placement of a rectangular piece of cartilage fashioned from septal cartilage, which is held in place by using sutures. The use of a septal extension graft is a powerful way of increasing tip projection and can also have an enormous impact on rotation. It is performed by fixing a cartilage graft to the dorsal or caudal septum, extending between the lower lateral cartilages. The distal portion of the graft enhances the supratip area and can be fixed at the desired angle. Ideally, the graft should be made from septal cartilage. If unavailable, other options like ear or rib cartilage must be considered. When compared to the columellar strut, the septal extension graft has proven to be more favorable in maintaining tip projection.

- ****Tip rotation:****The position of the nasal tip is an important aesthetic factor for patients. During rhinoplasty consultations, many of them are unhappy with their nasolabial angle and wish to modify it. There are many methods of achieving cephalic rotation of the tip, and the technique to use depends on the amount of rotation needed. An excessive amount of rotation will result in an exaggerated nostril show, while an insufficient rotation will produce a droopy tip. Understanding the anatomy and the dynamics of nasal surgery is paramount to realize why some maneuvers have an influence over tip rotation. Cephalic trim of the lower lateral cartilages is an example. When resecting the cartilage, space is created between the lower and upper lateral cartilages, and it facilitates passive rotation of the tip. Septal caudal trim is another tactic that can be used for the rotation of the tip. By altering the position of the ASA, the nasolabial angle will change because of its relations with other tip-defining structures. This must be done carefully, as this also can reduce tip projection. The tongue-in-groove technique was described in 1999 by Kridel.

- **Transdomal Suture**: Variations in nasal dome angles and their convexity can produce different tip shapes and deformities. Bulbous and boxy tips are examples of this. Transdomal sutures are used to narrow these angles, bringing the domal and lobular segments closer to each other while pulling the lateral crura medially. This projects the nasal tip while narrowing it.****The technique involves the placement of a horizontal mattress suture, which is tied up medially, between the domes, tightening it gradually until the desired effect is achieved. Care must be taken to place the sutures superficial to the vestibular lining.

- **Interdomal Suture**: This is a simple suture that is placed between the domes of the middle crura of each lower lateral cartilage. It is used to narrow tip width, enhance the infratip region, and increase projection. As with the previous technique, gradually tightening of the suture is advisable in order to achieve the expected results. Too much tightening may end up in a pinched tip. This maneuver was classically performed via the delivery of the lower lateral cartilages. In 2016, Harel described an interdomal suture technique through a non-delivery approach.

**Turbinectomy**: Inferior turbinate hypertrophy is a common finding that can produce varying amounts of airway obstruction. Its treatment will depend on the extent of the obstruction. Conventional methods include submucous turbinectomy, turbinoplasty, radiofrequency, and laser. If valvular issues and/or septal deviations have been addressed, turbinate outfracture alone may be satisfactory to provide an adequate airway size.

**Closure and Dressing**: After mucosal incisions are closed with resorbable sutures, Silastic splints are placed and sutured to each side of the septum in order to provide septal support and enhance mucosal healing.
