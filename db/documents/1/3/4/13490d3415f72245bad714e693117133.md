The management of keloids is difficult and thus the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a dermatologist, plastic surgeon, radiation expert, primary care provider and the specialist nurse. There is no effective treatment for keloids and the only reason for treatment is cosmesis. If the patient does not have problems with aesthetics, keloids should be left alone. There are dozens of treatments for keloids and none is better than the other and all have the potential to worsen the original lesion. Recently radiation has been touted as a treatment for keloids. While the treatment works, it is not reliable or consistent and it is not possible to predict in which patient it will work. The primary care providers should educate the patient on different treatment options and their pros and cons. The best remedy for keloids is to do nothing.
