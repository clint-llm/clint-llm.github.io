The most critical factor in the causation of endophthalmitis is the breakdown of the ocular blood barrier and intraocular colonization by pathogens (bacteria/fungi). In exogenous endophthalmitis, the inciting injury or surgery causes disruption of globe integrity, which allows invasion of the pathogens. In rare cases of delayed postoperative endophthalmitis, the organisms (usually Propionibacterium acnes sequestered in the capsular bag after cataract surgery) may get released after YAG capsulotomy causing endophthalmitis.

The pathogen's ability to cause intraocular damage depends on its virulence and host response. The virulence of an organism depends on:

- Its ability to synthesize toxic factors such as hemolysin BL, cytolysin, pneumolysin, lipopolysaccharide (bacterial outer envelope), and others

- The rapidity of intraocular growth

- Motility of organism

The ability of the host's innate immunity to mount an effective inflammatory response depends on the virulence of the organism. The acute inflammatory response may clear the less virulent organism; However, more virulent organisms may evade the host's immune response by secreting toxins or biofilm around it, in which case the inflammatory response can result in damage to intraocular tissues and loss of vision. The peak of inflammatory mediators such as TNFÎ±, interleukin 1-beta, interferon-gamma coincides with increased inflammatory signs such as fibrin in the anterior chamber, iris synechiae formation, hypopyon, and loss of the red reflex.
