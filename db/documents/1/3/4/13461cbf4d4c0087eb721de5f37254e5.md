Trauma and resection of tumors often leave large defects requiring coverage, which have historically meant multi-stage procedures. However, axial pattern flaps, which rely on an anatomically named direct cutaneous blood supply, have presented a single-stage procedure that provides a reliable, cosmetically appealing option. This activity reviews the indications, complications, and contraindications regarding axial flaps and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and caring for axial flaps preoperative, intraoperatively, and postoperatively.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for use of axial flaps.
- Describe the anatomy and physiology of axial flaps.
- Summarize the most common complications associated with axial flaps.
- Explain the importance of post-operative monitoring for axial flaps.
