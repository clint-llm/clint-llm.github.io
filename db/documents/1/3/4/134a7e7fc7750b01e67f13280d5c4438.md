Management of patients diagnosed with primary congenital glaucoma depends on age and severity of disease at the time of diagnosis. Though the mainstay of treatment is a surgical intervention, an initial medical course may be needed in few patients depending on their presentation.

The gold standard treatment for primary congenital glaucoma is angle surgery in the form of either goniotomy or trabeculotomy to alleviate IOP by enhancing aqueous outflow. When the angle surgery fails, trabeculectomy with mitomycin C or a glaucoma drainage device like Ahmed or Baerveldt should be attempted. In recalcitrant cases, cycloablation can be attempted by using diode cyclophotocaogulation, Nd YAG, or cryoablation. Topical or oral antiglaucoma drugs are used for decreasing corneal edema, control of IOP, and improve visualization for performing goniotomy

**Medical Treatment**

This approach is often an initial treatment measure to lower the IOP to decrease corneal edema, improve angel visualization, or until any surgical procedure is planned, or during the waiting period until fitness is obtained from a pediatrician or anesthetist for the procedure. Medical treatment is in the form of topical drugs, which act by either decreasing the aqueous production or increasing the aqueous outflow. Medications that decrease aqueous humor production include alpha-adrenergic agonists like brimonidine, apraclonidine, or beta-blockers like timolol, betaxolol, and levobetaxolol, or carbonic anhydrase inhibitors like brinzolamide.

Drugs that act by increasing aqueous outflow include parasympathomimetic drugs or prostaglandin analogs like travoprost. Alfa agonists, particularly brimonidine, should be avoided in children younger than two years of age and used with caution in children younger than six years of age, as these can cross the blood-brain barrier and may cause respiratory depression, apnea, and drowsiness.

**Surgical Treatment**

Surgery is the mainstay of treatment of patients with primary congenital glaucoma. The type of surgical procedure depends on the disease severity, cornea clarity, and surgeon’s choice and experience.

Surgical procedures for primary congenital glaucoma can be broadly divided into

**Angle Procedures**

- These procedures work by increasing the aqueous outflow by decreasing the resistance in the aqueous pathway due to angle anomaly. The angle procedures are further of two types based on internal or external approach.

- Internal approach using goniotomy - This was initially described by Barkan.

- External approach – Trabeculotomy. This technique was first described by Smith.

- A new modification using a prolene suture has been described as a modification procedure. This allows 360-degree trabeculotomy and allows to open the entire angle in a single sitting.

**Filtration Procedures**

- Trabeculectomy – This was first described by Cairns.

- The use of antifibrotic agents like Mitomycin- C, 5-fluorouracil has shown promising results in improving the success rates. Success rates from 52 to 82% have been reported following anti-metabolite-assisted trabeculectomy procedures in PCG patients.

- Deep sclerectomy – This procedure involves elevation of partial-thickness scleral flap and removal of the external portion of Schlemm’s canal and outer part of the trabecular meshwork, including juxtacanalicular tissue without full penetration inside the eye.

- Glaucoma Drainage Devices (GDD) – The role of GDD in primary congenital glaucoma as a primary procedure is limited. GDD implantation in primary congenital glaucoma is considered in cases where primary angle procedures have failed or in advanced refractory cases. Studies have shown a reduction of intraocular pressure by 28 to 49% following one year post-surgery.

**Combined Trabeculotomy and Trabeculectomy (CTT)**

- This procedure is attempted when the previous trabeculectomy has failed, or there is difficulty in cannulating the Schlemm canal. In this, the trabeculectomy is added to the trabeculotomy. A block of tissue is removed from the sclera aided by surgical peripheral iridectomy. Care is necessary when using mitomycin C.

**Cyclodestructive Procedures**

- This procedure is reserved for eyes with poor or nil visual prognosis. The success rate in these cases is close to 30% only.
