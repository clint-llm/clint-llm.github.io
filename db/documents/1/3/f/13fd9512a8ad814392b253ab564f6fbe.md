Even with the drawbacks, the strategy includes a simple and effective guideline on administering analgesics that is valid even today. The main components include:

- Oral dosing of drugs whenever possible (as opposed to intravenous, rectal, etc.).

- Around-the-clock rather than on-demand administration.

- Analgesics must be prescribed according to pain intensity as evaluated by a pain severity scale. For this purpose, a clinical examination must combine with an adequate pain assessment.

- Individualized therapy (including dosing) addresses the concerns of the patient.

- Proper medication adherence, as any dosing alterations can lead to pain recurrence.

Pain accounts for one of the top five reasons for consultation.

The WHO analgesic ladder has become a standard of care for cancer patients worldwide due to its effectiveness in relieving cancer pain without causing significant side effects. Studies have shown that following the WHO analgesic ladder can improve patient outcomes, reduce hospital stays, and improve quality of life. Additionally, using the ladder can help reduce opioid misuse and abuse by ensuring that opioids are only used when necessary

The WHO analgesic ladder also guides titrating medications according to the needs of the patient. This allows clinicians to adjust doses to provide optimal relief from cancer pain while avoiding unwanted side effects. Additionally, it encourages clinicians to assess the response to treatment regularly to ensure that their treatment plan remains adequate.

Overall, the WHO analgesic ladder has become an essential tool for managing cancer pain due to its ability to provide adequate relief while minimizing risks associated with opioid use. Therefore, it is an important part of any comprehensive cancer care plan and should be used whenever possible to ensure optimal outcomes for patients suffering from cancer pain.
