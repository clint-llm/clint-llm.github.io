Acute fatty liver in pregnancy (AFLP) is an obstetric emergency and carries high morbidity and mortality, including death in the mother and her fetus. It is characterized by maternal liver failure. Maternal mortality has decreased to 4% in recent years due to quicker diagnosis and immediate delivery. AFLP is not a predictable or preventable condition. Liver failure, coagulopathy, hemorrhage, renal failure, and severe infection can be lethal for both the mother and fetus. This activity outlines the pathogenesis, evaluation, and management of this disease.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of fatty liver in pregnancy.
- Review the typical presentation of acute fatty liver in pregnancy and the laboratory findings associated with it.
- Explain the evaluation and management of patients presenting with signs and symptoms of fatty liver in pregnancy.
- Outline the importance of a team-based approach and the collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team for the management of patients with acute fatty liver of pregnancy.
