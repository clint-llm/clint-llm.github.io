Injuries to the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis constitute about 5 to 10% of ankle sprains and 11 to 20% of ankle fractures. In cases of confirmed syndesmotic instability either during intra-operative fixation of an associated ankle fracture or a separate isolated syndesmotic injury, operative treatment is indicated.

Screw versus tightrope fixation methods

Regardless of the surgical technique utilized, the goal of syndesmotic repair/fixation is to achieve an anatomic reduction of the syndesmosis.  Studies have previously demonstrated anatomic reduction is crucial to successful outcomes in patients.

Incorporating intra-operative three-dimensional imaging has been suggested as a potential option for improving tibiofibular reduction outcomes. Imaging may also be used pre-operatively to determine any anatomical differences in the anatomic morphology of the fibular incisura on the tibia to decrease instances of malreduction.
