Managing patients with immunoglobulin deficiencies involves an interprofessional team that includes nurses, clinicians, and pharmacists. Many of these patients are prone to infections and opportunistic organisms; hence surveillance and close monitoring of the patient is vital. Immunologists, transplant specialists, geneticists, and hematologists from  NIH collaborate in an interprofessional manner for the Blood and Immune Deficiency–Cellular Therapy Program (BID–CTP). These clinicians deliver state-of-the-art and experimental care to patients with rare blood and immune system diseases through an integrated and interprofessional approach to evaluating, treating, and monitoring patients.

Similarly, PIDTC (Primary Immune Deficiency Treatment Consortium)  is a network of 33 centers in North America that explore the management of severe primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID). PIDTC evaluates the natural history of patients treated for Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome, and Chronic Granulomatous Disease through retrospective, prospective and cross-sectional studies. In addition, the PIDTC has interprofessional collaborative partnerships with European and international colleagues and works with patient advocacy groups to promote community awareness.
