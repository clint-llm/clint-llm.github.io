**Medication-related complications:**

- An overdose of local anesthetics can result in central nervous system (CNS)-toxicity like neuropathy, seizures, and coma.

- Methemoglobinemia

- Most sedative medications can result in hemodynamic effects including low blood pressure or low heart rate.

- General anesthetics may result in malignant hyperthermia and prolonged neuromuscular paralysis.

**Procedure-related complications**:

- Bleeding: In most cases, bleeding is usually self-limited. The pulmonologists should carefully ascertain for hemostasis, and in the event of severe bleeding prompt management should be immediately instituted.

- Pneumothorax: In 1% to 3% of patients, pneumothorax may occur after transbronchial biopsies. Small pneumothoraces may be managed conservatively, while symptomatic and large pneumothorax will require chest tube insertion and hospitalization. A tension pneumothorax results in hemodynamic instability and should be recognized even without imaging studies. Appropriate life-saving measures such as chest tube insertion should be undertaken immediately. Most pneumothoraces after bronchoscopy develop within the first hour of the procedure but can be delayed up to 24 hours. Appropriate instructions to the patient and appropriate follow up should be arranged.

- Cardiac arrhythmias may also occur especially in patients with pre-existing cardiac disease.

- Other potential complications of the procedure include trauma to the vocal cords, pneumomediastinum, hypoxia, and rarely death.
