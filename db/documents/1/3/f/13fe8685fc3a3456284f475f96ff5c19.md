An essential feature of the central nervous system (CNS), the spinal cord lies within the spinal column and extends from the brainstem to the lower back through the vertebral foramen of the vertebrae. In adults, the spinal cord terminates in the lumbar region at L1-L2, the conus medullaris.

The role of the spinal cord is to conduct information from the brain to the periphery and vice versa. It is organized segmentally, with 31 pairs of spinal nerves emanating from it. An injury to the spinal cord may disrupt this conduit between the body and brain and can lead to deficits in sensation, movement, autonomic regulation, and death.
