Boerhaave syndrome was first described in 1724 by Hermann Boerhaave, Professor of Medicine at Leiden University.  In one of his publications entitled “History of a Grievous Disease Not Previously Described,” he discussed the case of Baron Jan von Wassenaer, a Holland admiral, who, after a feast, began to vomit and suffered left-sided chest pain shortly afterward. Unfortunately, he survived for only 24 hours after the incident. Today, Boerhaave’s syndrome accounts for approximately 15% of all cases of esophageal rupture. Although the actual incidence of esophageal perforation worldwide is unclear, some studies estimate an incidence of approximately 3.1 per 1,000,000 per year.  The patient population who suffer from Boerhaave’s syndrome varies, but the risk is highest in middle-aged males.  The condition is highly associated with alcohol ingestion.
