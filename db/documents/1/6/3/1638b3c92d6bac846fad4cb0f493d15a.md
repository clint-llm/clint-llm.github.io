Initial treatment intervention for patients with inflammatory back pain should begin with education regarding the expected course of their condition along with the expectation for further evaluation for a possible source of the inflammatory process. Instructions to the patients should include advice to stop smoking, as this can worsen symptoms, and they receive a referral to sources of psychosocial support. Physical therapy is an essential target of referral for those with inflammatory back pain, as exercise and postural training may greatly benefit them in the course of this disease.
