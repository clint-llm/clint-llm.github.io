Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor used for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. It is seldom employed for its own antiviral activity but instead serves as a booster for other protease inhibitors. Although ritonavir was initially designed to inhibit HIV protease, studies have found that it also inhibits cytochrome P450-3A4. Because of its mechanism of action, ritonavir is currently under investigation for its use in treating some forms of cancer. In addition, it is used in combination with other medicines to treat Hepatitis C infection. This activity reviews the indications, dosage, administration, adverse event profile, mechanisms of action, toxicity, and contraindications for ritonavir as part of treating HIV/AIDS. This activity is pertinent for members of the interprofessional team involved in caring for patients with HIV/AIDS, including physicians, infectious disease specialists, nurses, pharmacists, physician assistants, and other healthcare providers.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for ritonavir.
- Outline the potential adverse effects of ritonavir.
- Summarize the mechanism of action of ritonavir, both as an antiretroviral on its own and in its use with other agents.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the care of HIV patients when dosing with ritonavir to help limit side effects and improve patient outcomes.
