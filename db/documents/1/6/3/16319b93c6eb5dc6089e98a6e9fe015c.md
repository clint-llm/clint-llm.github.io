Open airway procedural sedation (OAPS) allows practitioners to perform various procedures in different clinical settings that would otherwise be poorly tolerated by awake patients. There is considerable variability in the practice of OAPS due to the wide array of practitioners performing OAPS, the procedures taking place, and the setting in which it is being carried out. However, the principles remain unchanged and will therefore be the focus of this activity, which will cover important considerations in the pre-operative assessment of patients prior to OAPS, required equipment, common agents and techniques utilized during OAPS, as well the management of common intra-operative and post-operative issues encountered during OAPS.

**Objectives:**
- Review common intra-operative issues specific to open airway procedural sedation (OAPS).
- Describe the management of common intra-operative airway issues that arise during open airway procedural sedation (OAPS).
- Identify risk factors that put patients at increased risk for perioperative complications during open airway procedural sedation (OAPS).
- Explain the importance of preoperative physical examination and screening of patients before performing open airway procedural sedation (OAPS).
