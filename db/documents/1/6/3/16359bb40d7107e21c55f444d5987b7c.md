Control of traumatic peripheral vascular hemorrhage is vital for the survival of an injured victim. Hemorrhage control starts with the ATLS protocol along with the first responders.  The American College of Surgeon recently launched the "Stop the Bleed" campaign that educates individuals on the correct placement and supports the use of tourniquets. Tourniquet use in the civilian setting has been an area of controversy since World War I when complications such as nerve damage and limb loss were reported with their use. However, with the recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq more experience with tourniquets and peripheral vascular injuries was documented and studied.
