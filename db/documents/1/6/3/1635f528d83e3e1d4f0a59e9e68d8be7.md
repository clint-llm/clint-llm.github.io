Isoflurane is a volatile anesthetic approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. Like most volatile anesthetics, isoflurane is a halogenated ether compound that is a structural isomer to its predecessor, enflurane and has been approved for use in the United States since 1979. Unlike enflurane, isoflurane is a non-flammable volatile anesthetic but carries a strong, pungent odor that makes it difficult to use for inhalational induction of general anesthesia.
