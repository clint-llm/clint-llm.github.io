Many aneurysms will never cause a patient any discomfort or sequelae.

If an aneurysm does rupture, the prognosis depends on several factors including:

- Prior neurologic conditions

- Age

- Comorbidities

- Aneurysm location

- Time from rupture to first contact with a doctor

- Bleeding extent or grade of subarachnoid hemorrhage and (rebleeding)

- Aneurysm treatment success

- Vasospasm in the ensuing days

- Development of hydrocephalus and seizures

Twenty-five percent of patients with ruptured aneurysms will not survive the first 24 hours.

Of those who survive initially, 25 percent will die from other complications in the next six months.
