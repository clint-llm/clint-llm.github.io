The peripheral blood smear is key to the evaluation for functional asplenism. The presence of Howell-Jolly bodies on a peripheral blood smear is indicative of abnormal spleen function. Howell-Jolly bodies are nuclear remnants of old RBCs that are typically removed by the spleen. Although they are typically found on peripheral blood smear, a flow cytometry-based assay for Howell-Jolly bodies is currently under investigation. Acanthocytes, large cells, Heinz bodies, and iron granules may also be observed on a peripheral blood smear. Demonstration of many of these abnormalities requires special dyes and microscopy. The presence and quantitation of “pitted” RBCs have been used to determine the function of remaining splenic tissue. Thrombocytosis, lymphocytosis, and monocytosis are additional hematological signs of functional asplenism. A 99Tc-labelled radiocolloid scan is helpful in the evaluation of splenic function by measuring the uptake of injected radio-labeled particles by the splenic endothelium relative to the liver. This scan provides information regarding the phagocytic function of the spleen. Liver-Spleen scintigraphy has the disadvantage of being invasive and time-consuming for patients. Newer methods that are currently in use include immune response upon vaccination or the evaluation of the functionality of specific B-cell subsets. Functional asplenia is also associated with small, avascular spleens on Doppler sonography.
