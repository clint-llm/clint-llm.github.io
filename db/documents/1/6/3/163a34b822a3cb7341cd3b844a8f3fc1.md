The developmental outcome for all children can be greatly enhanced by systematic examination and developmental monitoring of all children. Even in relatively well-developed countries like the USA, as few as 1 in 5 children have been offered an acceptable parent completed developmental screening by a health care provider in the past year. According to the NSCH report in 2016, 30.4% of children aged 9 to 35 months were provided with parent-completed developmental screening instruments in addition to evaluation for behavior and interaction in the past year, which was confirmed by the parent/caregiver. Among them, only 19.2% had obtained both developmental screening and surveillance.

The results are far worse in LMIC, where the majority of children live.  An extensive medical and developmental evaluation is warranted to detect developmental delays at an early age. If this is done, it is possible that, through a collaborative effort between health care providers, parents, and society, children will have more favorable outcomes in the face of developmental delays.
