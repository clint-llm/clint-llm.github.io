Assessing patients for risks of cerebrovascular events start by taking a careful history and a focused physical exam. The optimum position for listening for a carotid bruit is with the patient either supine or sitting. In the sitting position, optimal carotid palpation and auscultation are achievable when approaching the patient from behind. With the patient’s chin pointing straight forward, the bell of the stethoscope is applied over the course of each carotid artery, sealing the overlying skin. The patient is then instructed to inspire deeply and hold the breath without bearing down for 15 to 30 seconds. Auscultation continues during, and shortly after, the breath-holding. Breath-holding not only eliminates other adventitious sounds but it also accentuates a carotid bruit.
