According to the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, there are 12 injury-related emergency department visits for every 100 persons over the age of 65 annually. Geriatric patients account for a quarter of trauma admissions nationally. Cervical spine injuries are relatively common in the elderly population. These injuries are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. This activity examines when this condition should be considered in differential diagnosis and how to properly evaluate these conditions. This activity also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the various type of cervical spine injuries, most notably fractures, in light of pre-disposing factors and pathologies prevalent in geriatric patients.
- Outline the diagnostic approach and evaluation criteria for potential cervical spine injuries in the geriatric population.
- Summarize the treatment options for cervical spine fractures and other injuries in the elderly.
- Explain possible interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and treatment of cervical spine injuries in the elderly and improve outcomes.
