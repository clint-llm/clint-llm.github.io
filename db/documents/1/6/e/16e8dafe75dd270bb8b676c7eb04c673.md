Goblet cells are intestinal mucosal epithelial cells that serve as the primary site for nutrient digestion and mucosal absorption.

Colonic and small intestinal crypt goblet cells secrete upon stimulation. Examples of stimulation include responses to endocytosis or acetylcholine. Surface colonic goblet cells constantly secrete to maintain the inner mucus layer. These goblet cells contrast with the upper part of the colonic crypt goblet cells that can secrete by rapid compound exocytosis.

Goblet cells play an important role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Recent studies have shown that goblet cells can act as antigen importers and may serve as a regulator of innate immune function. Goblet cells help maintain homeostasis by providing bicarbonate for proper mucin unfolding in the small intestine. Goblet cells can also form a line of defense at the intestinal mucosa and have a common secretory role. Small intestinal goblet cells uptake antigens through cholinergic agonists regulated by muscarinic receptor 4.
