The short-term prognosis of lacunar infarctions is better than other infarcts due to other stroke mechanisms. Multiple population-based epidemiological studies on lacunar infarcts have shown significantly better survival among patients who suffered from lacunar infarctions compared to those who suffered from non-lacunar infarcts.

Though the short-term prognosis for patients with lacunar syndromes is better, there is not as stark a difference in the long-term prognosis when compared with non-lacunar events. Multiple studies have shown that the stroke recurrence rate and the risk of death between lacunar infarcts and non-lacunar infarcts are similar after 5 years. The main reason for the better 5-year survival rate in lacunar syndrome patients is attributed to the lower mortality within the first year of the ischemic event.

As expected, patients that suffered from a lacunar infarction with worse initial neurologic deficits had a worse functional outcome. However, data does not exist comparing patient functional outcomes and long-term prognosis between different mechanisms of lacunar infarction production.
