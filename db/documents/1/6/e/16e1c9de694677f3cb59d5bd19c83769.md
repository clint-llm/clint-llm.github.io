Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is a relatively low-risk therapy. Otic barotrauma is common but usually not severe. Infrequent complications include oxygen toxicity seizures, transient myopia, and rare cataract formation. Patients with severe structural lung disease or poor left ventricular function are susceptible to more serious complications such as pulmonary barotrauma and acute pulmonary edema.

Contraindications to hyperbaric therapy include recent use of doxorubicin or bleomycin, claustrophobia, epilepsy, severeÂ emphysema particularly with blebs, and certain implanted devices.
