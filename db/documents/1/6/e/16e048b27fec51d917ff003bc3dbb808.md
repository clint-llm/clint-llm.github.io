Epidermoid tumors frequently pose a diagnostic dilemma. These patients may exhibit non-specific signs and symptoms, including cranial nerve deficits.Â While the neurosurgeon is almost always involved in the care of patients, it is important to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that include a neurologist, neuroanesthesiologist, neuroradiologist, and neuropathologist. The nurses are also vital members of the interprofessional group as they will monitor the patient's vital signs and assist with the education of the patient and family. In the postoperative period, the pharmacist will ensure that the patient is on the appropriate analgesic medications, antiemetics, prophylactic antibiotics, and steroids if aseptic meningitis is developed. The neuroradiologist also plays a vital role in determining the cause of the symptoms. Without providing a proper history, the neuroradiologist may not be sure what to look for or what additional radiologic exams may be needed when providing a diagnostic impression.
