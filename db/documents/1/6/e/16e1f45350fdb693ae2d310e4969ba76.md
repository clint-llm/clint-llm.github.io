Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is based on clinical findings of having at least 2 of the 3 listed clinical criteria for a positive diagnosis:

- Family history

- Multiple dark blue to brown pigmented (macules) lesions on the mucous membranes and skin are most often intraoral on the buccal mucosa or gingiva, lips, perioral, fingertips, palms, and soles

- Hamartomatous intestinal polyps

Mucocutaneous findings are non-specific for Peutz-Jeghers syndrome; other differentials must be considered. Molecular and genetic testing can aid in confirming the diagnosis
