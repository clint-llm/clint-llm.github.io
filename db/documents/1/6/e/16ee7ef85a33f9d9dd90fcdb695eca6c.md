# Continuing Education Activity

Functional dyspepsia is a common gastrointestinal disorder that is benign. It isn't easy to diagnose because the presentation is similar to other conditions. The principal treatment is symptom management, as this disorder can be relapsing and remitting. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of functional dyspepsia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia.
- Outline the diagnostic criteria and evaluation of functional dyspepsia.
- Identify the treatment options available for patients with functional dyspepsia. 
- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the care for patients with functional dyspepsia.

# Introduction

Functional dyspepsia is one of the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders and affects more than 20% of the population.  There are three different subtypes: epigastric pain syndrome (EPS), postprandial distress syndrome (PDS), and overlapping PDS and EPS. Functional dyspepsia is diagnosed based on the Rome IV criteria. It is defined by the presence of one or more of the following symptoms: epigastric pain or burning, early satiety, and postprandial fullness in the absence of structural disease using imaging or endoscopy.Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) if they are less than 60 years of age.

# Etiology

The etiology of functional dyspepsia is likely multifactorial; however, the exact cause is not clearly understood.  Several risk factors have been seen to be associated with the condition.

- Enteric infections: H. pylori, Escherichia coli O157, Campylobacter jejuni, and Salmonella.

- Recent antibiotic use

- Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

- Being overweight

- Smoking

- Psychosocial dysfunction

# Epidemiology

Functional dyspepsia prevalence varies worldwide, with higher prevalence in Western countries (10% to 40%), including the United States (US). In Asian countries, the prevalence is 5% to 30%.  Functional dyspepsia is found to be more common in women than in men. This difference is said to be due to inherent sex-specific differences in gastrointestinal function. For example, there exists sex-specific variation in hormone mechanisms, pain signaling, and health care maintenance.

# Pathophysiology

Although the exact mechanism is not well understood, the pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia is complex. Several different mechanisms are thought to contribute to each subtype.

# History and Physical

Typical symptoms can be divided into the subtypes PDS and EPS, and there exists an overlap between the two syndromes. These symptoms can be acute or chronic. PDS patients report loss of appetite, early satiation, nausea, retching, vomiting, and bloating. In EPS, patients have stomach cramping and other upper abdominal pain. Some symptoms are non-gastrointestinal. Patients often report associated diaphoresis, headache, sleep disorders, and irritable bladder.  Functional dyspepsia symptoms usually do not progress and lack red flag signs of unintentional weight loss, dysphagia, night sweats, and persistent vomiting.

# Evaluation

To exclude organic causes, evaluation can start with laboratory tests, including blood count, complete metabolic panel, thyroid function, and inflammatory markers. If H. pylori infection is prevalent in at least 10% of the population, it is recommended to test for this.

Confirmation of the diagnosis is based on the patient’s history by excluding other diseases with similar presentations.

# Treatment / Management

Treatment can be challenging, where the main aim is symptom control.H. pylori eradication is recommended as the first treatment for all patients with functional dyspepsia. This improves symptoms and decreases the risk of peptic ulcers and gastric cancer.

# Differential Diagnosis

- GERD

- H. pylori infection

- Gastritis

- Peptic ulcer disease

- Celiac disease

- Irritable bowel syndrome

- Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth

- Chronic pancreatitis

- Gastroparesis

- Acute cholecystitis

- Gastric carcinoma

# Prognosis

Functional dyspepsia is relapsing and remitting. Population studies have shown that 15% to 20% of patients have persistent symptoms during extended follow-up, while 50% have complete resolution of symptoms.  There is no data to show that it is associated with decreased survival.

# Complications

Although the condition is not associated with increased mortality, it does cause physical and mental distress affecting the patient’s quality of life.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

It is essential to educate patients on the benign course of this disorder, to establish long-term care and expectations for treatment.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Functional dyspepsia is a rather common condition that prompts a patient to visit their physician. Patients will have symptoms that manifest similarly to other conditions. It is important to rule out any potential organic causes of the symptoms using additional [invasive] testing, especially if red flag signs are present. Making the diagnosis can be difficult, as it is a clinical diagnosis based on the Rome IV criteria.
