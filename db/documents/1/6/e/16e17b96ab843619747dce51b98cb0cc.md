The diagnosis of cutaneous sarcoidosis is often made by the recognition of compatible clinical features and the detection of classic histopathologic findings. Lupus pernio is associated with a higher risk of extracutaneous sarcoidosis and most commonly involves the respiratory tract. Dermatoscopic examination of the skin lesions may assist in identifying granulomatous skin lesions but it is a non-specific study. All skin lesions concerning lupus pernio should be biopsied to confirm the histopathologic diagnosis.

A thorough history and physical examination should be done to identify extra-cutaneous involvement. An initial evaluation should include a chest x-ray and pulmonary function tests to look for any involvement of the respiratory tract. Laboratory analysis may show elevated C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. A high serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level, although not specific to sarcoidosis and increased in only 60% of patients with sarcoidosis,

In some patients, further imaging should be considered including high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) chest, echocardiogram, or hand and feet radiographs based on clinical suspicion. In patients with no systemic involvement at initial evaluation, a long-term follow-up with close clinical and radiological supervision is warranted, as patients may develop systemic symptoms later on the course of the disease.
