Branchial cleft cysts are the most typical congenital neck masses. Typically, they present as a non-tender, fluctuant mass along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. These cysts may present more commonly during or after an upper respiratory tract infection. While there are four different types ofÂ branchial cleft cysts described, second branchial cleft cysts are most common. It is important for providers to consider branchial cleft cysts in the differential diagnosis of a neck mass in both children and adults. Treatment is surgical excision after the acute infection has been adequately treated.
