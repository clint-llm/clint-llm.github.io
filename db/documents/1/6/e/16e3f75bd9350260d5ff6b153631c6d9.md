Key Rhinoplasty Terminology:

- Ala – the lower lateral surface of the nare formed by the lower lateral cartilages

- Alar groove – the surface depression between the lower lateral crus (medially) and the ala (laterally)

- Anterior septal angle – the angle formed by the dorsal and caudal septum

- Columella – the skin between the nasal tip and the base, lying between the nares

- Dome – the anterior projection of the nose where the intermediate and lateral crura meet

- Dorsum – the external midline ridge of the nose between the tip and the nasion

- External nasal valve – the opening of the nare including the rim, columella, and nasal sill

- Internal nasal valve – the point of maximal airway resistance in the nose formed by the upper lateral cartilage (caudal edge), the head of the inferior turbinate, and the nasal septum

- Keystone – the location where the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid and the cartilaginous septum join at the dorsum of the nose

- Lower lateral cartilage (LLC) – the paired alar cartilages including the medial, intermediate, and lateral crura

- Nasion – the depression marked by the nasofrontal suture

- Nasolabial angle – the angle between the long axis of the nostril and a line perpendicular to the Frankfort horizontal line. Ideal angles vary, though have been defined as 90–115 degrees, with more acute angles preferred for males.

- Radix – the junction of the nasal and frontal bone, with the deepest portion ideally located at the level of the supratarsal crease

- Rhinion – the superficial location of the bony-cartilaginous junction along the nasal dorsum. Note: the nasal skin is thinnest at this area.

- Scroll area – the juncture of the cephalic lateral crus caudal upper lateral cartilage

- Supratip area – the region cephalad to where the caudal nasal dorsum meets the tip

- Tip-defining point (TDP) – the most anterior projection of the tip which produces an external light reflex as seen on frontal view

- Tip projection – the anterior-posterior distance from the TDP to the alar-facial groove. Several methods exist to measure tip projection (e.g., Goode ratio).

- Tip rotation – the cephalad or caudad movement of the TDP with a pivot at the alar base

- Upper lateral cartilages (ULC) – the paired cephalad cartilages of the nose situated below the caudal aspect of the nasal bone, forming the lateral walls of the middle vault

Facial Analysis:

Only after obtaining a thorough understanding of the underlying nasal anatomy and physiology can a comprehensive nasal analysis be performed, allowing a customized rhinoplasty treatment plan with attention to both aesthetic and functional concerns.

At a minimum, assessment of frontal, lateral, and basal views is necessary. The nose then gets divided into thirds (i.e., upper, middle, and lower third), and each area analyzed individually for issues related to symmetry, width (e.g., wide nasal bones) contour irregularities (e.g., dorsal hump), tip shape (e.g., boxy, bulbous), tip location (e.g., low tip-defining point), projection, rotation (cephalad/caudad), length (short/long), columellar/alar relationships (e.g., hanging columella), as well as shape/size of the nostrils.

The surgeon should document the nasal skin thickness, as this has practical implications not only for surgery (e.g., thicker skin requires more extensive alteration of the underlying framework to maximize definition) but also for recovery (e.g., thicker skin is associated with prolonged postoperative edema).

Nasal palpation is mandatory to determine tip support, the integrity of the caudal septum, and the size and position of the nasal bones.

Lastly, the nasal cavity should be inspected to evaluate the septum, inferior turbinates, and nasal valves (external and internal), as deficits may dictate what type of surgical techniques are required (e.g., septoplasty, turbinate reduction, spreader grafts, etc.)
