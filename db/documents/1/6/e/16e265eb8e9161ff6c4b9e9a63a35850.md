Of all the paranasal sinuses, the ethmoid sinus is the most complex and most variable. The roof of the ethmoid bone labyrinth consists of the fovea ethmoidalis, and the olfactory fossae are grooves on the cribriform plate within the ethmoid bone.

The depth of the cribriform plate has also shown to be different in various ethnic groups. For instance, Meloni et al. found that the cribriform plate has an average depth of 5.9 mm among Italian subjects.

The uncinate process, which is the sickle-shaped portion of the ethmoid bone, also has multiple variations among different patients. Its superior attachment has three major variants

- The uncinate process could extend laterally to the lamina papyracea or ethmoid bulla to generate a nook at the end of the infundibulum; this is the most common variation found in patients.

- The uncinate process could extend medially to the lateral region of the middle turbinate, with the frontal recess going into the infundibulum.

- The uncinate process could extend medially and superiorly to the base of the skull, with the frontal recess going into the infundibulum.
