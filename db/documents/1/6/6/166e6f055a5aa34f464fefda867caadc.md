Hydroa vacciniforme lesions characteristically demonstrate intraepidermal spongiotic vesiculation containing fibrin and acute inflammatory cells, confluent epidermal and focal upper dermal necrosis, and prominent, reticular keratinocyte degeneration. Early lesions may have a variably dense lymphohistiocytic infiltrate admixed with neutrophils that are followed by neutrophilic invasion. The lymphoid infiltrate shows in-situ hybridization positivity for EBV RNA.
