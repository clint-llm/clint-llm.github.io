Symptoms of entropion can include foreign body sensation in the eye, eye pain, excessive tearing or epiphora, and blurred vision; patients with symptomatic entropion on clinical examination are candidates for entropion repair. Early entropion repair before developing clinical signs of corneal exposure or trauma will potentially prevent more serious sequelae, including irreversible vision loss. Those with reversible corneal changes, such as corneal abrasion, should undergo repair more urgently; reversible changes may progress to irreversible changes if left untreated.

Patients with early, reversible corneal damage should also be treated with temporizing measures while awaiting surgery to prevent further damage. These patients may benefit from increased ocular lubrication with ointments or artificial tears, botulinum toxin injection, tarsorrhaphy, or Quickert suturing.
