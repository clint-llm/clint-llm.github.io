Nifedipine is available in both immediate and extended-release preparations. Its initial marketing was in a short-acting, immediate-release formulation that required multiple daily dosing. These preparations caused rapid vasodilation followed by reflex sympathetic activation, resulting in side effects such as headaches, palpitations, and flushing. These side effects led to the launch of extended-release preparations, which have shown to have a sustained 24-hour anti-hypertensive effect and fewer side effects.

Extended-release preparations are available in 30, 60, and 90 mg tablets. Dosage adjustments should ideally occur at 7- to 14-day intervals. The same total daily dosage should apply when switching from immediate to extended-release preparations. Patients may take immediate-release formulations without regard to meals. A few specific extended-release preparations require ingestion on an empty stomach.

Immediate-release preparations have an onset of action within 20 minutes with a plasma half-life of about 4 to 7 hours. Extended-release preparations have an approximate duration of action of about 24 hours.  It undergoes hepatic metabolism via the CYP3A4 pathway. Extended-release preparations have a bioavailability of up to 89% relative to the immediate-release formulation. Bioavailability significantly increases in patients with liver failure necessitating dosage adjustment (due to reduced clearance of the medication).
