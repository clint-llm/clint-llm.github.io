Color fundus photo helps in documenting the fundus features, counseling the patients, and evaluating the progression of the disease and treatment response.

Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA)

The optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the macula in CRAO shows hyperreflectivity of inner retinal layers and retinal thickening. In lipid storage disorders, there is hyperreflectivity of the nerve fiber layer and the ganglion cell layer on OCT.

Autofluorescence may show hyper autofluorescence around the fovea in sialidosis.

In suspected lipid storage disorder, evaluation for enzyme deficiency and multisystem involvement is essential. In retinitis, evaluation includes tests forÂ immune status, neurological examination for some patients, and, if needed, vitreous or aqueous tap to look for various infectious etiologies.
