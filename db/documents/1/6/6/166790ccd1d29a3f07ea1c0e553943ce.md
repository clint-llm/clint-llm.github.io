The first-line treatment options for CIDP include corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), and plasma exchange (PLEX).

**Corticosteroids**

- The usual induction dose of prednisone is 60 to 100 mg per day. This can be tapered after steroid-sparing medications reach a steady state in patients/.

- Studies have shown no difference between high-dose monthly dexamethasone and daily oral prednisone.

- Corticosteroids are rather much cheaper and easier to use.

- Serious side effects of corticosteroids are hypertension, diabetes, moon facies, osteoporosis and fractures, myopathy, sleep and mood disturbances, cataract, skin and hair changes, immunosuppression, and risk of infections.

**IVIG**

- The ICE (Immune Globulin Intravenous for Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy) trial in 2008 was the largest reported study of CIDP treatment that showed the efficacy and the safety of IVIG as the initial and maintenance therapy for CIDP to prevent frequent relapses.

- The relapse rate with IVIG is reported at around 45%, whereas corticosteroids are around 50%.

- The median time to deterioration was delayed or slowed after chronic administration of corticosteroids and IVIG.

- Dosing: IVIG is administered as an initial induction dose of 2 g/kg over 2 to 5 days, followed by a maintenance dose of 0.4 g/kg (0.2 to 1 g/kg) every 3 to 4 weeks.

- More recently, the PATH study reported the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous IG for maintenance therapy of CIDP given for 24 weeks. The study showed equal efficacy with fewer generalized side effects as compared to IVIG.

- Some adverse effects of IVIG are infusion reactions, fever, chills, hypotension, thrombotic events, and aseptic meningitis.

**Plasma Exchange**

- Plasma exchange is typically used in severe cases or if patients do not respond to corticosteroids and IVIG.

**Steroid Sparing Agents for Maintenance Therapy**

- There is no clinical guideline about the duration of maintenance therapy. Maintenance therapy is usually given for about six months based on the clinical response and relapses.

- Patients requiring chronic therapies with high risks of developing serious adverse effects from corticosteroids or IVIG can be switched to other immunosuppressive agents such as methotrexate, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, and mycophenolate. There are no major randomized trials for most of these therapies; however, they have shown benefits in smaller case studies or anecdotal reports.

- Azathioprine (2 mg/kg) offers unclear benefits. Methotrexate (15 mg weekly) has no benefit. Rather can cause serious adverse effects compared to placebo.

- Mycophenolate mofetil has been used alone or in combination with prednisone to treat various autoimmune conditions, including CIDP. Like Azathioprine, it can cause bone marrow suppression and is contraindicated in pregnant females.

- Approximately 25% of patients are refractory to first-line treatment. These patients require further investigations to evaluate for CIDP variants or other causes of acquired demyelinating chronic neuropathies. In such cases, targeted therapies such as rituximab and alemtuzumab can be used.
