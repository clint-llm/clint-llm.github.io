Nursing care is crucial to monitoring or evidence of surgical complications postoperatively.Â Nursing staff should understand the complications, including anastomotic leaks, hemorrhage, and bowel obstruction. The surgical team should be notified of any persistent tachycardia, sudden onset of abdominal or left shoulder pain, fever, and decreased urine output because these can be suggestive of a leak. Severe abdominal pain, distension, and vomiting could be symptoms of a bowel obstruction.
