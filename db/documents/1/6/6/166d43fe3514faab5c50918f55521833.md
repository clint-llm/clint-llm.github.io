Etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor, was first synthesized in 1966 and then approved in 1983 by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for cancer therapy.Podophyllum peltatum, and the Indian speciesÂ Podophyllum emodi.

Etoposide has proven effective when administered through multiple dosings over three to five consecutive days rather than a single weekly dose.

Etoposide is also one of the most active chemotherapeutic drugs for other cancers, such as refractory pediatric neoplasms, hepatocellular carcinomas, acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), prostatic carcinomas, ovarian carcinomas, and non-small cell lung cancer.

Etoposide is inactive against malignant melanoma, colorectal cancer, and cancer of the head and neck.
