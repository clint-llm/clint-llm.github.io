In recent years, the incidence of prostate cancer has been the highest ever recorded due to earlier and more accurate detection and an increase in the average lifetime. Prostate cancer is now the second most common malignancy amongst all cancers in men and the fourth most common overall.

The American Cancer Society has identified prostate cancer as the second leading cause of mortality from oncological causes in the United States, accounting for an estimated 268,490 newly diagnosed cases and 34,500 deaths in 2022. The National Cancer Institute predicts that the average American man has an 11% risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point in life and a 2.5% overall risk of dying from the disease.

Globally, there were more than 1.4 million new cases of prostate cancer diagnosed worldwide in 2020, accounting for 375,304 deaths.

Timely diagnosis leading to earlier and more effective treatment is required to reduce the significant morbidity and mortality rates. Nuclear medicine has several new and revolutionary prostate cancer detection, localization, staging, and treatment toolsÂ utilizing targeted therapy.
