The external carotid artery usually gives off three anterior branches. From inferior to superior, they are the superior thyroid artery, the lingual artery, and the facial artery.

The superior thyroid artery travels inferiorly to the thyroid gland and gives off the sternomastoid artery. Occasionally, the sternomastoid artery will arise directly from the external carotid artery.

The facial artery normally exits the external carotid artery above the greater horn of the hyoid and travels superiorly behind the submandibular gland. Once it reaches the stylohyoid muscle, it turns medially and courses towards the angle of the mouth and medial canthus. In 10% of people, the facial artery is hypoplastic and does not travel to the angle of the mouth. In 1% of people, it fails to reach the face completely.
