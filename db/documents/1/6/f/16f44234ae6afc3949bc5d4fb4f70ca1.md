Pulmonary papillomas are benign papillary tumors characterized by a fibrovascular core covered by an epithelium. These tumors are usually unique and rarely multiple. They can be proximal or peripheral. Many mimickers may be suspected due to their radiologic appearance but microscopic examination is the basis of making a confirmed diagnosis. Pulmonary papillomas consistÂ of mainly 3 subtypes:

- Squamous cell papillomas

- Glandular papillomas

- Mixed papillomas

These tumors have a good prognosis with no recurrences in case of complete resection. Malignant transformation is rare and can be only observed in squamous cell papilloma.
