There is a growing anti-vaccination movement that has resulted in the resurgence of diseases that were previously near-eradication. This movement is based on a paper published by Andrew Wakefield and his colleagues in 1998, which correlated MMR vaccination with the development of autism.

Consequently, many women of child-bearing age are currently unvaccinated and at increased risk for antepartum infections.Â Screening for vaccination concerns at appointments can help identify at-risk individuals.

HIV, HSV, and CMV can be vertically transmitted through breast milk.

Medical providers should help mothers weigh the risk of CMV transmission versus the benefits of breastfeeding in these cases. Freezing and pasteurization of breast milk can decrease the risk of transmission in these cases.

Pregnant women should also be instructed to avoid travel to locations where HEV and Zika virus are endemic and to avoid high-risk behaviors that increase the risk of contracting syphilis, HIV, HSV, HBV, and HCV.
