an interprofessional approach at the initial evaluation of patients with GLPLS is the key to providing optimal care and improved outcomes. Multiple medical specialties can assist in the diagnostic and long-term care processes including dermatologists, dermatopathologists, pharmacists, hair-loss support groups, and psychologists.  Satisfactory diagnosis is of utmost importance followed by psycho-social assistance from trained professionals and alopecia support groups. Support groups of patients with alopecia can lead to increased feelings of belonging and reduce psycho-social stress associated with the diagnosis of GLPLS.
