Stunning of the myocardium can coexist with other severe cardiac diseases such as coronary artery diseases and ischemic heart diseases. Similarly, occasionally myocardium can be stunned in patients with a neurological condition such as subarachnoid hemorrhage and people undergoing dialysis. There is no treatment for stunned myocardium. Therefore, patients diagnosed with stunned myocardium or at risk for developing the disease should be made aware of the underlying medical conditions and managed accordingly.
