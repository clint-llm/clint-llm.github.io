Klaus Conrad appropriated five stages involved in the progression of delusions, consisting of, in sequence, trema, apophany, anastrophe, consolidation, and residuum. Trema represents the manifestation of a 'delusional mood', resulting in distorted perceptions. Next, the stage of apophany symbolizes the designation of new meanings for psychological events. This is subsequently followed by anastrophe, which is the heightening of the psychosis. The penultimate phase, consolidation, concludes in a new psychological reality or  'delusional state', ultimately leading to residuum, which is the new baseline 'autistic state'.
