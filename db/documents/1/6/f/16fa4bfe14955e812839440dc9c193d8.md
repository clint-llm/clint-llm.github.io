The etiology of infectious scleritis can be primary or secondary. Primary scleritis occurs following an accidental or surgical injury (58.5 to 88%).

A cosmetic ocular-whitening procedure, popularized in South Korea, has also been noted to lead to infectious scleritis. The procedure involves the removal of pinguecula or pterygium and is followed by an amniotic membrane graft. One severe post-procedural complication is a scleral melt, which puts the patient at high risk for infectious scleritis.
