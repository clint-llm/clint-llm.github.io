Patients with lacunar infarctions must be managed by a neurologist, family clinicians, nursing staff, and physical, occupational, and social therapists, all operating as an interprofessional team, to receive comprehensive care. Physical deficits like ataxia and motor hemiparesis are managed with physical therapy, while muscle relaxants like baclofen and tizanidine can be used for spasticity. Pharmacists remain crucial in patients receiving multiple medications to check drug interactions. Rehabilitation therapy must be continued to maximize the patient’s neurologic function to bring them close to their baseline before the infarction. All interprofessional team members must maintain open communication lines with each other and maintain accurate and updated patient records to serve as an accurate information source for everyone involved in care. This interprofessional approach to care will result in the best possible patient outcomes. [Level 5]

Long-term care coordination is the responsibility of the primary care provider. Emphasis on managing stroke risk factors includes intense antihypertensive therapy, lipid management, and strict control of blood sugars after the lacunar ischemic event.
