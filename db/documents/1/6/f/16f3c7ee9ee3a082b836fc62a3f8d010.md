The standard treatment of acute ON was oral corticosteroids when the collaborative, multicenter Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT)

Most subjects in each cohort recovered visual function in the first 1 to 3 months. Visual improvement occurred more rapidly in subjects treated with intravenous methylprednisolone, but there was no difference in the cohorts receiving oral corticosteroids and placebo. Visual acuity did not fully return in many subjects with initial visual acuities of 20/200 or worse. Visual outcomes at six months were similar in all cohorts but optic neuritis recurred twice as often in subjects who received prednisone.

At one year there were no differences in visual function (acuity, visual field, color discrimination, and contrast sensitivity) between subjects who received placebo and corticosteroids (VA of 20/40 or better: placebo (95%), intravenous methylprednisolone (94%), and oral prednisone (91%)

Diagnostic and treatment guidelines of ON have evolved over time
