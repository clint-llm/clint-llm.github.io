Children with alimentary tract duplications require the involvement of multiple disciplines for its optimal management. A radiologist is involved in the multidisciplinary team right from the antenatal diagnosis of a duplication cyst. The involvement of a gynecologist and fetal surgeon is necessary in case fetal intervention is required due to severe polyhydramnios and hydrops. The radiologist also needs to be consulted for cysts presenting in the postnatal period. A primary clinician or neonatologist plays a crucial role in the preoperative management of the child. A pediatric surgeon needs to be consulted for the surgical management of the child. The involvement of a neurosurgeon is also crucial in cases requiring the management of cysts with intraspinal extension.
