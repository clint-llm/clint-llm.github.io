Routine newborn care is essential to aid babies in the transition period right after birth. While most babies are born with minimal difficulties requiring little or no support, a small number of them necessitate someÂ intervention at the time of delivery. Having an interprofessional team that consists of a pediatrician, primary care provider, labor and delivery nurse, and an obstetrician can help identify infants in need of resuscitation.
