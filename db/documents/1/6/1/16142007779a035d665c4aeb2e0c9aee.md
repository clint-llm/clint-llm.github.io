To the best of our knowledge, and since publication from the Institute of Medicine in 2000, there is no evidence to suggest any relationship between silicone and systemic diseases of the whole body. Despite continued research, there is no new evidence to suggest otherwise. It is also important to understand that implants do not last forever and that having an augmentation will require more surgery in the future to maintain results or to deal with complications such as contracture or malposition of the implant. More recently, women have been claiming breast implant illness (BII), motivating them to have "en block" removals. Still, there remains no evidence that there is an identifiable link between implants and BII, except for these anecdotal reports.
