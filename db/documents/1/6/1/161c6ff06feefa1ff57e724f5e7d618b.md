Chest x-ray: in children, 90% are visible on the first chest x-ray after pneumonia. Radiologic evidence, most of the time, occurs on the fifth to the sixth day of hospitalization.

Chest x-ray has a low sensitivity of 24% in diagnosing traumatic pneumatoceles, especially if they are obtained in the supine position and if the lesion is smaller than 2 cm. The diagnostic accuracy of chest radiography ranges from 24% to 50%. Serial chest x-rays taken over several days can be useful to differentiate. The majority of traumatic pneumatocele are found on lower lobes.

The typical radiographic presentation of traumatic pneumatocele is a round or oval shadow usually surrounded by pulmonary contusion. Air-fluid levels are often present and thought to be related to bleeding into the pneumatocele.

CT scan:  CT is much more accurate, with a reported sensitivity of 96%. The thoracic CT scan more precisely defines the location and size of the cyst and provides early detection and differential diagnosis.

In terms of sensitivity evaluated in a study, computed tomography (CT) is superior to radiography in the diagnosis pneumatocele ( 20% vs. 100%).

The main advantages of CT include:

- earlier identification

- visualization of small lesions

- the ability to identify pneumatocele in the presence of pulmonary contusion.

The typical appearance of traumatic pneumatocele on CT is a round or oval thin-walled cavitary lesion with air-fluid levels. More recent studies report an incidence of up to 10%, unlike 3% in comparison to studies prior to 2003. This is attributed to more widespread diagnostic use of CT rather than an increasing occurrence of pneumatoceles.

Lung ultrasound, in combination with chest x-ray, has been found useful in the pediatric population in 2 case reports.

The size of traumatic pseudocysts reported in the literature ranges from 1 to 14 centimeters in diameter  Relationships between the size of the lesion and severity of the inciting chest trauma are unclear. Large pseudocysts occurred more frequently in patients with multiple injuries, bilateral pulmonary contusions, or significant respiratory involvement. The risk of developing complications may be higher in patients with large pneumatoceles, posing more risk and complications.

Due to changes in size, shape, and composition of pneumatoceles within days following trauma, serial imaging studies may help differentiate pneumatocele from other lesions.
