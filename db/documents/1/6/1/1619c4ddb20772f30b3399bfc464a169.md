Chloroprocaine is an ester class local anesthetic with labeled indications to provide anesthesia through infiltration, peripheral nerve, epidural, and caudal block. Due to its low potential for systemic toxicity, chloroprocaine has been used to identify inadvertent intravascular epidural catheter insertion in pregnant and non-pregnant adults.

The most common application for chloroprocaine is the obstetric setting, where it is used to provide fast onset epidural anesthesia when urgent or emergent cesarean delivery is indicated.

Reports of adhesive arachnoiditis, cauda equina syndrome, anterior spinal artery syndrome, and other non-specified forms of permanent neurologic injury after intrathecal chloroprocaine administration were reported in the 1980s.
