Any clinician (MD, DO, PA, NP)Â should consult with a cardiologist before starting a patient on amiodarone. The drug has many serious side effects, and there is also the potential for interacting adversely with other medications. Patients receiving amiodarone should chronically have baseline testing done to facilitate future monitoring of hepatic, thyroid, pulmonary, and ophthalmologic toxicity. Patients on warfarin will also need close monitoring of their INR. The provider and pharmacist should perform thorough medication reconciliation and consult point-of-care medical resources for potential drug interactions that may require dosage adjustment.

Drug interactions with amiodarone may include but are not limited to digoxin, procainamide, diltiazem, verapamil, beta-blockers, phenytoin, warfarin, and statins. It is also wise to include a cardiology board-certified pharmacist when starting amiodarone therapy to verify therapeutic appropriateness, dosing, and drug interactions. Nursing staff with cardiology specialty training should also be aware of amiodarone side effects and assist in evaluating patient adherence and therapeutic effectiveness. All providers, including clinicians, specialists, nursing, and pharmacy, must operate as an interprofessional team when considering amiodarone therapy so that the drug can provide maximum benefit with minimal adverse events.
