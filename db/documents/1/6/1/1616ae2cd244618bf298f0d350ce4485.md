The normal function of the heart is to create forward blood flow. During each cardiac cycle, blood is pushed from the atria to the ventricles passing through the atrioventricular valves. Central venous pressure is measured in the right atrium. The bedside clinician can directly assess the jugular venous pulse by observing the patients neck. When obtaining a central or jugular venous pressure curve, its course can be described as 3 positive and 2 negative deflections.

- Atrial contraction (A wave)

- Ventricular contraction (C wave)

- Venous passive filling of the right atrium (V wave)

The negative deflections are:

- Atrial relaxation (X wave)

- Emptying of the right atrium (Y wave)

A proper heart function requires a synchronized action of the myocardium. When the cardiac rhythm is disturbed, the heart cannot provide proper blood flow. Cannon A waves are an example of this. Electrical disturbances cause mechanical problems causing atrial contraction to occur when the tricuspid valve is closed. The reflection of the pressure wave travels up the venous system and can be examined in the jugular vein as exaggerated A wave pulsation.

A Wave in JVP is an expression of normal atrial contraction. In opposition to Canon A waves, missing A waves might indicate atrial standstill as seen in atrial fibrillation.
