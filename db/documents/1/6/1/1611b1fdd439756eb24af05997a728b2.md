Vulvodynia is a vulvar pain of at least three months' duration without a clear, identifiable cause. It may be generalized or localized with respect to location. It may always occur spontaneously or have to be provoked. It could occur throughout a patient's life or just with a new partner (primary or secondary) and/or it can be intermittent, persistent, constant, immediate, or delayed in timing.

Other diagnoses must be ruled out, such as:

- Infections: vulvovaginal candidiasis, trichomoniasis, and genital herpes

- Inflammation: lichen sclerosis, lichen planus, contact dermatitis, lichen simplex

- Neoplastic disorders: squamous cell carcinoma

- Neurologic disorders: pudendal, genitofemoral and/or ilioinguinal nerve injury, nerveÂ entrapment, neuropathy, Tarlov cysts

- Vulva trauma, leading to pain: straddle injuries, female genital cutting, motor vehicle accidents

- Estrogen deficiencies

- Iatrogenic causes
