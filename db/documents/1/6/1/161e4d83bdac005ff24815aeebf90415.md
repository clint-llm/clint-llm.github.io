**Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) of the Upper Extremity**

This can be secondary to thromboembolism, arteritis, or fibrodysplasia. It can present with exercise-induced pain, pain at rest, or digit ulceration. Sometimes, asymmetric arm blood pressures are the only finding. It can be differentiated from SSS due to the absence of neurological manifestations in the former.

**Posterior Circulation Stroke**

This can present with neurological manifestations like syncope, dizziness, blurring of vision, or ataxia. MR angiography or CT angiography can help in differentiating it from subclavian steal syndrome.

**Aortic Stenosis**

In a patient presenting with syncope, though SSS merit considered in the differentials, it is essential to rule out cardiac causes, including aortic stenosis. An ejection systolic murmur in the aortic area on examination can be suggestive. An echocardiogram is definitive in diagnosing aortic stenosis.

**Diabetic Neuropathy**

The presence of 'glove and stock' pattern of symptoms suggest peripheral neuropathy. Electromyography may help in diagnosing peripheral neuropathy and thereby distinguishing it from SSS.
