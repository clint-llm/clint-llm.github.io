The peripheral nervous systemÂ arises from neuroepithelial cells. These neuroepithelial cells migrate from the pia mater to the periphery, differentiating into neurons, glioblasts, and ependymal cells. These cells facilitate the growth of structures such as the lumbar plexus and the eventual obturator nerve.
