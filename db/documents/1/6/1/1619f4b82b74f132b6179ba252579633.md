Water is essential for the maintenance of life. As the major element of fluid compartments in the body, water makes up approximately 60% of body weight. Gender, age, physical activity, and adiposity are pertinent factors that may alter this percentage.

The body uses water for a variety of mechanisms from transporting nutrients to excreting wastes and tissue structure viability. Water balance occurs by matching the daily water input/output to and from the body. The primary means of water intake is by consumption of food and fluids. Daily fluid maintenance requirements for adults are approximately 1.5 to 2.5L of water.

During the perioperative period, the goals of fluid management are to provide a suitable volume of parenteral fluid to support cardiac preload, intravascular volume, oxygen carrying capacity, and electrolyte balance. Additionally, parenteral fluid replenishment focuses on equipping the body with enough fluid to meet both insensible and sensible physiologic losses. Maintenance fluid rate replacement is calculated by using the “4-2-1” rule, which came from the 1950s work published in Pediatrics.
