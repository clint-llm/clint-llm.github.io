The mainstay of the prevention of odontogenic and orofacial infections is proper dental hygiene.

SinceÂ dental hygiene is of critical importance, discussion of poor dental habits is appropriate. These include consumption of highly acidic or sweet foods, consumption of tobacco products, consumption of alcohol, and tooth grinding (particularly bruxism). Secondary prevention is performed exclusively by dental hygienists and dentists with plaque removal and prompt recognition and treatment of dental caries.
