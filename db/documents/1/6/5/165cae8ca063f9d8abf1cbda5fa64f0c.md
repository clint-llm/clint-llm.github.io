The study of cells and tissue (histochemistry) and intracellular activities (cytochemistry) is useful for narrowing down the correct diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry uses antibodies to target specific antigens in a specimen. The antibody-antigen complex can then be stained to appreciate the presence of the particular antigen. This test can aid in the diagnosis of acute allograft rejection, amyloidosis, neoplasms, and cardiomyopathy. T-lymphocytes, seen in myocarditis, can also be identified with the help of immunohistochemistry. Immunofluorescence is very similar to immunohistochemistry. However, the antibodies contain a fluorescent dye which is visible when the antibody is attached to an antigen.  Immunofluorescence can assist with the diagnosis of allograft rejection and certain cardiomyopathies.

Special stains highlight specific components in a specimen that might be difficult to visualize using hematoxylin and eosin. The Congo red and methyl violet stains are useful to detect amyloid deposits in tissue. In myocarditis or allograft rejection, methyl green-pyronine stain can spot if lymphocytes. Masson's elastic trichrome stains connective tissue, such as elastic fiber and collagen. In patients with iron-overload cardiomyopathy, possibly due to hemochromatosis, any iron deposition in the tissue can be stained using the Prussian blue stain.
