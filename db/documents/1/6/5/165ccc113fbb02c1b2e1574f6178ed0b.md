There are not many natural physiological variations in spleens. Some common variations which do exist naturally are in relation to organ size, with differences being minimal. Nevertheless, congenital abnormalities of the spleen do exist and include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Shape (lobulations, notches, and clefts)

- Accessory spleen

- Wandering/displaced spleen

- Polysplenia (Chaudhry's disease)
