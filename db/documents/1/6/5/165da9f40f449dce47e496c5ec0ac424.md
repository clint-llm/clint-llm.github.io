Multiple mechanisms have been proposed as the etiology of lacunar infarction. The usual etiology of small lacunar infarctions (between 3 mm and 7 mm) is lipohyalinosis of the small perforating arteries feeding deep subcortical structures. Another mechanism is micro-atheroma formation at the origin of penetrating arteries from major cerebral arteries like the middle cerebral artery, Circle of Willis, or the distal basilar artery. These first two mechanisms are proven pathologically and likely due to chronic hypertension and resulting in small vessel disease.

If the size of the lacune is larger than 5 to 7 mm, it is often not caused by occlusion of 1 or 2 lenticulostriate arterial branches but from an atherothrombotic lesion involving the mainstem middle cerebral artery. These infarcts are named striatocapsular infarcts by Bladin and Berkovic.

Other proposed mechanisms that have failed to be proven pathologically include tiny emboli causing obstruction and cerebral arteriolar and capillary endothelial dysfunction leading to small vessel disease as a result of the extravasation of blood products.

Out of all the causes of Lacunar strokes, hypertension is the most common modifiable risk factor for stroke. For every 10 mmHg decrease in blood pressure, there is a 1/3rd lowering of stroke risk in primary prevention. So it is extremely important to control blood pressure effectively to prevent future strokes. Cigarette smoking doubles stroke risk.
