The lifespan of a Kupffer cell is estimated to be 3.8 days.

The phagocytic ability of the Kupffer cells is vast; they can engulf pathogens, immune complexes, liposomes, lipid microspheres, tumor cells, endotoxins, and various other particles. Kupffer cells are also known to be heterogeneous in function based on their location. In zone 1 (periportal) of the liver lobules, they have higher activity overall than their counterpart in zone 3 (centrilobular).
