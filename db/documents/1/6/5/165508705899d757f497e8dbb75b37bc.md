Knowledge and understanding of ultrasound physics and familiarity with the echocardiography machine and its controls are paramount to obtain useful TEE imaging, decrease artifacts, and to prevent misdiagnosis. Equipment required for a transesophageal echocardiography exam includes both an echocardiography machine and an appropriate transducer, as well as a method to archive and store, completed examinations.  The multiplane (meaning that its imaging angle can be adjusted from zero to one-hundred eighty degrees) TEE probe has a connector that can be attached to the ultrasound machine, 2 dials that control side-to-side and forward and backward movement of the tip, and an ultrasonic transducer at the end. The transducer contains ceramic lead zirconate titanate and consists of a phased array of piezoelectric crystals which both send and receive ultrasound waves. The transducer and probe may be 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional and contain a dramatically increased number of crystals. During an exam, the transducer will lie in contact with the esophagus or stomach and generate sound waves which will be attenuated, refracted, scattered, or reflected back from certain cardiac structures. In echocardiography, ultrasound with frequencies of 2 to 10 MHz is utilized. This is significantly higher than sound in the audible range (the upper limit of which is approximately 20,000 Hz). The piezoelectric crystals will then convert the reflected sound into electric pulses which allow the creation of an image of the heart or other structure on display.

One end of the TEE probe is a connector that is plugged and locked into the echocardiography machine. The handle of the probe has two control wheels and image array rotation buttons. The wheels control the side-to-side and front-to-back movement of the articulating end of the probe. The handle also contains a lock which allows the user to lock the probe in a certain configuration that is initially set by the control wheels.  In addition to the movement controlled by the wheels, the probe can be inserted or withdrawn and can be twisted to the left or right. The buttons allow the piezoelectric crystals to be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise from zero to one-hundred eighty degrees. Adult TEE probes are very similar but larger than a standard gastroscope. Pediatric TEE probes are a considerably smaller diameter, higher frequency, and have more flexibility in the shaft.

The keyboard and control panel of the echocardiography machine contains a plethora of options for adjustment and acquisition of the probe, display, and acquisition of the image. Some of these include a system gain setting, time gain compensation, compression, image depth and width, B-mode, color Doppler, pulse wave Doppler, continuous wave Doppler, power output, image freeze, and image store or acquire.
