Clinical features of food protein intolerance involve a spectrum of organ systems and vary among different disorders. However, patients mostly present with gastrointestinal manifestations. In non-immunological food protein intolerances, the amount of food ingested tends to be more directly related to the severity of symptoms. Excessive intestinal gas, bloating, abdominal pain, and diarrhea are common presenting symptoms. Whereas, in immunological food protein allergies, even trace amounts of the sensitized food protein can trigger an explosive reaction and may involve the skin and blood vessels. The IgE-mediated reactions occur within minutes to an hour of food protein ingestion, and symptoms range from skin rashes, urticaria, angioedema, wheezing, to anaphylaxis, whereas non-IgE mediated reactions may occur in hours to days.

A typical presentation in infants can be seen as an infant younger than 6 months of age developing diarrhea, and in due course, vomiting after being fed with formula milk for a few weeks. Food-induced proctocolitis syndrome is a common condition where healthy infants present with diarrhea but do not lose weight. Whereas, in cases of FPIES, the infant can become dehydrated and lose weight.

Here are some of the symptoms and physical findings that are seen among different disorders of protein intolerance:

Oral allergy syndrome: The reaction mainly arises due to cross-reactivity between pollen and plant-derived food (fruits and vegetables), and the symptoms are localized to the mucous membrane within the oral cavity.

Immediate GI hypersensitivity: Patients develop nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting within 1 to 2 hours of sensitized food protein ingestion, often followed by diarrhea. The affected individuals have intermittent abdominal pain, poor appetite, and poor weight gain.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE): Patients present with difficulty in swallowing, solid food impaction, abdominal pains, regurgitation or vomiting, and decreased appetite. Younger children may present with feeding difficulties and poor weight gain. The symptoms frequently overlap and are often confused with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, patients with EoE are often found to have a history of other autoimmune and allergic conditions as well.

Eosinophilic gastritis: They usually present with features of gastritis, such as abdominal pain, postprandial vomiting, early satiety, anorexia, and failure to thrive. The disease is very responsive to dietary restriction therapies in children. Approximately 50% of these patients have atopic features as well.

Eosinophilic gastroenteritis: It is an uncommon disorder with a chronic relapsing course characterized by infiltration of eosinophils in the mucosa of the GI tract. The presentation may vary. Pediatric patients can present with failure to thrive, growth retardation, delayed puberty, or amenorrhea. Frequently, the adults present with abdominal pain, dysphagia, or diarrhea. They may also present with features of protein-losing enteropathy, GI bleeding, or malabsorption.

Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES): The patients can present with vomiting one to three hours after feeding. They may also have abdominal distention, bloody diarrhea, anemia, and weight loss, and are commonly provoked by cow’s milk or soy protein-based formulas. On physical examination, signs of dehydration may be evident. There is an absence of respiratory symptoms or the classic IgE-mediated allergic skin reactions.

Food protein-induced enteropathy: Patients with food protein-induced enteropathy present with steatorrhea and failure to thrive in the early few months of life.

Food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis: It is commonly seen in healthy breast-fed infants. They develop symptoms of blood-streaked stools in the first few months of life.

Celiac disease: Patients with celiac disease commonly present with diarrhea, foul-smelling stool, steatorrhea, borborygmi, flatulence, and loss of weight. Patients complain of weakness and fatigue, usually related to poor nutrition. Signs of anemia may be evident. Dermatitis herpetiformis, a pruritic papulovesicular rash involving the extensor surfaces of the extremities, trunk, and buttocks, may be noted.

Enterokinase deficiency: Infants with this enzyme deficiency develop diarrhea from birth and fail to thrive. With the chronic malabsorption of protein, they are prone to develop hypoproteinemic edema. Oral administration of pancreatic extract results in expeditious control of symptoms and helps with growth acceleration.

Inborn errors of metabolism: These disorders result in an accumulation of metabolites upstream of the defective enzyme (amino acids and/or ammonia), causing intoxication. The symptoms vary according to the enzymes affected.

Toxic reactions to biogenic amines: Ingestion of some biogenic amines contribute to toxic reactions. Patients may present with headache, palpitations, vomiting, diarrhea, and allergy. Consuming aged cheese containing tyramine in conjunction with the use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) is found to cause headaches and hypertensive crisis.Scombridae and Scomberesocidae families (tuna, mackerel, bonito, bluefish, etc.) containing high levels of histamine.

Dermatological manifestations:

Protein intolerance is frequently associated with dermatologic atopic conditions. A study done in Italy showed 71% of the children with concomitant cow’s milk allergy to have a comorbid atopic dermatitis.
