The most common adverse reaction associated with WALANT is fainting secondary to a vasovagal response.

A common myth associated with WALANT is that there is a high risk of digital ischemia with epinephrine use. This concern originated from a study using procaine-epinephrine instead of lidocaine for analgesia. Procaine has a higher incidence of digital ischemia due to its significantly lower pH than lidocaine or bupivacaine.

Epinephrine-induced cardiac ischemia is a rare complication of WALANT.
