Identifying, treating, and managing the underlying etiology, in addition to careful treatment of hypertension, is crucial for the management of PRES. There is no specific, established antihypertensive regimen for the treatment of acute hypertension in people with PRES.

Sometimes individuals with PRES develop life-threatening complications, such as status epilepticus or coma, and treatment and management of such complications at an intensive care unit (ICU) should follow.

If PRES is attributed to an immunosuppressant, reduction of the dose or substitution of the agent is recommended.
