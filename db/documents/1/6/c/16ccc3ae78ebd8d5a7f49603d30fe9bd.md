A weighted speculum is placed in the vagina; a right angle retractor is used to visualize the cervix; the anterior lip of the cervix is then grasped with a tenaculum. If stay sutures are used, they are placed at the three o'clock and nine o’clock position at the cervicovaginal junction. Current literature does not show a decrease in bleeding or hemorrhage, so it is a surgeon’s preference. Typically, 10 cc to 15 cc of dilute vasopressin is injected into the cervix at 2 o'clock, 4 o'clock, 8 o'clock, and 10 o’clock. Blanching will be seen. An angled blade is used to cut the cervix starting at two o’clock outside the transformation zone. A jigsaw cutting technique is performed circumferentially to include the lesion and the transformation zone.  Toothed forceps or an Allis clamp can be used to provide counter traction and elevate the cone bed, take caution not to damage the epithelium. The angled blade creates the cone specimen, and after circumferential excision, the base of the cone is excised with Mayo scissors. The residual endocervical canal is curettage with a Kevorkian curette and specimen captured on a Telfa pad. Then, hemostasis is obtained with Bovie cautery at 40 W ball electrode,
