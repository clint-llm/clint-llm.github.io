Recurrence can be very high if the underlying cause of the cyst is not addressed. Corticosteroid injections into digital mucous cysts can cause further issues with soft tissue coverage in this area by further thinning the skin. DIP joint arthrodesis is the only way to obtain theÂ lowest likelihood of recurrence. It is important to remember the anatomy in the area in regards to the location of the terminal end of the extensor tendon and the germinal matrix when performing a dissection of the area to help minimize complications. When performing a surgical intervention, it is important to assess the skin preoperatively and to be prepared to perform a flap for coverage should the skin be found to be too thin at the end of the procedure.
