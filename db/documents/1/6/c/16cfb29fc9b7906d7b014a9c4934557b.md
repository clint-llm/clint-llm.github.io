The sural arteries (or twin arteries) are collateral arteries of the popliteal artery (which derive from the femoral artery). The sural arteries originate at the level of the popliteal fossa and nourish the twin muscles and the soleus. The fibular circumflex artery, derived from the collateral branches of the posterior tibial artery (which derives from the popliteal artery), nourishes someÂ deep muscles, including the soleus.

The lymphatic vessels of the lower limb are divided into superficial and deep. The superficial vessels originate from the integuments, run subcutaneously, and are grouped into medial, lateral, and superficial gluteal collectors, which then flow into the superficial inguinal lymphatic grouping. The deep vessels originate from the bones, muscles, and joints to become satellites of the deep vessels, ending in the deep inguinal lymph nodes. The lumbar lymph nodes left, and right are the efferent vessels of the lateral aortic group of lumboaortic lymph nodes. They drain the sub-umbilical region of the abdominal wall, the pelvic wall, the perineal wall, the lower limb, and the vascularized territory from the splanchnic branches of the aorta.
