Ampicillin is a medication used to manage and treat certain bacterial infections. It is in the penicillin class of medications. Ampicillin was developed to overcome the issue of drug resistance and extend the antimicrobial coverage of penicillins. It is also resistant to acid so it can be administered orally. This activity outlines the indications, action, and contraindications for ampicillin as a valuable agent in treating certain bacterial infections like those from E. coli, S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, etc. In addition, this activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, and relevant interactions pertinent for interprofessional team members in treating patients with infections caused by susceptible bacteria.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for the use of ampicillin.
- Describe the mechanism of action of ampicillin.
- Review the adverse effects associated with the use of ampicillin.
- Outline the role of interprofessional coordination in restricting unwarranted use of ampicillin and other antimicrobials.
