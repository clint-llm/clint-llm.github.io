Spasticity, which is sometimes referred to as tightness or stiffness, is a motor disorder marked by a velocity-dependent increase in muscle tone or tonic stretch reflexes associated with hypertonia. The presentation of spasticity is variable. In some cases, manifestations are subtle, and in others, muscle tone is increased to the point that joints become immobilized. This activity describes the evaluation and management of spasticity and highlights the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiologic basis of spasticity.

- Identify the causes of spasticity. 
- Explain treatment considerations for spasticity. 
- Describe how enhanced coordination of the interprofessional team can lead to more rapid recognition of spasticity and subsequently improve its evaluation, enhancing detection of pathology and allowing for treatment when indicated.
