Due to the poor systemic absorption of dornase alfa, there is no required hepatic or renal monitoring; however, it is essential to follow up with the patients for any side effects and ensure administration of the proper dose.

Additionally, a preliminary study done by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in 2013 focused on improving the FEV1 patients with CF. They provided strict guidelines for using dornase alfa and hypertonic saline for patients older than six years of age and prescribing inhaled tobramycin and oral azithromycin in patients older than six years of age with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. They monitored the adherence to the guidelines every quarter for one year.Â It was demonstrated that adherence to the guidelines by clinicians increased the FEV1 in patients with CF.
