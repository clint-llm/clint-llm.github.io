Fecal incontinence is a highly prevalent problem resulting in an inability to control the discharge of bowel contents. Its severity can range from the involuntary passage of flatus to the involuntary evacuation of fecal matter. There are many etiologies that result in fecal incontinence, and many of them are treatable. A proper history and physical exam and appropriately guided investigations often identify easily correctable causes of fecal incontinence.
