Patients who develop barotrauma secondary to mechanical ventilation also end up staying in the ICU and on mechanical ventilation for a more extended period. Prolonged time on mechanical ventilation may result in further complications secondary to barotrauma as well as others, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, delirium, intensive care acquired weakness, and nosocomial infections.
