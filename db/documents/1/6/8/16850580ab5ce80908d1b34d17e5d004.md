Hydrogen sulfide toxicity can be difficult to diagnose as it is a colorless gas with a rapidly desensitizing scent. Symptoms can overlap with other toxic gaseous exposures. It is important that first-responders obtain a thorough history so as to clue providers into the likely diagnosis upon arrival to the emergency department. Once the patient arrives, an astute provider will look for keys to diagnosis such as the location of toxicity, work environment, the possible scent of rotten egg, and assess these clues in conjunction with patient symptoms and signs.

It is imperative the patient is decontaminated so as not to affect other staff, and treatment should begin promptly as hydrogen sulfide toxicity can be rapidly decompensating and ultimately ensue in death. The poison control center should be notified immediately for greater expertise in diagnosing and treating this rare condition.
