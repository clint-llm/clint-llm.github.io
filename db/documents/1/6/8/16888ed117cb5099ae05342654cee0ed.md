Prognosis following a pinworm infection is excellent. Patients are recommended to follow up with their physicians after completion of the treatment to make sure they do not have any reinfection. Is symptoms recurÂ then testing and treatment as above should be re-initiated.

Ectopic pinworm infections have been described in many organs including the vagina, inguinal area, genitals, peritoneum, liver, oral cavity, lungs, and pelvis. There are even reported cases of appendicitis caused by impaction of the organ by pinworms. While death is very rare, recurrences are common. Eradicating pinworms from institutions is very difficult and long term surveillance is required. To completely eradicate the pinworm, everyone in the classroom or in the family has to be treated.
