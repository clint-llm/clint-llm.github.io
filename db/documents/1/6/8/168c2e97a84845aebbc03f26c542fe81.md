Patients with paraneoplastic syndromes should be counseled about the course of the disease. The risk of treatment-specific complications associated with high morbidity and mortality should be explained to the patients and their families. These patients usually present with advanced-stage cancer with a limited life expectancy. These seriously ill patients should be encouraged to participate in early goals of care discussions with the medical team to promote goal-congruent care.
