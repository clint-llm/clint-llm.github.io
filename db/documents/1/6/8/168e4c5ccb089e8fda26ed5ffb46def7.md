Lymph nodes are the most common location for metastasis. There is a strong correlation between the presence of metastasis within the lymphatic system and prognosis. Given this, the treatment of neoplastic cells within the lymphatic system is essential for the prevention of distant metastatic locations. Once a distant metastatic location is identified, it is more likely that the patient will be treated with systemic therapy.

Lymphoscintigraphy has a benefit and clinical significance, most commonly utilized in the identification of sentinel lymph nodes for breast cancer to determine the extent of disease metastasis. When a sentinel lymph node is identified and shown to be negative for metastasis, there can be higher confidence that the disease has not metastasized distally. It has a relatively low exposure to radiation and is non-invasive with a high impact on clinical decision making, therefore, adding value to the field of medicine. The field of lymphatic system imaging has been growing recently with many large advances, including MR lymphangiography and intranodal lymphangiogram, for interventional procedures with research published frequently, indicating the growing field.
