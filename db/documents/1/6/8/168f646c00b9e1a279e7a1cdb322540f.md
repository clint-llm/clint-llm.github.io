The medial longitudinal archÂ is made up of the calcaneus, navicular, talus, first three cuneiforms, and first, second, and third metatarsals.

Rigid pes planus is rare. It usually develops during childhood, but it can occur at any point in life. It develops from the tarsal coalition, accessory navicular bone, congenital vertical talus, or other forms of congenital hindfoot pathology.
