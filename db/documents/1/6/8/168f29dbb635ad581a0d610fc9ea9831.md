The subaxial cervical spine consists of levels C3 through C7 and includes both the bony anatomy as well as the ligamentous anatomy. Injuries to the subaxial cervical spine can be bony, soft tissue, or a combination of the two. The purpose of this activity is to review the different morphologies of subaxial cervical spine fractures as well as the different approaches to management. Special topics discussed include pediatric cervical spine trauma, cervical spine trauma in athletes, and cervical spine trauma in an ankylosed spine. This activity assists the clinical team in the evaluation, treatment, and interprofessional management of these fractures.

**Objectives:**
- Review the different mechanisms of action and morphologies of subaxial cervical spine fractures.
- Outline the different imaging studies and when it is appropriate to order them in the evaluation of subaxial cervical spine fractures.
- Summarize the different treatment options for the different patterns of subaxial cervical spine fractures.
- Outline the importance of improving communication between neurosurgeons or orthopedic surgeons (specialized in spine surgery), radiologists, and the rest of the interprofessional healthcare team in regards to advanced imaging to improve outcomes for patients with subaxial cervical spine fractures.
