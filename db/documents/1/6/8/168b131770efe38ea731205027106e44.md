Light microscopy shows a characteristic appearance with alternating bright and dark bands in the hair shaft. The bands that appear dark in light microscopy correspond to white bands macroscopically, under reflected light, and in trichoscopy. Transmission electron microscopy of affected hairs shows a normal medulla with clusters of intermittent air-filled cavities within the cortex of the hair shafts. Scanning electron microscopy reveals a "cobblestoned" and fluted cuticle.

Like in other hair shaft disorders, trichoscopy represents a simple and rapid method that enables the practitioners to establish the diagnosis of pili annulati without the need to pluck hairs.

In both dark and blond hairs, It demonstrates regular light-colored bands covering more than 50% of the hair shaft width, giving a “misty-like” appearance. This trichoscopic image of pili annulati may be misdiagnosed as "intermittent medulla," seen within thick hair shafts in healthy individuals. In these cases, intermittent light-colored bands cover less than 50% of the hair shaft’s thickness.
