Given its widespread role in nearly every molecular, cellular function, aberrations in serum phosphate levels can be highly impactful. Hypophosphatemia is defined as an adult serum phosphate level of fewer than 2.5 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). The normal level of serum phosphate in children is considerably higher and 7 mg/dL for infants. Hypophosphatemia is a relatively common laboratory abnormality and is often an incidental finding. This activity describes the risk factors, evaluation, and management of hypophosphatemia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in enhancing care delivery for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the definition of hypophosphatemia.
- Outline the causes of hypophosphatemia.
- Explain the management of hypophosphatemia.
- Explain how the interprofessional team can work collaboratively to prevent the potentially profound complications of hypophosphatemia by applying knowledge about the presentation, evaluation, and management of this condition.
