An initial tube change in general wards is associated with a higher risk of airway loss in comparison to the intensive care unit or step-down unit (96.1% vs. 63.6%).

While routine changes on general wards are typically safe provided there are adequately trained staff, equipment, and support, first tube changes may require higher levels of nursing and ancillary support not found on general wards.

Various guidelines and local protocols exist for required personnel and practices in tracheostomy changes. Typically, the first tube change is performed or supervised by at least a senior resident and not during nights or weekends.
