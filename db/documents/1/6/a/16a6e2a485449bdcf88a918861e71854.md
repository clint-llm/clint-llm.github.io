The differential diagnosis for a cardiac valvular mass is large, but it can be broken down into categories based on clinical presentation. If a patient is presenting with concerning signs of infection, then a TTE or TEE guided identification of mass is strongly suggestive of endocarditis. If the mass is present in the clinical setting of lupus or inflammatory states, consider non-bacterial or marantic endocarditis. A thrombus, Lamblâ€™s excrescence, or valvular calcifications should merit consideration in the differential. A majority of cardiac masses are secondary to metastatic cancer of the breast, melanoma, hepatocellular, renal, or sarcoma. Primary malignant tumors are rare, but the differential includes angiosarcoma and leiomyosarcoma, which typically do not involve the aortic valve.
