**History**

The patient may present with one of the following symptoms:

- **Decrease or blurring in vision:**gradual and painless; unilateral or bilateral depending upon the eye being affected without and at mature stages even with glasses

- **Diplopia or polyopia:**mostly uniocular but can be binocular- this is due to multiple refractions through clear areas between the opacities

- **Colored halos around the light:**Rainbow halos; possibly due to the collection of water drops between layers of lens fibers acting as a prism splitting light into its seven colors

- **Sensitivity to****glare:**especially headlights of automobiles and sunlight****

- **Increased frequency to change refractive glasses:**as the cataract matures, a person may visit his ophthalmologist more often for refraction

- **Disturbance in color vision:**fading or yellowing of objects

**Physical Findings**

Following findings can be noticed during a thorough ophthalmic examination depending upon the part of the lens involved:

**Visual Acuity**

- Decreased unilaterally or bilaterally depending upon the affected eye

**Cortical Cataract**

- Wedge-shaped opacity with clear areas of lens matter mostly present at the periphery (incipient cortical cataract)

- Well-developed wedge-shaped opacity (progressive cortical cataract)

- Advanced opacity with a greyish lens, clear cortex, and an iris shadow (immature cortical cataract)

- Findings of the immature stage but with a swollen lens due to the accumulation of fluid making anterior chamber shallow (intumescent cortical cataract)

- The entire opaque cortex with the absence of iris shadow (mature cortical cataract)

- Milky fluid bag with lens nucleus present at the bottom due to liquefaction of the cortex without an iris shadow and a shallow anterior chamber (hypermature cortical cataract)

**Nuclear Cataract**

- Dark brown or black lens with an iris shadow

- No fundal view due to dark opacity in the center against a red glow

- No fourth Purkinje image

**Systemic Diseases**

- **Diabetes mellitus:**classic snowflake cortical opacities

- **Myotonic dystrophy:**Christmas tree cortical cataract which later evolves into wedge-shaped cortical and subcapsular opacities resembling a star-like in conformation

- **Atopic dermatitis:**characteristic shield-like dense anterior subcapsular plaques

- **Neurofibromatosis type 2:**mixed opacities; can be subcapsular, capsular or cortical
