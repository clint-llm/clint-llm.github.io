Aortopulmonary window (AP window) is a very rare congenital cardiac defect causing a communication between the aorta and pulmonary artery. The resultant left to right shunt causes volume overload to the pulmonary circulation and subsequently congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and pulmonary vascular obstructive disease if left untreated.
