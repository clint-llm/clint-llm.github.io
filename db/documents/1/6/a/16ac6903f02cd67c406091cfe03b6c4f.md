**Micro-lumbar discectomy (MLD)**

Using intraoperative radiography to confirm the target level, a two to three-centimeter marking for a longitudinal midline incision is made over the interspace. The skin incision is made with a sharp scalpel, and subcutaneous dissection with electrocautery reveals the lumbar fascia over the midline. The muscular aponeurosis is incised just off of the midline on the side of the approach, and the multifidus is released subperiosteally from the spinous process on one side out to the facet joints with a Cobb elevator. The dissection should include half of the lamina both above and below the interspace. Do not violate the facet capsule. At this point, repeat imaging should be performed to confirm the appropriate level. Retractors are introduced to establish the working window, and the microscope is positioned accordingly over the incision. The surgeon can alternately use magnifying loupes.

The ligamentum flavum is exposed and released with a curette from its attachment on the anterior aspect of the superior lamina of the inferior vertebra. The ligamentum flavum is then incised sharply to allow for its retraction. An angled Woodson elevator can be used beneath the ligamentum to protect the dura during this incision Retraction of the ligamentum or removal with a Kerrison rongeur should allow for visualization of the exiting nerve root with its associated epidural fat. The nerve root must be identified before proceeding to disc resection. If visualization is inadequate, the medial aspect of the inferior facet of the superior vertebra may need to be removed. To minimize the risk of iatrogenic instability, it is important to preserve at least half of the facet joint and 8 to 12 mm of bone from the lateral edge of decompression to the edge of the pars interarticularis. A laminotomy of the inferior portion of the upper lamina may be necessary if the disc is not centered on the interlaminar space. A blunt ball-tipped probe is inserted into the neuroforamen to mobilize the nerve root, which is then retracted medially with a nerve root retractor. Disc excision can now be performed with the removal of the fragmented or herniated disc tissue.

In some cases, the annulus must be incised to remove a portion of the disc from behind the posterior longitudinal ligament. Up- and down-facing curettes and pituitary rongeurs can be used to perform the discectomy. Care is taken not to violate anteriorly beyond the disc space where major vessels lie, especially when using the microscope. Using a blunt instrument such as a Penfield dissector or a Woodson elevator, freedom of the nerve and dural sac is checked by probing in all directions to check for any remaining disc or ligamentous tissue and confirm an adequate decompression.

Irrigate the disc space with saline via a hollow flexible tube or bulb syringe to express any unrecognized loose disc fragments. Meticulous hemostasis is obtained with bipolar cautery, and the wound is thoroughly irrigated with saline. Vancomycin powder can be applied to the wound before closure. The fascia of the lumbar musculature and subcutaneous layers are closed with absorbable sutures, and the skin is closed according to surgeon preference. Some disc herniations, such as those extending through the foramen, may need to be approached from a combined midline and lateral approach.

**Far-lateral Microdiscectomy**

The same general steps can be applied but approached through the muscle-splitting technique to avoid the extensive muscle retraction that would be necessary from a midline approach. In this case, an incision is made 3.0 to 6.0 cm off the midline on the side of the affected level. A skin incision is made with a sharp scalpel, and subcutaneous dissection with electrocautery reveals the thoracolumbar fascia. Muscle fibers of the superficial lumbar musculature are split longitudinally. Specifically, the fibers of the multifidus and longissimus muscles are bluntly separated. Self-retaining retractors can now be introduced, and the microscope is positioned over the working window (similarly, the surgeon can proceed instead with the assistance of magnifying loupes). Surgical landmarks are identified, including the pars interarticularis or isthmus, transverse processes, facet joint, and intertransverse ligament. The intertransverse ligament can be detached from the inferior transverse process and retracted laterally. If needed, a Kerrison rongeur or high-speed drill can be used to remove a portion of bone along the superior aspect of the isthmus as well as the inferior portion of the superior transverse process. At this point, the ligamentum flavum is visualized along with the inferior aspect of the pedicle beneath the transverse process. Resect the ligamentum flavum using a Kerrison rongeur for better visualization of the nerve and to avoid injury. The nerve is typically displaced superiorly and laterally by the underlying disc material. Dissect lumbar arteries and veins from the lower foramen when possible and inspect for any further migration of the herniated disc. Carefully examine the foramen for any disc fragments with a blunt nerve hook as the nerve exits inferior to the pedicle. Irrigate and close the wound as detailed above.

**Micro-endoscopic discectomy (MED)**

The patient is positioned and prepped as described above. A 1.5 to 2.0 cm surgical incision is marked longitudinally 1.5 cm paramedian to the midline on the affected side for paracentral herniations. For extraforaminal or far-lateral disc herniations, the incision is marked 3.0 to 5.0 cm paramedian to the midline. An incision is made with a scalpel to facilitate the blunt muscle-sparing dissection through the serial placement of dilators. The dilators are placed under direct vision with fluoroscopy to ensure appropriate depth and localization and create a working channel. At this point, the microscope can be introduced to the surgical field, or magnifying loupes can be used to aid in visualization. Once the bony exposure of the spine is visible within the tubular retractor, hemilaminectomy and discectomy can be performed as needed, similar to the open exposures detailed above. Once hemostasis is achieved, the tubular retractor system can be removed, and subcutaneous tissue and skin can be closed.

Salient surgical steps can be summarized as: Microdiscectomy for medial, paramedian, and intra-foraminal discs

- This was first described by Caspar.

- There is an integration of a microscope for providing illumination as well as magnification.

- These are approached through a 3 cm paramedian incision (5 mm from the midline on the affected side).

- The dorsolumbar fascia is incised 1cm off the midline on the affected side and the multifidus is released from the spinous process on one side without hampering its insertions.

- The inter-laminar window of the concerned level is reached.

- The speculum is applied and opened.

- Stringent care to preserve the capsular and the interspinous ligament is required.

- The microscope or magnifying goggles is applied.

- The ligamentum flavum is curetted off its attachment and opened laterally.

- The nerve root is exposed and safely mobilized to visualize the disc either in the shoulder or the axilla.

- The posterior ligament is incised and herniated disc is removed.

- Extruded or intra-discal sequestra are removed.

- The adequate decompression of the nerve root and the dural sac is confirmed by passing a ball-tipped non-traumatic hook in all directions.

**Extra-Foraminal discs**

- This was first described by Wiltse and Spencer.

- A skin incision is made 3 cm and 6 cm lateral to the midline.

- The dorsolumbar fascia is incised in a semicircular manner.

- The inter-transverse plane is approached via a trans-muscular corridor between the multifidus and longissimus.

- The inter-transverse ligament and muscle are then excised lateral to the facet joint, to expose the dorsal root ganglion.

- The ganglion is then securely mobilized to expose the disc.

**Foraminal disc**

Depending on the extension of the disc, the Wiltse approach or the standard posterior approach can be taken.

In young patients owing to strong paravertebral muscles that share loading with the spinal column, only MLD suffices. In elderly patients with wide-based annulus laxity with disc herniation, microdiscectomy alongside dynamic stabilization and interspinous devices is justified.

**Advantages of the MLD compared to SD:**

- Magnified surgical view.

- Improved illumination of the surgical field.

- Minimal surgical incision.

- Minimal trauma to paraspinal multifidus muscles.

- Reduced intraoperative blood loss and better hemostasis.

- Reduced risks of intra-operative complications.

- Avoids peridural fibrosis.

- Shortened hospital stay.

- Homogenous improved clinical outcomes with a success rate of 76% and 100%.

- Can be performed as a daycare procedure with patient satisfaction exceeding 80% and an overall success rate of nearly 90%.

- Does not prolong the operative time.

- Does not increase the odds of wrong-level surgeries or missed disc fragments.

**Disadvantages:**

- Small operating corridor with a compromised field of vision harbingers the risk of neurovascular injury.

- Learning curve.
