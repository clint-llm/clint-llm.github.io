There are over 250,000 bariatric surgeries in the USA each year. There is substantial data suggesting surgery results in improved outcome measures when compared with medical treatment alone.

Analysis of over 50,000 patients in the UK National Bariatric Surgical Register revealed that mortality from bariatric surgery in hospitals is low (0.07%). The associated morbidity was 3.1%, and the most commonly encountered complications were post-operative vomiting, atelectasis/pneumonia, fever/infection, and electrolyte imbalance.

Although all patients should be recommended for surgical intervention on an individual basis in conjunction with the patientâ€™s wishes, there is overwhelmingly statistically significant evidence of reducing overall mortality.
