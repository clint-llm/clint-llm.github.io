The followingÂ are some contraindications to cleft lip repair:

- Surgery may be delayed in case further workup of coexisting conditions is necessary.

- Conditions that preclude toleration of general anesthesia may delay the surgery.

- Coexisting conditions that require surgery on a more urgent basis, such as cardiovascular anomalies, should be performed prior to cleft lip repair.
