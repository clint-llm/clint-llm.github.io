In patients with suspected orthostatic proteinuria, the clinician should obtain a urinalysis from the first-morning void sample. If the first-morning urine has normal urinary protein, then these patients do not require further investigations for renal disease.

A urine protein-to-creatinine ratio can also help with the diagnosis. A normal urine protein/creatinine ratio in a recumbent position (less than 0.2mg/mg creatinine) with a high ratio in samples collected in a standing position establishes the diagnosis.
