Prognosis of HTLV-1 Infection: Acute infection is usually undetected and often occurs early in life through vertical transmission. The significant but variable time duration between acute infection and progression to a disease process implies that the presence of the virus in isolation is insufficient to induce pathogenesis. These likely additional factors are currently poorly understood therefore understanding of HTLV-1 prognosis is incomplete.

Prognosis of ATLL: ATLL is a fatal disease associated with very poor prognostic outcomes due to intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy and generalized immunosuppression.

Prognosis of HAM/TSP: The disease course of HAM/TSP is extremely variable and there are limited identified predictors of disease progression through the viral load.
