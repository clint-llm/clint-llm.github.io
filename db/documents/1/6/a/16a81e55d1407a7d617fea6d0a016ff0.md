Detailed information on the toxicokinetics for these agents is limited. Detailed pharmacokinetics for aspirin is covered in the salicylate chapter. Briefly, gastrointestinal aspirin absorption is variable and depends on the dose, tablet formulation, and rate of gastric emptying.

The P2Y12 receptor inhibitors, (clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor), are rapidly absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract with a bioavailability of approximately 50%, 79%, 78% respectively.

Orally dosed dipyridamole has variable absorptionÂ and is 99% protein bound with a half-life of approximately 12 hours.

Cilostazol also has decreased absorption when administered orally; however, the reason for these low rates stems from its limited solubility.

Abciximab and eptifibatide are parenteral antiplatelet drugs with very low volumes of distribution.
