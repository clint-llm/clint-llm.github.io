Female is the default phenotypic differentiation. Degeneration of the mesonephric duct occurs, allowing for the paramesonephric duct to develop.

In males, the SRY gene on the Y chromosome is what produces the testis-determining factor, which allows for the development of the testes. As a result, testes then can give rise to Sertoli cells, which produce: Mullerian inhibitory factor (MIF), which suppresses the development of paramesonephric ducts, and Leydig cells, which produce the androgens that are necessary for the development of the mesonephric ducts.

Male and female genital homologs:

- Genital tubercle

- Dihydrotestosterone --> Glans penis, corpus cavernosum, and spongiosum (Cowper)
- Estrogen --> Glans clitoris, vestibular bulbs

- Urogenital sinus

- Dihydrotestosterone --> Bulbourethral glans, prostate 
- Estrogen --> Greater vestibular glands (Bartholin), Urethral and paraurethral glands (Skene) 
- Bladder and urethra

- Urogenital folds

- Dihydrotestosterone --> Ventral shaft of the penis (penile urethra)
- Estrogen --> Labia minora

- Labioscrotal swelling

- Dihydrotestosterone --> Scrotum
- Estrogen --> Labia majors
