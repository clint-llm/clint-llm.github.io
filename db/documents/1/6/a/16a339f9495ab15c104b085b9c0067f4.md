For asymptomatic and low-risk patients, endometrial polyps can be managed conservatively with observation. Incidental endometrial polyps may regress spontaneously if left untreated. In one trial, 29% of endometrial polyps resolved spontaneously after 1 year in premenopausal patients.

Hysteroscopic polypectomy is considered the standard treatment of an endometrial polyp. Polyps may be associated with underlying endometrial pathology; therefore, both the polyp and the surrounding endometrium should be histologically evaluated. Benign polyps have been found in 20% of cases with a diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma. The timing of hysteroscopic polypectomy is unclear for asymptomatic and low-risk patients. A retrospective study performed to determine the appropriate timing of polypectomy found no incidence of malignancy on histologic specimens and concluded that it is unclear when to perform routine polypectomy in asymptomatic females.

Hysterectomy is a radical surgical option that eliminates the risk of polyp recurrence and the potential for malignancy. Hysterectomy is associated with a significantly greater risk to the patient and cost and should only be contemplated after extensive patient counseling.

For patients with anemia secondary to abnormal uterine bleeding, consider daily iron supplementation.
