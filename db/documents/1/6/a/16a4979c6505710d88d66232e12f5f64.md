This procedure can be useful in individuals experiencing rectal/anal discomfort to evaluate for common lower gastrointestinal pathology which can cause pain such as anal fissures, sexually transmitted infection, anal condylomata, or bleeding such as internal hemorrhoids, rectal ulceration/inflammation, rectal varices or trauma. Anoscopy can be useful in evaluating for anal cancer, particularly in high-risk groups such as inÂ men who have sex with men and have co-existing HIV infection. This translates to a lifetime risk of 7% to 8% in a male infected in his 20s. There are no current routine screening guidelines at this time.

Anoscopy will help visualize the anus, the anal canal, and the internal sphincter, it is usually used when the digital rectal examination is inconclusive.

The following summarizes the indications for anoscopy

- Initial evaluation of rectal bleeding (hemorrhoids, proctitis, neoplasm)

- To obtain cytology samples to screen for anal squamous lesions, particularly in high-risk patients with HIV infection)

- Evaluation of intra-anal condyloma

- Anal/perianal pain (thrombosed hemorrhoids, fissures)

- Anal fistula

- Evaluation of anal trauma

- Mass palpated on DRE

- Perianal itching

- Abdominal pain

- Change in bowel habit

- Anal discharge/prolapse

- Retrieval of foreign body

- Evaluation of fecal impaction

- Treatment of prolapsing hemorrhoids by rubber band ligation (using a slotted anoscope)
