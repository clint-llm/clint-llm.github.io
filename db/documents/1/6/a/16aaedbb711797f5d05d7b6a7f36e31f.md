Untreated pulmonary regurgitation can result in ventricular arrhythmias, right heart failure, congestive hepatomegaly, anasarca, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and sudden cardiac death. Causes of death in patients with pulmonary regurgitation include sudden cardiac death from ventricular arrhythmias and heart failure from progressive ventricular dysfunction.

Complications following a pulmonary valve replacement is also a point of contention. Increased frequency of repeat surgical intervention and prosthetic valve failure are complications that follow. Following surgical pulmonary valve replacement with a mechanical valve, anticoagulation and prophylaxis against bacterial endocarditis are advised.
