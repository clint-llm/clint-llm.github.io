Operative indications vary from children to adults, but intestinal transplant is considered when intestinal failure has led to multi-organ dysfunction.  Gastrointestinal failure is met when the body no longer can maintain the delicate balance of proteins, fats, carbohydrates, electrolytes, fluids, and micronutrients.

- Multiple infections parenteral central line (2+ episodes yearly, or single episode of fungemia).

- Organ dysfunction secondary to parenteral nutrition (PN) – most commonly liver.

- Peripheral and central venous thrombosis/stenosis limiting central venous access for PN.

- Frequent dehydration in the setting of concurrent PN and intravenous fluids

Other common indications for MVT:

Adults:

- Short bowel syndrome

- Mesenteric ischemia (arterial or venous)

- Abdominal neoplasms

- Inflammatory bowel disease (typically leading to SBS)

- Radiation enteritis

- Trauma

Children:

- Volvulus (most common indication)

- Gastroschisis

- Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)

- Intestinal dysmotility diseases (ex: aganglionosis, Hirschsprung's Disease)

- Intestinal atresias

- Short bowel syndrome
