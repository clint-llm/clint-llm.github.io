Many patients with Swyer-James-MacLeod syndrome are asymptomatic, whereas some suffer from recurrent pulmonary infections. Some patients are diagnosed in childhood, others incidentally during adulthood when undergoing investigations for a different reason (such as the symptoms of asthma or recurrent chest infections).

When symptomatic, patients most often present with recurrent pulmonary infectionsÂ or exertional dyspnea.

The main physical findings include reduced chest expansion, hyper-resonant on percussion, and decreased breath sounds on the affected side.
