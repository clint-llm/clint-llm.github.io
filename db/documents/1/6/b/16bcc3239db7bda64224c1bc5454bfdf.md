When patients present in acute decompensated heart failure or flash pulmonary edema, there are many different diagnoses to consider, based on the risk factors for heart failure alone. It is also important to consider other potentially life-threatening causes of heart failure.

- Sepsis - Septic patients are at risk of multiorgan system failure.  Approximately 1 out of 3 patients with sepsis present with reversible left ventricular systolic dysfunction, reduced ejection fracture, and 1 out of 2 patients with sepsis have left ventricular or right ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The cardiac dysfunction associated with sepsis can result in significantly increased mortality. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction is associated with an increased mortality risk of 80%, and right ventricular diastolic dysfunction is associated with a 60% increased mortality.

- Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by acute respiratory failure, and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, which could potentially mimic flash pulmonary edema.

- Neurological causes - Hemispheric and hippocampal brain infarcts are associated with heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Infarct of certain areas of the brain tissue can result in a sympathetic storm and loss of vasomotor homeostasis precipitated neurogenic pulmonary edema.

- Pulmonary embolism - While a massive pulmonary embolism can cause acute cardiac dysfunction secondary to obstruction of blood flow, post pulmonary embolism syndrome may also present with heart failure type symptoms.  Post pulmonary embolism syndrome, reduced exercise tolerance has been associated with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, arrhythmia, valvular dysfunction,n and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.

- Acute coronary syndrome - Acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction is a common cause of acute decompensated heart failure.
