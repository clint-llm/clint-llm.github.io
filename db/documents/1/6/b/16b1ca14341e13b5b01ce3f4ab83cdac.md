Amebiasis is a relatively common parasitic infection worldwide. Occurring much more commonly in endemic areas of poor socioeconomic status. An important component of prevention is patient education through interprofessional communication. Physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, and pharmacists should educate patients if they are traveling to endemic areas in the world on common steps they can take to reduce their chance of contracting amebiasis. Specifically, they should educate patients to avoid consumption of tap water and avoid raw fruits and vegetables that have been cleaned with tap water. Patients should be encouraged to contact their healthcare provider if they have symptoms of diarrhea and blood stools after traveling to an endemic area. Open communication, especially inÂ obtaining a good history, will be critical in early diagnosis and treatment. Following treatment, the prognosis has been proven to be favorable.
