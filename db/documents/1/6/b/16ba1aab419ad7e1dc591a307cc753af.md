Most tongue lacerations are on the anterior dorsum of the tongue followed by the mid-dorsum and anterior ventrum. Posterior tongue lacerations are less common. Â Complete loss of tissue from the tip or lateral edge of the tongue leaves nothing to be repaired and is unlikely to cause a permanent deficit. After these types of injuries, the tongue will hypertrophy and obscure the deficit over time. An injury to the base of the tongue is potentially more problematic than other locations due to the location of the hypoglossal nerve.
