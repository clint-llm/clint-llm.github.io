No laboratory tests are needed to diagnose and manage typical temper tantrums. The physical examination is often normal.

Because visual or hearing deficits can cause frustration leading to tantrums, perform vision and hearing screening if warranted.

Lead neurotoxicity in children is associated with aggressive behavior.

Standardized rating scales of childhood behavior for the evaluation of temper tantrums are usually not necessary in the community pediatricianâ€™s office. There are rating scales available for purchase by pediatricians, researchers, and other child specialists for use in research and clinical evaluations of preschoolers. The Child Behavior Checklist and the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment are examples of instruments used with parents of children ages two to five years old.
