Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections in the neonatal period continue to be troublesome for practitioners. In the 1970s, the drug vidarabine was introduced, but it was extremely toxic to the neonate, and there was little improvement in outcomes. The development of acyclovir in the 1980s led to significant improvements in the survival of infected infants. Mortality of infants with the disseminated disease has decreased from 85 percent to 29 percent, and patients with central nervous system (CNS) disease has decreased from 50 percent to roughly 4 percent in industrialized countries. This activity reviews the evaluation, and management of neonatal herpes and stresses the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of neonatal herpes.
- Describe the evaluation of neonatal herpes.
- Outline the treatment options available for neonatal herpes.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination to advance outcomes for patients with neonatal herpes.
