Uhthoff phenomenon, also known as Uhthoff sign or Uhthoff syndrome, is a transient worsening of neurological function lasting less than 24 hours that can occur in multiple sclerosis patients due to increases in core body temperature. Knowledge of this phenomenon and its pathophysiology, therefore, is essential for recognition and appropriate treatment. This activity reviews the pathophysiologic basis of Uhthoff phenomenon and describes how Uhthoff phenomenon can be distinguished from a relapse of multiple sclerosis. This activity highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the Uhthoff phenomenon. 
- Describe how the Uhthoff phenomenon may, in select cases, suggest that further evaluation for multiple sclerosis is warranted. 
- Review how to evaluate a patient for multiple sclerosis. 
- Explain the importance of improving coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care for patients with multiple sclerosis.
