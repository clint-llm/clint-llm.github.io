If a discoid meniscus is diagnosed incidentally in the absence of symptoms, no formal treatment is indicated. However, if a discoid meniscus is causing mechanical or painful symptoms, surgery is warranted. The outcomes after surgery in young patients are good to excellent. A thorough discussion of the risks and benefits between operative and nonoperative management should be held between the patient and the patient's legal guardian if they are under age for them to make an informed decision.
