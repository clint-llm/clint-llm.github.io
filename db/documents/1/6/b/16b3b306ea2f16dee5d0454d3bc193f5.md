Abdominal compartment syndrome occurs when the pressure in the abdominal cavity elevates beyond 20 mmHg. It is associated with multiorgan dysfunction. Failure to promptly recognize and managed abdominal compartment syndrome contributes to its high rate of mortality and morbidity. This activity reviews the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of this condition. This activity highlights the importance of the interprofessional team in recognizing and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe circumstances in which clinical suspicion for abdominal compartment syndrome should be high.

- Identify the most common method of diagnosing abdominal compartment syndrome.
- Summarize the definition of intra-abdominal hypertension with that of abdominal compartment syndrome.
- Explain how interprofessional team collaboration can improve care coordination and result in improved detection, monitoring, and treatment of intraabdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome.
