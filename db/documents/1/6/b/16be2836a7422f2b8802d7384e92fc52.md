Shrinking lung syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion.

A wide variety of illnesses causing dyspnoea or pleuritic chest pain need to be excluded before making a diagnosis. This includes conditions such as pneumonia, viral or bacterial pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary embolism, interstitial lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, musculoskeletal chest wall disorders, and anxiety.

If a raised hemidiaphragm is identified, as is almost ubiquitous in this condition, other causes that could be considered before making a diagnosis of shrinking lung syndrome include pulmonary atelectasis, pulmonary hypoplasia, prior lobectomy, prior pneumonectomy, phrenic nerve palsy, contralateral stroke, subphrenic abscess, distended stomach or colon or abdominal tumors.

Finally, other causes of a restrictive lung deficit need to be considered and excluded. These include causes such as pulmonary fibrosis, large pleural effusions, kyphoscoliosis, morbid obesity, and neuromuscular disorders such as motor neuron disease and myasthenia gravis.
