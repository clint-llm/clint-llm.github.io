According to theÂ Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, vulvar cancer represents 0.3% of all new cancer cases annually at a rate of 2.6 per 100,000 women per year in the United States.

Diagnosis is usually made in the sixth through eighth decades of life and is commonly identified at an early stage of the disease. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) accounts for most vulvar cancers, while basal cell carcinoma (BCC), extramammary Paget disease, and vulvar melanoma comprise the less common subtypes. Surgery remains the mainstay of vulvar cancer treatment, with medical and radiation oncology playing an increasingly important role in preventing recurrence and improving outcomes.
