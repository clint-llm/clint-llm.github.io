The patient should be initially evaluated to determine if the prompt reduction of the knee joint is needed. Upon achieving reduction, or if the joint has already spontaneously reduced, the patient’s vascular status should undergo evaluation, including palpating pulses and measuring ankle-brachial index (ABI). The ABI measurement is a ratio of lower extremity perfusion (posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries) and upper extremity perfusion (brachial artery). An ABI of 0.9 or greater is considered normal, while an ABI less than 0.9 can indicate a vascular compromise. This test is just one adjunct in the evaluation of the patient with a knee dislocation. The clinician’s pulse and perfusion examination are of limited utility unless there are hard signs of vascular compromise, in which prompt case evaluation by vascular surgery is necessary. Normal pulses or ABIs do not necessarily rule out any injury, and this finding should not falsely reassure the clinician. Reports exist of popliteal artery contusion, intimal layer disruption, and delayed thrombus formation in patients with distal perfusion after knee dislocation.

Imaging with anteroposterior and lateral radiographs can confirm the reduction of the joint and any concomitant fracture. Duplex ultrasonography, if readily available, can be used for bedside evaluation of the vasculature. Due to limitations of the vascular exam, imaging with computed tomography angiogram should be pursued in cases of asymmetric pulses, decreased ABI, or abnormal duplex ultrasound. Hard signs such as absent/weak pulses, pale or cool extremity, paresthesias, or paralysis mandate emergent vascular surgery consultation.
