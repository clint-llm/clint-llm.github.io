**Wound Healing and Growth Factors**

Wound healing is a normal, multiphase, physiological process and is of obvious importance after surgery. Growth factors play critical roles in all three phases of wound healing: (1) the inflammatory phase, (2) the proliferative phase, and (3) the remodeling phase. Platelets are the principal cell type for the inflammatory phase because they release platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and TGF-beta, both of which are growth factors that attract macrophages and neutrophils. Neutrophils are white blood cells that can kill bacteria and thereby prevent sepsis at the wound site. Macrophages secrete growth factors that both attract fibroblasts and also play a key role in the second phase of wound healing, the proliferative phase. TGF-beta is also secreted by macrophages and plays a role in wound fibrosis. Both macrophages and endothelial cells can secrete VEGF, and this growth factor promotes angiogenesis (growth of new blood vessels). Macrophages also secrete epidermal growth factor (EGF), and it stimulates fibroblasts to secrete collagenase, which is essential during the remodeling phase. There is evidence suggesting that the complex and changing mixture of growth factors occurring during wound healing modulates macrophage functions.
