Contraindications for central venous access are always relative and dependent on the urgency and alternative venous access. Site-specific contraindications include distorted local anatomy, skin infection overlying the insertion site, thrombus within the intended vein, or the presence of other indwelling intravascular hardware within the intended vessel. Coagulopathy and bleeding disorders are considered relative contraindications even when they are severe. A systematic review studying the risk of complications following CVL placement in patients with moderate-to-severe coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia revealed that theÂ incidence of major bleeding complications is low, and evidence supporting the correction of coagulopathy before CVL placement is lacking.

It still needs to be determined what thresholds of platelet count, international normalized ratio (INR), and partial thromboplastin time central venous catheterization can safely be performed. According to recent data, thrombocytopenia appears to pose a greater risk when compared with prolonged clotting times.
