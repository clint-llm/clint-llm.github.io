Clinicians are encouraged to recognize the similarities and subtle differences when managing osteoporotic patients versus SCI-induced osteoporotic patients. While some general underlying principles in treatment exist, there is an evolving treatment paradigm to be recognized in the SCI-induced osteoporosis subgroup of patients.

**Mechanical Loading**

Weight-bearing activity stimulates and creates an ideal stress environment to promote physiologic bone remodeling according to the Wolff law. Mechanical loading has demonstrated reversal capabilities in the SCI-induced osteoporotic process in long bones in the lower extremity. Specifically, cortical thickening is noted in response to applied mechanical stress and strain even after disuse osteopenia has ensued. However, studies have demonstrated the most ideal environment to maximize osteogenic potential and create a net anabolic activity in bone turnover comes from intermittent force application. Constant stimulation can lead to desensitization of the bone to the applied mechanical forces.

**Vibration Therapy**

Low magnitude mechanical signals (LMMS) as a therapeutic modality has demonstrated bone formation capabilities in both human and rodent models. However, beyond limited case reports there is little evidence available to advocate its definitive therapeutic potential.  Similarly, low-intensity vibration treatment protocols have shown some promising results in a small case series of SCI-induced osteoporotic patients.

**Calcium and Vitamin D**

Without question, all patients should be taking calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Patients should be educated on the recommended daily intake for calcium and vitamin D. The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) recommends 1200 to 1500 mg of calcium per day and 800 to 1000 IUs of daily vitamin D for adults over the age of 50. In the setting of SCI-induced osteoporosis, all patients should begin supplementation regardless of age at presentation.

**Anti-Osteoporotic Pharmacotherapy Options**

Pharmacotherapy agents work through either anti-resorptive or anabolic means. In general, bisphosphonates are the most commonly prescribed medication class for osteoporosis treatment. These drugs are divided into non-nitrogen and nitrogen-containing compounds. The latter are considered first-line therapy for osteoporosis.

In one study, alendronate was able to prevent further bone loss in 55 patients with chronic SCI-induced osteoporosis at the 2-year follow-up.  However, this is a stark contrast to alendronate’s proven track record and documented capabilities to increase BMD values measured in ambulatory (i.e., not SCI-induced), post-menopausal women with osteoporosis.

While alendronate, risedronate, and intravenous zoledronic acid have all demonstrated reduced fragility fracture rates in the general osteoporosis population, the clinical evidence has yet to be demonstrated in the SCI-induced osteoporosis population.

**Denosumab**

Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody against receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-? ligand (RANKL), has recently been studied specifically in patients afflicted with SCI-induced osteoporosis. In 2016, one study demonstrated increases in lumbar and femoral BMD values as measured by DXA scans after 1 year of treatment compared to baseline BMD values. Denosumab was administered in a 60 mg every 6 months protocol during the study period.

**Anabolic Agents and Emerging Pharmacotherapy Agents**

Teriparatide is a recombinant form of PTH that stimulates osteoblasts to produce more bone. Teriparatide is now FDA approved for osteoporosis treatment in males and females, but more studies are needed in order to improve our understanding of its effects on BMD levels and clinical outcomes in SCI-induced osteoporotic patients.

Activins are a group of agents belonging to the transforming growth factor-beta family and are highly expressed in bone. Studies have demonstrated that blocking the type II activin receptor, promotes bone formation secondary to the inhibition of activin A ligand signaling. In similar fashion, studies have also suggested the same conclusion when targeting cathepsin-K inhibitors. To date, there is little if any literature specifically targeting patients with SCI-induced osteoporosis. Future studies are warranted to delineate clinical efficacy.
