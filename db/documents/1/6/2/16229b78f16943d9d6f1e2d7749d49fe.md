A mediastinal mass can arise from a variety of diseases, commonly from lymphoma, bronchogenic carcinoma, tuberculosis, germ cell carcinoma, thymoma, and metastasis.

Rib fractures can affect the surrounding anatomical structures in numerous ways. Multiple rib fractures resulting in a flail chest alters the normal physiology of the thoracic wall; the flail segment moves paradoxically during respiration, reducing the efficacy of ventilation.

Fluid collecting within the pericardial space (pericardial effusion) ultimately limits the space the heart has within the middle mediastinum.

Aortic aneurysm and dissection can occur at different regions within the thoracic cavity; this will ultimately affect different arterial branches changing the severity of the disease.
