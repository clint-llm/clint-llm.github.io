Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) is a multimeric complex composed of enzymes from the NOX family. NOX plays a pivotal role in forming superoxide anion (O-), expending NADPH in the process. The formation of a superoxide anion is critical in killing microorganisms in phagocytic leukocytes.

First identified in the 1950s, chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare heterogeneous condition described as a series of recurrent life-threatening infections. Defective phagocyte NADPH oxidase causes the disease. The ultimate result is phagocytes' inability, such as neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages, to destroy certain microbes. This article describes updates to the clinical biochemistry and management of this phagocyte disorder.
