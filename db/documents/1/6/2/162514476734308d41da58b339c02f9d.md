Based on the speed of penetration, it can be classified into two categories:

- High-velocity penetration: Examples include injuries caused by bullets or shell fragments, from direct trauma or shockwave injury to surrounding brain tissue due to a stretch injury.

- Low-velocity penetration: Examples include a knife or other sharp objects, with direct trauma to brain tissue.
