The brain consumes a significant amount of energy compared to its weight and size. It is highly metabolically active and exquisitely sensitive to hypoxia and hypoperfusion. Cellular injury can begin within minutes, and permanent brain injury will follow if prompt intervention does not occur. Therefore, it is critical to understand the clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and management options.
