Corneal foreign bodies account for the second most common form of ocular trauma, with corneal abrasions being number one. In general, major morbidity such as visual acuity loss is not common. Many corneal foreign bodies are superficial and benign, albeit uncomfortable. This activity reviews the presentation of a patient with a corneal foreign body, its diagnosis, and management by an interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the presentation of a patient with a corneal foreign body.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with a corneal foreign body.
- Summarize the treatment options for corneal foreign bodies.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by a corneal foreign body.
