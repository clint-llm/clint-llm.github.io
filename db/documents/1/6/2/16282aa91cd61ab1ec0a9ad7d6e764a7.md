The contraindications to interlaminar epidural injection include local infection, systemic infection, allergy to injectate, and potentially bleeding disorders or anticoagulation. The American Society of Intervention Pain Physicians (ASIPP) and American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA) guidelines vary in terms of recommendations regarding discontinuation of anticoagulant/antiplatelet medications.

Intermediate-risk: Lumbar interlaminar epidural injections at L5-S1High-risk: Cervical, thoracic, and all lumbar interlaminar epidural injections above L4-L5

Recommendations on the continuation of antithrombotics or anticoagulants, stopping, and restarting therapy following the procedure are agent-specific. Clinicians need to consider appropriate consideration of the risks-benefits of holding these agents for all patients. The use of a steroid for injection also expands contraindications to include medical comorbidities such as poorly controlled diabetes/hypertension or congestive heart failure.
