Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is a state of a dysregulated and excess immune response against latent or subacute opportunistic infections that can occur in up to one-third of HIV patients following HAART initiation. IRIS can also be seen in non-HIV patients with latent infections such as in females in the post-partum period, patients on TNF-alpha blockers, neutropenic patients with stem cell transplants, and patients with a history of solid organ transplants on immunosuppressants. Its clinical presentation can be heterogeneous and depends on the underlying organism causing the latent infection, location of the infection, and severity of inflammatory response following immune recovery.

The diagnosis of IRIS can be challenging as its clinical presentationÂ can be similar to drug-related side effects or progression of existing opportunistic infections due to lack of adherence or resistance of anti-microbial agents. Timely identification of IRIS can lead to avoidance of complications, which in case of severe CNS-IRIS or pulmonary IRIS, can be life-threatening. Thus, HIV positive patients initiated on HAART need close follow up with an interprofessional team consisting of health care professionals including primary care doctors, infectious disease specialists, pharmacists, and nurses to monitor for symptoms of IRIS and timely initiation of treatment.
