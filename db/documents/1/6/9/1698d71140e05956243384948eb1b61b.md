As mentioned earlier, there are specific genetic and molecular messengers that are essential for normal testicular descent.

**SRY**

In 1990 Sinclair et al. identified a gene on the Y chromosome, which they named the sex-determining region of the Y chromosome.

The SRY gene becomes transactivated by the product of the WT1, which binds to the SRY promoter region.

**SOX9**

The SOX9Â (SRY-Box Transcription Factor 9) gene encodes a 509 amino acid long transcription factor, which is necessary for sexual development. It is found on the long arm of chromosome 17 and is a member of HMG transcription factors having a molecular mass of 56kD.

SRY begins a feed-forward loop between Glia-activating factor (FGF9) and SOX9; this causes the upregulation of FGF9 and inhibits WNT4. WNT4 promotes female sex development, whereas FGF9 stimulates male sex development. This upregulation of FGF9 and SOX9 and downregulation of WNT4 stimulate testis development.

**SF1**

Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1), also known as NR5A1, is a transcription factor that consists of 461 amino acids.

**AMH**

Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), also known as Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS) is a 560 amino acid long protein.

**INSL3**

Insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3), otherwise known as Leydig cell-specific relaxin-like factor, is a hormone encoded by the INSL3 gene found on chromosome 19.
