The pathogenesis of AKI is etiology-driven. The common endpoint in all types of acute tubular necrosis is a cellular insult either secondary to ischemia or direct toxins, which results in effacement of the brush border and eventually cell death, thus shutting down the function of tubular cells. Intratubular obstruction by pigments such as myoglobin or crystals such as uric acid in tumor lysis syndrome or immunoglobulin light chains, as seen in monoclonal gammopathy, may also lead to the same result. On the other hand, the mechanism of injury in glomerulonephritis may be due to direct immune-mediated injury of the vessels or immune complex deposition leading to an immune response and damage to the glomeruli.
