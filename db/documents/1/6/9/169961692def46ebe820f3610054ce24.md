Ophthalmic topical bimatoprost is a structural analog of prostaglandin F2α. It has received approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 2001 as a treatment to lower intraocular pressure (IOP). Evidence indicates that topical bimatoprost is among the most efficacious drugs for reducing IOP in eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and ocular hypertension.

In 2008, the FDA approved ophthalmic bimatoprost to treat hypotrichosis, such as for patients post-chemotherapy.

The ophthalmic bimatoprost is available as both topical 0.01% and 0.03% concentrations in the United States. When used to lower IOP, once-daily dosing of bimatoprost may be used alone or concomitantly with another drug such as timolol.

Once-daily bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% applied to the upper eyelashes has been studied extensively as an effective method of enhancing eyelash growth with favorable safety profiles and tolerability.
