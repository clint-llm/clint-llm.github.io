Adapalene is applied to a clean face once daily in the morning or at bedtime. The patient should wash the face with a gentle cleanser and allow the face to dry thoroughly. Then a pea-sized amount of adapalene should be applied as a thin layer to the entire face. Avoiding application to eyelids, lips, and mucous membranes is necessary. Patients can apply an oil-free moisturizer over adapalene to help decrease the risk of irritation. As there is a risk of photosensitivity with topical retinoids, the clinician should also recommend an oil-free sunscreen and warn the patient against excessive sun exposure.

One reason for treatment failure with topical retinoids is the initial skin irritation that occurs and maximizes in intensity within two weeks of treatment. This initial mild irritation can lead to the discontinuation of therapy.

An investigation in modulating treatment regimens with adapalene 0.1%-benzoyl peroxide 2.5% combination in the first four weeks demonstrated no difference in efficacy outcomes at 12 weeks. The treatment regimens investigated were topical nightly application, limited exposure application of 3 hours, every other night application, and nightly application with a gentle moisturizer.

**Use in Specific Patient Populations**

**Patients with Renal Impairment:**No information regarding the use of adapalene in patients with renal impairment is provided in product labeling.

**Patients with Hepatic Impairment:**No information regarding the use of adapalene in patients with hepatic impairment is provided in product labeling.

**Pregnancy Considerations:**Adapalene was pregnancy category C under the prior FDA pregnancy classification system and should be avoided in pregnant patients. . Oral exposure of pregnant animals to high doses of third-generation retinoids resulted in retinoid embryopathies. Topical administration of adapalene results in minimal systemic absorption, with less than 0.01% absorbed systemically and clearance from plasma within 72 hours of application. The most sensitive adverse effect of retinoids is possible teratogenicity. Vitamin A is essential for embryo-fetal development. Both deficiencies and overabundance can disrupt normal development. First and second-generation retinoids are known to cause retinoid embryopathies with oral administration. Topically applied retinoids, including first-generation tretinoin, have minimal systemic absorption, and third- and fourth-generation retinoids are designed to minimize off-target effects. Concern for teratogenicity was first raised because three reports to the FDA from 1986 to 1989 highlight holoprosencephaly in infants exposed to topical retinoids in utero. Subsequent case series and observational cohorts did not corroborate the initial reports.

A recent systematic literature review and meta-analysis evaluating first-trimester exposure to topical retinoids demonstrated no clear increase in the risk of retinoid embryopathy. However, the lack of epidemiologic data is reason enough to approach the use of topical retinoids during pregnancy with caution. Topical retinoids are not currently recommended during pregnancy. Therefore, adapalene should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

**Breastfeeding Considerations:**The use of topical adapalene has not been evaluated during breastfeeding. Adapalene is probably a low risk to the nursing infant because it is poorly absorbed after topical application, and blood levels are minimal with prolonged therapy. However, clinicians should advise breastfeeding mothers that adapalene should not be applied to the nipple area and ensure that the infant's skin does not come into direct contact with skin areas treated with adapalene. Clinicians should generally avoid prescribing during breastfeeding due to potential risks to the infant.
