Clinicians, nurses, physician assistants, and pharmacists must educate patients when confronted with the matter that regular biotin use is not indicated and also not well-documented. Interprofessional team members should be aware that biotin marketing often claims it is "a magic pill for hair and nails," but the benefits remain unclear. Without the research to support regular usage, heavily marketed claims by the beauty and supplementation industry need to be challenged to examine the efficacy and safety of this drug, which they advertise for regular use. With the epidemic of type 2 diabetes in the United States, further exploration regarding biotin's role in glucose control requires investigation since studies have concluded it may be beneficial for obese patients and those with type 2 diabetes.
