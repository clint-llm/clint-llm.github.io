The aim of treatment is to reduce redness, swelling and irritation in striae rubrae, and to increase collagen and elastic fiber production, improve hydration, and reduce inflammation in striae albae.

Topical management is commonly recommended to prevent and treat striae, with very little if any evidence of efficacy, according to several published comprehensive reviews. Clinical trials have been of low quality involving small numbers of subjects.

- Many emollients and over-the-counter cosmeceuticals are marketed and used by pregnant women with the intention of preventing striae distensae or reducing their severity, resulting in considerable effort and expense, despite the considerable uncertainty whether any have benefit.

- Silicone gels are recommended for atrophic scars and may be used in striae distensae. Published results are difficult to interpret.

- Tretinoin cream has been reported to be possibly useful in striae rubrae when compared to placebo over a six-month period. It may result in irritation, redness, and peeling. It should not be applied during pregnancy due to its pregnancy category.

- Chemical peels using various acids have been used to treat striae. Efficacy is unknown.

Physical treatments are also advocated but also have little evidence to support their use.

- Massage is a component of topical therapy, and it is also used in scar management.

- Exposure to broadband ultraviolet radiation can cause repigmentation in striae alba but is reported to have temporary effect with loss of pigmentation within a few months.

- Light and laser therapies have shown improvements in the appearance of striae, although it is uncertain which is best, and at what stage (rubrae, albae) they should be used.

- Light and lasers cause short-term erythema and oedema. They should be avoided in darker skin types due to greater risk of adverse effects, particularly transient postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and persistent hypopigmentation. Non-ablative devices are safer than ablative lasers.

- Radiofrequency energy devices emit high-frequency alternating electric current producing dermal heat. They are used to tighten the dermis, reduce wrinkles, and improve cellulite. Treatment promotes neocollagenesis, neoelastogenesis, and increased ground substances (proteoglycans) and should theoretically improve the appearance of striae. At least one published study has reported treatment was well tolerated, and the patients were satisfied with the results. A more recent advance has been the delivery of radiofrequency energy to a depth of 3.5 mm using a multiple needle delivery mode. Anecdotal reports are encouraging but proper studies are awaited.

- Other devices used have included microdermabrasion

The effect of treatments is difficult to assess. For example, laser protocols use differing devices, fluence, pulse duration, spot size and treatment frequency and number.  The utility of combination strategies is unknown.

Platelet-rich plasma injections are also under investigation.

When using any of these modalities, it is important to have standardized pre-treatment and post-treatment photographs. Furthermore, it is important to take these photographs six and twelve months out after the course of treatments. Many published reports do not have standardized photographs, nor do they have long-term follow up.
