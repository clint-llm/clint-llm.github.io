One method of estimating the delivery date is by using the patient's last menstrual cycle

Fundal height measurement is a physical exam parameter that can be used to estimate gestational age

First-trimester ultrasound (ultrasound before 13 weeks and 6/7 days) is the most accurate method to establish or confirm gestation age in pregnancy

The performance of a first-trimester ultrasound is not always possible. Patients occasionally initiate prenatal care in the second trimester, or they may not present to a facility with ultrasound capability. In resource-poor areas, an initial ultrasound should be performed between 18 to 20 weeks

The accuracy of second-trimester ultrasound (between 14 0/7 weeks and 27 6/7 weeks) is widely variablesub-optimally dated Beyond 22 0/7 weeks until 27 6/7 weeks, if the last menstrual period-determined estimated date of delivery differs by more than 14 days, the ultrasound estimated date of delivery should be used

Third-trimester ultrasound (beyond 28 0/7 weeks) is the most inaccurate method for pregnancy dating with an accuracy of +/- 21-30 days
