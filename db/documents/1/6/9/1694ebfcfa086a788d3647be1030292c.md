Crohn disease, a well-known subtype of inflammatory bowel disease, is an inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract with numerous possible extra-intestinal manifestations. Approximately 40% of all patients affected by Crohn disease experience at least one extra-intestinal manifestation of the disease, with the skin being the most common site of extra-intestinal involvement. Other common locations of extra-intestinal involvement include the eyes, joints, and hepatobiliary system. Interestingly, an extra-intestinal manifestation may precede the formal diagnosis of Crohn disease in about 25% of patients. This activity describes the evaluation and management of Crohn and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the presentation of various cutaneous conditions that manifest in association with Crohn disease.
- Outline the management of various cutaneous conditions that manifest in association with Crohn disease.
- Review the treatment strategies for TNF-alpha inhibitor-induced psoriasiform/eczematous dermatoses in patients with Crohns treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors. 
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to ensure appropriate care for Crohn disease patients.
