**Thoracic Wall**

T1 to T12 thoracic spinal nerves exit through the intervertebral foramina and branch into anterior and posterior ramus branches.

The brachial plexus originates from C5 to T1 spinal nerves and is situated superior to the thorax.

**Thoracic Cavity**

The sympathetic nervous system of the body is formed by two preganglionic neurons and one postganglionic neuron from T1 to L2.

The vagus nerve is responsible for the parasympathetic innervation of the thoracic cavity.

The left recurrent laryngeal nerve branches off the left vagus nerve at the level of the aortic arch.

The phrenic nerve originates from the C3 to C5 spinal nerves bilaterally.
