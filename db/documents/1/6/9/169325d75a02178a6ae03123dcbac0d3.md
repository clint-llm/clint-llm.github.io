There is insufficient data on lurasidone overdose. A literature search revealed only one case report of acute lurasidone overdose. This case report describes a 31-year-old man who overdosed on large amounts of lurasidone in an attempt to commit suicide. The quantity of lurasidone ingested was 8.5 times the upper maximum limit. Overdose took place shortly after lunch, which increased lurasidone’s absorption. The patient presented with mild hypertension and slightly elevated TSH. The patient only required IV fluids and recovered without sequelae. TSH normalized in 3 weeks after the overdose.

There is only one other documented case in the lurasidone leaflet regarding overdose. A patient took 560 mg of lurasidone and recovered without negative sequelae. Clinicians on the case noticed no long-term adverse effects with lurasidone overdose.

There are no specific antidotes for lurasidone. In case of overdose, it recommended close monitoring and supervision for prolongation of the QT interval, orthostatic hypotension, CNS depression, and tachycardia.
