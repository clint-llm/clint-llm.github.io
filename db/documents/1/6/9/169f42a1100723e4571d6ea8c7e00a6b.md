The prevalence ofÂ prerenal kidney failure has increased significantly in the last decade. This rise is secondary to the increased incidence of acute critical illnesses, septicemia, shock, and respiratory failure. It is reported that about 30% of acutely critically sick patients have AKI preadmission.

In a retrospective single-center study published in 2006 using the RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney function, and End-stage kidney disease) criteria, it was reported that AKI was present in 9% of the patients in the hospital, and about 50% in the ICU setting. The majority of the hospital causes of AKI are secondary to prerenal disease and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Combined, these two entities account for about three-quarters of the cases of AKI. Prerenal AKI represented about 21% of AKI in hospitalized patients.
