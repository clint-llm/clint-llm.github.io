Evaluation of Patients with breast cancer needs a triple assessment using clinical evaluation, imaging, and tissue biopsy. Mammography is the most commonly used modality for the diagnosis of breast cancer. Most of the asymptomatic cases are diagnosed during screening mammography. Breast cancer always presents as calcifications, dense lump, with or without architecture distortion. However, mammography is not sensitive in young women for whom breast ultrasonography can be used. Ultrasonography is useful in assessing the consistency and size of breast lumps. It has a great role in guided needle biopsy. Magnetic resonance imaging has good sensitivity for describing abnormalities in soft tissues, including the breast. It is indicated if there are occult lesions, or suspicion of multifocal or bilateral malignancy, especially ILC, and in the assessment of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, or when planning for breast conservation surgery and screening in the high-risk patient. Tissue biopsy is an important step in the evaluation of a breast cancer patient. There are different ways to take a tissue specimen, and these include fine-needle aspiration cytology, core biopsy (Trucut), and incisional or excisional biopsy.
