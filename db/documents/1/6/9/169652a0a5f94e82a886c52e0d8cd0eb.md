Surgeons need to understand the anatomy of the abdominal wall so that the correct incision is made when entering the abdominal cavity.

- A midline incision is made through the linea alba with a slight curve at the umbilicus. The linea alba is poorly vascularized, and hence blood loss is minimal, and no nerves are excised. This is perhaps the most versatile incision when approaching abdominal organs.

- A paramedian is an incision made just lateral to the linea alba. It provides access to the kidney, adrenal, and spleen. However, this incision is rarely used today as it required ligation of blood vessels and cutting of nerves.

- A transverse incision is made below the umbilicus. It was once used, but since it has poor healing, this incision is rarely used today.

- Pfannenstiel or suprapubic transverse incision is made just a few centimeters above the pubis. Before making this incision, the bladder must be emptied/decompressed to prevent injury.

- A subcostal incision is made just below the rib cage and allows access to the spleen or gallbladder. It is a limited incision with restricted exposure.

- McBurneyâ€™s incision consists of splitting the muscle fibers instead of cutting them. It is located a third of the distance from the anterior superior iliac spine and the umbilicus. It is widely used during an appendectomy.
