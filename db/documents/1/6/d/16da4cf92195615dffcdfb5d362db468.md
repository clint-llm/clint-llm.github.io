Low carbohydrate (low-carb) diets are a strategy for weight loss. Today, there continues to be an interest in low-carb approaches. While all low carbohydrate approaches reduce the overall intake of carbohydrates, there is no clear consensus on what defines a low-carb diet. Studies have defined low carbohydrate as a percent of daily macronutrient intake or total daily carbohydrate load. This activity will review the evidence and effectiveness of low-carb approaches in clinical medicine for an interprofessional team to consult with patients who might benefit from such a dietary strategy.

**Objectives:**
- Outline low carbohydrate diets in terms of percent of macronutrient content and total carbohydrate load.
- Review the evidence behind low carbohydrate diets.
- Describe the potential concerns surrounding low carbohydrate diets.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to ensure the appropriate selection of candidates for low carbohydrate diets and educate patients to provide the best possible outcome.
