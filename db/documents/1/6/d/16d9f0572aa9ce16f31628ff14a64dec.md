During embryology, the development of peripheral nerves derives from neural crest cells. The development of the structures in the face originates from the branchial apparatus. The branchial arch is made up of mesoderm and neural crest cells. The branchial arch will form the muscles, nerves, and bones in the face and neck. The first branchial arch will develop the first two branches of the trigeminal nerve. The maxillary nerve and the mandibular nerve and their innervation territories will form from the first branchial arch. As the face develops, the maxillary nerve and mandibular nerve will branch into their respective alveolar nerves, which means the alveolar nerves are derivatives of neural crest cells.
