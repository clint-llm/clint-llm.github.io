Thalassemia is autosomal recessive, which means both the parents must be affected with or carriers for the disease to transfer it to the next generation. It is caused by mutations or deletions of the Hb genes, resulting in underproduction or absence of alpha or beta chains. There are over 200 mutations identified as the culprits for causing thalassemias. Alpha thalassemia is caused by deletions of alpha-globin genes, and beta thalassemias are caused by a point mutation in splice site and promoter regions of the beta-globin gene on chromosome 11.
