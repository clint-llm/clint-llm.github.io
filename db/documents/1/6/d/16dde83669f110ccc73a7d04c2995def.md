# Continuing Education Activity

Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is a surgical technique used for the treatment of osteoarthritis in one compartment of the knee, most commonly in the medial compartment. In contrast, a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is used for the treatment of osteoarthritis in all three compartments of the knee. UKA was first introduced in the 1970s. This activity reviews the indications for UKA and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with osteoarthritis.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.
- Review the contraindications for unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.
- Summarize the clinical relevance of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients undergoing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.

# Introduction

Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is a surgical technique used for the treatment of osteoarthritis in one compartment of the knee, most commonly in the medial compartment.

# Anatomy and Physiology

The knee has three compartments: medial, lateral, and patellofemoral. The medial compartment is the articulation between the medial condyle of the femur and the medial aspect of the tibial plateau. The lateral compartment is the articulation between the lateral femoral condyle and the lateral aspect of the tibial plateau. The patellofemoral compartment is the articulation between the patella and the trochlear groove of the femur. A patient can develop arthritis in one, two, or all three of these compartments. The alignment of the limb is one factor that can determine the location of osteoarthritis development. Patients with varus (or bow-legged) malalignment will have greater contact stresses in the medial compartment of the knee and be more likely to develop medial compartment arthritis. Patients with valgus (or knock-kneed) malalignment will be more likely to develop arthritis in the lateral compartment.

# Indications

As with other elective procedures, prior to considering surgery, the patient should have attempted treatment with conservative measures, including activity modification, physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications, bracing, and/or injections. Surgical intervention can be considered only if these conservative measures fail to provide relief. The indications for UKA are controversial and have evolved since its introduction. Kozinn and Scott established a set of indications in 1989.

More recent evidence has shown improved outcomes and survivorship in younger (age less than 60 years) and obese patients.

# Contraindications

The contraindications to UKA as initially described by Kozinn and Scott

Recent studies have demonstrated no difference in function and revision rates in patients with and without PFJ arthritis.in vivo studies have demonstrated biomechanical instability in ACL-deficient knees that may predispose to polyethylene wear and worsening degeneration in the lateral and patellofemoral compartments.

# Preparation

Preoperative evaluation should include a detailed history and physical examination. Evaluation of the knee should encompass testing for ligamentous stability and range of motion limitations based on criteria established by Kozinn and Scott.

# Technique or Treatment

The surgical approach to UKA should allow adequate exposure of the medial compartment while minimizing the release of the soft tissues. The tibial resection should match the native tibial slope. The sagittal resection should be as close to the tibial spine as possible to maximize the area for positioning of the component without causing damage to the ACL. In the coronal plane, the part should be placed perpendicular to the long axis of the tibia.

The ideal position of the femoral component is central or slightly lateral on the femoral condyle to optimize tracking with the tibial component.

Other considerations in UKA include the use of mobile- (MB) versus fixed-bearing (FB) implants. MB implants were introduced in the 1980s and were designed to distribute loads over a large surface area to decrease polyethylene wear.

Another consideration is whether to use cement during component implantation. Cementing in UKA can prove challenging given the limited exposure and surface area. Furthermore, cementing prolongs the operative duration and may result in cementation errors.

# Complications

Since the introduction of UKA several decades ago, the primary mechanism of failure has remained consistent in the literature, most commonly stemming from aseptic loosening, followed by progressive osteoarthritis.

# Clinical Significance

Since its initial introduction, indications for UKA has continued to expand. Data from large case series, registries, and meta-analyses have consistently demonstrated the long-term efficacy and survivorship of UKA in the appropriate patient populations. When performed for the correct indications and in the appropriate settings, UKA is a minimally invasive surgery that can return the patient to their previous level of recreational activity. Heightened patient expectations especially in younger and more active patients, however, can lead to early wear of the implant and the need for revision. Nevertheless, conversion of a failed UKA to total knee arthroplasty is associated with lower morbidity compared to revision of a TKA.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Despite the excellent long-term survival rates after UKA in recent literature, there are substantial differences in outcomes demonstrated by cohort and registry data.
