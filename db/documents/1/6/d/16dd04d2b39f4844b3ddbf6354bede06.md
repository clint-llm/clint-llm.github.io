Ketamine is a structural analog of the dissociative anesthetic and recreational drug phencyclidine (PCP).

After the chemist Calvin Stevens first synthesized ketamine in 1962, ketamine was tested in clinical trials performed in pediatric and adult surgical patients, and the Food and Drug Administration approved it for human use in 1970.

Like its chemical cousin phencyclidine, ketamine’s psychomimetic effects have made it a popular recreational drug. In low doses, it’s euphoric and dissociative effects are sometimes referred to as “k-land,” whereas at high doses, the immobilizing and hallucinogenic effects are referred to as being in a “k-hole.”

Ketamine toxicity can cause a variety of neurological, cardiovascular, psychiatric, urogenital, and abdominal symptoms, which are dose-dependent, and depend on whether ketamine administration was in an iatrogenic or illicit context. For example, some experts have attributed the higher incidence of ulcerative cystitis in recreational users to the adulterants with which the drug is mixed. Emergency medicine providers should be aware of the various mechanisms to treat ketamine toxicity and to prevent acute complications such as rhabdomyolysis, seizures, and chronic complications such as psychiatric disturbances and ulcerative cystitis.
