Crescentic glomerulonephritis, also known as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, is a condition of the kidney characterized by a rapid loss of renal function. On histological examination, it has the presence of numerous glomerular crescents (usually greater than 50%). This activity describes the evaluation and management of crescentic glomerulonephritis and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the classification of primary crescentic glomerulonephritis. 
- Describe the epidemiology of crescentic glomerulonephritis.
- Identify the evaluation of crescentic glomerulonephritis.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by crescentic glomerulonephritis.
