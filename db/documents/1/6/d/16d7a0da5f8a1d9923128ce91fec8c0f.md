High-velocity, low-amplitude technique (HVLA) is frequently used among various professions, including physicians, chiropractors, physical therapists, and other manual medicine practitioners. HVLA therapy is also referred to as the "thrust" technique since it directs a quick, short thrust through a joint, typically in the spine.

The goal of HVLA OMT of the cervical spine is the resolution of symptoms (reduced pain, increase range of motion). The frequently cited therapeutic mechanism of HVLA treatment centers on the restoration of mobility of a joint and/or correcting a joint's malalignment.

Controversy exists since evidence suggests that treating the asymmetrical movement of a single vertebral segment or multiple segments is unlikely to be a source of therapeutic effect and that treating spinal segments only produces a "minor movement" that is already observed in the pre-treatment segments.

Studies have suggested that osteopathic manipulative treatment, in general, is as efficacious as intramuscular ketorolac in providing pain relief.
