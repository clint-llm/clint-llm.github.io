Patients with voice problems such as hoarseness, breathiness, vocal fatigue, loss of vocal pitch range, laryngeal discomfort, tightness, irritation with frequent coughing or throat clearance, or altered sensation are candidates for videostroboscopy. Patients who recently underwent laryngeal or neck surgery, are undergoing voice therapy, or require oncological surveillance may also be candidates. Videostroboscopy is usuallyÂ performed after visualization of the pharyngeal and laryngeal anatomy with flexible nasolaryngoscopy.
