Absolute contraindications to diving include spontaneous pneumothorax, acute asthma with abnormal PFTs, cystic or cavitary lung disease, obstructive or restrictive lung disease, seizures, atrial septal defect (ASD), symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic perforated TM, inability to equalize sinus or middle ear pressure, or intra-orbital gas.

Middle ear barotrauma can be prevented by avoiding diving with significant nasal congestion, descending feet first, descending at a slow rate with the use of an anchor line, and avoiding forceful Valsalva at depth or upon ascent. When someone fails to equalize pressures passively, they may perform one of many equalizing techniques to open the Eustachian tube and allow free gas exchange. These include Valsalva, yawning, swallowing, wiggling jaw, Toynbee, Edmonds, among others. Prophylaxis with pseudoephedrine or nasal steroids before dives has been shown to decrease the incidence of middle ear barotrauma.

Including other gases (such as hydrogen or nitrogen) into the helium-oxygen mixture suppresses the neurological effects of HPNS. Also, because faster compression rate and higher maximum pressure experienced by a diver lead to more severe presentations of HPNS, divers should not dive to depths greater than 500 feet and should descend slowly or incorporate stops during compression to avoid HPNS.
