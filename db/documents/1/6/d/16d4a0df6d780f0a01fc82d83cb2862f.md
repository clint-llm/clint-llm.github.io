- The nasal bones are the most frequently fractured in the maxillofacial area.

- A high percentage of patients with nasal bone fractures will also have an injury to the nasal septum, which may go unrecognized.

- In isolated nasal bone fractures, imaging studies should be avoided unless the history or physical examination suggests more extensive injuries.

- Closed reduction of the nasal bones is best performed before two weeks to achieve better cosmetic outcomes.

- Septoplasty should be considered in the acute setting for a severely deviated or fractured septum without extensive mucosal injury.

- Septorhinoplasty for residual nasal deformity or nasal obstruction should be delayed 3 to 6 months to allow lacerations and cartilaginous injuries to heal.
