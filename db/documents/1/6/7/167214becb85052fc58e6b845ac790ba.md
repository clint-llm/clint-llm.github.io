The primary function of the motor cortex is to plan and create electrical impulses that cause voluntary muscle contractions. The nerves that come out of the motor cortex can be either cranial nerves or spinal nerves. Cranial nerves come directly from the brainstem, whereas spinal nerves emerge from the spinal cord. There are several cranial nerves (CN) that have a motor function, including CN III (oculomotor nerve), CN IV (trochlear nerve), CN V (trigeminal nerve), CN VI (abducens nerve), CN VII (facial nerve), CN IX (glossopharyngeal nerve), CN X (vagus nerve), and CN XI (accessory nerve) and CN XII (hypoglossal nerve). CN III, CN IV, and CN VI are involved in eye movement. CN V innervates the muscles of mastication. CN VII allows movement of the facial muscles. CN IX innervates the stylopharyngeus muscle, which allows for movement of the pharynx and larynx.Â CN X has many functions that play a role in speaking and swallowing. CN XI is involved with shoulder shrugging and head-turning with innervation of the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid, respectively. CN XII innervates most muscles of the tongue.

**Supplementary Motor Area**

Primarily, the supplementary motor area projects to the motor cortex. It appears to be involved mainly in programming in motor sequencing. Any lesions of this area in monkeys produce awkwardness in performing complex activities with bimanual coordination.

When humans count to themselves without speaking, the motor cortex is quiescent, but when they count, the number out loud as they count, blood flow increases in the motor cortex and the supplementary motor area. Furthermore, the supplementary motor area, as well as the motor cortex, is involved in the voluntary movements when the movements being performed are complex and require planning. The blood flow increases whether or not a planned movement is carried out. The increase in blood flow occurs whether the movement is performed by the contralateral or the ipsilateral hand.
