A trendelenburg gait is an abnormal gait resulting from a defective hip abductor mechanism. The primary musculature involved is the gluteal musculature, including the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus muscles. The weakness of these muscles causes drooping of the pelvis to the contralateral side while walking. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of trendenlenburg gait and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of the trendenlenburg gait.
- Identify conditions that may lead to a trendenlenburg gait.
- Explain management strategies for a trendenlenburg gait.
- Outline the importance of enhancing care coordination among the interprofessional team to ensure proper evaluation and management of trendenlenburg gait.
