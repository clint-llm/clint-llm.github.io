Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis is characterized primarily by hepatolithiasis both within the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. These calculi, formed for the most part by calcium bilirubinate, do not necessarily cause biliary obstruction (unlike cholesterol stones implicated in biliary colic) but initiate a cycle of inflammation and biliary stricture formation withinÂ a dilated biliary tree. This in itself exposes the biliary tree to ascending translocation of mainly coliform bacteria from the gut (such as E.coli), the process of which is responsible for the acute-on-chronic cholangitic presentation that recurrent pyogenic cholangitis is known for.

The role of helminthic infection is unclear, but it is thought that chronic infection with trematodes such as Clonorchis sinensis and nematodes such as Ascaris lumbricoides aid the inflammatory process and dampen the immune response, allowing for further bacterial translocation, epithelial fibrosis and scarring, and subsequent stricture formation.
