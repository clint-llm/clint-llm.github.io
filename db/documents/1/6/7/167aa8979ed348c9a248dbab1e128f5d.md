The treatment of patients with Hellervorden Spatz disease or PKAN is mostly symptomatic. The tremors best respond to dopaminergic agents.  For rigidity and spasticity, dopamine agonists and anticholinergic agent alone or in combination may be used.  Intrathecal or oral Baclofen in moderate doses relieves the stiffness and spasms and can reduce dystonia.  Intramuscular botulinum toxin has also been used for the alleviation of hypertonicity.  Benzodiazepines have been used for choreoathetotic movements. Medications such as methscopolamine bromide can be attempted for excessive drooling. Dysarthria could respond to medications employed for rigidity and spasticity. A multidisciplinary team approach including physical and speech therapy, swallowing evaluation, dietary assessment, gastrostomy tube feeding and computer-assisted devices may be used in advanced cases and to improve functional and communication skills.

Dementia is gradual and progressive, and usually, doesn't respond to treatments.  Affected individuals with recurrent tongue biting due to severe Oro buccolingual dystonia,  bite blocks, and full-mouth dental extraction may be the only effective measure.  The use of systemic chelating agents, such as desferrioxamine, has been attempted to remove excess iron from the brain, but it didn't prove beneficial. Research and trials for the administration of coenzyme A and high dosage of pantothenate are still in progress. However, no conclusive data is available.
