Nocardiosis is an infectious disease caused by Nocardia that classically manifests as an opportunistic infection in immunocompromised hosts. Pulmonary nocardiosis and disseminated forms of the infection are opportunistic diseases occurring mainly in patients deficient in T cell-mediated immunity. Patients with the greatest susceptibility to this include those with solid organ transplant, hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients, patients taking corticosteroids chronically, or patients with ongoing malignant processes. Primary cutaneous nocardiosis may occur in immunocompetent patients after direct inoculation of the microorganism into the skin after trauma, which most commonly occurs in those working in rural areas in agriculture. This activity describes the risk factors, evaluation, and management of nocardiosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in enhancing care delivery for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the population in which nocardiosis typically occurs.
- Describe the common presentation of nocardiosis. 
- Review the management of nocardiosis. 
- Explain the importance of enhancing care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients with nocardiosis.
