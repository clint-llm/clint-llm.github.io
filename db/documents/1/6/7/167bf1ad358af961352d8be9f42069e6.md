The types of azoospermia can be classified as either testicular/post-testicular or obstructive/non-obstructive; both appear in the table below. We find the classification based on obstruction to be more useful and practical.

The exact pathophysiology of azoospermia is not always known. However, in such cases, azoospermia mainly occurs due to abnormal ciliary function and poor mucus quality.

Pretesticular causes are endocrinal abnormalities related to the hypothalamus, pituitary, and male gonads (testis). In addition, testicular causes usually involve disorders related to spermatogenesis. Posttesticular causes of azoospermia include any ductal obstruction at any site in the entire male reproductive tract.

**Pretesticular Causes**

Pretesticular causes, also called secondary testicular failure, usually result from pathological endocrine conditions. Although relatively uncommon, up to 3% of infertile men with subfertility will have underlying endocrinopathies.

Pretesticular azoospermia can be congenital or acquired. Pretesticular azoospermia may be seen in association with the following:

- Kallmann syndrome: These are defects seen at the level of the hypothalamus where there is a failure of GnRH hormone secretion (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism). In Kallmann syndrome, it occurs due to failure in the migration of GnRH-releasing neurons to the olfactory lobe, which explains the presence of a decreased sense of smell in affected individuals.

- Hyperprolactinemia: Hyperprolactinemia is the excessive production of prolactin hormone.

- Mumps orchitis: It may lead to testicular atrophy on both sides and may lead to infertility in 13% of cases.

- Klinefelter Syndrome: It is characterized by a tall eunuchoid phenotype, decreased facial and pubertal hair, decreased penis size, hard testicles, decreased cognitive abilities, and decreased testosterone levels.

**Post-testicular Causes of Azoospermia**

- Congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD): Its incidence is 1% amongst infertile men. It mainly occurs due to mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator gene (CFTR) and defective mesonephric duct differentiation.

- Vasal obstruction: Incidences of unintended vasal obstruction are usually seen after corrective surgeries for inguinal canal hernias.

- Obstruction of epididymis: Obstruction of the epididymis is present in Young syndrome, which is a triad of chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis, and obstructive azoospermia.

- Obstruction of the ejaculatory ducts: Obstruction of the ejaculatory ducts of unilateral or bilateral.

**Types of Azoospermia and Causes**

**Obstructive Azoospermia**

**Non-obstructive Azoospermia**

**A.  Congenital**

- Congenital unilateral absence of the vas deferens (CUAVD) or congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD)

- Partial or complete absence of the epididymis

- Karyotype abnormalities

- Young syndrome

**B.  Endocrinological**

- GnRH, LH, FSH deficiency

- Excess of androgens, estrogen, prolactin, glucocorticoids

- Thyroid disorders

- Androgen insensitivity

**C. Acquired**

- Chemotherapy exposure

- Iatrogenic: vasectomy; injury following inguinal hernia repair; vasography; post-hydrocelectomy; percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration (PESA); microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration (MESA); epididymal biopsy, spermatocelectomy.

- Radiation exposure

- Surgeries performed for hernia repair, bilateral vasectomies, spermatoceles, epididymal resections

**D. Infections and inflammatory conditions**

- Epididymitis and orchitis

- Prostatitis

- Lower genitourinary infections

**A. Congenital**

- Congenital absence of vas deferens

- Ejaculatory duct obstruction or cysts

- Obstruction at the prostatic utricle

- Malformation of the excurrent ductal system

- Cryptorchidism

- Congenital varicocele

- Klinefelter syndrome

- Microdeletions of the Y chromosome (AZFa, AZFb, and AZFc subregions)

**B. Endocrinological causes**

- Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism: congenital (Kallmann syndrome); acquired (pituitary tumors)

- Hyperprolactinemia

- Congenital adrenal hyperplasia

- Hypothyroidism

- Hyperprolactinemia

**C. Inflammatory conditions**

- Epididymo-orchitis

- Prostatitis

**D. Iatrogenic**

- Drugs or medical therapy
