Bochdalek hernias tend to present differently in pediatric and adult age groups.  In the pediatric age group, the presentation is often with respiratory symptoms from lung hypoplasia after mechanical compression of developing lung parenchyma in utero. In contrast, Bochdalek hernias in adults are usually asymptomatic and incidentally found.  Symptoms in adults often manifest as vague or nonspecific gastrointestinal complaints.
