The World Health Organization categorizes neonatal sepsis as early or late based on the age of onset. Early neonatal sepsis affects infants less than 72 hours of age ( some experts will extend it to 7 days), whereas late-onset infections are seen in infants between 72 hours and 28 days of age. Early recognition and treatment are necessary to decrease the significant morbidity and mortality in this age group associated with neonatal sepsis. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of neonatal sepsis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in these patients' care.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of neonatal sepsis.
- Describe the evaluation of neonatal sepsis.
- Explain the management options available for neonatal sepsis.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and management of neonatal sepsis, and improve outcomes.
