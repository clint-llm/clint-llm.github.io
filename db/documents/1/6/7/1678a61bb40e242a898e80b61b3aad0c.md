Evaluation of actinic keratoses is primarily by clinical observation during the physical examination. In some cases, useful diagnostic adjuncts to the clinical exam may include dermoscopy or biopsy. On dermoscopy, non-pigmented facial AKs are characterized by a “strawberry pattern” and include an erythematous vessel pseudo network, prominent follicular openings, and a surrounding white halo.

A shave or punch biopsy may be recommended in cases of diagnostic uncertainty, failure to respond to treatment, or in situations where one wants to determine whether an AK has progressed to squamous cell carcinoma.
