Splints may be applied by medical personnel with a wide range of clinical backgrounds. Regardless of experience, basic knowledge about proper splint application and complications allows teams to work together to care for patients effectively. Following fracture splinting, follow up care should be coordinated for the patient to ensure improving clinical status. Often this coordination occurs between emergency physicians or first responders and primary care physicians or pediatricians for injuries that do not require specialty level care or operative fixation. This is particularly relevant in the case of pediatric forearm fractures, where most patients receive follow-up care with primary care physicians and not orthopedic specialists.

Articles and videos have been developed to help educate medical personnel to improve provider splint application.
