Points to remember:

- The acute scrotum should be approached similarly to the acute abdomen.

- The differential diagnosis is broad but may be narrowed based on the patient’s demographics, risk factors, history and physical examination.

- The most common etiology of acute scrotal pain in adults is epididymitis/epididymo-orchitis.

- Suspected testicular torsion is a time-dependent surgical emergency and consultation should be not delayed.

- The most appropriate imaging modality is usually Doppler ultrasound.

- Despite “classic” presentations, a cremasteric reflex does not definitively confirm nor exclude torsion, and the testicle may be salvageable long after the 6-hour window.
