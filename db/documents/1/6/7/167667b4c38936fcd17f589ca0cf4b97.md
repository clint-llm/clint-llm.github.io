Shoulder subluxation is defined as partial or incomplete dislocation of the glenohumeral joint or translation between the humeral head and glenoid fossa while the humeral head is in contact with the glenoid fossa. The weakness of rotator cuff muscles or laxity of the glenohumeral ligaments causes the humeral head to slip out of the glenoid fossa easily and results in glenohumeral subluxation. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of shoulder subluxation and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the diagnostic approach for evaluating shoulder subluxation injuries.
- Summarize the pathophysiology and mechanism of the three different etiologies of shoulder subluxations.
- Review treatment and management options for patients with shoulder subluxation injuries.
- Discuss the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members to perform maneuvers, which will improve outcomes for those with shoulder subluxations.
