The corneal epithelium contains thousands of nerve endings that lend it high sensitivity to contact with foreign objects. Long ciliary nerves from the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (V1) carry sensory innervation of the cornea. The density of nociceptors in the cornea is estimated at 300 to 600 times that of skin. The ciliary nerves form mid-stromal, subepithelial/sub-basal, and epithelial networks.
