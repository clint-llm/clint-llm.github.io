The differential diagnosis of cervical polyps can be extensive as symptomatic patients usually present with abnormal uterine bleeding.

Abnormal uterine bleeding may happen due to different etiologies, such as:

- Uterine fibroid.

- Endometrial hyperplasia and malignancy.

- Endometriosis.

- Adenomyosis.

- Cervical ectropion.

- Cervical cancer.

- Surface lesions of the genital tract.

- Sexually transmitted infections.

- Pregnancy-related conditions, i.e., ectopic pregnancy

- During the gynecological examination, an endometrial polyp projecting through the cervical canal may resemble a cervical polyp if it is in the cervix.
