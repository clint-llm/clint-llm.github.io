Keratometer or ophthalmometer is an instrument used to measure the anterior corneal curvature and the axis and extent of astigmatism.

The keratometry is based on the principle that the anterior corneal surface behaves like a mirror and the image size varies with the corneal curvature. Hence the radius of curvature of the cornea can be calculated based on image size from the anterior corneal surface.

In a keratometer, the relationship between the object, image, radius of refractive surface, and distance between the surface and object is denoted as r = 2ul/ o, where r is the radius of the reflective surface, o is the object size, l is the image size, and u is the distance measured between the reflective surface and object.

There can be surgical or operating keratometers as well as automated keratometers. The activity describes various types of keratometers, parts of a keratometer, indications of keratometry, limitations, complications, patient safety, education, and clinical significance of a keratometer.
