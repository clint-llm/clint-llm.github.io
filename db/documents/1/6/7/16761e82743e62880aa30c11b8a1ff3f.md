Lanugo is detectable on a physical exam, and it is fine, thin, soft, and depigmented hair. If the suspicion is that lanugo is due to other diseases, a more thorough systemic workup is necessary.Â This assessment includes psychiatric evaluation for anorexia and bulimia nervosa, complete blood count (CBC), complete metabolic panel (CMP), and the search for other tumor markers indicative of a teratoma. The clinician should note the degree of lanugo presence and its distribution as well, as this can correlate with disease severity.
