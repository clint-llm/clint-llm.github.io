As it is a rare and clinically polymorphic pathology, no controlled prospective therapeutic study could be conducted to validate a certain treatment. The treatments are only suspensive and poorly efficient. In patients with relatively few non-scarring lesions, therapeutic abstention can be considered. Disabling or cosmetically disturbing forms can be attenuated or controlled with weekly doses of 5 to 20 mg of methotrexate. Used orally, subcutaneously, or intramuscularly, methotrexate is the systemic treatment of choice for lymphomatoid papulosis, regardless of histological type.

The treatment of the child's papulosis poses difficulties because of the particularÂ therapeutic risk of phototherapy at this age and the fear of using methotrexate in pediatrics. Most authors recommend therapeutic abstention or the use of very strong topical corticosteroids on papules at the initial inflammatory stages. The risk of scarring of the lesions may lead to general treatment, and ultraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy will be preferred, although its results in children are inconsistent.

Because of the potential risk for developing a systemic lymphoma, long-term follow-up is required in all patients with lymphomatoid papulosis.
