Contact a medical toxicologist or regional poison control center for all symptomatic and asymptomatic exposures to aromatic hydrocarbons or hydrocarbons with toxic additives.

Further observation or hospitalization is required for patients with symptomatic hydrocarbon exposure.

For toluene, the patient should be admitted to correct renal tubular acidosis, hypokalemia, and/or rhabdomyolysis.

For benzene, consult hematologist/oncologist for further evaluation of hematological abnormality.

**Pearls**:

- The hallmarks of acute toluene toxicity include renal tubular acidosis and hypokalemic paralysis.

- Benzene toxicity can cause hematological disorders such as aplastic anemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, and multiple myeloma.
