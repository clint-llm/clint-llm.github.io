Doppler liver ultrasonography constitutes an effective and non-invasive means of evaluating the hepatic vasculature. Understanding the normal and abnormal waveforms for the primary hepatic vessels and their characteristic waveforms can help diagnose specific diseases that have a characteristic effect on these waveform patterns. It is important to understand how an abnormal hepatic artery, hepatic vein, or portal vein manifests on Doppler sonography and can help identify or confirm diseases affecting the liver. Hepatic doppler ultrasound is a part of the abdominal ultrasound examination. It is used to assess the patency of the hepatic vasculature and the direction and velocity of blood flow. This activity examines the use of Doppler ultrasound in hepatic assessment.

**Objectives:**
- Review the indications for hepatic Doppler ultrasound and its significance in clinical practice.
- Review the limitations of hepatic Doppler ultrasound.
- Describe the anatomy of the hepatic vessels as shown on Doppler ultrasound.
- Explain the types of flow in hepatic Doppler ultrasound.
