**Involvement of Patient and Family**

The patient and family can assist in making informed decision-making regarding continuing or discontinuing opioid therapy. Family members are often aware of when a patient is depressed and less functional. Questions to ask the family include:

- Is the patient's day focused on taking opioid pain medication?

- What is the frequency of pain medication?

- Does the patient haveÂ any other alcohol or drug problems?

- Does the patient avoid activity?

- Is the patient depressed?

- Is the patient able to function?****

**What To Teach A Patient Taking Opioids**

- Avoid driving or operating power equipment.

- Avoid stoping opioids suddenly.

- Avoid taking other drugs that depress the respiratory system as alcohol, sedatives, and anxiolytics.

- Contact prescribing if pain medication is not adequate for relief.

- Destroy opioids based on product-specific disposal information (usually flushing down the toilet or mixing with cat litter or coffee grounds)

- Do not chew tables

- Do not share opioids with friends or family.

- Follow the dosing regimen as prescribed.

- Provide product-specific information

- Take opioids only as prescribed.
