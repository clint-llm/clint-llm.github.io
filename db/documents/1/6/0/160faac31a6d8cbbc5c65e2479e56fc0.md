The first person to recognize an eye injury should intervene and place a rigid eye shield over the eye. Nurses are vital in keeping the patient calm before the repair. Control of pain and nausea before and after the repair is necessary. Antibiotics should be administered at the onset of the injury and continued throughout the recovery period.

Any member of the care team should speak up if they notice anything unsafe or have any concerns.
