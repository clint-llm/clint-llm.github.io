It is important to reinforce to patients that Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease is a systemic disease and one that can relapse and recur. Untreated recurrent episodes of the disease lead to progressively worse outcomes, and patients often require lifelong immunosuppressive therapy. Patients should be educated on the various manifestations of the disease to recognize when their condition is relapsing.
