A thorough history and physical exam are necessary including a family history of hypospadias. Today, the diagnosis of hypospadias is made soon after birth. Key features include a glandular groove and a dorsal hood of the foreskin but in almost all cases the prepuce is incomplete ventrally. In addition, the urethral meatus is usually in an abnormal location. If the infant has a complete foreskin, the hypospadias may become obvious after circumcision. Any hypospadias discovered on circumcision should immediately be referred to a urologist; the circumcision should be halted.

Some patients may have an associated penile curvature which may be obvious during an erection.
