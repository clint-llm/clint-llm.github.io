Anhidrosis is the inability to sweat. It is important to recognize anhidrosis as it can be potentially life-threatening due to heat-related illnesses.

Causes of central/neuropathic anhidrosis can occur at any level of innervation.

Peripheral alterations that cause anhidrosis can be congenital or acquired. In addition, forms of peripheral alterations can be due to genetic abnormalities such as incontinentia pigmenti, due to local destruction, for example, by a tumor, or obstruction by entities such as psoriasis.

As heat intolerance may be due to various underlying disorders, a detailed history is important in establishing the diagnosis. Heat intolerance can cause drowsiness, episodic inability to concentrate while in a hot environment, or fatigue, along with a decrease in the patient's normal sweating, which are clues to the diagnosis of anhidrosis. A detailed history should also include the addition of medications, medical events such as injuries, growths or radiation, alcohol consumption, the presence of autoimmune disease or diabetes mellitus, and family history.
