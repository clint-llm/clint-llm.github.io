Diagnosis can be established with an antecedent history of trauma and neuroimaging modalities such as plain radiographs, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Imaging is imperative to define the extent of primary skull fracture and associated encephalomalacia, aid in surgical planning, and exclude other pathologies.

- **Plain X-ray skull-**early phase shows the diastatic fracture. Late lesions may show lytic lesions with scalloped margins.

- **CT brain**- In addition to the findings in the plain radiograph, the early phase shows concurrent lesions, with brain contusions being the most common finding.

- **MRI**-The main advantage of MRI is early detection of the defect in the dura and concurrent herniated brain elements in high risks patients.
- Cephalhematoma
- Bone diastasis of 4 mm or more, and
- Underlying brain contusion should ideally have a contrast brain MRI to find out the dural tear and herniation of the brain matter.

- **Color Doppler imaging-**useful for newborns who develop leptomeningeal cysts due to birth trauma.

- Seizures warrant evaluation with an **electroencephalogram**.

**Three primary types of LMCs:**

- Type 1- contains a leptomeningeal cyst in the calvarial defect.

- Type 2-contains encephalomalacia and gliotic brain tissue in the defect, or

- Type 3- contains a porencephalic cyst in the subgaleal space in the subperiosteal layer.
