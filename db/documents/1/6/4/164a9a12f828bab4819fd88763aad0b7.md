Both kidneys are retroperitoneal structures on either side of the vertebral column. The right kidney is located slightly lower than the left kidney because of the liver. Each kidney is about three vertebrae in length. Both adrenal glands are superior to the kidneys within the renal (Gerota's) fascia. The left and right kidney are on top of the psoas major and quadratus lumborum muscles.
