Diffuse intramural esophageal diverticulosis is a rare benign disease. It is suggested that there are only about 200 reports published all around the world. Moreover, in one study, which looked at 14,350 barium swallow esophagrams, this clinical entity was identified only in 21 patients who underwent the diagnostic procedure (that is about 0.15%).
