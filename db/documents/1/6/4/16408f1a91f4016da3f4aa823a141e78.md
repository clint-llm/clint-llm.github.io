Cannabis intoxication, cannabis withdrawal, and cannabis use disorder: the differential may include intoxication syndromes from other substances. These may include amphetamine or cocaine intoxication, withdrawal from benzodiazepines or hypnotics, atrial tachycardia, an anxiety disorder, and panic attacks. A thorough medical history, psychiatric history, substance use history, family psychiatric and medical history, medication review, toxicology screen, and blood alcohol level are needed. Endogenous psychiatric disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder or a primary psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia spectrum disorder will typically demonstrate symptomology before and long after cessation of cannabis. Collateral sources, typically from family members, long-standing friends, or other providers, can help.
