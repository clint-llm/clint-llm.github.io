Fine needle aspiration (FNA) dates back to the 1930s when Martin and Ellis first described the procedure and its potential implications in the medical field. Over time the role of ultrasound-guided FNA evolved as an important tool in assessing thyroid nodules. This activity describes and outlines fine-needle aspiration of a thyroid nodule with ultrasound guidance. It also reviews the role of proper technique in the successful acquisition of thyroid cells for cytopathologic review.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for ultrasound-guided thyroid nodule FNA.
- Outline the different steps in preparing the patient for an ultrasound-guided thyroid FNA.
- Explain the proper technique involved in the adequate acquisition of aspirate samples.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication between the interprofessional team members to safely perform the procedure.
