Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are a class of antidepressants. The use of MAOIs has declined in the past few decades due to the introduction of newer antidepressants, making the incidence of toxicity rare. They have the potential to interact with many other medications and certain foods to produce nonspecific symptoms which can range from mild to life-threatening. MAOI toxicity can be difficult to distinguish from much more common clinical entities. Prompt recognition and intervention are vital to treatment. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of monoamine oxidase inhibitor toxicity and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of monoamine oxidase inhibitor toxicity.
- Review the presentation of monoamine oxidase inhibitor toxicity.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for monoamine oxidase inhibitor toxicity.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by monoamine oxidase inhibitor toxicity.
