Mood is defined as a pervasive and sustained feeling tone that is endured internally and which impacts nearly all aspects of a personâ€™s behavior in the external world. Mood disorders are described by marked disruptions in emotions (severe lows called depression or highs called hypomania or mania). These include bipolar disorder, cyclothymia, hypomania, major depressive disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, persistent depressive disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. These are common psychiatric disorders leading to an increase in morbidity and mortality.
