Excessive alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking are intrinsic to the development of glottic cancers, with the continuation of smoking resulting in poorer functional outcomes, reduced survival, and a higher rate of recurrence. Moreover, cessation of smoking after 1 to 4 years can result in a significant risk reduction in developing laryngeal cancer, reaching the level of never-smokers after 20 years.
