Transmission of hepatitis B involves the transfer of the virus from infected people to non-immune people in various ways. Major modes of transmission for hepatitis B are as follows:

1. Horizontal transmission: It involves the transmission of hepatitis B through sexual contact or mucosal surface contact. Unprotected sex and injection drug use are major modes of transmission in low to intermediate prevalence areas.

2. Vertical transmission: Vertical transmission involves the maternal-to-newborn perinatal transmission of the virus.

Sexual contact includes unprotected intercourse (vaginal, oral, or anal) and mucosal contact involves any contact involving an infected patientâ€™s saliva, vaginal secretion, semen, and blood.

Prevalence areas are based on the percentage of the population with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity with greater than or equal to 8% representing high prevalence areas, 2-7% representing low to intermediate prevalence areas, and less than 2% representing low prevalence areas.
