The vast majority of patients with perioral dermatitis are diagnosed clinically, although skin biopsy should be considered with an atypical presentation or lack of response to treatment. If a bacterial component is suspected, a culture may be obtained. Additionally, a scraping and potassium hydroxide (KOH) prep can be done if Candida is considered to be contributing to the lesions. With a more severe disease presentation, diascopy can be performed by an experienced clinician.
