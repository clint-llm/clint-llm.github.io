Hearing aids are prescribed for children with hearing loss to allow them audible access to speech and environmental sounds. This is crucial for normal expressive and receptive development, similar to their hearing peers. Healthcare professionals must consider several hearing aid fittings considerations to ensure precision. Such factors include hearing level, device choice, and family counseling. This activity describes the indications, equipment, and technique for hearing aid fitting in pediatric populations with hearing loss. It also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in supporting the family to achieve optimal benefits from the device.
