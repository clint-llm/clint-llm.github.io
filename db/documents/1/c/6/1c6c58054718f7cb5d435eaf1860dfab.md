The parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) stimulates peristalsis via the myenteric plexus. The afferent (sensory) nerves of the myenteric plexus deliver information to interneurons within the plexus. Interneurons communicate with efferent nerves, stimulating an action potential (spike-wave) within smooth muscle cells. The afferent nerves are stimulated by two mechanisms: (1) reflexive (stretch or chemoreceptors) or (2) parasympathetic stimulation (via acetylcholine).

The smooth muscle cells responsible for peristalsis include the inner circular and outer longitudinal layers of muscle, collectively called the muscularis propria. Reflexive stimulation of afferent nerves begins when a food bolus causes stretch within the intestines. The efferent signal causes the inner circular muscles just before the bolus to contract and push the bolus forward while also causing the outer longitudinal muscles to contract and shorten the tube. At the same time, descending inhibitory reflexes cause the circular muscles just beyond the bolus to relax, allowing for forward movement of the bolus. The bolus moves a few centimeters during each peristalsis wave, and the process starts over again.

Two types of peristalsis occur within the esophagus: primary and secondary. Primary esophageal peristalsis is a continuation of pharyngeal peristalsis, initiated by swallowing, and acts to move contents from the esophagus into the stomach. Should primary peristalsis fail to move the entirety of the bolus into the stomach, distension of the esophagus will initiate secondary esophageal peristalsis until all contents are cleared.
