History and physical examination should help tailor case evaluation and diagnosis; however, cranial imaging should be performed in all patients with suspected subdural empyema.

Laboratory workup can add evidence to the suspected diagnosis. Leukocytosis can be seen, indicating an active process of infection. Immunocompromised or immunosuppressed patients will not always present with elevated white blood cells on complete blood count. Depending on the patientâ€™s immune response, bacterial infections can cause a leftward shift with associated neutrophilia. Further laboratory workup, including serum inflammation markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, could add evidence as these are considered acute phase reactants. In cases of infections, some clinicians may recommend blood culture samples to try direct antibiotic therapy early in the disease course; however, in the case of subdural empyema, these rarely identify an organism due to the capsulated nature of the infection.

Spinal puncture is not indicated for the diagnosis and can be dangerous in those patients with increased intracranial pressure and empyemas, causing mass effect.
