The reaction pattern of fever, arthralgia, and lesions of erythema nodosum, though suggestive are not specific for sarcoidosis. Reactions may be idiopathic or caused by several other triggers including:

- Medication-induced causes of penicillin, sulfa drugs, oral contraceptives, immunizations

- Infections such as Streptococcus, enteric bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis

- Other systemic inflammatory diseases like inflammatory bowel disease, lupus, Behcet disease

- Pregnancy

Approximately 10% to 22% of cases of erythema nodosum are attributable to sarcoidosis. A thorough medical history can help distinguish between many of the above causes of erythema nodosum. Tuberculosis should be ruled out with either Tuberculin skin test or QuantiFERON gold. Combination of classic radiographic pulmonary findings of bilateral hilar adenopathy can assist in confirming the diagnosis of Lofgren syndrome. As discussed above, if syndrome does not follow the classic timeline alternative diagnosis should be considered, and histologic confirmation of disease is necessary.
