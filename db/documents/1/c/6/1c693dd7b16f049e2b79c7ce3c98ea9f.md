**Laboratory Studies**:

Arylsulfatase A enzyme activity in leukocytes or cultured skin fibroblasts may be decreased.

- Urine sulfatide levels

- Radiolabeled sulfatide fibroblast loading

- DNA mutation analysis or next-generation sequencing- biallelic ARSA pathogenic variants

**Imaging Studies**

Brain MRI shows T2-weighted FLAIR symmetric and confluent hyperintensities diffusely on the frontal and parietal periventricular white matter, which are characteristic of the diseases but nonspecific. T1-weighted images tend to be hypointense, given it is a demyelinating disorder. A normal MRI does not exclude metachromatic leukodystrophy.

Ultrasound or CT abdomen may reveal hyperplastic gallbladder polyps, which can predispose for gallbladder carcinoma.

**Additional Tests**

The following tests can be conducted with could further help in diagnosing the case.

- Nerve conduction and ENG studies

- EMG- can show a demyelinating polyneuropathy pattern affecting both compound muscle (CMAPs) and sensory action potentials (SNAPs)

- Neurocognitive, neuropsychological testing, or both

**Procedures**

- Lumbar Puncture:****Elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein concentrations may be helpful to arrive at the diagnosis.

- Peripheral nerve biopsy: usually not performed, but may show metachromatic lipid deposits

**Newborn Screening**

- It is still under development. It uses mass spectrometry. However, it can not be distinguished from pseudo deficiency.
