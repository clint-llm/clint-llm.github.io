Lupus erythematosus (LE) is an inflammatory connective tissue disorder characterized by pathogenic autoantibodies, immune complex formation, deposition, and attributed to the loss of immune tolerance. Dermatological manifestations of lupus constitute one of the diagnostic criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Cutaneous findings in lupus encompass a broad spectrum of findings and may exist with systemic involvement as well as independent of SLE.

This activity will discussÂ subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE). SCLE is a subtype of CLE presenting as symmetric, non-scarring photosensitive erythematous rash usually over syn-exposed areas like face, neck, arms, upper back, and shoulders.
