The prevalence of SAA in general population is reportedto be less than 1%, as most of the SAAs remain asymptomatic and therefore go undetected. A recent retrospective study found that 78% of SAAs occur in women. Mortality because of splenic aneurysm rupture in non-pregnant patients ranges from 25% to 40%. However, maternal mortality due to SAA rupture increases up to 75%, and fetal mortality increases as high as 95%.
