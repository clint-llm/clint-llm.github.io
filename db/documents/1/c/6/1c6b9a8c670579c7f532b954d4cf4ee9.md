Ensuring proper fluid analysis with gram stain and culture is vital to the purpose of arthrocentesis. It is essential to communicate fluid analysis orders with the lab technician and if able to walk the fluid specimens directly to the lab to ensure timely fluid analysis. Clear communication will prevent unnecessary use of long-term empiric antibiotics and improve patient therapy by tailoring the treatment to the proper diagnosis.
