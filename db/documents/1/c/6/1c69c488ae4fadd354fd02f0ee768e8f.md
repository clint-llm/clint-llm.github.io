Since the cardiovascular manifestations result from intrauterine damage to the developing fetus, antiviral therapy in the newborn period would not be expected to have much impact on the sequelae. However, if the infant develops clinical signs of active infection, acyclovir should be administered intravenously. The therapy duration is determined based on control of active VZV replication with either cessation of new skin lesion formation or with negative VZV PCR testing.

If a mother develops chickenpox infection during the high-risk time period for neonatal varicella infection (5 days before through 2 days after delivery), infants should receive Varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) immediately after birth or as soon after the maternal symptoms appear in the two days after delivery.  Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) is an alternative if VZIG is unavailable. Infants should be treated even if the mother was also administered VZIG. These infants should be monitored carefully, and early treatment with intravenous acyclovir should be administered for breakthrough varicella infection.
