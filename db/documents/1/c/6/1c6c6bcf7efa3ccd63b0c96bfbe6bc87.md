Training is a vital part of disaster preparedness. Healthcare workers in Boston have credited their effective response to the Boston Marathon bombing to their training and preparedness exercises. Without training and preparation physicians working or volunteering in a disaster situation have the potential to hinder the disaster response or become a victim themselves.

When disasters occur, physicians will be expected to provide care for disaster victims. More and more medical schools have started providing disaster training for students; however, relatively few schools require any significant training for medical students. Residents receive variable amounts of training based on the program and specialty. Emergency medicine residents appear to receive more training than other residency programs, but the number of hours is minimal, and methods of training vary by program. Practicing physicians have opportunities for training available through organizations such as FEMA or the National Disaster Life Support Foundation and hospitals are required to conduct disaster exercises; however, physicians must seek out these opportunities.

Physicians in all specialties should consider their potential roles in a disaster and attempt to prepare for these roles. Disasters are unpredictable. Preparation is vitally important. Disaster training and exercises can help physicians plan for and successfully respond to the next natural or human-made disaster.
