Gastric lymphoma accounts for only 3% of gastric cancers but is the most common location for extranodal Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas. These indolent cancers are often composed of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) with heterogeneous B-cells located in the stomach or diffuse large B-cells (more often high grade). More than 90% of Gastric MALT Lymphomas are associated with Helicobacter pylori infections.Â For this reason, treatment of H. pylori remains a key factor in treating gastric lymphomas.
