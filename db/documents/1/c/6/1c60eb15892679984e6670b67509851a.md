The management of the parainfluenza virus is best done with an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals that includes a nurse, a primary clinician, an infectious disease expert, a pediatrician, an epidemiologist, a pharmacist, and in the more severe cases, the ICU team is also involved. Once a diagnosis of the parainfluenza virus is made, the key is to prevent further spread of the infection. The primary clinician and the nurse are in the prime position to educate the patient and the family about the importance of the prevention measures, including isolation and physical distancing.

Management of an outbreak of the parainfluenza virus is an interprofessional work, requiring the participation and the mobilization of not just the team within the hospital settings managing the patient, but also local resources to contain the spread of the disease as early as possible. It is especially important in the immunocompromised, neonatal, and elderly care facilities, to identify infected individuals, educate the population, and prevent further transmission.

National resources such as the centers for disease control (CDC) as well as the global resources such as the world health organization (WHO), must be informed to assists in managing the local cases, prevent further spread, identify the origin of the outbreak, provide diagnostic aid from high-level biosafety laboratories, and provide experimental treatment options.
