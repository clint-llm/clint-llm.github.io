Leydig cells are essential and crucial cells located in the testes of the male gonads. They are known as testicular interstitial cells and can be found between seminiferous tubules, which contain Sertoli and germ cells. Together, these three cell types maintain spermatogenesis, control hormonal regulation, and affect secondary sexual characteristics in males. Leydig cells are under hormonal regulation by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. These cells can be associated with some pathologic changes or cancerous malformation.
