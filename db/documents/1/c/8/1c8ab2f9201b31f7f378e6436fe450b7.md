Dressler syndrome, also known as postmyocardial infarction syndrome, is a form of secondary pericarditis with or without pericardial effusion that occurs as a result of injury to the heart or pericardium. Given its wide-ranging clinical presentation, Dressler syndrome can be difficult for health professionals to recognize. This activity reviews the clinical presentation, evaluation, and management of patients with Dressler syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the clinical presentation of a patient with Dressler syndrome.
