In general terms, the most common complications of MMS include pain, wound dehiscence, hematoma, infection, and flap failure. Each subsite carries aesthetic and functional complication risks specific to the surrounding structures of the surgical site, which were previously discussed.

Certain factors do exist; however, that may increase the risk of complications after undergoing facial reconstruction for MMS defects

- smoking status

- size of the defect

- full-thickness defects

- interpolated flaps with cartilage grafting

- use of composite grafts.

NOTE: delayed repair does not increase the risk of infection or flap failure, and may, in fact, lessen the risk of complications.

All procedures result in some scarring, which warrants postoperative attention. If an unsightly scar occurs after routine wound care, multiple methods exist to improve the appearance of the scar, which is beyond the scope of this paper.
