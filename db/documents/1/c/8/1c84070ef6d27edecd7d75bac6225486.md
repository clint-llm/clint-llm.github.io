Numerous patient conditions have been identified that predispose patients to an increased risk of secondary and interfacility transport.  These conditions include ALTEs, seizures, respiratory distress, isolated orthopedic injuries (particularly of the upper arm and elbow), as well as children with special health care needs. Significantly, all these conditions can be accurately assessed by prehospital providers. There are inherent risks to secondary transport and IFT relating to the transportation itself, sub-optimal care or under-treatment before arriving at the site of definitive care as well as a prolonged wait for definitive care.  In an effort to predict which children will need specialized or comprehensive care, numerous predictive models have been tested.  However, the only model that has been shown to be both accurate and maintain interrater reliability is the Pediatric Assessment Triangle (PAT). In the future to minimize the frequency of a potentially harmful IFT and/or secondary transport, pediatric prehospital destination EBGs should be developed and prospectively validated, incorporating the PAT, high-risk conditions, and qualitative assessments.
