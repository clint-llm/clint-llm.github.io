As major branches within the aortic arterial supply line, the subclavian arteries provide vital flow for much of the head, neck, and upper extremities. The left subclavian artery arises directly from the aortic arch, but the right subclavian artery comes off the short brachiocephalic artery which gives off the right subclavian and right common carotid vessels. As the subclavian arteries extend laterally, they pass through the anterior and middle scalene muscles and convert into the axillary artery once they pass the tip of the first rib. Given the long path of the artery, it subdivides into three different parts labeled first, second, and third. The first part initiates as the root of the subclavian artery and ends at the medial edge of the scalene muscles, and this area can feed the circle of Willis, thyroid tissue and breast tissue. The second part starts at the medial edge of the scalenes and extends to the lateral edge of the scalenes; this area feeds the costocervical trunk. The third part initiates at the lateral scalene muscle running to the lateral tip of the first rib at which point the artery becomes the axillary artery and feeds the upper extremity.
