Due to the heterogeneity of the selective IgA deficiency and the fact that there is no specific treatment, every patient requires individual management. The recommended management comprises periodic monitoring, prophylaxis, and treatment of infections with antibiotics (sometimes empirically), treatment of the associated allergic and autoimmune conditions, replacement therapy with intravenous or subcutaneous immunoglobulins (rare), and patient education.Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza. Immunoglobulin replacement should be performed judiciously and cautiously to avoid an anaphylactic reaction.

All IgA deficient patines, even if asymptomatic, should receive polyvalent pneumococcal and influenza vaccines; patients must avoid attenuated or live vaccines. Specifically, live vaccines such as oral polio, Bacille-Calmette-Guerin, and yellow fever, should be considered contraindicated due to the threat of subsequent severe infection.
