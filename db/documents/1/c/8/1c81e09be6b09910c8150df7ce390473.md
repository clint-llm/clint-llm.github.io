A proper history and physicalÂ is vital in determining the cause of elevated hemidiaphragm. Recent pulmonary infection, neuromuscular diseases, autoimmune disease, congenital malformations, and direct trauma should all be considered. In cases where patients present with severe pulmonary distress and a proper history cannot be obtained, imaging studies will help rule out differential causes of elevated hemidiaphragm. Most patients with unilateral diaphragm dysfunction have no symptoms, and they are generally found with the incidental elevation of a hemidiaphragm on chest imaging.

Physical examination findings in case of unilateral diaphragm paralysis include decreased breath sounds, dullness on the lower chest on percussion of the involved side, paradoxical abdominal wall retraction during inspiration, hypoxemia secondary to atelectasis, generalized or focal neurological deficit.
