People who come in close contact with meningococcal infected patients can become infected and show symptoms within ten days after initial contact. Close contact refers to proximity less than 3 feet for greater than 8 hours (e.g., family members, roommates, military recruits, daycare centers). Those who are exposed to the patients oral (e.g., kissing) or respiratory secretions (e.g., intubation, suctioning, passengers close on a long flight) are also at risk. If recognized, antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis should commence. Due to the high efficacy in chemoprophylaxis, strongly consider this in patients if there is questionable close contact. Several options are available and include ceftriaxone, rifampin, and ciprofloxacin.

- Ceftriaxone 250 mg intramuscularly as a one-time dose.

- 125 mg in pediatric patients younger than 15 years old

- Rifampin 600 mg oral or intravenously twice daily for two days.

- 5 mg/kg in pediatric patients younger than 1 month
- 10 mg/kg in pediatric patients older than 1 month

- Ciprofloxacin 500 mg oral as a one-time dose.

- 20 mg/kg in pediatric patients older than 1 month (maximum 500 mg)

- Azithromycin (last choice) 500 mg oral as one-time dose in adults

- 10 mg/ kg (maximum 500 mg) in pediatric patients older than one month
