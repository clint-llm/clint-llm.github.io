Mononucleosis classically presents with fever, lymphadenopathy, and tonsillar pharyngitis. The term infectious mononucleosis was first used in the 1920s to describe a group of students with a similar pharyngeal illness and blood laboratory findings of lymphocytosis and atypical mononuclear cells. It was only later that the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was established as the cause of mononucleosis after an exposed healthcare worker developed a positive heterophile test. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of mononucleosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of mononucleosis.
- Review the presentation of mononucleosis.
- Summarize the treatment of mononucleosis.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by mononucleosis.
