An ophthalmologist, oculoplastic, facial plastic, or plastic surgeon is required, and a surgical assistant is helpful. This procedure can be performed under local anesthesia in many cases. However, complex cases or certain patients may benefit from intravenous sedation or general anesthesia; an anesthetist is also required in such cases.
