Often, it is difficult to fully elucidate a neuromuscular diagnosis with history and physical examination alone. Furthermore, many neuromuscular diagnoses cannot be identified on an MRI or CT scan and thus require an alternate modality to identify—this is the role of the electrodiagnosis techniques: Electroneurography (ENG) and electromyography (EMG). Specifically, ENG and EMG are useful in identifying peripheral neuropathies caused by compression of the tibial nerve. Neuropathy of the posterior tibial nerve is a relatively rare condition that causes foot and ankle pain, paresthesia, and even weakness of the intrinsic foot muscles.

When this neuropathy occurs in the tarsal tunnel, it is known as tarsal tunnel syndrome. This condition is most frequently caused by external compression by ill-fitting footwear or tight plaster casts. Other causes are posttraumatic fibrosis and acute trauma (such as those from sprains, strains, fractures) but can also result from lipomas, cysts, tumors, soft tissue infection, and inflammatory arthropathies. A true entrapment from a thickened flexor retinaculum is rare.

Electromyography can be used to identify the specific muscles affected by a nerve lesion. If a nerve lesion localizes to the tarsal tunnel, the practitioner must determine the cause of the compression.
