If a patient is clinically stable and time permits, knowing the cause of wide QRS complex tachycardia provides an opportunity to appropriately manage the patient and significantly reduce the potential for morbidity and mortality. Below are some of the known causes of WCT, which also consists of the differential diagnosis.

- Sodium channel blockade

- Hyperkalemia

- Hyper- or hypo-magnesemia

- Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with pre-existing or a rate-related bundle branch block (BBB)

- SVT with aberrant conduction

- Atrial fibrillation (Afib) with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPWS)

- Mono-morphic ventricular tachycardia (VT)

- Ventricular fibrillation (VFib)

- Polymorphic VT (torsades de pointes)

- Pacemaker mediated tachycardia (PMT)

- Drug overdose and toxicities (i.e., TCA’s, digitalis, cocaine, lithium, diphenhydramine)

- Post-resuscitation (ROSC)

- EKG artifact
