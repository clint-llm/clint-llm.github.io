It is important to educate the patients and involve parents/guardians in decision-making and management. In young patients with good control and small-angle deviations, an observation alone might be sufficient. At times patching with close observation or orthoptics exercises might be needed. The management plan needs to be discussed with parents, and their involvement is mandatory to ensure children are following the treatment correctly.

Parents should be explained that orthoptics exercises might help in delaying the surgery. The need for regular follow-ups and involvement of parents to assess the home control should be well discussed. A detailed discussion should be done about the risks and benefits associated with different management options. They should also be hinted at the possible impact of strabismus on the childâ€™s psychological health and its effect on social behavior and education.
