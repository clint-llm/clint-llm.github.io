The axillary nerve innervates the teres minor. The axillary nerve, composed of nerve roots C5 and C6, arises from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus. First, the axillary nerve is posterior to the axillary artery and anterior to the subscapularis muscle, then it travels to the inferior edge of the subscapularis muscle. Here, it moves posteriorly out of the axilla with the posterior circumflex humeral artery (PCHA) through the quadrangular space, created by the teres minor superiorly, teres major inferiorly, the surgical neck of humerus laterally, and long head of triceps brachii medially. When it enters the posterior scapula, the axillary nerve bifurcates into two terminal branches; the posterior terminal branch innervates the teres minor.
