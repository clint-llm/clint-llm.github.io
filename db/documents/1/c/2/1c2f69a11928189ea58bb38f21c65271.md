Depending on the frequency or degrees of deviation, the dissociated vertical deviation can be observed or might need non-surgical or surgical treatment. No major studies have compared non-surgical versus surgical management options. The most frequently performed procedures include inferior oblique anteriorization or superior rectus weakening procedures. The choice of surgical procedure depends on the degrees of deviation, degree of anomalous head posture, and surgeon's preference.
