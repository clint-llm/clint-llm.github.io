The familial inheritance of trinucleotide repeat disorders is well known. The primary inciting event for this expansion has been studied extensively. Various environmental factors have been postulated to trigger complex cellular responses that trigger cellular mechanisms to increase the chances of cell survival. One effect, in response to cold, heat, hypoxic, and oxidative stresses, is to compromise the fidelity of DNA repair, which unwittingly results in increasing mutagenesis. This occurs in microsatellite regions, that are highly mutable, and that respond with re-replication in the form of trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansions.
