The etiology of Jessner lymphocytic infiltration of the skin (JLIS) remains unknown. However, there are numerous proposed etiologies. There may be a genetic/hereditary component due to multiple reported familial cases of the disease.

The suppression of natural kill cell cytolytic activity suggests an alteration in immunoregulatory pathways similar to those in neoplastic and endocrine disorders.

Further studies report photosensitivity as a trigger for JLIS, causing this disease to be linked to polymorphous light eruption. The fact that the distribution of eruptions is usually in sun-exposed areas serves as further support for this possible etiology. Finally, there are drug-induced cases, primarily by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and immunosuppressive therapies such as etanercept,Borrelia burgdorferi infection.
