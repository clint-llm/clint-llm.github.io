Monitor respiratory and cardiovascular status, blood pressure, and heart rate.

Lorazepam is a Schedule IV drug, and patients may develop dependence and tolerance with long-term use. The recommendation is to use the lowest possible effective dose for the shortest period. When stopping lorazepam, it should be tapered by 0.5 mg every three days to avoid withdrawal symptoms.

Monitor and adjust the dose of lorazepam according to the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol–Revised (CIWA-Ar) protocol.

Monitor for improvement in anxiety by using a validated scoring system like Hamilton Anxiety Scale.
