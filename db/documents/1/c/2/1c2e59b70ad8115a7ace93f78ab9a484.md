Appropriate diagnosis and evaluation of patients with tibial eminence fractures are important to provide the best care for patients. Delay in treatment can lead to further injury to other structures within the knee. Primary care, pediatric, and emergency department physicians need to recognize this injury and to refer the patient appropriately for further treatment. Associated injuries should be recognized early to allow earlier evaluation to optimize treatment. For non-operative treatment, communicating appropriate cast care to caregivers and nursing is important to avoid any skin related complications from casting. Proper directions regarding weight-bearing status are important regarding any physical or occupational therapy the patient receives during their fracture rehabilitation. Communicating with the patient and the interprofessional team's expectations of treatment is important to optimize treatment and to address all concerns that may arise for the patient.
