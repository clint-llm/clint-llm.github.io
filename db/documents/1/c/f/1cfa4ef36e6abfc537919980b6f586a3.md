Mastoiditis is a clinical diagnosis. Laboratory and imaging are used as an adjunct when you are unsure of the diagnosis or considering a complication of acute mastoiditis. Laboratory studies to obtain include a CBC with differential, ESR, and CRP. Most commonly, one will see an elevated white blood cell count with a left shift, and elevated inflammatory markers ESR and CRP. Radiologic evaluation of acute mastoiditis uses CT imaging. CT imaging can reveal the disruption of the bony septation in the mastoid air cells and the potential extension of the infection. In particular, CT imaging in patients with mastoiditis reveals the following:

- Fluid and/or mucosal thickening in the middle ear and mastoid condensation.

- Loss of definition of the bony septae that define mastoid air cells

- Destruction of the irregularity of the mastoid cortex

- Periosteum thickening, disruption of periosteum, or subperiosteal abscess.
