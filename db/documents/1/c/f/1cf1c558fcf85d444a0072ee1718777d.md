The diagnosis and management of carbamate toxicity are best made with an interprofessional team that includes the emergency department physician, pulmonologist, neurologist, nurse practitioner, emergency department nurse, intensivist,Â and pharmacist.

One should attempt to gain collateral history on initial patient presentation, and in cases of occupational and known exposures, try to identify the compound on the MSDS. This information may be more readily available than BuChE or RBC AChE levels. In cases of undifferentiated insecticide toxicity, treat empirically, as if it is outpatient ingestion, as pralidoxime is unlikely to be harmful in carbamate toxicity.

In the United States, consider contacting the regional poison center at 1-800-222-1222 for assistance with patient management as well as providing data for epidemiologic purposes. Some hospitals may have medical toxicologists available for consultation and advice for patient management. These resources may provide guidance with long-term management decisions, such as discontinuation of atropine, and are important resources for data collection and analysis.

The outcomes for carbamate toxicity depend on the amount ingested. For mild cases, full recovery is expected, but severe cases can lead to prolonged hospitalization with the need for ventilation.
