The decrease or cessation of bile formation or flow is known as cholestasis. Cholestasis can result from the impaired canalicular secretion of bile, ductular disease, or obstruction of bile flow through the biliary tree. Causes of decreased canalicular secretion include drugs, sex hormones, and inherited defects. Ductal diseases include primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Bile duct obstruction is most commonly due to gallstones but is also seen with cancers of the bile duct or pancreas
