The development of the urinary tract system starts at week four with the pronephros as a set of rudimentary and nonfunctional kidneys. These disappear and pave the way for the mesonephros, which functions during week five through week ten as the permanent kidneys are forming. The mesonephric structures make a pathway for urine production. The metanephros appears in week five, become functional at week ten, and continues to develop to become the adult kidney. The metanephroi consist of the metanephric mesenchyme (where nephrogenesis will occur) and the ureteric bud (which gives rise to the collecting duct system-the collecting tubules, major and minor calyces, renal pelvis, and ureter).
