The evaluation of suspected septic arthritis includes arthrocentesis with synovial fluid analysis, laboratory and imaging studies.

**Laboratory Studies**

The most useful diagnostic laboratory test for identifying septic arthritis is an evaluation of the synovial fluid from the affected joint (culture, Gram stain, crystals analysis, white blood cell count with differential). Synovial fluid with a white blood cell (WBC) count greater than 50,000 and 90% neutrophil predominance suggests a bacterial source.

In prosthetic joint infections, synovial fluid WBC count of 1100 with a neutrophil differential of 64% suggests septic arthritis.

Two sets of blood cultures should be obtained to rule out bacteremia. If Neisseria is suspected, one should obtain cultures from the cervix, rectum, and throat.

**Imaging Studies**

Plain radiographs may reveal widened joint spaces, bulging of the soft tissues, or subchondral bony changes (late finding). A normal plain radiograph does not rule out septic arthritis. Ultrasonography is useful in identifying and quantifying the joint effusion as well as aiding in needle aspiration of the joint.

MRI is sensitive for early detection of joint fluid and may reveal abnormalities in surrounding soft tissue and bone, and delineate the extent of cartilaginous involvement.

Bone scans are not specific and cannot differentiate infections from a sterile process. However, they are useful when evaluating localized infection of the sacroiliac or hip joint.
