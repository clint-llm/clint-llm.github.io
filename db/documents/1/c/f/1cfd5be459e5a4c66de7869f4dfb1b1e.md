Potassium Iodide (KI) affects the production of thyroid hormone and is useful in treating conditions related to thyroid hormone, especially severe cases of thyrotoxicosis. Also, KI is a salt that can protect the thyroid in cases of high radiation exposure. KI is considered a thyroid blocking agent in the case of a nuclear emergency by the American Thyroid Association. This activity reviews the indications, interaction, adverse effects, and other pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic factors of KI and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients receiving potassium iodide for conditions where it has an indicated therapeutic value.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of potassium iodide.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of potassium iodide.
- Review the appropriate monitoring for patients receiving potassium iodide.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance potassium iodide and improve outcomes.
