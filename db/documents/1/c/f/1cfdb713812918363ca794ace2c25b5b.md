Most pain syndromes and associated impairment typically resolve within one month of the injury onset.

Ultimately, prevention is critical in the treatment of chronic pain. If acute and subacute pain receives appropriate treatment and chronic pain can be avoided, the patient will have limited impacts on their quality of life. A longer pain duration history is correlated with increased pain levels, disability, and emotional distress.
