The outcomes for most patients with HAV are excellent. After an infection, long term immunity is common and unlike the other viral hepatitis infections, recurrence of symptoms is rare.Â  Death is rare but may occur in older individuals or those with underlying liver disease. In the US, there are about a hundred deaths from HAV every year. Rarely in children with fulminant disease, liver transplant has been undertaken. The most important prognostic factor is age; the older the individual, the more likely that an adverse reaction or event may occur. Long term sequelae are very rare.
