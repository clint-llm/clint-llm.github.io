The classic clinical scenario is that of an abrupt onset neurologic deficit that reaches maximal intensity within minutes and then gradually improves.

As with all strokes, the clinical features depend on the extent and location of neurovascular compromise. However, depressed consciousness is usually a factor favoring a cardioembolic etiology instead of an atherothrombotic stroke.

Classic features of cardioembolic stroke include the following:

- Abrupt decline in mental status

- Change in the level of consciousness

- Presence of neurological deficits

Cardiac findings may include:

- Atrial fibrillation

- Presence of a cardiac murmur

- Signs of congestive heart failure

- Recent myocardial infarction

- Recent diagnosis of infective endocarditis
