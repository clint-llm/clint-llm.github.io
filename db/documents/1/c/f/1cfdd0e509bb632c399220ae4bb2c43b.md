Due to the progressive nature of Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome, patients and families will need frequent counsel throughout the course of the disease.  Families should be educated about the general progression of the disease and be trained on specific skills as the needs arise.  Due to the loss of mobility and cognitive abilities, the burden of care is likely to grow in the later stages of the disease.  It is crucial to ensure the family has the resources they need at home to deliver the patient care and treatment required.  Genetic counseling may also be of value if future pregnancies are a consideration.
