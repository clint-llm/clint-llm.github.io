Treatment of cerebral gas embolism is immediate recompression on pure oxygen. First-aid includes placing the patient on 100% oxygen by nonrebreather mask or demand mask until recompression. Unstable patients or those with a Glasgow coma scale less than eight may be intubated for treatment when the chamber can support a ventilator. Early consultation with a hyperbaric physician, especially for critical cases or those requiring intubation, is essential.

Pre-hospital management of divers with suspected gas embolism should include high-flow oxygen and rapid transport to an emergency department capable of evaluating and differentially diagnosing serious neurological injury. The head-down position or lateral decubitus positions are no longer recommended during transportation.
