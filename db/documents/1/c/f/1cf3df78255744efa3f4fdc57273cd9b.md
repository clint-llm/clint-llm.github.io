Complications are more common in patients with larger CMNs, ranging from localized cutaneous irritation to malignant melanoma transformation.

Malignant melanomas may develop in any patient with CMN, although the risk is higher in patients with large lesions >20cm in size, or with multiple CMNs.

Meningeal melanocytosis is a condition associated with giant or multiple CMNs, characterized by benign or malignant proliferation of melanocytes in the central nervous system.
