**Appropriate Use And Indication Criteria for Echocardiography According to ACCF/ASE/AHA/ASNC/HFSA/HRS/SCAI/SCCM/ SCCT/SCMR 2011**

- Symptoms related to cardiac diseases such as chest pain, shortness of breath, syncope, palpitations, transient ischemic attack, stroke, and peripheral embolic event

- Previous diagnostic tests such as cardiac enzymes, electrocardiogram, and chest X-ray indicating cardiac disease

- Premature ventricular contraction ( Frequent or exercise-induced)

- Arrhythmias such as Atrial fibrillation, Atrioventricular node re-entry tachycardia, and Ventricular tachycardia (sustained or non-sustained)

- Evaluation of right ventricular function (fractional area change, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion(TAPSE), Right index of myocardial performance (RIMP), and pulmonary artery pressure in a patient with suspected pulmonary artery hypertension

- Routine follow-up of patients as surveillance (>1 year) for diagnosed pulmonary artery hypertension patients without a change in symptoms or physical examination

- To guide management in patients diagnosed with pulmonary artery hypertension and change in cardiac symptoms or physical examination

- Patient in shock with an uncertain or suspected cardiac cause

- For evaluation pf patient with a suspicion of myocardial infarction either with chest pain or diagnostic tests such as cardiac enzymes and electrocardiogram indicating of myocardial infarction

- For diagnosis of valvular heart disease

- To guide management in patients diagnosed with valvular heart disease and change in cardiac symptoms or physical examination.

- Patients with suspicion of hypertensive heart disease, prosthetic valve dysfunction,Â  infective endocarditis, heart failure, congenital heart disease, cardiac mass, pericardial disease, aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection, or cardiovascular source of embolus

**Indication for Transesophageal Echocardiography**

- Transthoracic echo nondiagnostic due to patient characteristics

- To guide percutaneous noncoronary cardiac interventions such as closure device placement, radiofrequency ablation, and percutaneous valve procedures.

- To rule out cardiovascular sources such as embolus in patients with no other non-cardiac cause.

- To provide help in the decision-making of cardioversion, anticoagulation, and ablation in atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation.

- To diagnose infective endocarditis in patients with moderate-high pretest probability.

**Indication for Stress Echocardiography**

- Patients with intermediate and high pre-test probability for coronary artery disease

- Patients with a possible acute coronary syndrome (electrocardiogram: no ischemic changes or with LBBB or electronically paced ventricular rhythm, low-risk TIMI score with either borderline or minimally elevated troponin, High-risk TIMI score with negative troponin)
