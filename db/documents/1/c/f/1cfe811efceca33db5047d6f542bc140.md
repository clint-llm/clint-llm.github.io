Antenatally pregnancies of patients affected with muscular dystrophies may show polyhydramnios due to decreased swallowing of amniotic fluid and reduced fetal movements in utero. At birth, these patients may present with a poor feeble cry and minimal spontaneous movements of the extremities along with hypotonia on examination, and the most severe variants can have contractures at birth.

On asking the parents, a history of poor feeding can be elicited, which is secondary to poor suck. Significant motor delay can be one of the other presenting symptoms during childhood. The severity of muscle weakness in these patients depends on the type of disease and the abnormal protein being completely or partially affected. All infants suspected to have hypotonia should have a thorough physical examination done to rule out anomalies affecting other organs and to look for the possible syndromic association.

The timing of onset (infancy vs. childhood) and type of muscles (proximal vs. distal) involved are clues towards limiting the differential diagnosis to a smaller subset of disorders.
