While some ABO discrepancies can be resolved easily by reviewing the patient's history, others can be quite challenging to resolve. Workup and resolution of a discrepancy are time-consuming. This can be a significant problem in critical and unstable patients when there is an urgent need for blood product transfusion.

In those situations, patient care must not be compromised, and unmatched universal donor products like O-negative red blood cells are transfused simultaneously with the workup of the discrepancy. The patient's blood group should not be reported until the resolution of the discrepancy is achieved with clear test documentation.
