A differential diagnosis for Transverse myelitis should include any diseases causing myelopathy. Such examples would include compressive myelopathy from herniated discs, vertebral body compression fractures, epidural abscesses/masses, and spondylitis. Other diagnoses to be included in the differential diagnosis are vascular causes, metabolic/nutritional causes, neoplasms, and radiation. Infectious and autoimmune diseases may be the underlying cause of TM, leading to secondary TM. Treatment would require treating the underlying causes. Guillain-Barr√© should also be considered when evaluating for TM.
