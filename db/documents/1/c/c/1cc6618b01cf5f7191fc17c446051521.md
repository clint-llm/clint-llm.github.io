Radiation esophagitis can be classified as acute or late. Acute radiation esophagitis develops less than 3 months after therapy whereas late occurrences develop greater than 3 months after therapy. However, most cases of acute radiation esophagitis develop within 2 to 3 weeks post initial treatment and 6 months for late development. Symptoms may be cumulative but are typically self-limiting. In severe cases, dysmotility, perforations, fistula, and strictures can develop.

The diagnosis is typically made clinically in these patients; however, if there is a concern for more serious complications, further diagnostics may be needed. A barium swallow should be used to evaluate for esophageal strictures or impaired peristaltic waves and dysmotility. Chest and abdomen computed tomography (CT) may be used to evaluate for fistula and characterization of strictures. Upper endoscopy may be used to evaluate for ulcerations and biopsy if needed.
