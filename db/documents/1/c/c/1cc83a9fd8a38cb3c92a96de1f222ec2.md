Bupropion is classified as a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor; however, it is difficult to attribute its toxicity to sympathetic and dopaminergic stimulation entirely. The mechanism behind bupropionâ€™s pro-convulsant effect is unknown. Bupropion overdose has also been implicated in serotonin toxicity. The mechanism leading to serotonin toxicity is unclear since there is no direct serotonergic activity of bupropion on serotonin receptors; however, the increased neuronal firing of serotonin receptors has been observed in rat brains with sustained exposure to bupropion and is a proposed mechanism for this syndrome.

Electrocardiographic abnormalities have also been described in overdose. Prolongation of the QT interval is due to blockage of the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current, while QRS widening is the effect of gap junction intercellular communication rather than fast sodium channel blockade.
