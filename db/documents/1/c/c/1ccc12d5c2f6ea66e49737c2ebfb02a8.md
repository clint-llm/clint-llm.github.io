Most developmental delay is idiopathic and time-limited. There is no differential diagnosis, per se. However, for some children, developmental delay is the first step toward a "development disorder," one of a large group of syndromes for which there are specific diagnostic procedures undertaken by specialists to arrive at a diagnosis. Examples of these progressions include;
