**Inflamed Bursae**

Irritation to any part of the body can cause inflammation. Any inflammation of the bursa is called bursitis. This inflammatory response can result from a minor, repetitive impact on the surrounding bursa area, or can occur from sudden and more urgent injuries.

**Septic Bursitis and Surgical Considerations**

Patients can also present with sudden onset of redness and pain in a previously inflamed bursa. That could be as a result of infection, which can be due to poor host immune response or a direct inoculation with penetrating trauma or an insect bite.

In certain scenarios, the clinical findings might not be adequate to differentiate septic bursitis from friction, crystal deposition, or inflammatory conditions. Aspiration under aseptic precautions and, if required with ultrasound guidance, followed by oral antibiotics, is the recommendation.

Surgical treatment for recurrent bursitis is not standardized with supporting evidence. There is a considerable variation in treatment modalities across the globe. The patient should be made aware of the potential risks associated with surgical excision, including infection, delayed healing, sinus formation, the persistence of pain, and recurrence.
