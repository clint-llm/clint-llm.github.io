A patient with a normal general and neurologic exam, whose history is consistent with a simple febrile seizure, does not need a further laboratory, imaging, or neurophysiologic evaluation. If a patient's history is consistent with a complex febrile seizure, an electroencephalogram (EEG) is obtained to look for underlying abnormalities that may predispose the patient to seizures. If this initial EEG is abnormal, imaging is the next step. In a complex febrile seizure returning to baseline, often these are outpatient studies.

A lumbar puncture may be a consideration in the setting of fever and seizures. For a patient with the appropriate history of a febrile seizure and a rapid return to baseline, no lumbar puncture is necessary. Lumbar puncture is a recommendation when there are signs or symptoms that cause concern of a CNS infection; further, the lumbar puncture should be considered in infants aged 6 months to 12 months without appropriate immunization against Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenza type B and in patients taking antibiotics in which partial treatment may mask meningitis or other CNS infection.

Imaging studies are not indicated for simple febrile seizures.
