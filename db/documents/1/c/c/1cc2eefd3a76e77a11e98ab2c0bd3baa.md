Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic. It exhibits bactericidal activity against aerobic gram-negative bacteria making gentamicin a good option to treat several common infections.Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia spp., and Enterobacter spp.), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and some strains of Neisseria, Moraxella, and Haemophilus genera.Staphylococcus aureus isolates show inhibition by gentamicin in clinical drug concentration, although they can readily develop resistance.

According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) orientations, gentamicin should be used, confirmed with culture and susceptibility information whenever possible. However, the option for gentamicin is also appropriate when based on epidemiological data. Therefore, it has applications in several clinical scenarios, such as bacterial septicemia, meningitis, urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal tract (including peritonitis), and soft tissue infection, but always using additional information (e.g., patient age, symptoms, and signs at presentation, local antimicrobial resistance patterns) to enhance the probability to use gentamicin against susceptible germs. The combination with another antibiotic, especially beta-lactams, is reasonable in bacterial endocarditis, enterococcal bacteremia, and other severe infections, although other antibiotics are preferable in these settings.
