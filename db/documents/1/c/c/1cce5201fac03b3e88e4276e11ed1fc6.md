Tissue and organ donation is of tremendous benefit to living patients as it functions to help the living. One individual's tissue and organ donation can impact numerous lives. While the majority of the public is in favor of organ donation, individuals often fail to include this decision in their living wills. Further, while many states allow drivers to register as organ donors on their driver licenses, few complete the required form. The consequence is a tremendous tissue and organ shortage leading to long wait times on transplant lists that in many instances result in premature deaths of viable patients that could have lived longer lives with the benefit of tissue and organ transplants.
