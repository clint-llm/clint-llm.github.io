The musculocutaneous nerve may be bilaterally absent; the median nerve can innervate muscles that are usually innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve or a portion of the lateral cord of the brachial plexus. The musculocutaneous nerve can perform anastomosis with the median nerve.

The radial nerve (superficial branch of the radial nerve) can remain superficial to the brachioradialis muscle during its path, confusing itself with the medial or lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerves. The radial nerve can have anastomosis with the ulnar nerve, bilaterally, or only on one side.

The ulnar nerve has, like the other nerves of the forearm, various anatomical variations in its path and with anastomosis with the radial and median nerve.
