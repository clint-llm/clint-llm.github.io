PAF is not known as the sole mediator of disease in humans. However, it plays a pivotal role in some syndromes and diseases. The activity of PAF and PAF-like lipids is measurable with the activity of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) or plasma PAF acetylhydrolase.

It is an independent risk marker for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic substrates of Lp-PLA2 enhance the expression of this enzyme in macrophages. Therefore, elevated levels might reflect the accumulation of these substrates.
