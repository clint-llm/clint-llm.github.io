CT and US are the primary modalities used for imaging the spleen. MRI can be helpful in select cases.

The normal signal of the adult spleen on MRI is hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging and hypointense on T1-weighted imaging relative to the liver.

Hemangiomas are identified on MR as hypointense on T1-weight imaging and hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging. Contrast-enhanced imaging patterns will be similar to contrast-enhanced CT and can show peripheral enhancement with centripetal filling on later phase imaging, although not all hemangiomas show this pattern.

Different types of lymphoma can produce various manifestations in the spleen, including splenomegaly, diffuse miliary splenic infiltration, large focal mass, etc.
