Urethritis can be diagnosed with any ofÂ the following:

- Mucoid, mucopurulent, or purulent discharge on examination

- Gram stain of urethral secretions demonstrating equal to 2 white blood cells (WBC) per oil immersion field

- Positive leukocyte esterase test on urinalysis or microscopic examination of sediment from a spun first-void urine demonstrating equal to 10 WBC per high-power field

The diagnosis of NGU requires the exclusion of gonorrheal infection. This can be achieved with a gram stain that lacks gram-negative diplococci or by any negative gonorrhea test (culture, nucleic acid testing, among others).

In men at high risk for infection, if symptoms are present but none of these criteria are met, a presumptive diagnosis can be made, and empiric treatment started. These patients should be treated with a drug regimen for both chlamydia and gonorrhea.

Patients should also have a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) performed for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis. In urethritis, NAAT testing is recommended over culture because of its high sensitivity and specificity. NAAT testing for M. genitalium exists but is not widely available.
