The highly vascularized joint synovium lacks a limiting basement membrane so is prone to infection via hematogenous seeding from systemic infection. Septic arthritis may also result from direct injury, puncture wounds, and intra-articular injections. Contiguous spread from adjacent osteomyelitis may occur. The hip and shoulder are vulnerable to contiguous spread. Septic arthritis occurs when there is a bacterial invasion of the synovium and joint space followed by an inflammatory process. Inflammatory cytokines and proteases mediate joint destruction. Other factors which play a role in joint damage are bacterial toxins (based on animal models

Prosthetic joint infections are classified into:

- Early within 3 months of implantation

- Delayed within 3-24 months of surgery

- Late: occurring after 24 months

Most early prosthetic joint infections are caused by staphylococcus, whereas delayed cases are due to gram negatives and coagulase-negative staphylococcus. Late cases are usually secondary to hematogenous spread from various foci.
