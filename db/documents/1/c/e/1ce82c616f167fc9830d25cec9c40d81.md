There are no particular lab studies or psychological testing that are performable to make the diagnosis of a brief psychotic disorder.

The most appropriate tests and imaging to be done would rule out other potential diagnoses or causes for the behavioral disturbances. Hence, it would be apt to do a serum pregnancy test in women to evaluate any underlying triggers for the patient's behavioral disturbances. Other potential tests to consider ordering would be ECG, electrolytes, glucose level, liver function tests, thyroid function tests, and urinalysis. Urine toxicology tests can help exclude any potential drug or medication intoxication or withdrawal. CT and MRI of the brain may also be performed to evaluate for any underlyingÂ structural causes for the symptoms.
