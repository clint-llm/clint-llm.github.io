The treatment for Coats disease depends on the stage of the disease. Mild cases with only retinal telangiectasia and no exudation can be observed and followed up at regular intervals. Treatment is needed when exudation develops. In less severe cases of exudation, laser photocoagulation to telangiectatic vessels is done.

FFA helps in detecting the leaking vessels.

Advanced cases with bullous exudative detachment abutting the lens might benefit from surgery. The subretinal fluid is drained either trans-sclerally or internally. The detached retina gets approximated. Pan retinal photocoagulation or cryotherapy is then done. In cases with the rhegmatogenous or tractional component, pars plana vitrectomy is done with or without tamponade. Surgery primarily aims to prevent a painful blind eye and avoid enucleation rather than vision restoration.

Enucleation is done in endstage disease with neovascularization or angle-closure glaucoma.

Intravitreal corticosteroids and anti-VEGF agents may effectively reduce macular edema and subretinal fluid.
