Basilar skull fractures are present in only 4% of patients with a severe head injury.

Overall the majority of skull-basedÂ fractures are linear and tend to be more common in children. The temporal bone is involved in the majority of skull fractures (45%), followed by basilar skull fractures (20%). When a depressed skull fracture occurs, it is usually an open fracture, which generally necessitates surgery as soon as possible.
