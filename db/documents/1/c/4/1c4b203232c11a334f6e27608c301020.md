Wood's light is a simple and effective method to diagnose specific dermatosis including cutaneous fungal, bacterial infections, and pigmentary disorders. The test is done in the clinic under the direct supervision of the treating provider. In certain situations, it is not enough to do Wood's light test since the result is equivocal or the case is complex. Because the Wood's light emits light in the ultraviolet range, it is prohibited to look at the light for a long time; both patients and the physician need to protect their eyes.
