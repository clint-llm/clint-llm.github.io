Recurrence and prognosis are highly dependent on age and activity level. Multiple studies cite incidence rates with certain contact sports. There is an up to 92% recurrent shoulder dislocation rate in patients less than 25 years old and participating in a contact sport. In patients over 30, the recurrence is approximately 72%. Depending on the initial age of injury, follow up, and Bankart lesion repair, patients may develop arthropathy in addition to chronic instability. Arthropathy is seen in approximately 28% to 67% of those that undergo a Bankart repair, which may be due to chondral damage due to repeated dislocations.
