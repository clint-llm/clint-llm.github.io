Many indications exist that necessitate the insertion of a nasogastric tube. Most notably, the need for decompression of the stomach. This procedure is seen in the setting of obstruction, from the pylorus and beyond. Common scenarios include adhesions, internal or incarcerated hernias, ileus, obstructive neoplasm, intussusception, and volvulus, to name a few.

Other medical indications include poison removal or victims of overdose. Unfortunately, these complications can also result in intractable nausea, placing the patient at aspiration risk. The placement of a nasogastric tube can prevent this adverse event.

Additionally, another clear indication for nasogastric tube placement is for nutrition and/or medicine delivery. Diagnosis and careful evaluation on a case-by-case basis play a key role in decision-making. Clinicians must determine whether a patient can willfully and without resultative complications consume solids and liquids. Those patients most likely to fall into this category are those with a decreased level of consciousness or mental capacity. Furthermore, those suffering from some degree of dysphagia that would result in aspiration would be good candidates as well.

When considering whether to use the fluoroscopic-guided placement of a nasogastric tube, it is best to consider the patient's anatomy.  There is a clear indication for the use of fluoroscopy when dealing with patients who have advanced head and neck cancer.
