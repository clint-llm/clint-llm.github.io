Nimodipine is usually well tolerated orally, but its use correlates with some side effects related to the vasodilating property. The main adverse effects of the drug are headache, vertigo, flushing, nausea, diarrhea, pedal edema, rash, and palpitations.

Acute Colonic Pseudo-Obstruction (Ogilvie Syndrome) has been reported using oral nimodipine.

**Drug-Drug Interactions**

The cytochrome P450 3A4 system metabolizes nimodipine. Drugs that inhibit this enzyme can lead to increased plasma concentrations of nimodipine. Such drugs include macrolide antibiotics like erythromycin, clarithromycin, and telithromycin; protease inhibitors like ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, and saquinavir; azole antimycotics like ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole; antidepressants like nefazodone, fluoxetine, and quinupristin/dalfopristin, cimetidine, and valproic acid. Grapefruit juice is also an inhibitor of the cytochrome system, and a patient treated with nimodipine should avoid it.

CYP3A4 Inducers carbamazepine, phenobarbital (phenobarbitone), and/or phenytoin enhance the metabolism of nimodipine and decrease the serum concentration of nimodipine. This can lead to therapeutic failure of treatment with nimodipine.
