X-ray radiation production is the first step of a multistep process that results in creating a radiograph. The process involves generating an X-ray beam, passage of X-ray photons through a patient's biological tissues, and interaction of exiting photons with an image receptor to generate a film-screen or digital system radiograph. It is important to understand the general physical principles of X-ray production. Additionally, a general understanding of factors affecting X-ray attenuation, such as the absorption characteristics of anatomic tissues, is crucial to understanding how technically adequate radiographs are produced, and artifact production is limited. Lastly, understanding technically adequate anatomic features of a radiograph can be used to troubleshoot discrepancies in the production process.
