According to the manufacturer's label, absolute contraindication for gentamicin use is a history of hypersensitivity reaction to it or other aminoglycosides, although this is rare. In cases of renal impairment, dosing adjustment should be made based on the glomerular filtration rate (GFR); for a high-dose and extended interval dosing approach, the dose can be preserved, but the interval between doses should increase in line with the GFR decreased. In burn patients, the systemic absorption of topical gentamicin may be enhanced, and one should be watchful for the potential repercussions. Systemic gentamicin belongs to category D of FDA pregnancy risk classification (i.e., although the evidence of human fetal risk, its use is acceptable if the possible benefits overcome the risks).

**Drug Interactions**

Avoid the concomitant administration of gentamicin with potent diuretics (i.e., ethacrynic acid, furosemide, etc.) as diuretics may cause ototoxicity. Additionally, when diuretics are administered intravenously, it enhances gentamicin toxicity by increasing the drug concentration in serum and tissue.
