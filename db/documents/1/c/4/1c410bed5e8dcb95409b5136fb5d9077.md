The normal progression of labor requires the inspection of **three**"Ps," representing power, passage, and passenger. The power comes from uterine contractions and maternal expulsive efforts. The passage is the maternal pelvis, and finally, the fetus is the passenger, who may or may not present itself in a favorable position and presentation. Abnormal progress of labor may be related to fetal factors, uterine factors, bony pelvis factors, or a combination of these. The size of the fetus and the capacity of the maternal pelvis are tested as uterine contractions provide propulsion. Asynclitism or extension of the fetal head as well as occiput posterior or transverse position or mentum or brow presentation may also be etiologies of abnormal progress of labor or labor dystocia.
