Ipecac is rarely useful for most poisonings. It is unsuccessful at removing any significant quantities of ingested poisons unless delivered in the first few minutes post-ingestion; even then, the results are inconsistent and unpredictable. Its effect of uncontrolled vomiting delays otherÂ orally administered antidotes (e.g., activated charcoal) by one to two hours. Given the risks of aspiration, an adequately controlled airway is paramount. If the patient demonstrates signs of toxicity that include sedation or an inability to maintain their airway, ipecac will not only create a risk of aspiration of vomited material; it will almost certainly be ineffective as the drug is already absorbed.
