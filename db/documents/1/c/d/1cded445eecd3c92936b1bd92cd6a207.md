Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms are the most common aneurysm of the aorta. Screening ultrasound has helped detect AAA and surveillance in asymptomatic patients with a diameter < 5 cm.  In females, the repair should be considered at 5 cm and in males at 5.5 cm.  If the rapid enlargement is demonstrated (>5 mm over 6 months), repair should be considered. Education of first responders, primary care physicians, and emergency department physicians can facilitate diagnosis and reduce delays in treatment. A team approach of emergency nurses, emergency physicians, and a vascular surgeon will facilitate rapid evaluation and treatment and improve outcomes. Referral to a vascular center that can provide a standard of care management is appropriate. Once the decision for repair has been made, cardiology workup and clearance and optimization of other medical co-morbidities can improve outcomes. If the aneurysm is small, the patient and family should be educated regarding compliance with blood pressure control, a healthy diet, exercise, cessation of smoking, and follow up.
