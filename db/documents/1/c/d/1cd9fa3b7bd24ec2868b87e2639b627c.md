Initially, PCI was performed using balloon catheters alone. However, due to subclinical outcomes and vessel re-stenosis, other devices were introduced including atherectomy devices and coronary stents. Atherectomy devices used alone resulted in poor outcomes. Coronary stents are the most widely used intracoronary devices in PTCA due to improved clinical outcomes. Various types of stents are available including traditional bare-metal stents (BMS) and drug-eluting stents (DES). DES has a polymer coating that prevents inflammation and endothelial cell proliferation. Most recent DES used in the United States use sirolimus, everolimus, and zotarolimus. The newer generation DES have reduced the incidence of late stent thrombosis.
