Fuchs endothelial dystrophy (FECD): Fuchs endothelial dystrophy has the most similar pathophysiology and presentation to amantadine keratopathy. Differentiating features include the presence of guttata on slit-lamp examination and persistence following discontinuation of amantadine.

Band keratopathy: Calcium deposition in the anterior stroma can look similar to the stomal edema associated with amantadine keratopathy, and the epidemiology is similar due to the age-related progression and association with chronic disease. Patients will generally have a sub-acute or chronic progression of corneal opacification as opposed to that in amantadine keratopathy, and there is an increased association with ocular comorbidities. Like FECD, band keratopathy will not resolve with discontinuation of amantadine.
