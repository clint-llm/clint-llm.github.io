Endometrial polyps refer to overgrowths of endometrial glands and stroma within the uterine cavity. Endometrial polyps vary in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter. Polyps may be found as a single lesion or multiple lesions filling the entire endometrial cavity. Endometrial polyps may be diagnosed at all ages; however, peak incidence occurs between the age of 40 to 49 years old. Although these polyps are considered benign, there is a small risk of malignant transformation.
