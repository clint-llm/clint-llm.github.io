**Urine Testing**

- Urine is placed in or on a designated receptacle (most commercially available and medical point of care tests)

- An indicator (typically a colored line or symbol), along with a control, will appear if the test is positive

- An isolated control line/symbol will be evident if the test is negative

**Serum Testing**

- Serum hCG testing is performed in a laboratory equipped with the proper machinery and uses a peripheral blood sample

- If a hook effect/gestational trophoblastic disease is suspected, the lab should perform a dilution prior to testing
