Mycobacterium marinum is a non-tuberculous mycobacterium that causes a tuberculosis-like illness in fish and can infect humans when injured skin is exposed to a contaminated aqueous environment. Human infection presents as a nodular granulomatous disease that can spread along with the distribution of the lymphatic system and is usually limited to the skin and soft tissues in immunocompetent patients. Disseminated M. marinum infection in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) / acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) has infrequently been reported. This activity reviews the presentation, appropriate diagnostic modality, and management of Mycobacterium marinum infection and the interprofessional team's role in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of Mycobacterium marinum infection. 
- Explain when Mycobacterium marinum infection should be considered in a differential diagnosis. 
- Outline the management of Mycobacterium marinum infections.
- Review the role of interprofessional team members in optimizing collaboration and communication to ensure patients suspected of having Mycobacterium marinum infections receive appropriate evaluation and care to enhance outcomes.
