Unlike the oculomotor nerve and the trochlear nerve, the abducens nerve is a purelyÂ motor nerve, meaning the nerve has no sensory function. Its main function is to carry general somatic efferent nerve axons to innervate the lateral rectus muscle, which then abducts the eye on the ipsilateral side. It is also secondarily involved in the innervation of the contralateral medial rectus muscle by way of the medial longitudinal fasciculus so that both eyes move laterally in a coordinated manner.
