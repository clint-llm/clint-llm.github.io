Patients will often present with a history of progressive pain at the inferior and medial heel, but can, however, radiate proximally in more severe cases. They will often describe the pain as sharp and worst with the first few steps out of bed in the morning. Long periods of standing, or in severe cases, sitting for prolonged periods, will also exacerbate symptoms. Pain often decreases with ambulation or beginning an athletic activity, but then increases throughout the day as activity increases. Pain can usually be reproduced by palpating the plantar medial calcaneal tubercle at the site of the plantar fascial insertion on the heel bone. Pain can also be reproduced with passive dorsiflexion of the foot and toes. Specifically, passive dorsiflexion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint is known as the windlass (or Jack's) test and considered a positive test if pain is reproduced. Secondary findings may include a tight Achilles heel cord, pes planus, or pes cavus. It may also be beneficial to assess a patient's gait to assess for biomechanical factors or predisposing factors mentioned previously. When considering the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis, one should consider fat pad contusion or atrophy, stress fractures, and nerve entrapments such as tarsal tunnel syndrome in the differential.
