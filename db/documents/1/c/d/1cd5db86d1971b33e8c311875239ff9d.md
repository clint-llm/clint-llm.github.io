**Coronary artery Calcifications (CAC)**

A cardiac CT angiogram (CTA) is better at demonstrating the CAC and also quantifying it. This is particularly important in asymptomatic patients who have an intermediate (10% to 20%) 10-year risk of ASCVD based on the Framingham risk score, as well as for asymptomatic individuals 40 years and older with diabetes mellitus for coronary artery calcium scanning.

Currently, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association gives class IIa indication for asymptomatic patients with an intermediate 10-year risk of ASCVD (10% to 20%) based on Framingham risk score, as well as for asymptomatic individuals 40 years and older with diabetes mellitus. CAC measurement is generally not recommended for patients at low (less than 10%) or high (greater than 20%) 10-year risk of cardiac events based on the Framingham risk score.

Quantification of CAC is based on Agatston score calculated using CTA of coronary arteries is as follows;

- 0: no identifiable disease

- 1 to 99: mild disease

- 100 to 399: moderate disease

- Greater than 400: severe disease

In general, the extent of CAC correlates with coronary artery disease burden and does not exactly tell us about the degree of stenosis for which coronary angiogram or other intravascular imaging modalities are needed.

**Valvular Calcifications**

Aortic valve stenosis is the most common valve pathology in the elderly. It is usually diagnosed by an echocardiogram, which tells us the valvular area as well as valvular gradients. Severe AS is usually diagnosed by valve area of < 1 cm2, peak velocity of > 4 m/sec and mean gradient of > 40 mmHg. Accurate diagnosis of severe AS relies on a normal contractile function of the heart. In cases of left ventricular failure, severity may be misdiagnosed on echocardiogram. Aortic valve calcium scoring (not very readily available) is a quantitative and flow –independent method of assessing the AS severity (recommended thresholds of 2000 in men and 1250 in women). Similarly, for other calcified valves, an echocardiogram can predict the severity of stenosis as well.

**Pericardial and Myocardial Calcifications**

For pericardial calcifications seen on chest x-ray or CT scan in patients with signs and symptoms of right heart failure, a thorough investigation of the right heart function should be done, including a right heart catheterization as well as an echocardiogram. Pericardial calcification is usually diagnosed as a rim of calcification or spotty calcification involving the pericardium.

Myocardial calcifications are usually diagnosed as incidental findings on chest imaging or autopsy of patients. A predisposing global cardiac injury like ischemia or sepsis is usually present in these patients.
