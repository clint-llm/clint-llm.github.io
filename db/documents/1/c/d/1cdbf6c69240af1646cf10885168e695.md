In cases where the diagnosis is certain, the practitioner should counsel the patient that this is a benign lesion; however, it will not resolve spontaneously. They should understand the various methods that are options for removal and that scarring is a likely outcome with any method. In cases where the diagnosis is uncertain, a biopsy of the lesion is the recommendation, which can also result in scarring.
