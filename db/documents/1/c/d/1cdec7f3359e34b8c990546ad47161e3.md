Several authors have called for national public health measures to curtail the opioid epidemic and the hidden public health crisis of neonatal abstinence syndrome. A multi-faceted, interprofessional team approach involving healthcare professionals, researchers, and government officials is required to improve mothers' care with substance use disorder (SUD) and their infants with NAS.

Management of NAS must start from the prenatal period and span across the perinatal period.

NAS assessment requires standardization, and tools must be developed based on strong clinical data instead of psychometrics. Non-pharmacological care must be provided to all infants with NAS, be standardized, and include couplet care across units to promote rooming-in, breastfeeding, and skin-to-skin.

State and federal governments need to recognize the growing problem of NAS, which remains a hidden consequence of the opioid epidemic. States must have laws that clearly define what is reportable. The diagnosis and definition of NAS must be standardized to better surveillance and understand the epidemic.
