The muscles supplied by the ileocolic artery are within the bowel walls. For peristalsis to occur, the muscular layer, consisting of the inner transverse layer and outer longitudinal layer, must receive their blood supply. In addition to providing blood to the muscles in the bowel wall, the ileocolic artery supplies the intrinsic anatomic sphincter muscle comprising the ileocecal valve. Finally, the ileocolic artery supplies the proximal portion of the taeniae coli. Beginning from where they coalesced at the vermiform appendix up through the proximal portion of the ascending colon where the anastomosis with the right colic artery occurs.
