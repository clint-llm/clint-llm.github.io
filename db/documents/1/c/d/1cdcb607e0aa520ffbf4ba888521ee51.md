The cingulate cortex is made up of the cingulate gyrus and the cortical gray matter lining the superior and inferior borders of the cingulate sulcus. As the Latin translation of "cingulate" would suggest, the cingulate gyrus wraps around the corpus callosum like a "belt." It begins beneath the rostrum of the corpus callosum, curves around the genu, and projects above the superior surface of the body of the corpus callosum, reaching its posterior end where it terminates at the isthmus of the cingulate gyrus. The isthmus is continuous inferiorly to the parahippocampal gyrus in the temporal lobe. The cingulate gyrus is separated from the corpus callosum inferiorly by the callosal sulcus and from the superior frontal gyrus superiorly by the cingulate sulcus.

The cingulate cortex divides into four functionally distinct regions: the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), midcingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and retrosplenial cortex.

The PCC houses BA 23, 29, 30, and 31. The thick granular layer IV of the PCC marks a clear histologic distinction from the thin agranular layer IV of the ACC. The PCC consists of the posterior cingulate cortex proper (ventral and dorsal PCC), which is responsible for visuospatial orientation. Although contained within the PCC, the retrosplenial cortex is considered a distinct region of the cingulate cortex. It is implicated in imagination and the formation and consolidation of episodic memory.

The cingulum, or cingulum bundle, is an important white matter tract that connects the orbitofrontal cortex to the temporal pole, nearly forming a near-complete ring that lies beneath the cingulate gyrus

As seen from the extensive neural pathways it shares with other brain regions, the cingulate cortex can be considered, in a sense, a connecting hub of emotions, sensations, and action. Some of these pathways are those involved in motivational processing, which is apparent through the connections with the orbitofrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and insula, which together make up the reward centers of the brain. Also, the cingulate cortex projects pathways to the lateral prefrontal cortex, which is involved in executive control, working memory, and learning. Pathways between the cingulate cortex and motor areas, like the primary and supplementary motor cortices, spinal cord, and frontal eye fields, suggest an important role in motor control. Moreover, the cingulate cortex and frontal and parietal lobes comprise a neural network for orienting attention, and expectedly, injury to any of these areas is known to cause hemineglect. The neural circuits cingulate cortex shares with the hippocampus and amygdala suggest a role in consolidating long-term memories and processing emotionally relevant stimuli, respectively.
