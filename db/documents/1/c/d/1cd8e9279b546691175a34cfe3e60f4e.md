The development of polyarthritis and polyarthralgia is the most common complication of rubella infection, affecting up to 70% of adolescents and adult women. It is usually symmetric and involves the wrists, fingers, knees, and ankles. Other manifestations, although rare, include thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, myocarditis, pericarditis, hepatitis, orchitis, retinopathy, uveitis, Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, and post-infection encephalitis. Rubella infection during pregnancy may lead to miscarriage, intrauterine fetal demise, premature labor, intrauterine growth retardation, and congenital rubella syndrome.
