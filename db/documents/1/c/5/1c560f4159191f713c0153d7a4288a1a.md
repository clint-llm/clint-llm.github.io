Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis is an emergency that requires timely diagnosis and prompt treatment. The effective management of this potentially devastating infection requires an integrated approach from the health care team. The available diagnostic tools, including laboratory tests and imaging modalities, especially hand sonography, can be beneficial in confirming the diagnosis and monitoring the infection severity. However, the health care professional should be able to make this diagnosis based on the cardinal Kanavel signs.

Early communication with an orthopedic or plastic surgeon is a must to formulate the best management plan. The role of nurses in perioperative care and infection monitoring for PFT is crucial and cannot be undermined. Postoperative care demands an integrated approach from doctors, nurses, hand therapists, and social workers. Rehabilitation after PFT requires early involvement of the hand therapist and early onset of active range of movement exercises.
