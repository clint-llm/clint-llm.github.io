**Molecular**

Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) is a compact enzyme of around 82 kDa that is found in both the cytosol and mitochondria of tissues where energy demands are high.B on 14q32 and M on 19q13. These subunits allow the formation of three tissue-specific isoenzymes: CPK-MB (cardiac muscle), CPK-MM (skeletal muscle), and CPK-BB (brain). Typically, the ratio of subunits varies with muscle type: skeletal muscle: 98% MM and 2% MB; cardiac muscle: 70 to 80% MM and 20 to 30% MB, while the brain predominantly has BB.

Mitochondrial (Mt-CK) and cytosolic CK are connected in a so-called PCr/Cr-shuttle or circuit.

Normally, creatine phosphokinase occurs in heart tissue, skeletal muscles, the brain, etc. However, upon muscular injury, there is leakage of CPK into the bloodstream. Thus, CPK is indicative of muscular damage. CPK-MB is a more specific indicator of myocardial muscle damage, while CPK-MM is more indicative of skeletal muscle damage.

When electrophoresed, CPK-MM runs closest to the cathode, CPK-MB has intermediate mobility, and CPK-BB moves farthest from the point of application toward the anode. Mt-CK, which runs more cathodal than the MM fraction, is usually associated with tissue necrosis that accompanies severe anoxic shock and severe liver disease.

Both M and B subunits have a C-terminal lysine residue, but only the former is hydrolyzed by the action of carboxypeptidases present in the blood. Carboxypeptidases B or N sequentially hydrolyze the lysine residues from CKMM to produce two CK-MM isoforms—CK-MM2 (one lysine residue removed) and CK-MM1 (both lysine residues removed).
