SD-OCT testing visualizes the retinal layers in as much detail as microscopic examinationÂ and in CQ/HCQ retinopathy a loss of the photoreceptor inner-outer segment junction (the IS/OS line, also called the ellipsoid zone or the photoreceptor integrity line (PIL)) and a thinning of the outer nuclear layer of the retina are observed.
