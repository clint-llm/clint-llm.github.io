- Deep neck infections most commonly arise from a nearby infectious focus, with odontogenic and tonsil/pharyngeal sources being the most common.

- Clinicians should be aware of these infections and not underestimate their potential to cause life-threatening complications.

- Knowledge of the anatomical compartments and spaces of the neck is essential for understanding the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and potential routes of spread of infections.

- Deep neck space infections are typically polymicrobial in origin, originating from the oral cavity and oropharynx. Empiric antimicrobials should cover these species.

- Computed tomography WITH IV contrast is the imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis of deep neck space infections. There is little to no utility in obtaining a non-contrasted scan.

- The treatment of deep neck infections include appropriate antibiotics based upon the likely microbiology of the infection along with drainage of the abscess collection, if present, via either aspiration or surgical drainage.
