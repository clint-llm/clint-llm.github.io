Patients presenting with signs of paraproteinemic keratopathy or other signs and symptoms suspicious of gammopathy should be worked up for a systemic monoclonal proliferation. Serum protein, serum free light chains, serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) or urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP), flow cytometry, and bone marrow biopsy with aspirate should be obtained.

Diagnosis is made via slit-lamp exam or confocal microscopy by the identification of paracrystalline protein deposits seen throughout the cornea, in addition to serum findings described above. Immunohistochemistry and electrophoresis are also effective methods of diagnosis if corneal specimens have already been obtained during surgery; however, less invasive methods should be used where possible. The specific findings in PPK vary widely. The deposits may be iridescent and vary in color from white to grey or yellow and may affect any or all layers of the cornea. Deposits may be diffuse or sporadic, vary in density, and usually affect bilateral corneas. They may be central or peripheral.

On electron microscopy, areas of normal corneal stroma containing crystalline protein deposits are found. Of note, in patients with multiple myeloma and paraproteinemic keratopathy, nearly identical crystalline structures may be found within bone marrow cells, as seen on light and electron microscopes.
