Indications for the sweat test include individuals suspected of having cystic fibrosis, either through a positive newborn screening test or if clinical features suggestive of CF are present. The sweat test is considered to be the gold standard as a confirmatory test. CF genotyping is recommended to help decide CF mutation-specific therapy, in case the sweat test results are borderline or sweat test is not technically possible (e.g., severe eczema). The CFF recommends CF genotyping in all patients. In the United States, the newborn screen tests for an elevated level of IRT (immunoreactive trypsinogen) and if positive may reflex to a DNA test for known mutations of the CFTR gene, depending on the each state’s protocol. A child demonstrating a positive newborn screen will subsequently require confirmatory sweat testing at a CF center.

In children clinically suspected to have cystic fibrosis, a referral to a CF center for sweat testing is indicated. Patients with cystic fibrosis may present with a myriad of different presentations. Neonates may present with meconium ileus. Smaller children may present with pulmonary complications such as recurrent pneumonia, upper respiratory infections, wheezing, and coughing. Gastrointestinal manifestations include failure to thrive with malabsorptive stools, recurrent abdominal pain. Given the clinical suspicion, children obtain a referral for testing.
