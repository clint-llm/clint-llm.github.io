HER2 amplification or overexpression occurs in approximately 20 to 30% of human breast cancers, some ovarian and gastric cancers. It confers worse biological behavior and clinical aggressiveness in breast cancer.

Overexpression of HER2 is primarily attributed to HER2 gene amplification and results in constitutive activation of the HER2 downstream signaling pathway.

HER2 amplification is a seminal event in human breast tumorigenesis, occurring in almost 50% of in situ carcinomas.

HER2-amplified breast cancers have unique biological and clinical characteristics such as increased proliferation rates, high histologic and nuclear grade, low ER and PR levels, more aneuploidy, tendency to metastasize to CNS viscera, relative resistance to endocrine therapy, and increased sensitivity to doxorubicin.
