From a clinical standpoint, endorphins and their effects and interactions are still being understood and studied. One basic yet noteworthy interaction of endorphins is with naloxone. Naloxone is administered as a drug, typically in the case of opioid overdose, to mitigate bodily response to the opioid. This is achieved by binding to the opioid receptors, making it not only difficult for opioid binding but also endorphin binding, and thereby reducing the effect of available endorphins. Studies have been conducted in relation to naloxone usage in the presence of depersonalization disorder, and it was found that patient conditions improved. Based on this, endorphins are suspected of being linked with contributing to this disorder. Another interaction of clinical significance includes cases where the patient has a physical dependence on an opiate. Links have been made to opiate dependence and hypothalamo-hypophyseal-gonadal dysfunction. Studies have supported beta-endorphins as affecting the pituitary glandâ€™s release of luteinizing hormone through gonadotropin-releasing hormone influence and thereby as being involved with gonadal homeostasis. Thus, the association is made between the effects of opiate dependency on gonadal homeostasis via the interruption of effective beta-endorphin action. An interesting correlation also has been made about the administration of opioid medications versus non-opioid pain medication prescribed for patients following surgery. Levels of beta-endorphins were found to be high in patients using opioid medications, correlating to a physiological response to pain. However, it was interesting to note that in the presence of rofecoxib (a COX-2 inhibitor), beta-endorphin levels remain unaffected as opposed to in the presence of acetaminophen, where beta-endorphin levels declined with its use. The rofecoxib resulted in a less perceived feeling of pain, potentially attributed to the maintenance of the beta-endorphin levels, but exactly in what way this interaction allowed for this is still being understood. The result of such a deeper understanding would be to exploit that knowledge to use more effective non-opioid pain reducers that lack the negative properties of opioids, such as addiction and tolerance over prolonged usage.
