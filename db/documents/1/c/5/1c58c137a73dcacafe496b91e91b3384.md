Although there is an extensive understanding of clinical presentation, diagnostic criteria, and management of preeclampsia currently utilized routinely, the underlying etiology of preeclampsia is not well-understood. A widely accepted cause of preeclampsia stems from the theory of abnormal placentation leading to significant maternal physiologic dysfunction. Despite these obstacles, the well-supported etiologic origin of preeclampsia has been shown to arise from abnormal placentation, leading to aberrant spiral arteries remodeling, placental ischemia, hypoxia, and oxidative stress.
