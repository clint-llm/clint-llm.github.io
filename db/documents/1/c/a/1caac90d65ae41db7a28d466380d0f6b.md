Although the prognostic outcome of hypotonic labor is good, it is still important to explore the other components of labor when making a diagnosis of an abnormality with power (uterine contraction). A diagnosis of cephalo-pelvic disproportion should not be missed, as this is an immediate indication for cesarean section.

Typically, maternal exhaustion and fetal distress do not present early in hypotonic labor. They occur later in the labor process and should have the utmost priority irrespective of the adequacy of labor progression. Even where cervical dilation is complete or near-complete, fetal distress should not be ignored in favor of a vaginal delivery.

In the absence of an absolute indication for cesarean section, hypotonic contractions are very responsive to the use of oxytocin to augment the labor. It should only be administered by qualified professional personnel who understand the oxytocin indications, dosing, contraindications, and signs of complication within a facility where surgical interventions are immediately accessible. Oxytocin is contraindicated or discontinued in the following conditions:

- Fetal prematurity and fetal distress when vaginal delivery is not imminent

- Contraindication for vaginal delivery (vasa previa, cord prolapse/presentation, active genital herpes, or cervical cancer)

- Cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD)

- Abnormal fetal presentation/position

- Uterine hypertonicity or hyperactivity

- High risk for uterine rupture (grand multiparity, uterine overdistension, or extensive uterine surgeries)

- Obstetric emergencies that necessitate a surgical intervention
