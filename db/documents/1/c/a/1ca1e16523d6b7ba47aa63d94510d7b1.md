The main treatment for xanthomas is for the associated medical conditions that produce these lesions. On occasion, surgical excisional biopsy of these lesions may be performed for symptomatic lesions or to exclude other differential diagnoses. It has been reported that identifying the specific lipid type in a lesion can help with the diagnosis of the broader systemic condition underlying this finding. In symptomatic lesions such as tendinous xanthomas over areas that sustain frequent contact with the external environment (for example, shoe wear in Achilles tendon lesions), complete excision in tandem with medical stabilization of the underlying systemic disease process is preferred in order to minimize the risk of recurrence.

In areas such as the Achilles tendon, where wound healing may be difficult after lesion excision, it is imperative to exercise careful soft tissue management and optimize wound closure techniques (including the potential use of flaps).

Interestingly, reports of spontaneous resolution of smaller xanthomas have been described following liver transplant and plasmapheresis. These findings again emphasize the importance of controlling the systemic disease as the primary objective. Newer treatment options have emerged in the treatment of these metabolic diseases. For example, monoclonal antibodies against the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 gene have been found to be effective agents in familial hypercholesterolemia.
