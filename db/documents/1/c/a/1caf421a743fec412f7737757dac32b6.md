Hydatidiform moles are usually diagnosed during the first trimester of pregnancy. The most common presentation is abnormal bleeding. Other signs include uterine enlargement greater than expected for gestational age, absent fetal heart tones, cystic ovary enlargement, hyperemesis gravidarum, and abnormally high level of hCG for gestational age.

Ultrasound is the gold standard in non-invasive techniques. The most commonly described appearance of a molar pregnancy on ultrasound is the "snowstorm" or "bunches of grapes" pattern of the uterus. However, this is not as commonly seen today due to earlier diagnosis, often in the first trimester. The majority of first-trimester complete moles have a sonographic appearance of a complex, echogenic intrauterine mass which contains multiple small cystic spaces. These spaces correspond to the hydropic villi on gross pathology. Despite the utility of ultrasound in making this diagnosis, in patient's who are presumed to have a spontaneous abortion, a molar pregnancy is detected only after pathology evaluation of a uterine curettage sample. This most often occurs in those with a partial mole.
