Orthostatic proteinuria, also known as postural proteinuria, is a condition where an abnormally large amount of protein is excreted in the urine when the patient is in an upright position and normal protein excretion in the supine position. In this activity, the etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, histophysiology, history and physical, treatment/management, differential diagnosis, ongoing trials, prognosis, complications, consultations, and patient education will be discussed in greater detail. This activity also highlights the role of interprofessional team strategies in improving patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of orthostatic proteinuria.
- Review the necessary steps to take in the evaluation of orthostatic proteinuria.
- Describe the management strategies for orthostatic proteinuria.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes.
