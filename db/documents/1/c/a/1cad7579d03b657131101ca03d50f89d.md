Achilles tendon rupture is the most common tendon rupture in the lower extremity. The injury most commonly occurs in adults in their third to fifth decade of life. Acute ruptures often present with sudden onset of pain associated with a "snapping" or audible "pop" heard at the site of injury. Patients may describe a sensation similar to being kicked in the lower leg. Achilles tendon rupture causes significant pain and disability. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of Achilles tendon rupture and examines the role of the interprofessional team in managing it.

**Objectives:**
- Describe risk factors associated with Achilles tendon rupture. 
- Explain how the Thompson test is performed and what a positive test suggests.
- Describe the factors to consider when deciding whether to treat an Achilles tendon rupture with operative versus nonoperative management.
- Describe how an optimally functioning interprofessional team would coordinate care to enhance outcomes for patients with Achilles tendon rupture.
