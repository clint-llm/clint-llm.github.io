Recommendations are for screening for gestational diabetes at 24 to 28 weeks of pregnancy with a 50-g, 1-hour oral glucose challenge test. If the values are abnormal, greater than or equal to 130 mg/dL (7.22 mmol/L), or greater than or equal to 140 mg/dL (7.77 mmol/L), a confirmatory test is necessary with a 100-g, 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test, with the following values: first hour over 180 mg/dL, second hour over 155 mg/dL, third hour more than 140 mg/dL. The presence of two or more abnormal results establishes the diagnosis of gestational diabetes.

The ADA recommends to consider screening strategy for detecting pregestational diabetes or early gestational diabetes mellitus in all women who are overweight or obese and have one or more of the following risk factors:

- Physical inactivity,

- First degree relative with diabetes

- High-risk race or ethnicity

- Have previously birthed an infant weighing 4000 grams or more

- Previously gestational diabetes, hypertension

- HDL level less than 35mg/dL

- Triglyceride level greater than 250 mg/dL

- Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome

- Hemoglobin A1c greater than 5.7%

- Impaired glucose tolerance test

- Impaired fasting glucose

- History of cardiovascular disease

- Other clinical conditions associated with insulin resistance

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has noted that measurement of hemoglobin A1C is usable, but it may not be suitable to use alone, due to decreased sensitivity compared to oral glucose tolerance test.

The ACOG recommended levels of blood glucose in pregnancy is fasting plasma glucose under 95 mg/dL, 1 hour postprandial under 130-140 mg/dL, 2 hours postprandial below 120mg/dL.

In the postpartum period, 24 to 72 hours after the delivery, it is recommended to monitor glucose levels. After removing the placenta insulin resistance tends to improve, this can help escalate down insulin or hypoglycemic agents. Glycemic therapy will point towards achieving a euglycemic glucose level. At 4 to 12 weeks post-partum, it is recommended to perform a 75g oral glucose tolerance test to rule out the possibility of development of type 2 diabetes.
