An undescended testicle is the most prevalent male congenital defect affecting the male genitalia. Most (about 80%) will descend by the third month of life. It is more frequently found in premature infants. Risks for male infertility and cancer are increased compared to the general population but are still relatively small. The optimal timing of surgical orchidopexy (<18 months of age) is not always followed, and ultrasound is still being done too often unnecessarily. Close collaboration and communication between physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, pediatricians, and urologic surgeons will result in better outcomes and avoid unnecessary procedures while increasing the incidence of timely surgery when indicated.
