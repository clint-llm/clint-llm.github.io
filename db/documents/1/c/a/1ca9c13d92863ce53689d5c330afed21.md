**Prescriptive Authority**

Prescriptive authority refers to the ability of healthcare providers to prescribe specific medications, including controlled substances. Although prescriptive authority refers to a provider's role in prescribing and dispensing legal drugs as described in Title 21, the regulation of this authority does not fall under the federal government's purview. Instead, prescriptive authority is regulated by each state's government.

In every state within the United States, all physicians holding an MD or DO degree have full prescriptive authority. However, there have been some legal disparities between states regarding providing prescriptive authority to other certified providers, such as registered nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs). In some states, these providers may only prescribe certain medications under the supervision of a licensed clinician.

In other states, these providers can prescribe some medications but not controlled substances, and in other states, they have full prescriptive authority at the same level as doctors.
