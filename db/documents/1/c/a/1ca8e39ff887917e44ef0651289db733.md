The chemical reactions by which metabolism occurs is almost the same in all living organisms that include animals, plants, bacteria, and fungi. All these chemical reactions are mediated by proteins that act as catalysts under specific environmental conditions such as pH and temperature. The synthesis of many of the catalysts that mediate chemical reactions throughout our body has its origins in DNA. The deoxyribonucleic acid is the molecule residing within the nucleus, is made of four bases called adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. RNA is the molecule used by some living organisms instead of DNA, and this molecule's components include ribose and uracil instead of thymine. The environment, mostly plants, use sunlight to transform water and carbon dioxide to synthesize carbohydrates. Living organisms do the opposite, consuming carbohydrates and other organic materials to produce energy.

**Thermodynamics**

It is impossible to discuss metabolism without taking a look at the laws of thermodynamics. The first two laws, particularly, merit particular attention. The first two laws of thermodynamics state that energy can neither be created nor destroyed and that the outcome of physical and chemical changes is to increase entropy in the universe. The energy that is actually useful, or free energy, is that kind of energy capable of doing work under no difference in temperature. Less useful forms of energy become liberated in the form of heat.
