Simulation can produce multiple types of data, and in turn, this data can provide significant support for simulation planning, grading stimulated activities, assessing attainment of educational goals and objectives, providing simulation usage reports for strategic planning and financial decisions, and processing academic records. Simulation data can be complex, and often involves multiple data points for multiple learners and systems. Additionally, managing simulation records and ensuring database security across a range of multiple simulation encounters can be challenging.
