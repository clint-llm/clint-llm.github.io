The prognosis of pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals depends on several factors, some of which are:

- Age

- Type and degree of immunocompromise

- Associated comorbidities, for example, diabetes, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, malignancy, etc

- Severity of illness

- The setting of care, i.e., outpatient vs. inpatient (non-ICU) vs. ICU

- Drug resistance of the infective organism

Scoring systems such as the CURB-65 and the pneumonia severity index (PSI) have been developed to predict the prognosis in pneumonia patients in general; however, they are limited in their usefulness in immunocompromised patients.
