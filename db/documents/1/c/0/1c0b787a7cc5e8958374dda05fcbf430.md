Over the years, several patients have been noted to experience a progression to significant optic nerve damage with changes in the visual field and ganglion cell loss. The total duration of elevated IOP is responsible for this damage to the optic nerve, which assumes typical characteristics of a glaucomatous optic nerve head and therefore is assumed to be secondary glaucoma. This association with glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) has been explored extensively.

In one study, as much as 45% of patients at the initial visit presented with concomitant GON.

This category of patients should be treated prophylactically. In one study, up to 26.5% of PSS patients developed GON.Â Factors that could predict progression to GON have been researched. Among those factors examined, the total duration of disease was predictive of glaucoma progression; but the age of onset and number of attacks were not.
