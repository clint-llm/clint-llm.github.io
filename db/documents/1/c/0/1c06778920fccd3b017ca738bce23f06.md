Antimicrobial therapy that can reach effective concentrations in the CSF is required. Immunocompromised patients need aggressive treatment. Initially, empirical therapy is used based on the patientâ€™s age and etiology. For catheter-related ventriculitis, this is generally vancomycin and an anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam (cefepime, ceftazidime or meropenem).

Specific antibiotics are chosen based on in vitro susceptibility and penetration into CSF when meningeal inflammation is present.

Intraventricular antibiotics are an option if the ventriculitis is refractory to systemic therapy. Commonly used antibiotics include vancomycin (5 to 20mg/d) or gentamicin (1 to 8mg/d) but depend on local microbial policies.

Removing all components of the infected shunt or EVD, in combination with antimicrobial therapy, is recommended for catheter-related infection.
