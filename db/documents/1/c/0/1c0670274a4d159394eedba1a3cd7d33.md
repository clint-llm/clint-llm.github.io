Cyanosis is caused due to an absolute increase in the deoxygenated hemoglobin. Therefore, in anemic patients, greater desaturation of arterial hemoglobin is required for cyanosis to manifest, as compared to individuals with normal hemoglobin levels. This means that the appearance of cyanosis in anemic patients warrant immediate attention as their oxygen saturation is very low at this point.
