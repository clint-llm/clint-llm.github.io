Increased acid secretion leads to the development of erosions that can lead to gastric hemorrhage. Although these bleeds may not be life-threatening initially, they may cause patient discomfort or melanotic stools in the early phase and severe hemorrhage 4 to 5 days later.

Stress results in the release of angiotensin II, which decreases blood flow to the mucosa. This causes reactive oxygen species formation, which attacks DNA and results in 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) formation. This results in an oxidative mutagenic byproduct and, subsequently, oxidative stress on the mucosa. On the other hand, naturally produced nitric oxide is believed to protect against stress gastritis because it promotes vasodilation.

Initial symptoms may be persistent nausea associated with epigastric pain, but hemorrhage is typically the first symptom. For a patient in the intensive care unit, nasogastric tube output may become bloody. A patient may even develop hematemesis.

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) may show diffuse gastric inflammation and mild erosions in the stomach and duodenum. These ulcers tend to be shallow. Typically, acute gastric erosions in burn or severe trauma patients can be seen within 3 days of injury.

The most common presenting symptom of stress-induced gastritis is a hemorrhage. Very rarely, approximately 10%, patients will develop perforation.
