Patients with an inguinal hernia may first present to the primary care provider, emergency department physician, nurse practitioner or the internist. Since all hernias have the potential to strangulate or become incarcerated, these patients should be referred to the general surgeon. Laparoscopic hernia repair is now often done for bilateral and recurrent inguinal hernia. TheÂ  technique results in faster recovery, less pain and earlier discharge. However, significant pain and recurrence still occur in a number of patients. Thus, education of the patient is key. Upon discharge the nurse should educate the patient on symptoms of recurrence and when to return to the hospital.
