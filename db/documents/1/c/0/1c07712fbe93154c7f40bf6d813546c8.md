Any adult patient with unexplained daytime or sleep-related symptoms such as excessive sleepiness, fatigue, or unrefreshing sleep should be evaluated for sleep apnea. However, universal screening for OSA is not recommended in asymptomatic patients except for those who are at risk of occupational hazards such as driving or those who are pilots.

Nighttime in-laboratory Level 1 polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard test for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. During the test, patients are monitored with EEG leads, pulse oximetry, temperature and pressure sensors to detect nasal and oral airflow, respiratory impedance plethysmography belts around the chest and abdomen to detect motion, an ECG lead, and EMG sensors to detect muscle contraction in the chin, chest, and legs (as depicted in the polygraph).

Scoring respiratory events in adults rely on 4 channels:

- Oronasal thermal sensor

- Nasal air pressure transducer

- Inductance plethysmography (esophageal manometry or pressure catheter may be used instead)

- Pulse oximetry

*A snoring monitor is a required channel but is not used in scoring any respiratory events

According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), hypopnea can be defined based on one of two criteria. It can either be a reduction in airflow of at least 30% for more than 10 seconds associated with at least 4% oxygen desaturation (Medicare criteria) or a reduction in airflow of at least 30% for more than 10 seconds associated with at least 3% oxygen desaturation or an arousal from sleep on EEG (Recommended  AASM criteria).

Scoring apnea requires both of the following criteria to be met:

- A. Drop in the peak signal excursion by ≥90% of pre-event baseline flow

- B. Duration of the drop in flow is ≥10 seconds.

- Apneas usually further are classified based on effort (RIP signals):
- Obstructive apnea, if there is increased effort throughout the entire apnea
- Central apnea, if there is no effort throughout the entire apnea

Mixed apnea occurs if there is no effort in the first part and there is an effort in the second part of the apnea (See polygraph).

Home sleep tests (HST) or portable monitoring (PM) have gained popularity due to their relative accessibility and lower cost. PM, however, should be used with specific rules and procedures based on the AASM unattended PM task force guidelines, which outlined the following criteria

- At a minimum, PM must record airflow, respiratory effort, and blood oxygenation.

- The airflow, effort, and oximetric biosensors conventionally used for in-laboratory PSG should be used in PM.

- PM testing must be performed under the auspices of an AASM-accredited comprehensive sleep medicine program with written policies and procedures.

- An experienced sleep technologist/technician must apply the sensors or directly educate patients in sensor application.

- The PM device must allow for the display of raw data with the capability of manual scoring or editing of automated scoring by a qualified sleep technician/technologist.

- A board-certified sleep specialist, or an individual who fulfills the eligibility criteria for the sleep medicine certification examination, must review the raw data from PM using scoring criteria consistent with current published AASM standards.

- A follow-up visit to review test results should be performed for all patients undergoing PM.

- In patients with a high pretest probability of moderate to severe OSA, negative or technically inadequate PM tests should prompt in-laboratory polysomnography.

Unattended PM and HST are appropriate for adults with a high pretest probability for sleep apnea and no significant medical comorbidities (advanced congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neurologic disorders). These are level III sleep tests consisting of pulse oximetry, heart rate monitoring, temperature and pressure sensors to detect nasal and oral airflow, resistance belts around the chest and abdomen to detect motion, and a sensor to detect body position. Moderate and severe sleep apnea is detected on these tests, but due to the chance of underestimating the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) relative to the total recording time (which may be longer than the total sleep time measured in an in-lab study), mild sleep apnea may go undiagnosed, and a repeat in-lab study may be needed. A proposed algorithm for the appropriate use of PM and in-lab PSG is outlined in the figure below.

One of the main limitations of HST is that the majority of studies rely on total recording time (TRT) as the denominator instead of total sleep time (TST) in the calculation of AHI as there are no EEG sensors to differentiate sleep from wake. It is estimated that using TRT can result in an underestimation of AHI by at least 20%.

While most PM devices include flow sensors, other technologies use an alternative method without flow such as peripheral arterial tonometry (called PAT) to identify sleep-disordered breathing events. The OSA severity obtained using PAT devices is called pAHI and is reported to provide similar indices to PSG-derived AHI.

The severity of OSA in adults is based on AHI, REI, or pAHI as follows:

- Mild: 5 to 15 events per hour

- Moderate: >15 to 30 events per hour

- Severe: greater than 30 events per hour

The burden of disease in mild OSA is controversial and based on associated clinical sequelae (such as excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep maintenance insomnia, and cognitive dysfunction).

Recent studies challenged however the traditional definition and scoring criteria of OSA in adults due to its limitations in capturing the pathophysiological impact in individual patients.
