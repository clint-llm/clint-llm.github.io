Healthcare workers should be aware that Electrical alternans, although considered pathognomonic for pericardial effusion, is not a diagnostic factor for effusion and cardiac tamponade as other pathologies can result in this ECG finding. If the rhythm is noted on the ECG, the next step is to order an echocardiogram and consult with a cardiologist. If the patient is hemodynamically unstable, immediate drainage of the pericardial fluid is required. The most compelling fact is that electrical alternans is not a benign event and one should always rule out cardiac tamponade first.
