There are four important components that lead to the formation of clinical diseases such as gastritis and ulcer in H. pylori infection. First, the urease activity of H. pylori plays an important role in countering the acidic environment of the stomach. Second, the flagella-mediated motility helps H. pylori bacterium move towards the host gastric epithelial cells. This is followed by the bacterial adhesins interacting with the host cell receptors, leading to successful colonization and persistent infection. Finally, there are many effector proteins/toxins that include cytotoxin-associated gene A (Cag A) and vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA) released by H. pylori that lead to host tissue damage. Both acute and chronic inflammation is seen in H. pylori gastritis as eosinophils, neutrophils, mast cells,Â and dendritic cells are stimulated.
