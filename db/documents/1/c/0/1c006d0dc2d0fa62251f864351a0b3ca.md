Patient education and counseling are critical for the management of such progressive diseases. The patients need to be explained that the disease is progressive and their vision may reduce to a level that their daily activities may be hampered. They need to be counseled about their mental state.

They need to be explained about the available low-vision aids which can help them perform their daily activities. Further, they should be subjected to genetic counseling and ophthalmological screening, which can help them understand the chances of their offspring(s) and siblings developing the same disease. The patients can be given a ray of hope about the possibility of developing a potential therapy that can halt or even reverse the disease.
