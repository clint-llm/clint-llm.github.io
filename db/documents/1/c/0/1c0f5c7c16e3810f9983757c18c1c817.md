There are 3 primary methods for calculating medication dosages; Dimensional Analysis, Ratio Proportion, and Formula or Desired Over Have Method. We will explore the Desired Over Have or Formula Method, one of these 3 methods, in more detail.

Desired Over Have or Formula Method uses a formula or equation to solve for an unknown quantity (x), much like ratio proportion.

Drug calculations requireÂ using conversion factors, for example, when converting from pounds to kilograms or liters to milliliters. Simplistic in design, this method allows clinicians to work with various units of measurement, converting factors to find the answer. These methods are useful in checking the accuracy of the other methods of calculation, thus acting as a double or triple check.
