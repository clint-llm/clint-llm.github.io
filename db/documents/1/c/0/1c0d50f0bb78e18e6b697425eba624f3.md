The thrombolytic nature of streptokinase makes it contraindicated in patients with active internal bleeding, as it can worsen bleeding in some patients. It is also contraindicated in patients with severe uncontrolled hypertension, intracranial neoplasms, surgery within two months, recent stroke, and intraspinal surgery.

Streptokinase administered with extreme caution to those who have experienced recent trauma, coagulopathies or hematologic diseases, gastrointestinal bleeding, infective endocarditis, obstetric deliveries, diabetic hemorrhagic retinopathy, organ biopsies, or previous puncture of a non-compressible vessel. Streptokinase is a pregnancy Category C medication. The effects of streptokinase on a fetus are unknown, and pregnant patients should only receive streptokinase to prevent life-threatening injury.
