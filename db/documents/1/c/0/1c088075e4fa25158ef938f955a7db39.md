Skin biopsy shows upper dermal edema, and a dense perivascular and periadnexal lymphocytic infiltrate without vasculitis. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells and T regulatory cells predominate.

In most patients with a polymorphic light eruption, blood tests will reveal normal results. However, positive antinuclear antibody and extractable nuclear antigen (anti-Ro/La) in low titer may be detected, even in the absence of other criteria to suggest a diagnosis of lupus erythematosus.  When the history or clinical findings indicate, urinary and red cell porphyrin screening may be performed and are negative.

Phototesting is rarely necessary. Specialized centers may undertake photoprovocation testing in late winter, to determine inciting wavelengths. This involves exposure of 5-cm squares of usually-affected skin to 1–2 minimal erythema doses (MED) of broadband UVB and to varying doses of UVA.  The test is repeated on the same site daily for 3 days and the area examined to detect the typical rash. False negative responses occur in 10% to 40% of tested individuals. Formal monochromator MED testing is non-contributory, usually demonstrating expected results for the patient’s skin color.
