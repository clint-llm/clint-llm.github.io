Patients may describe a dislocation and potential self-reduction of the elbow.

If dislocated, the elbow deformity will be obvious. Note the position of comfort; this will be approximately 75 degrees of flexion if a large effusion is present.

The ulnar or medial collateral ligaments of the elbow testing can be by performing standard valgus stress to the elbow. This should be performed with the elbow flexed to 30 degrees, allowing the olecranon to disengage the humerus. It may be difficult to stabilize the humerus and subtle laxity in the UCL can be missed. Therefore, the “moving valgus stress test” is an important test to learn. It has been noted to have a very high sensitivity.

The “milking maneuver” is another good examination tool to assess the medial ligamentous structures which may be frequently injured in association with a coronoid process fracture.  This involves placing the involved upper extremity in a position where the shoulder and elbow are both flexed to 90 degrees and the forearm is supinated.  From this position, either the patient or the examiner may pull the thumb to apply a valgus force on the elbow.  A positive test is apprehension, medial elbow pain, or instability at the elbow.

Posterolateral rotatory instability (PLRI) may be assessed with both the “lateral pivot shift test” and the “posterolateral drawer test”.  The pivot shift test is performed is initiated with the patient supine, the arm abducted over the head and fully externally rotated, and the forearm supinated. The clinician holds the wrist. A valgus and supinating force is applied along with gentle axial compression as the elbow is moved from full extension into flexion. A positive test involved pain and apprehension at approximately 40 degrees of flexion. If performed under anesthesia, a clunk may be appreciated with a dimple visualized proximal to the radial head. This represents subluxation of the radiocapitallar joint. Further flexion should lead to a reduction of the joint.

The posterolateral rotatory drawer test is completed with the elbow at a position of 30 to 40 degrees of flexion. The examiner then applies a posteriorly directed force to the lateral portion of the proximal forearm; this resembles hyper-supination of the forearm. The goal is to translate the radius and ulna posteriorly by pivoting around the intact medial elbow ligaments. A test is deemed positive if apprehension or skin dimpling is noted.

Perhaps a simpler physical exam maneuver can be performed by having the patient push up from the armrest of their chair with the forearm supinated and shoulders abducted. Pain, instability, and apprehension can again be considered a positive test for posterolateral rotatory instability.  Repeating the maneuver with the forearm pronated by eliminating the apprehension.
