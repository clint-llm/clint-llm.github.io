The two forms of isosorbide (isosorbide mononitrate and isosorbide dinitrate) vary extensively in their pharmacokinetic properties. The liver contains organic nitrate reductase, which removes the nitrate group in a stepwise manner and ultimately inactivates the drug. After oral administration, isosorbide dinitrate undergoes an extensive first-pass effect in the liver, reducing the oral bioavailability to 20 percent.

The elimination half-life of isosorbide dinitrate is 1 hour, while the elimination half-life of isosorbide mononitrate is 5 to 6 hours.

The commonly available forms of isosorbide are:

**Short-acting**

- Isosorbide dinitrate, sublingual - 2.5 to 10 mg (duration of action - 10 to 60 minutes)

**Long-acting**

- Isosorbide dinitrate, oral - 10 to 40 mg 3 times a day (duration of action - 4 to 6 hours)

- Isosorbide dinitrate, spray - 1.25 mg per dose

- Isosorbide dinitrate, oral sustained-release capsules/tablets - 40 mg,14 hours apart (duration of action:12 to 14 hours)

- Isosorbide mononitrate, oral - 20 mg twice daily, 7 hours apart (duration of action - 6 to 10 hours)

- Isosorbide mononitrate, oral sustained-release tablets - 30 to 120 mg daily

- A fixed-dose combination of isosorbide dinitrate (20 mg) and hydralazine hydrochloride (37.5 mg) has received approval for use in treating heart failure in African-Americans
