The immune system is the body’s defense against invaders. Opsonization occurs in the immune system. The organ systems involved are dependent on what mechanism is used. The lymphatic system is responsible for the transport and filtration of lymph fluid, which contains antibodies and lymphocytes. The cardiovascular system is responsible for the circulation of blood, which is necessary for an important factor in the alternative complement system pathway. The lectin-complement system pathway requires the involvement of the liver. The liver is part of the gastrointestinal (GI) system. These organ systems work together to fight off bacteria, viruses, and other invaders that are trying to attack the body.
