Acute stroke is commonly called a cerebrovascular accident; however, a stroke is not an accident. A more meaningful term is "brain attack," similar in significance to "heart attack," but stroke is more heterogeneous than heart disease. Stroke is classified as ischemic or hemorrhagic, and hemorrhagic is subdivided into intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), more specifically nontraumatic (spontaneous) ICH and nontraumatic (spontaneous aneurysmal) SAH.

Ischemic strokes are due to blood vessel blockage limiting the blood supply to the brain. In contrast, hemorrhagic strokes are due to blood vessel rupture leading to blood spilling into the intracranial cavity.

The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) provides an exhaustive definition of stroke.

Globally, stroke is the second leading cause of death and a leading cause of disability.

Knowing that the ability to achieve complete neurologic recovery declines with each untreated minute of an acute stroke is essential. This is the basis for the "time is brain" concept in which due emphasis is placed on the timely evaluation and management of an acute stroke. With early and focused treatment, rehabilitation programs, and long-term lifestyle changes, clinical outcomes can be significantly improved for patients with an acute stroke, hopefully leading to maximal clinical recovery for the individual patient and decreasing the global burden of stroke.
