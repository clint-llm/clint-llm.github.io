Methimazole (MMI) is an anti-thyroid drug that belongs to drug class thionamides. The primary mechanism of action of methimazole is to block thyroid hormone production from the thyroid gland. It interferes with the step that causes the iodination of tyrosine residues in thyroglobulin, mediated by the enzyme thyroid peroxidase, thus preventing the synthesis of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine(T3).

An additional mechanism is by inhibiting the iodotyrosyl residues from the coupling. Methimazole may also interfere with the oxidation of the iodide ion and iodotyrosyl groups. Eventually, thyroglobulin gets depleted, and circulating thyroid hormone levels decrease. It may also help to control diseases by affecting the overall immune system. Various studies show the reduction of immune molecules like intracellular adhesion molecule 1, soluble interleukin 2, and anti-thyrotropin receptor antibody over time, thus alleviating immune-related hyperthyroid issues.

However, this drug does not affect the existing thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) in the circulation or stored in the thyroid gland. Similarly, there have been no observations of alterations in the effectiveness of exogenously administered thyroid hormones.
