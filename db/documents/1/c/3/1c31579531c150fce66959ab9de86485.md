Differential diagnosis of PLMS will include:

- Restless leg syndrome

- Peripheral neuropathy

- REM behavioral disorder

- Uremia

Less common sleep-related movement disorders must also merit consideration.

- Excessive fragmentary myoclonus (EFM)

- Sleep-related leg cramps, bruxism

- Rhythmic feet movements (RFM)

- Hypnagogic foot tremors (HFT)

- Alternating leg muscle activation (ALMA)

The clinical focus while evaluating any patient with sleep-related limb movements is to ask for symptoms of restless leg syndrome. Then consider other common sleep disordersÂ potentially associated with PLMS, like narcolepsy, OSA, REM behavioral disorder, and uremia. If any of these are present, then the diagnosis of PLMD cannot be made.
