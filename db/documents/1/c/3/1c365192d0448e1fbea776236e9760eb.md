While the Rinne and Weber tuning fork tests can be useful in preliminary evaluation of hearing loss, they are not usually performed as standalone tests due to variable reports of sensitivity and specificity and limited diagnostic utility in quantifying the degree of any hearing loss detected.

Tuning fork tests are a helpful clinical tool due to their convenience and ease of use, but audiometry is the gold standard for formal hearing loss evaluation. For this reason, tuning fork tests are mainly indicated in the setting of suspected hearing loss in a communicative patient as an initial clinical workup to guide further auditory testing or in certain post-operative situations to confirm patent auditory neural pathways.

An indication for PTA is suspected hearing loss in a patient who can participate in behavioral hearing testing. However, according to U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations, PTA is not recommended as a screening protocol for asymptomatic adult patients due to insufficient evidence to assess the harms and benefits of screening.

In contrast, ABR testing as part of newborn hearing screening is universally recommended. It is important for early diagnosis of and intervention in a number of treatable causes of hearing loss to encourage proper language development as the child grows.
