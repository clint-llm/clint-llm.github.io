As with the homeostasis established via processes performed by the SNS and PSNS, drugs from each of the four categories listed above also work inversely to each other. The primary mechanism of action for most of these agents are to serve as either agonists or antagonists of specific receptors within these systems.

For adrenoreceptors stimulated by norepinephrine (synapses) and epinephrine (endocrine), involved in SNS processes

- **Alpha-1 (A1)**– located mostly in postsynaptic effector cells found in smooth muscle; effects mediated by IP3/DAG path, include mydriasis due to contraction of radial muscles, constriction of arteries and veins, urinary retention due to internal/external urethral sphincter contraction, and a decrease in renin release from renal juxtaglomerular cells

- **Alpha-2 (A2)**– located in presynaptic adrenergic terminals found in lipocytes and smooth muscle; effects mediated by decreasing cAMP, including a decrease in norepinephrine release, stimulates platelet aggregation and decreases insulin secretion

- **Beta-1 (B1)**– located in postsynaptic effector cells in the SA node of the heart, lipocytes, brain, juxtaglomerular apparatus of renal tubules, and the ciliary body epithelium; effects mediated by increasing cAMP, including increased heart rate and the conduction velocity through the cardiac nodes, also increases renin release from renal juxtaglomerular cells

- **Beta-2 (B2)**– located in postsynaptic effector cells in smooth muscle and cardiac myocytes; effects mediated by increasing cAMP, include vasodilation, bronchiole dilation, increased insulin secretion, and uterine relaxation

- **Beta-3 (B3)**– located in postsynaptic effector cells in lipocytes and myocardium; similar effects to beta-1 receptors mediated by increasing cAMP

For cholinoreceptors stimulated by acetylcholine, most involved in PSNS processes

- **Muscarinic-1 (M1)**– important to note is the only cholinoreceptor involved in an SNS process, located in sweat glands of the skin; effects mediated by IP3/DAG path, include glandular contraction and increased secretion

- **Muscarinic-2 (M2)**– located in SA and AV nodes and myocardium; effects mediated by decreasing cAMP, include decreasing heart rate and myocardial conduction velocity

- **Muscarinic-3 (M3)**– located in the smooth muscle of various organ systems; effects mediated by IP3/DAG path, include contraction of the ciliary muscle causing miosis, contraction of bronchioles, increased bronchiole secretions, increased GI motility, detrusor muscle contraction, and internal/external urethral sphincter relaxation

- **Muscarinic-4 (M4)**and**Muscarinic (M5)**- located primarily in the CNS, e.g., forebrain and substania nigra, respectively

- **Nicotinic-N (NN)**– located in postsynaptic dendrites of both sympathetic and parasympathetic postganglionic neurons; effects mediated by Na+/K+ depolarization, include increased neurotransmission

- **Nicotinic-M (NM)**– located in neuromuscular endplates of skeletal muscle; effects mediated by Na+/K+ depolarization, include skeletal muscle contraction

For dopamine receptors, most involved in both SNS and PSNS processes

- **Dopamine 1-5 (D1-5)**– located in the CNS, except for Dopamine-1 receptors, which also appear in renal vasculature; effects mediated by cAMP path, include renal artery vasodilation, increased renal blood flow, and modulation of neuroendocrine signaling

In terms of the four categories mentioned, each is an agonist and/or antagonist of the receptors listed. Cholinomimetics have agonist activity at muscarinic receptors augmenting PSNS activity to achieve the desired effects of increasing GI motility and decreasing intraocular pressure.

Within the SNS system, adrenoreceptor agonists/sympathomimetics work at alpha and beta receptors to potentiate SNS activity to achieve higher cardiac output and fast bronchodilation.
