Laboratory evaluation is indicated for neonatal anemia or hyperbilirubinemia. Childhood chronic anemia with splenomegaly warrants investigation. Transfusion-dependent patients require evaluation.****Complete blood count characterizes anemia. Hemoglobin levels vary for different severities of PK deficiency. A blood smear shows normochromic cells. Polychromasia with echinocytes may be seen. Spherocytes are absent. Macrocytosis indicates folate deficiency.

PK activity level is key to the diagnosis. PKD suspicion is warranted with near-normal PK levels. In these cases, adjusted measures are necessary. RBC age-corrected PK enzyme levels are low. Pyruvate kinase/hexokinase activity ratio is also low.

Genetic analysis showing PKLR mutations is diagnostic. Mutation types are elucidated by this method.

Iron overload is a risk in PKD. Regular screening with iron studies may reveal its onset.
