Care of the patient with hepatic injury often begins in the trauma bay. First responders can give provide crucial information regarding the mechanism of injury that may help the clinician discern whether a liver injury may exist. Trauma to the anterior or lateral wall or thoracoabdominal region may raise the suspicion of a possible hepatic injury. As with all trauma patients, the evaluation must be guided with advanced trauma life support principles. The primary survey should be conducted to identify immediately life-threatening injuries. For patients with hepatic injury, the primary survey should identify the presence of hypovolemic shock from liver bleeding. Vital sign changes present in hemorrhagic shock include a narrow pulse pressure, hypotension, and tachycardia.

After the primary survey is completed, the secondary survey should be conducted by performing a head-to-toe exam that can identify any potential injuries. Patients with the liver injury can have right upper quadrant tenderness, and the presence of abdominal distention can suggest hemoperitoneum.
