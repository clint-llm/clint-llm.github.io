Although PEG tube placement is a relatively safe procedure, there are several minor and major complications to note. Some minor complications reported include peristomal wound infection, granuloma formation, tube leakage into the abdominal cavity causing peritonitis, stoma leakage, inadvertent PEG removal, tube blockage, pneumoperitoneum, and gastric outlet obstruction. Major complications include aspiration pneumonia (particularly with a weak lower esophageal sphincter), hemorrhage, buried bumper syndrome, perforated viscus, necrotizing fasciitis, colonic fistula (due to misplacement of the PEG tube), and metastatic seeding.
