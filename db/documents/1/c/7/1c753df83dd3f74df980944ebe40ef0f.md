Stimulators that are paraesthesia based or paraesthesia free are the two main types of stimulators. There are persistently activated stimulators, high frequency, and burst stimulators. Electrical impulse control determines either persistent or tonic delivery.

The technique of installation is relatively comparable from one type of stimulator to another. When surgical leads are placed, it is typically done with spinal anesthesia using bupivacaine. Paresthesia testing can still be complete despite the anesthesia.

Stimulator implantation requires fluoroscopy to determine proper lead placement. Lead placement depends on the location of the patient's back pain. A small cut is made to insert an epidural needle and to insert the leads. For example, in the case of chronic low back pain, the leads would be placed at the levels of T8 to L1. For neck pain, the leads are positioned above C3 in the epidural space.
