Histopathology in affected skin shows a reduction of the number of melanocytes and a decreased number and size of melanosomes in the epidermal basal layer with a selective decrease in eumelanin without pigmentary incontinence. There is no extracellular melanin in the dermis and no evidence of inflammation. Depigmented areas contain increased numbers of epidermal Langerhans cells. Special stains such as Fontana-Masson and immunostains such as SOX 10, MIFT, or Melan A can confirm the decreased activity of melanocytes.
