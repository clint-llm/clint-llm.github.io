The potential causes of hearing loss are varied, and their management options correspondingly so. Many common causes of hearing impairment, such as age-related hearing loss, are considered 'benign.' However, as stated earlier, even benign hearing loss can contribute to social isolation andÂ depression, and therefore patients should be encouraged to seek help regarding hearing loss if they or a relative notice that their hearing is declining. Patients presenting with hearing loss should undergo appropriate and thorough clinical assessment, including a pure tone audiogram, to determine whether further investigations are required.
