Halogenated agents, including sevoflurane, desflurane, isoflurane, enflurane, and halothane, all decrease mean arterial pressure (MAP) with increasing concentrations of the anesthetic gas in a dose-dependent manner.

Cardiac output (CO) is reduced with increasing concentrations of inhaled anesthetics.

Tachycardia is commonly seen during maintenance administration of halogenated inhalation agents and is thought to be compensatory to the reduction in cardiac output as described above. The heart rate is dose-dependent as concentration increases and is slightly different for each agent. The concentration of inhalation anesthetics is standardized by the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC), a known concentration of inhaled anesthetic at whichÂ fifty percent of patients do not elicit a physical response to a painful stimulus. Tachycardia is typically induced at the following concentrations for isoflurane, desflurane, and sevoflurane respectively: 0.25, 1.0, and 1.5 MAC.

Rapid increases in the concentration of desflurane and isoflurane have significant effects on the heart rate, different from the maintenance dose as described above. Desflurane has the most profound response. An abrupt increase of desflurane concentration from 4% to 8% in less than a minute may result in a doubling of the heart rate and blood pressure above baseline in the absence of opiates, beta-blockers, or clonidine.
