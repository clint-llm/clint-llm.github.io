Despite some limitations, the assessment of IADLs remains useful in determining the cognitive function of an individual. Individuals with MCI who have impairments performing IADLs are more likely to develop dementia. The ability to perform IADLs is the first to decline in individuals with Alzheimer disease, while the ability to perform basic activities remains unimpaired. This finding can be helpful to healthcare professionals in detecting early-onset Alzheimer and dementia.

In most hospitals, the interdisciplinary approach to healthcare has become a popular concept. In rehab facilities, the physician, nurses, occupational therapists, and physical therapists work together to share knowledge and patient care skills. As stated before, occupational therapists generally assess ADLs and IADLs. Reports from occupational therapists can help analyze the functional and mental status of the patient. Studies have shown physical disability is a strong risk factor for cognitive decline. Thus, physicians and occupational therapists need to work closely together to minimize the risk of physical disability to limit cognitive decline. Understanding the importance of assessing ADLs and IADLs is crucial, as it can be a useful screening tool for dementia in the elderly population.
