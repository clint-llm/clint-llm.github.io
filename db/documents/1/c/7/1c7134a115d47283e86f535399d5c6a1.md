A typical presenting symptom is a thunderclap headache. Patients usually describe it as the "worst headache of my life." This problem should prompt further imaging. A headache is frequently associated with nausea, vomiting (often projectile), nuchal rigidity, and photophobia. Meningismus is typically present due to blood extending into the fourth ventricle. As the blood moves further down the spinal cord, it irritates surrounding nerves causing neck pain and stiffness. Practitioners should perform a detailed exam. The presence of a focal deficit increases the grade of subarachnoid hemorrhage and changes the perspective of post-event recovery. Patients with a high-grade subarachnoid hemorrhage often present in a state of coma that calls for an urgent evaluation and treatment, as in some the coma can be reversible.
