Hypogonadism can be due to congenital or acquired causes. Ambiguous genitalia, micropenis, and bilateral cryptorchidism are all signs of testosterone deficiency in pre-pubertal males. Karyotype testing is done in young adults to rule out conditions such as Turner syndrome and Klinefelter syndrome which can result in testosterone deficiency. Some causes of primary hypogonadism include Klinefelterâ€™s syndrome, undescended testicles, mumps orchitis, hemochromatosis, cancer treatment, and normal aging. Causes of secondary hypogonadism include Kallman syndrome, pituitary disorders, HIV, obesity, surgery, trauma, and stress-induced hypogonadism
