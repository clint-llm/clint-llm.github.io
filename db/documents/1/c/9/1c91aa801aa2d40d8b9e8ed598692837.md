These patients are typically brought to breast tumor board prior to surgery so that a prospective plan is made before taking the patients for surgery. The surgeon then obtains informed consent before the operation. This includes the patients with possible axillary dissection during a sentinel lymph node biopsy procedure, in addition to patients who had a planned axillary lymphadenectomy. Radiotracer and/or lymphazurin/methylene blue are not necessary for this procedure but may have been used if the initial procedure was a sentinel lymph node biopsy that was converted to axillary dissection.
