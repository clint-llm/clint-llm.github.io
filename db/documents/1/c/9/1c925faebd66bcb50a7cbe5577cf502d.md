Despite being the gold standard for diagnosing multiple sleep disorders, polysomnograms (PSGs) have several limitations. For example, the first-night effect, which is due to poor sleep because of a new sleeping environment, may lead to underestimating OSA due to the potential for decreased REM sleep being captured.

In addition to diagnostic limitations, there are also systemic interfering factors with PSG. Performing a PSG requires an adequate sleep period, highly trained technicians to administer the study, and sleep providers interpreting the study, resulting in high cost. As a result, insurance companies usually require prior authorizations, placing many barriers between the patient and their ability to get a PSG even when indicated. The PSG data itself is also not portable in many cases, requiring unique software that is not readily exportable.
