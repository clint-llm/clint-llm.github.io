Biopsies of EBV positive mucocutaneous ulcer demonstrate surface ulceration with infiltrates of atypical lymphoid cells. This lymphoid component is variable in appearance and can have a similar histological appearance to that of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). There may be a mixed inflammatory infiltrate with lymphocytes, plasma cells, histiocytes, and eosinophils. Often there is a rim of reactive T-cells around the EBV-positive B-cell areas. Immunoblasts have been shown to express markers consistent with B-cell immunophenotypes.
