Carotidynia is associated with anxiety in a number of patients. Patients should be reassured about the relatively benign nature of this condition, as compared to carotid artery dissection, giant cell temporal arteritis, and neck neoplasms. However, they should also be counseled that relapse of symptoms is not an uncommon occurrence, with the majority of patients experiencing a repeat episode within 1Â to 6 months. The patients should be reviewed clinically and informed about the reoccurrence of carotidynia and that it is usually benign.
