Management of primary thyroid lymphoma requires the involvement of an interprofessional team of specialists from different departments that includes a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, otolaryngologist, primary care physician, endocrinologist, pathologist, and specialty care nurses. Patients usually present to their primary care physician,Â nurse practitioner or endocrinologist with an enlarged neck mass and obstructive symptoms, and it is the responsibility of the initial physician to have a high degree of suspicion for thyroid lymphoma and involve the otolaryngologist and the pathologist for establishing a diagnosis with a core biopsy of the thyroid. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, the medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, and an endocrinologist should all have involvement in the case; additional workup and treatment should commence immediately. Primary thyroid lymphoma has a good prognosis if the patient receives well-coordinated care from all the specialists promptly. As can be seen, thyroid lymphoma diagnosis and management require an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. Oncology nurses administer chemotherapy, educate patients and their families, and keep the team apprised of the status of the patient. The pharmacist reviews medications for dose and drug-drug interactions and also participate in education. [Level 5]
