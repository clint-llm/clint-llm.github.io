Patients commonly present with an itchy, red rash.  These typically present on the exposed skin of the neck, trunk, and/or extremities.

On physical exam, single or multiple lesions are usually circular or ovoid in appearance with patches and plaques.  These annular lesions demonstrate sharp marginations with a raised erythematous scaly edge which may contain vesicles.  The degree of inflammation is variable.

The lesions advance centrifugally from a core, leaving a central clearing and mild residual scaling; this appears as a "ring" shape giving rise to the term "ringworm."
