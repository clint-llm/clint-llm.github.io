When an athlete develops an acute posterior thigh pain during a game, which makes it difficult to return to play immediately, a hamstring injury should be suspected. Acute hamstring injuries have pain with weight-bearing and an abnormal stiff-legged gait as a result of avoiding hip and knee flexion. If there is an associated complete rupture from the ischial tuberosity, pain can be localized to the proximal thigh with point tenderness at the ischial tubercle. Patients often have difficulty sitting as a result of pain at the avulsion site. Usually, proximal injuries go hand in hand with the distal strain of semimembranosus, which might divert attention.****

Physical examination, though an important part of the initial evaluation of hamstring injury, should not be relied upon completely to determine the exact natureÂ of the injury due to the deep location of the hamstring muscles. Localized swelling in the posterior thigh with tenderness to palpation and induration in the posterior thigh along the hamstring muscle bellies are the common examination findings. Complete rupture may have a palpable defect within the muscle substance.
