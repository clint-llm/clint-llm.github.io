The first line of treatment is with valproic acid or lamotrigine. Though ethosuximide may be helpful for absence seizures, it is not effective for generalized tonic-clonic seizures and, therefore, not the first line of treatment for a patient with both absence seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures.

In view of the side-effects of valproic acid, such as teratogenicity and weight gain, it has to be used with caution in young female patients. Therefore lamotrigine may be the preferred agent in this group of patients.

Juvenile absence epilepsy is typically a pharmaco-responsive epilepsy syndrome but some medications may exacerbate seizures such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, gabapentin, pregabalin, and vigabatrin.
