Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to all known vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) isoforms. It blocks the interaction between VEGF-A and the VEGF receptors (VEGFR), primarily VEGFR-1 (fit-1) and VEGFR-2 (KDRflk-1), on the surface of endothelial cells. It is 93% human and 7% murine in the protein sequence. The binding of VEGF-A to VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 leads to endothelial cell proliferation, the activation of survival pathways, and the formation of new blood vessels and angiogenesis. Therefore, the administration of bevacizumab inhibits microvascular growth and angiogenesis and is used in cancer treatment to inhibit malignant cell growth and blood vessel formation.

**Pharmacokinetics**

Absorption: A PK study concluded bevacizumab follows linear pharmacokinetics and is expected to reach 90% of steady-state concentration by 84 days.

Distribution: The volume of distribution is 2.9 L. After correcting for body weight, males have a larger central volume of distribution (3.2 L vs. 2.7 L) than females.

Metabolism: The metabolism of bevacizumab is likely identical to endogenous antibodies like IgG, i.e., by proteolytic catabolism, involving non-specific elimination pathways and target-mediated elimination by VEGF-expressing cells. Hence it doesn't affect the activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes in the liver.

Elimination: The mean clearance is 0.23 L/day. After correcting for body weight, clearance is approximately 26% higher in men than in women. The estimated half-life is 20 days. The clearance of bevacizumab alters by body weight, sex, and tumor burden. Clearance is reduced with increased albumin and reduced alkaline phosphatase.
