The managementÂ of chronic pain is complex and should be done with an interprofessional team that consists of a pain specialist, nurse anesthetist, primary care provider, neurologist, psychiatrist, radiologist, physical therapist and an anesthesiologist. With a major epidemic of opioid overdose currently ongoing in the US, healthcare workers are asked to refrain from prescribing these agents and seek other ways to combat pain. It is important to work as an interprofessional team because pain can be managed without opiates in most patients.
