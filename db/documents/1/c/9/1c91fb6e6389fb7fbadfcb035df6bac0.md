Preoperatively, the woman should be examined in the lithotomy position. Using a mirror to visualize her genitalia, she should indicate her concerns to the surgeon. This ensures the surgeon and patient agree on the aesthetic goals. Photographs should be taken with the patient in lithotomy and in a standing position with legs slightly abducted to shoulder width to visualize labial protrusion adequately. Pre-operative antibiotics are given within 30 minutes of the incision. This procedure can be performed in the office with conscious sedation and local anesthetics or as an outpatient surgery under monitored anesthesia care or general endotracheal anesthesia. As with any gynecologic or genital procedure, it is often prudent to have an assistant/witness present in the room for any intimate examination. Ideally, this person will be of the same assigned and chosen gender as the patient for the medico-legal safety of all involved.
