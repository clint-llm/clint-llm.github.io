Hepatocellular carcinoma develops from chronic liver disease caused by multiple risk factors. Hepatocellular carcinoma has a strong association with chronic hepatitis B and C virus (HBV and HCV) infections. Chronic hepatitis infections with other associated risk factors, including coinfection hepatitis D (HDV), alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, may have a higher liver cancer risk.
