In preparation for the facelift, the patient should be encouraged to stop smoking at least 3 to 4 weeks before the surgery. Patients should also be instructed to discontinue any anticoagulation, if possible, before surgery to avoid postoperative hematomas and reduce intraoperative blood loss. During the preoperative visit, the plastic surgeon should document any facial asymmetry, as well as the preoperative function of cranial nerves five and seven, and the great auricular nerve. Lastly, the patient should be positioned upright to appreciate the extent of soft tissue descent and plan the surgery.

A marker should be used to delineate the path of the intended incisions and flap elevation. Some physicians will mark the zygomatic ligament, the zygomaticus major muscle, the mandibular ligament, and the SMAS. The path of the great auricular nerve or the temporal branch of the facial nerve can also be marked preemptively to avoid injury during the surgery.
