Cervical radiculopathy is most commonly precipitated by compression of a nerve root. Diagnosis is made by combining the patientâ€™s symptoms, sensory and motor physical exam findings, and electrodiagnostic results. An electrodiagnostic evaluation may not be necessary if the clinical presentation is clear; however, electrodiagnostic studies confirm the diagnosis and determine prognosis.

The most common cause of compressive nerve radiculopathy is disc herniation; however, other compressive etiologies can cause nerve radiculopathy, including osteophyte, facet hypertrophy, and ligamentous hypertrophy. Noncompressive causes cannot be distinguished by electrodiagnostic testing form compressive ones unless they involve multiple myotomes and dermatomes. They include trauma, tumor, infections, demyelination, infarction, and post-radiation injury.
