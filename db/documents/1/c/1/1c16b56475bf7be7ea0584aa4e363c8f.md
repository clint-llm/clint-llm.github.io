The general mechanism by which a nociceptive neuron detects and reacts to a noxious stimulus has been a focus throughout this article. However, herein is a closer look at a model nociceptor, in this case, a thermosensitive nociceptor, with the goal being to better explain the cell-specific activities regarding detection, activation, afferent signaling, local signaling, and signal termination.

A noxious heat stimulus (if under physiologic conditions) or a sub-noxious heat stimulus (if sensitized by inflammatory markers such as prostaglandins or bradykinin) gets detected by TRPV1 (40 to 43 degrees Celsius) or TRPV2 (52 degrees Celsius) receptors.

The initial depolarization also mediates the release of many pro-inflammatory cytokines into the extracellular milieu; these cytokines include substance P and neurokinin A, which are neuropeptides, as well as the calcitonin-gene-related-peptide (CGRP).

The activated channels close once they become dephosphorylated, or the noxious stimulus ceases. Alternatively, only the overwhelming influx of calcium and sodium cations may halt the local inflammatory and nociceptive signals.
