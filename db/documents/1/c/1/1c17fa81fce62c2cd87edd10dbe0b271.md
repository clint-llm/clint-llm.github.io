The differential diagnosis of essential thrombocytosis is broad. Differential diagnosis includes other causes of clonal neoplasms, reactive and spurious thrombocytosis. Clonal causes include different types of myeloproliferative disorders including polycythemia vera and primary myelofibrosis. The presentation of essential thrombocytosis and other myeloproliferative disorders overlap considerably, and the only way to be sure of the diagnosis is to rule out the other myeloproliferative disorders.
