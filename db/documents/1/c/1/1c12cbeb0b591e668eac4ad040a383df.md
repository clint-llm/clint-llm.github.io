Historically, closed non-displaced fractures with less than 50% of displacement could be treated non-operatively, given the low degree of surrounding periosteal and interosseous membrane damage associated with non-displaced fractures.

In contrast, proximal shaft fractures are more likely to require surgical intervention due to their association with radial head instability. Open isolated ulnar shaft fractures also require a formal surgical debridement with internal fixation, as is the standard of care for open fractures. More than 5 mm of displacement or shortening is an indication for surgical stabilization. Polytrauma patients are also more likely to benefit from surgical stabilization, as surgical intervention allows for easier utilization of the extremity sooner after injury.
