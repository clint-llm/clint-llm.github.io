Since carotidynia is a self-limiting condition that spontaneously resolves with 7-14 days, the treatment is generally supportive. Initial treatment includes rest, reassurance, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or aspirin.****is usually prescribed.

In the past, antimigraine medications such as propranolol, tricyclic antidepressants, ergotamine, and methysergide were frequently used for the treatment of carotidynia. However, this trend decreased once carotidynia was removed from the International Classification of Headache disorders in 2004. In recent years, there is one case report which describes the efficacy of an antimigraine medication, almotriptan, in alleviating the symptoms of a patient diagnosed with carotidynia.
