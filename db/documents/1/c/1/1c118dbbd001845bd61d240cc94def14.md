Although the most common cause of olecranon bursitis is blunt injury, symptom onset can be delayed by more than a week and often the patient does not remember the inciting injury at all. In addition, the relatively low risk of infectious etiology plus spontaneous remission allows the common practice to include the complete absence of testing or aspiration during the initial evaluation. Although such conservative evaluation remains relatively safe, it exposes the clinician and patient to possible missed infection. It is highly recommended that any patients with significant comorbidities undergo routine aspiration with fluid analysis as part of their evaluation.
