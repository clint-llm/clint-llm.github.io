The standard instruments required for any intubation should be available. For intubation, the provider will need a laryngoscope handle and blade with proper lighting, a properly-sized endotracheal tube, an air-filled syringe to inflate the cuff, a stylet, and a source of oxygen. The gold standard for monitoring endotracheal intubation is end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring

Additional equipment necessary for intubating a difficult airway should be located at the bedsideÂ as well. This equipment will be dictated by the clinician who is performing the procedure and what is available. It is prudent to have a 'difficult airway cart' in any unit where intubations are frequently performed such as the emergency department (ED), intensive care unit (ICU), operating room (OR). Options include a video laryngoscope, Combitube, bougies, intubating laryngeal mask airway, intubating stylet, fiber-optic bronchoscope, and an articulating laryngoscope.
