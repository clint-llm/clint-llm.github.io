When carnitine deficiency is suspected, the first step is to measure plasma carnitine levels.SLC22A5Â gene, followed by the array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) if the sequence analysis is not conclusive. There is usually a poor correlation between genotype and phenotypic expression in PCD.

If genetic testing fails to confirm PCD diagnosis, functional assay such as the cultured skin fibroblast carnitine assay is the preferred test. In PCD, the OCTN2 transporter activity is <10% of normal controls.

In the U.S., the newborn screening test includes evaluation for PCD. By tandem mass spectrometry method, low plasma free carnitine levels are detected in newborns with PCD. Due to placental transfer of carnitine from the mother to the fetus, low fetal plasma creatinine levels shortly after birth can reflect the maternal plasma carnitine levels. Some mothers are diagnosed following their infants being detected with carnitine deficiency in their newborn screening tests. Therefore, if the newborn screening detects low carnitine levels, both the baby and the mother are re-tested, after two weeks, to determine who has PCD.
