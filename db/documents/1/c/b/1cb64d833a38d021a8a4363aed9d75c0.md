MEN2A and MEN2B should be suspected in any patient diagnosed with MTC or pheochromocytoma, particularly when the age of presentation is very young (younger than 35). MTC most commonly presents with a solitary thyroid nodule and/or cervical lymphadenopathy. Any patient with diagnosed MTC or family history of MTC should be tested for RET proto-oncogene mutations for both MEN2A and MEN2B. The patients who are diagnosed with pheochromocytoma at the age earlier than that of its sporadic forms should be tested for MEN2A and MEN2B. The classic symptoms of pheochromocytoma are the paroxysms of a headache, anxiety, diaphoresis and palpitations, and high blood pressure. The presence of these symptoms in the third decade, particularly in between 25 and 32 years, should prompt to screen for MEN2.

A detailed history of the presence of associated conditions (described above) in the patient or the family members should be taken. Other possible physical examination findings include marfanoid habitus (decreased upper to lower body ratio), mucosal neuromas (red papules) over lips and tongues, and joint hyperlaxity associated with MEN2B. The patients typically lack lens dislocation or aortic abnormalities, unlike Marfan syndrome. MEN2A also is suspected in patients with clinical features like purity, scaly, pigmented papules in the interscapular region as these are features of CLA that have an association with MEN2A.
