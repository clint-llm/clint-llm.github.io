The aorta is the first and largest artery in the body. It is responsible for transporting nutrient-rich blood to the systemic circulation following ejection from the left ventricle of the heart. The aorta extends from the aortic valve of the left ventricle to the proximal iliac bifurcation at the L4 vertebral level. The vessel can be divided into various segments depending on course and location. The thoracic aorta consists of the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta. The descending thoracic aorta passes through the diaphragmâ€™s aortic hiatus at the T12 vertebral level at which point it continues as the abdominal aorta. The abdominal aorta terminates as it bifurcates into common iliac arteries, which subsequently provide arterial supply to the pelvis and lower limbs.
