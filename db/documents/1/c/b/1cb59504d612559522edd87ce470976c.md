There is also a growing appreciation that there is cross-talk between the complement system and other systems, especially the coagulation system.

Chronic diseases like atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria(PNH), and age-related macular degeneration(AMD) also have complement cascade over activity behind their pathology. Autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) also have a complement cascade role, although there is a deficiency in clearing the immune complexes, which are supposed to be done by the early complement components of the cascade. This deficiency in clearing the apoptotic cells and debris in the central nervous system leads to the generation of an inflammatory microenvironment that has a role in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer disease.
