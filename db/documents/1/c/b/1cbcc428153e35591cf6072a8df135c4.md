Patients with nPHPT who are surgical candidates are often treated with newer minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques with fewer complications.

MIS has several benefits for patients, such asÂ less dissection, minimal blood loss, less hematoma formation, more use of local anesthesia and regional sedation, reduced operating time, and shorter hospital stays, with fewer nerve injuries and resultant voice problems. Localization procedures preoperatively, if successful, will lead to greater success in MIS. When diseased glands are not identified by MIS, it may be necessary to convert to a bilateral neck exploration. This is true when glands are small and in multi-gland disease, a situation not uncommonly seen in nPHPT.

Operative failure in nPHPT is defined as the persistence of an elevated PTH up to 6 months after surgery. When PTH levels return to normal initially but increase after six months, it is termed a recurrence. If a reoperation is considered, extensive patient counseling with a multi-disciplinary team should be involved; proper communication among the team members is crucial.
