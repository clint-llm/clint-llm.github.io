**Congenital**

Congenital causes of upper airway obstruction include craniofacial syndromes that cause midfacial hypoplasia, such as Apert and Crouzon syndromes.

**Acquired**

**Pediatric Acute**

Acquired acute pediatric causes of upper airway obstruction commonly include infectious causes such as neck abscesses or croup. An inhaled foreign body is an uncommon but important cause of acute upper airway obstruction. Less common, but worth mentioning, are burns or caustic injury to the upper airway.

**Pediatric Chronic**

The most common cause of chronic upper airway obstruction in children is adenotonsillar hypertrophy. In terms of laryngeal pathology, bilateral vocal cord palsy, subglottic hemangioma or stenosis, or recurrent respiratory papillomatosis should be considered. Acquired subglottic stenosis is possible if the child has had previous intubation, or most commonly following prolonged or repeated intubations.

**Adult Acute**

In the acute setting of upper airway obstruction in adults, infectious causes are many. Ludwig’s angina, i.e., the floor of mouth bacterial infection secondary to dental infection, can cause trismus and severe edema of the tongue, which is an airway emergency. Peri-tonsillar abscess and parapharyngeal abscesses are important differentials for trismus and sore throat. Supraglottitits can also occur in adults. Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis can cause acute on chronic upper airway in adults. Laryngeal cancer can present acutely with stridor and respiratory distress. Advanced untreated cancer of the oral cavity, oropharynx, or hypopharynx also poses a risk of upper airway obstruction.

**Adult Chronic**

The most common cause of chronic upper airway obstruction in adults is OSA. Less common but potential causes of laryngeal pathology and subsequent airway compromise are tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and Behcet disease.
