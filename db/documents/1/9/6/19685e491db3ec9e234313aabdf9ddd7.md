Three forms of PCA have been described:

- A **biparietal form**affects the dorsal ‘where’ visual pathway and causes visuospatial deficits such as Bálint syndrome, apraxia, and neglect.

- An **occipitotemporal form**affects the ventral ‘what’ visual pathway and causes visual agnosia, prosopagnosia, alexia.

- The **occipital form**presents with visual field defects such as homonymous hemianopia or quadrantanopia.
