Interprofessional collaboration, including clinicians, mid-level practitioners, nurses, and therapists, is imperative to the effectiveness of vestibular rehabilitation due to the complexity in nature and requirements for diagnosis and treatment, as well as the varying levels of treatment and required providers needed to accomplish these techniques (exercises, medication administration, surgical intervention, etc.).

Collaboration is also necessary to reduce costly procedures that neither aid in diagnostic measures nor benefit rehabilitation outcomes for the patient. Excessive diagnostic testing for vestibular patients has been demonstrated despite a thorough history combined with diagnostic maneuvers to be more effective in diagnoses (especially with BPPV). Medications are frequently chosen as the first course of treatment despite repositioning techniques and exercises being the most effective treatment for peripheral vestibular hypofunction and BPPV.

It is crucial not only for the care of the patient but also for a reduction in costly and unnecessary testing that practitioners can identify possible vestibular pathologies and either complete diagnostic testing or refer to medical professionals (vestibular specialists, physical therapists, occupational therapists) who can treat the patient and address their functional deficits. The future of vestibular rehabilitation also rests on collaboration, with promising research on theÂ effectiveness of web-based programs to supplement face-to-face provider treatment while still meeting the patient's needs.
