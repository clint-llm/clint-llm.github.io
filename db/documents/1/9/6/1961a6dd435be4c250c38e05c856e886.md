Although the anatomical snuffbox does not have its own blood supply, several vessels course through the boundaries of this surface anatomy feature. Both the cephalic vein and radial artery lie within the anatomical snuffbox. However, the radial artery branches are the most discussed in the practice of medicine due to their supply of the scaphoid bone. Direct branches from the radial artery supply 80% of the proximal scaphoid through intraosseous retrograde flow through the articular foramina, while the remainder is supplied via the volar scaphoid branches of the radial artery that enter at the distal pole. Avascular necrosis of the scaphoid bone commonly occurs due to the unique flow found in the anatomical snuffbox to the scaphoid bone.
