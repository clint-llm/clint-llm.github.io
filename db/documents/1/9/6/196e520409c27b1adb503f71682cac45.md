The ectodermal placodes, from which future sense organs and cranial ganglia will form, develop different molecular responses; in anterior areas, coding molecules will express as Pax (paired box protein), Six3 (homeobox protein SIX3), and Otx2 (homeobox protein OTX2). In the posterior portion of the placodes, we will find other molecules such as Irx1 / 2/3 (Iroquois-class homeodomain protein IRX-1) and Gbx2 (homeobox protein GBX-2). These proteins will help develop specific genes for specific functions.

For example, Pax6 will be more concentrated in the developmental areas of the sense of smell and the lens, while Pax3 and Pax2/8 will help to develop the trigeminal ganglia and the hearing area.
