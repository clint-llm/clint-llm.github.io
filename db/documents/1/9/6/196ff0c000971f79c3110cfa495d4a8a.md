Gradual restriction of passive shoulder motion characterizes a natural course of AC. The development is commonly described as progressing through 3 overlapping phases (4 stages classification can also be found in the literature). However, from a practical point of view, we recommended using  2-stage scheme: early and developed frozen shoulder.

- Freezing (2 to 9 months): Early

- Frozen (4 to 12 months): Developed

- Thawing (12 to 42 months): Developed

**Freezing**

An initial, painful phase with predominant pain that is worse at night, with gradually increased glenohumeral joint ROM restriction.

**Frozen**

The second phase with stiffness and persisted glenohumeral joint motion limitation, but with less pain than that at the “Freezing” stage.

**Thawing**

The third (recovery) phase with the gradual return of range of motion.
