Galantamine is a tertiary alkaloid in nature. It was characterized in the early 1950s and extracted from plant sources, such as Galanthus nivalis. Initially, galantamine was studied in neuropathic and paralytic conditions, including post-polio paralytic conditions, myopathies, and reversal of neuromuscular blockade. Nevertheless, the discovery of its acetylcholine esterase inhibiting property has changed the landscape of healthcare. It was studied to treat a variety of psychiatric conditions. However, redevelopment of galantamine for the treatment of Alzheimer disease did not start until the early 1990s due to difficulties in extraction and synthesis. Galantamine was approved by FDA in 2001 for the treatment of mild to moderately severe Alzheimer disease (AD).

Other non-FDA-approved off-label uses of galantamine appear below.****

- Vascular dementia.

- Alzheimer's dementia with the cerebrovascular component, also known as mixed dementia.

- Along with memantine, galantamine is used to treat Alzheimer disease

- Dementia associated with Parkinson disease

- To treat cognitive impairment in Lewy body disease

- Frontotemporal dementia

- Dementia associated with Multiple Sclerosis

- Galantamine alone or along with memantine is effective in the treatment of cognitive impairment due to traumatic brain injury

- It is effective in treating post-traumatic nerve palsy, oculomotor and trochlear nerves

- Galantamine alone or in combination with memantine is useful for the treatment of cognitive impairment associated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)

- Along with antipsychotic and memantine, galantamine has the potential to treat the positive, cognitive, and negative symptoms of schizophrenia

- As an augmentative therapy to risperidone, it alleviates some of the symptoms in children with autism

- Treatment of adult autism with galantamine enhances expressive language and communication

- It is effective in the management of acute scopolamine toxicity

- Galantamine treatment is beneficial in chronic post-stroke aphasia

- It is a substitution therapy for reducing smoking addiction in alcohol-dependent patients

- It improves the cognitive dysfunction associated with bipolar disorder

- To maintain the good quality of sleep in patients suffering from mild to moderate Alzheimer disease with or without vascular dementia

- Galantamine is an effective antidote against organophosphorus poisoning

- It is used to manage dementia associated with Down syndrome

In studies, galantamine's cholinergic control of inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, and cognitive impairment in obesity-associated disorders such as metabolic syndrome has provided a rationale for further therapeutic developments.

Galantamine has recently been used as an oneirogen and is a lucid dream inducer. Galantamine increases the duration of REM sleep (also called dream sleep), increases lucid dreaming, and the recall of dreams on awakening.****The dose of galantamine for lucid dreaming is on the low side, 4 to 12 mg during sleep.
