Warfarin, and superwarfarins, are vitamin K antagonists that primarily act through inhibition of 2,3 vitamin K epoxide reductase and cause a deficiency of active vitamin K.  The active vitamin K deficiency leaves coagulation factors II, VII, IX, X, and proteins C and S inactive.

Following oral ingestion, warfarin is quickly absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract (maximal concentration ~ 90 minutes status post ingestion).  Despite the quick absorption, an INR response is not noted until factor VII is at approximately 30% of its baseline.  In naïve patients, the PT/INR would not be expected to have a rise for 12 hours post ingestion and may continue to rise for several more hours due to ongoing absorption.  While chronic overdose resulting in toxicity presents with an  elevated PT/INR, that level is expected to remain at or near its maximum value on presentation
