The Gordon reflex is elicited by squeezing the calf muscle. The calf is mainly made up of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, which come together to form the Achilles tendon. Both muscles aid in the plantarflexing of the foot at the ankle. The typical plantar response reflex involves all muscles that shorten the leg, including the gastrocnemius and soleus.
