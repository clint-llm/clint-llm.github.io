Drug testing canÂ be used to further assess a patient presenting for evaluation or be used in the workplace for employment eligibility.

A positive result on a drug test tells the clinician that the patient had a detectable amount of a substance present during a certain window of time. This result does not typically indicate that impairment is the result of any particular substance or that the patient has a substance use disorder. When considering a positive result, confirmatory testing may be helpful in verifying results in certain situations. As discussed previously, false positives can occur due to cross-reactivity between other substances not being tested for and the immunoassay being used.

A major consideration when using drug testing is regarding the significance of a negative result. Clinicians should bear in mind that a negative result simply means that the particular substance being tested for was not detected.

It is essential that clinicians understand the testing methodology of various drug testing modalities as well as their associated sensitivity, specificity, and significance of false-negative and false-positive results.
