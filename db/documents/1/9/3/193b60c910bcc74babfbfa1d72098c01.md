Differential diagnosis includes an aneurysmal bone cyst, fibrous dysplasia, enchondroma, or benign chondroblastoma. A giant cell tumor or chondromyxoid fibroma may be additional considerations.

Aneurysmal bone cysts occur near the metadiaphysis and are usually more eccentric in location than centrally located. Additionally, aneurysmal bone cysts will show a significant expansion of the cortex, unlike the mild concentric expansion was seen in UBCs.

Fibrous dysplasia occurs within the same age distribution and is also centrally located. They can occur within the metadiaphysis or diaphysis. The radiographic appearance of this lesion is usually more “ground-glass” density versus lucent as seen with the unicameral bone cysts.

An enchondroma has less sclerotic margins than the unicameral bone cyst and often contains a chondroid matrix. The most common location is the metaphysis of the proximal humerus, which is often seen with unicameral bone cysts.
