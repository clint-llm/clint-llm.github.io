Treatment modalities are variable and depend on the extent of hemorrhage and degree of hormonal insufficiency. Conservative management with serial imaging and close monitoring is now being referred to as a more traditional interventional approach**.**

Assessment for hemodynamic instability and adrenal insufficiency should guide treatment. Individuals who have massive retroperitoneal bleeding unresponsive to transfusions and conservative management are candidates for intervention**.**Angiography and embolization of the bleeding lesion may provide better outcomes compared with traditional surgical laparotomy.

Adrenal insufficiency due to bilateral extensive hemorrhage should be managed with corticosteroids. As such, it may be useful to recognize computed tomography (CT) features of adrenal congestion as a sign for potential adrenal dysfunction and subsequent adrenal hemorrhage, so early steroid replacement therapy can be commenced to prevent death from adrenal insufficiency.

Adrenal hemorrhage may be the initial presentation of underlying adrenal mass lesions, with pheochromocytoma being the most common.Â Initial stabilizing therapy with antihypertensive treatment and alpha-blockers with definitive management once etiology is ascertained is advisable in these cases.
