Genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of alopecia totalis. Twin and familial studies support a genetic predisposition to the disease. Studies of identical twins report a concordance rate of 55%. A positive family history of AA is found in about 20% of patients with AT.

Genetic predisposition has been supported by genome-wide associated studies identifying certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes associated with the development of AA. HLA-DRB1 polymorphisms have increased susceptibility for AA, specificallyÂ HLA-DRB1*04 and HLA-DRB1*16.

In addition to genetic influence, environmental factors such as illness, infection, drugs, and stress may contribute to flares or relapse of disease.
