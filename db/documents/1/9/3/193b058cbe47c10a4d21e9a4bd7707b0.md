Although not entirely understood and having multiple theories of etiology, dysbaric osteonecrosis is commonly thought to result as a long-term manifestation of sub-clinical decompression sickness (DCS). During decompression, gas dissolved in the arterial blood comes out of solution and can form arterial gas emboli. Gas bubble formation can lead to endothelial disruption and subsequent vascular occlusion via coagulation of intraosseous microcirculation. This leads to venous thrombosis causing retrograde arterial flow and increasing the overall intraosseous pressure. When specifically examining a high-risk region such as the proximal femur, subsequent avascular necrosis of the femoral head can lead to chondral microfracture and eventual collapse.
