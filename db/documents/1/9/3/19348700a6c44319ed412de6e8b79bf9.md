A thorough medical history of the present illness, past ocular history, medical history, and family history should be elicited. A family photograph would help know if the leukocoria was present from birth or later in childhood. Persistent fetal vasculature is most often present at birth. A history of prematurity would lead us to investigate in line with retinopathy of prematurity, which presents as leukocoria due to retinal detachment and retrolental fibroplasia. Birth trauma can lead to hyphema or vitreous hemorrhage, which presents as an altered pupillary reflex. Family history is essential in retinoblastoma, FEVR, and coloboma.

The color of the pupillary reflex also gives a hint of the diagnosis. Retinoblastoma presents as a whitish pupillary reflex, while congenital cataracts show a blue-grey reflex. Coats disease and retinal detachment show a yellowish reflex. In 20% of cases, retinoblastoma presents as strabismus. Retinal detachments, vitreous hemorrhage, Coats disease, and retinoblastoma (60%) usually present as unilateral disease, while FEVR, endogenous endophthalmitis, astrocytic hamartomas, and 40% of retinoblastomas are bilateral.
