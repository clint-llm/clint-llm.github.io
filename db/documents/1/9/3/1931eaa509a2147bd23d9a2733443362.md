**Measurement of CK-MB, Interfering Factors, and Negating Techniques**

CK-MB was initially separated using gel electrophoresis, and densitometry was used to quantify the activity of CK-MB isoenzyme in blood.

CK-MB elevation was used as one of the criteria for diagnosing acute MI; as its use increased in frequency in the late 1980s and 1990s, it became evident that despite its high sensitivity in detecting acute MI, the specificity of CK-MB activity was low. Better methods to measure CK-MB have been developed to improve the specificity of CK-MB. CK-MB mass measurements using Immunoenzymometryic assays containing monoclonal antibodies binding to M and B subunits individually were proven to be highly specific and more sensitive than CK-MB activity measurement.
