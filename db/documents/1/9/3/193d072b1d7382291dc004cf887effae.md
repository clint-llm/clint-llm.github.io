USPSTF recommends screening for depression in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years (Grade B recommendation). Based on the available evidence, there is a moderate net benefit. Accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and appropriate follow-up are emphasized. The evidence for screening depression in children aged 11 years or less is insufficient (Grade I recommendation).Â Healthcare practitioners should do appropriate screening and early interventions for better outcomes.
