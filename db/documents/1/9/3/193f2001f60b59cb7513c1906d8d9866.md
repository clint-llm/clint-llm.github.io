# Continuing Education Activity

Crouzon syndrome is a genetically inherited syndrome characterized by craniosynostosis (premature fusion of coronal sutures) resulting in the skull and facial deformities. The syndrome was first described in 1912 by French physician Octave Crouzon when he identified both a mother and daughter with what was originally called "craniofacial dysostosis." He described a triad of skull deformities, facial anomalies, and proptosis. This triad of findings was then re-labeled "Crouzon syndrome." The syndrome’s genetic and molecular basis has since been identified and will be discussed. The syndrome is one of many craniosynostosis syndromes and is considered to be the mildest form of them. This activity reviews the workup of Crouzon syndrome and describes the role of health professionals working together to manage this condition.

# Introduction

Crouzon syndrome is a genetically inherited syndrome characterized by craniosynostosis (premature fusion of coronal sutures) resulting in the skull and facial deformities. The syndrome was first described in 1912 by French physician Octave Crouzon when he identified both a mother and daughter with what was originally called “craniofacial dysostosis.” He described a triad of skull deformities, facial anomalies, and proptosis. This triad of findings was then re-labeled “Crouzon syndrome.” The syndrome’s genetic and molecular basis has since been identified and will be discussed in more detail below. The syndrome is one of many craniosynostosis syndromes and is considered to be the mildest form of them.

# Etiology

Crouzon syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and is caused by a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-2 and -3 on chromosome 10.de novo mutations.

# Epidemiology

Crouzon syndrome is a fairly rare entity and is estimated to occur in 1 in 60,000 newborns; however, it is the second most common craniosynostosis syndrome behind only the more recently described Muenke syndrome.

# Pathophysiology

FGFR-2 and FGFR-3 are two of the four transmembrane protein receptors responsible for osteoblast differentiation during embryological development. Missense mutations in these two receptors result in gain-of-function signaling and subsequent acceleration in the differentiation of osteoblasts..

# History and Physical

Due to the autosomal inheritance pattern, family history is an important component of the history and physical. The clinical course of worsening of facial deformities over the first 1 to 2 years of life helps make the clinical diagnosis. Additional testing is usually not needed to make the diagnosis. As a genetic disease, the rest of the history of the newborn infant is unlikely to contribute much more to identifying the underlying diagnosis.

Crouzon syndrome is usually suspected at birth due to specific facial and cranial deformities and positive family history. There are several characteristic features of patients with Crouzon syndrome that can be seen on physical examination. The most commonly seen include brachycephaly, wide-set (hypertelorism), bulging eyes (proptosis), a flattened forehead, a beaked nose, and an underdeveloped upper jaw (maxillary/midface hypoplasia) that defines the Crouzonoid face. These patients can also suffer from a cleft lip and/or palate, hearing loss, and dental problems. The incidence of strabismus (misaligned eyes) is very high. An important detail to note is the normal hands and feet found in a Crouzon patient in contrast to those with Apert syndrome, a similar but more severe craniosynostosis syndrome, where there is pronounced syndactyly of the extremities. Pfeiffer syndrome, another craniosynostosis, is also epitomized by short, broad big toes and thumbs in contrast to the previously mentioned normal digits of those with Crouzon syndrome.

# Evaluation

The evaluation for Crouzon syndrome is relatively straightforward in the setting of known family history as the characteristic physical examination findings confirm the diagnosis. However, in cases where there is a spontaneous mutation, and the clinical presentation is not clear initially, these patients may require genetic testing for diagnosis. Additional tests in these situations may include imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomographic (CT) imaging of the brain to detect craniosynostosis or other skeletal abnormalities. The most common imaging findings on X-ray-based techniques are perisutural sclerosis, reduced serration, and bony bridging and/or the absence of the suture altogether.

If the history, physical, and imaging are still not conclusive, molecular testing can be pursued. Unfortunately, multiple craniosynostosis syndromes have a defect in one of the FGFRs; therefore, there is some overlap even in their molecular pathophysiology.

While not all required, the combination of detailed family history, specific physical examination findings, the use of various imaging modalities, and genetic testing help differentiate the spectrum of craniosynostosis syndromes (Pfeiffer, Apert, Saethre-Chotzen, Carpenter, and Jackson-Weiss syndromes) in which signs and symptoms can have significant overlap.

# Treatment / Management

The management of any patient with craniosynostosis is complex and requires a team of subspecialists including pediatricians, oral maxillofacial surgeons, plastic surgeons, neurosurgeons, otorhinolaryngology (ENT) specialists, and ophthalmologists (pediatric and oculoplastics).  Other specialists may be required depending on the specific issues at hand. Surgical management is the treatment modality of choice to correct the maldevelopment of the midface and orbits to prevent blindness and intellectual disability related to the restriction of the brain and orbital development. A detailed review of surgical techniques including the timing of repair can be seen in a recent review of the topic.

It requires long-term followup to monitor ocular development due to the propensity to develop strabismic amblyopia and the need for strabismus surgery. These examinations should also monitor for optic nerve edema that would raise concerns for elevated intracranial pressure. Due to airway changes, sleep apnea is also of concern. The previously mentioned team-based approach helps monitor for these vision and life-threatening complications.

There is some ongoing work investigating the role of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in mutated FGFR-related craniosynostosis conditions.

# Differential Diagnosis

- Apert syndrome

- Muenke syndrome

- Pfeiffer syndrome

- Nonsyndromic craniosynostosis

# Prognosis

The prognosis of patients with Crouzon syndrome depends on early diagnosis and treatment. If treated promptly, the patients may have a near-normal lifespan.

# Complications

- Raised intracranial pressure

- Mental subnormality

- Problems with vision

- Exposure keratitis

- Aspiration pneumonia

- Breathing problems and stridor

# Consultations

- Pediatricians

- Ophthalmologists (pediatric and oculoplastics)

- Maxillofacial surgeons

- Neurosurgeons

- Plastic surgeons

- Otorhinolaryngology specialists

# Deterrence and Patient Education

The parents of the patient should be counseled about the child's condition and the expected prognosis. They should understand that they could not have done anything before or during pregnancy to prevent the birth of a baby with this condition. Genetic evaluation should be offered to the parents.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

The management of craniosynostosis is complex and difficult and requires a team of subspecialists including pediatricians, oral maxillofacial surgeons, plastic surgeons, neurosurgeons, otorhinolaryngology (ENT) specialists, and ophthalmologists (pediatric and oculoplastics). The nurses involved need to be specially trained to assist in recognizing complications and educating the families. an interprofessional team approach will provide the best patient outcomes. [Level V]
