Patients often present with an insidious onset of pain initially starting after activity.  The pain progressively lasts longer and longer after a bout of exercise. If the athlete continues training, the pain will be present upon awakening the morning following a training activity. Additional information should be elicited while taking a history from the patient. Factors like investigating recent increases or changes in training, nutrition, assessing intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors, past medical history, and medications.

Physical exam findings are limited. Patients typically have focal tenderness to palpation and occasional edema at the site of the suspected stress fracture.  Clinical diagnostic tests are limited.  The use of a tuning fork or low pulsed ultrasound to reproduce the pain has been described but is generally of moderate sensitivity and specificity.

Spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis are unique stress fractures and require a high index of suspicion. Spondylosis can be asymptomatic and may be found incidentally on lumbar films. If an athlete reports lower back pain and spondylolysis is suspected, going into lumbar extension will increase the pain.

The key to diagnosing a stress fracture is the history of rapidly increasing activity, gradually increasing pain with activity, and a high clinical suspicion.
