Colesevelam is a bile acid sequestrant that is an FDA-approved drug to be used in adjunct with diet and exercise for a variety of indications. The main indication is to lower an elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients with primary hyperlipidemia and other diseases that cause hyperlipidemia. It can be used as a monotherapy or with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin), ezetimibe, or niacin, or a three- or four-drug combination. Another approved use is to reduce LDL-C levels in boys and postmenarchal girls ages 10-17 who have heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. For this situation, colesevelam can be used as a monotherapy or with a statin only after a proper trial of diet and exercise has failed. Finally, the last FDA-approved indication is to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetic adults.

While not an FDA-approved use, colesevelam has been shown to improve stool consistency in patients with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea, causing an overall improvement in bowel function.
