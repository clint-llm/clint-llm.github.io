The most common complaint will be a painful mouth lesion that will not heal. The patient may report an oral ulcer that persists despite treatment, odynophagia, pain-related trismus, occlusal changes, a foreign body sensation in the mouth, or the expectoration of bone chips. Occasionally halitosis or other odor-related complaints will be the presenting symptom. It is important to obtain a detailed oncologic history, including the site and stage of the primary tumor, dates of initiation and termination of radiation and/or chemotherapy, and any prior surgery. Dental history must be carefully obtained, including pre-radiation dental therapy, as well as any post-radiation dental cleanings or other procedures (implants, dentures, obturators, etc.). Oral cavity examination may reveal an obvious lesion or may reveal only granulation tissue. Flexible laryngoscopy is indicated to assess the larynx and posterior rami of the mandible and their mucosal covering, particularly in the setting of odynophagia. If the patient has teeth, a dental examination is warranted, as any loose teeth may be a harbinger of underlying ORN, as may periodontal disease. Any suspicious lesions or areas of granulation tissue must be biopsied to rule out the persistence/recurrence of cancer before any ORN treatment is begun.Â  A thorough neck exam is warranted to look for tumor masses or lymphadenopathy that may indicate recurrent disease.
