Beta-thalassemia is a hereditary disorder that is caused by more than 200 beta-globin gene point mutations resulting in decreased or absent globin chains (beta+ and beta0) via transcriptional, translational, and splicing of either the hemoglobin subunit beta (HBB) itself or its product. It can also be caused by HBB gene deletion from chromosome 11. The majority of the mutations result in frameshift due to deletion, single nucleotide substitution, and insertion patterns. Furthermore, the disease severity depends on the inheritance of two copies of both alleles present on each chromosome 11. The beta-globin chain production is genotypically allocated by beta+ and beta 0 for decreased production and absent production, respectively. While phenotypic variability is represented by minor or trait, intermedia, and major, it depends on the beta-globin gene production (i.e., beta+ and beta 0) and homozygous or heterozygous status.
