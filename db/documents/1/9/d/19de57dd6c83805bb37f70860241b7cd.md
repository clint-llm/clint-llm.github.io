Potential causes of malocclusion may be considered in the differential diagnosis. Malocclusion can be inherited or caused by the genes one inherits from their parents. Additionally, certain habits, such as thumb sucking or prolonged pacifier use, can cause malocclusion. Skeletal abnormalities, such as abnormalities in the shape or size of the jaw or face, can cause malocclusion. Lastly, missing teeth, inadequate space, and trauma can cause malocclusion.

To determine the cause of malocclusion, a thorough evaluation by an orthodontist is typically necessary. This may include taking a medical history, performing a physical examination, and ordering imaging tests such as panoramic radiographs. Based on the results of this evaluation, a diagnosis and treatment plan can be developed.
