The chemoreceptor trigger zone in the medulla oblongata plays an important role in the initiation of vomiting. Several neurotransmitters play a role in this response to noxious stimuli including acetylcholine, dopamine, and substance P, explaining the different potential prevention and treatment modalities available for PONV. While incompletely elucidated, stimulation in other neurons and from other areas of the body (GI tract, inner ear) may lead the chemoreceptor trigger zone to trigger vomiting. Additionally, opiates may act directly on this part of the brain to stimulate PONV.
