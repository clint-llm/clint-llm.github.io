A normal Pap test result begins with a statement of adequacy, followed by “negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy” (NILM).

Negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy findings include:

- Non-neoplastic cellular changes

- Reactive cellular changes

- Microorganisms including the following: Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida species, bacterial vaginosis, actinomyces and cellular changes due to Herpes simplex virus and Cytomegalovirus

Concerning findings include epithelial cell abnormalities and endometrial cells in women aged 45 years old or older. Endometrial cells found during cervical cancer screening may raise concern for endometrial hyperplasia, and further workup may be indicated.

Epithelial cell abnormalities are divided into two categories including squamous cell and glandular cell abnormalities.

Squamous cell findings include:

- Atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) or cannot rule out high grade (ASC-H)

- Low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN1). These are mild, subtle cell changes, and most go away without treatment

- High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) or CIN 2 or 3. Moderate and severe cell changes which require further testing or treatment

- Squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix

Glandular cell findings include:

- Atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance (AGUS),

- Atypical glandular cells

- Not otherwise specified (NOS)
- Favor neoplasia

- Endocervical adenocarcinoma in situ or adenocarcinoma

Epithelial cell abnormalities will need further workup and treatment based on the patient’s age and medical history.
