The etiology of Riedel thyroiditis is not definitively known. Various theories have suggested that it could be a variant of autoimmune thyroiditis or part of a systemic fibrosing disorder, or an immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) related disease. The presence of anti-thyroid antibodies, eosinophilic infiltrate, and response to glucocorticoid therapy are suggestive of autoimmune pathology.
