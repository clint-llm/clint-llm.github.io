Long-term follow-up is necessary given the possibility of progression to stricture disease or carcinoma. Pradhan et al. published a ten-year retrospective study of patients with balanitis xerotica obliterans. They noted 62.6% had foreskin scarring and 47.2% of patients had foreskin and meatus involvement, and 26.4% had a foreskin, glans, and meatus involvement. Of their patient population, the majority required circumcision before age sixteen, and an additional 19.8% of patients needed ad additional procedure following their circumcision and/or meatal dilation.
