Because it not always possible to rule out a malignancy, the primary care provider and nurse practitioner should refer these patients to the orthopedic surgeon for work up.Â There is no consensus on best treatment, but treatment is generally unnecessary in asymptomatic individuals. There is a widely reported range of failure with various treatments with the most common failure being fracture or recurrence.
