An ECG is often considered "uninterpretable" in the presence of LBBB. This is in fact false. There are many things that we can interpret on an ECG despite LBBB.

Clinicians can determine rate and rhythm. The LBBB only affects the left ventricle making any part of the QRS and ST segment uninterpretable, but the atrial rhythm is still valid.

In the setting of acute myocardial infarction, there are a set of criteria called Sgarbossa criteria which can be applied to the ECG to increase predictive value for or against myocardial infarction. These criteria are not as good as ST-segment elevation in the absence of LBBB. Their sensitivity is only 49%, but specificity is greater than 90%.

- Concordant ST elevation greater than 1 mm in leads with a positive QRS complex (5 points)

- Concordant ST depression greater than 1 mm in V1 to V3 (3 points)

- Discordant ST elevation greater than 5 mm in leads in a negative QRS complex (2 points)

Three or more points means acute myocardial infarction.

Modified Sgarbossa criteria were validated in 2015. The sensitivity of the modified criteria increases to 80% without affecting specificity. The third criteria regarding greater than 5 mm of discordance were chosen rather arbitrarily. The modified criteria change 5 mm to greater than 25% of the downward QRS deflection.

Criteria 3 is modified as follows: Discordant ST elevation greater than 25% of downward QRS deflection in a negative QRS complex (2 points)

**Definition of Terms**

Concordant: Means QRS and T wave go the same direction.

Discordant: Means QRS is opposite direction of T wave.

Positive QRS Complex: Net voltage of QRS goes upward from baseline.

Negative QRS Complex: Net voltage of QRS goes downward from baseline.
