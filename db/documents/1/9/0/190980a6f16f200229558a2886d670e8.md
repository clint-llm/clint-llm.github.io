PAN is a multi-system necrotizing vasculitis that has many aspects to its treatment and management which is best accomplished with an interprofessional team approach. Apart from the close involvement of rheumatologists and primary clinicians, consultation with a nephrologist in renal failure and infectious disease clinicians in cases associated with hepatitis B and C is required for many patients. So would be the case involving pharmacists for effective medication management and education. The pharmacist should educate the patient about medication compliance and their adverse effects. Strong communication among the interprofessional team is essential for better outcomes in these patients.
