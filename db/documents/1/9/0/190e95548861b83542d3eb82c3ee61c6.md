Acute porphyrias are genetic conditions; however, environmental, e.g., drugs and physiological factors, are crucial for clinical manifestation. Porphyria is a genetic disorder. Phenotypic manifestation of the genetic defect is variable and is more common in familial cases.

More than 100 mutations have been identified. Clinical manifestation is associated with a 50% or more reduction in enzyme function. Porphobilinogen deaminase has three patterns of mutation:

- Type 1: Single-base error causing an amino acid substitution

- Type 2: Confined to the tissue isoform of the enzyme

- Type 3: Deletion in exons

Hereditary coproporphyria is caused by significant heterogeneity and abnormal functioning of coproporphyrinogen oxidase. This is what makes routine genetic screening near to impossible. In heterozygous and homozygous individuals, the reduction in the enzyme is 50% and 90-98%, respectively.

A 50% reduction in protoporphyrinogen oxidase is present in all the samples tested. Mental retardation is prevalent in the neonatal form of variegate porphyria.
