Neutropenic colitis is a life-threatening condition usually seen in patients who are severely myelosuppressed. Although the exact pathogenesis is not completely understood, sever neutropenia conjugated with intestinal mucosal injury and the weakened immune system appear to be the denominator for neutropenic enterocolitis. An increased incidence of neutropenic colitis cases came as a consequence of the extensive use of chemotherapeutic agents. As these agents form part of the treatment, they also cause direct gastrointestinal mucositis. This activity covers the role of the interprofessional team in the diagnosis and management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology neutropenic enterocolitis.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of neutropenic enterocolitis.
- OUtline the management options available for neutropenic enterocolitis.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving the diagnosis and delivery of care for patients affected by neutropenic enterocolitis and improve outcomes.
