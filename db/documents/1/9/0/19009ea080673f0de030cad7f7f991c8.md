Foreign-educated physicians (FEP) are enrolling in nursing programs at an increasing rate. Nurse educators address concerns on how to construct lesson plans that will capture the unique experiences of the FEP nursing student and inspire his/her interest to make contributions for the future of the nursing profession. The situation arises because of the growing number of FEP entering the United States. Nursing is a preferred and viable alternative to medicine, offering accelerated programs to become a nurse practitioner.

Foreign physicians tackle a highly competitive process to pursue a medical career in the US. The Health Professions Education Assistance Act (HPEA) of 1976 has reduced medical residency programs. Nursing becomes a preferred and viable career choice regardless of social factors such as age, finance, language, and other obstacles.

Despite these challenges, the FEP may possess specific strengths that show a readiness to excel in collaboration and teamwork for quality improvement in the clinical setting of the nursing practice. The nurse educator must be insightful and innovative in framing learning experiences for the uniqueness of the FEP nursing student.
