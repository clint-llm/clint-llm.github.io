A slit lamp is an optical instrument with a high-intensity illumination source that can project as a slit.

These devices can be used to perform gonioscopy, pachymetry, applanation tonometry, ophthalmodynamometry, anterior segment imaging, slit lamp videography, laser interferometry, Nd YAG laser capsulotomy, YAG peripheral iridotomy, panretinal photocoagulation, laser interferometry, and potential acuity meter test.

Slit lamps are available in emergency departments, ophthalmic casualty departments, general ophthalmic wards, ophthalmic theatres, and the specialist chamber.

The various parts of the slit lamp are the observation system, illumination system, and mechanical support system. A perfect slit lamp examination requires the correct technique of examination, which involves patient adjustment, instrument adjustment, and proper illumination techniques.

The various methods of illumination are diffuse illumination, direct focal illumination, indirect illumination, retro illumination,Â  specular reflection, sclerotic scatter, and oscillating illumination of Koeppe. The current activity gives insight into parts of a slit lamp, examination technique, illumination techniques, indication, and use of accessory devices from slit lamps.
