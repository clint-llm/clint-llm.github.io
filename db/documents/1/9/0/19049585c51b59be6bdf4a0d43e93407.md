VisceraÂ of the upper abdomen, pelvis, retroperitoneum, and body wall all connect via many peritoneal ligaments, including the hepatoduodenal ligament. As a result of this proximity, the hepatoduodenal ligament is an important pathway of inflammatory and neoplastic disease between the stomach, retroperitoneum, and the porta hepatis through mechanisms such as direct invasion and lymphatic extension. Lymph nodes that surround this ligament can facilitate the spread of disease.
