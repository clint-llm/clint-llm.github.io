The clinician should utilize a standard approach to any suspected poisoned patient. As with any potentially critically ill patient, evaluation of the patient’s airway, respiratory, and circulatory status should immediately be performed. Vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation, should be obtained. The patient should be fully exposed to assess for topical sources of toxicity, such as a hyoscine patch. The patient should also be placed on continuous cardiac monitoring and have intravenous (IV) access established.

Diagnostics, including urinalysis, urine drug screen, finger-stick glucose, salicylate and acetaminophen levels, electrocardiogram, and pregnancy test for females, should be obtained. If seizures or significant hyperthermia are present, the clinician should obtain further laboratory evaluation, including a metabolic panel, liver enzymes, and creatine kinase. However, it is important to understand that anticholinergic toxicity is a clinical diagnosis. Anticholinergic toxicity can be confused with sympathomimetic toxicity. However, the absence of sweating indicates anticholinergic toxicity.
