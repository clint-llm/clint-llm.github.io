The thoracodorsal nerve runs with the thoracodorsal artery and vein to supply the latissimus dorsi muscle. The nerve is close to the lymphatic vessels of the axilla, which are relevant during axillary lymph node dissection procedures. The subscapular lymph nodes are located in the posterior axillary fold, receiving lymph from the posterior thoracic wall and scapular region. Injury to the thoracodorsal nerve during axillary lymph node dissection is less frequent than other complications, including lymphedema and seroma formation.
