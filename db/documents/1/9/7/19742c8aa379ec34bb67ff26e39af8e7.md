New research for ACS is focused on both diagnosis and treatment. Serum phospholipase A2 converts neutral fats to FFA and has been shown to increase hours before the onset of ACS. This may be able toÂ predict an ACS episode. Inhaled nitric oxide has a current ongoing randomized controlled trial regarding its efficacy. Inhaled NO is a pulmonary vasodilator, which should improve V/Q mismatching and decrease pulmonary hypertension. It may also increase the oxygen affinity of HbS, leading to less sickling of erythrocytes.
