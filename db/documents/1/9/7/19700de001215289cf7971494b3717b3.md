Lateral humeral condyle fractures are the second most commonly encountered elbow fractures after supracondylar fractures in the pediatric age group. These fractures are peculiar as they are intra-articular and are prone to displacement owing to the attachment of the forearm extensor muscles on the lateral condyle. Due to this, they can produce various complications, including elbow deformity, if not appropriately managed. This activity reviews the injury mechanism, presentation, evaluation, management, and post-operative care of pediatric lateral humeral condyle fractures. It highlights the common associated injuries, assessment pitfalls, and related complications of both operative and non-operative care to improve care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of lateral humeral condyle fractures in the pediatric population.
- Describe the clinical presentation, including history and physical findings in evaluating pediatric lateral humeral condyle fractures. 
- Outline the various treatment options for lateral humeral condyle fractures.
- Explain the importance of a close collaboration between the interprofessional team (surgical, radiological, nursing, and physiotherapeutic) in order to achieve and maximize functional recovery following pediatric lateral humeral condyle fractures.
