Specific scenarios exist where the benefit of root extraction does not necessarily outweigh the potential risks associated with removal. Additionally, it may be necessary to leave retained roots for some time until just before implant placement. Retaining vital root segments can preserve alveolar bone, which may make the surgical site more favorable for a dental implant. After completing a thorough risk-benefit analysis, the surgeon can decide if surgical removal is warranted or if it may be necessary to leave the retained root fragment. Root fragments may be intentionally undisturbed when there is an increased risk of damage to adjacent teeth or neurovascular structures like the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN).

The increased risk of unintentional displacement of fragments into nearby spaces such as the maxillary sinus, fracture of supporting alveolar bone, or development of an oroantral communication may also preclude removal.

Sometimes, prosthetics replacement drives the decision to keep or remove root segments. Retaining vital root segments could preserve alveolar bone. This approach is referred to as root submergence and may be the approach of choice when considering future prosthodontic options.

Alternatively, root fractures occurring at the time of surgery in the setting of a vital pulp with no marked root mobilization and appropriate wound closure can often be left indefinitely to allow for healing. Lastly, always consider the patient's desires for treatment. Patients may decline treatment despite indications for removal.
