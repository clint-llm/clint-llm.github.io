It is critical that the clinician correctly identifies the cavus foot as a sign of an underlying disease. In many cases, the patient may not be presenting to a foot and ankle specialist but rather may be seen by other members of the health-care team, such as their primary care provider or pediatrician.

Early identification and intervention to prevent progression of the and flexible and correctable cavus foot to the rigid cavus foot requiring arthrodesis and/or more extensive osteotomies isÂ paramount.

Identification of the subtle cavus foot may require greater vigilance as there may be no other signs or symptoms of systemic disease and yet the subtle cavus foot may lead to significant pathology and disability if left untreated.
