With the radial and femoral arteries being the 2 most cannulated sites, we will explore the anatomical site where the 2 can be located and cannulated in detail.

Radial artery: From the brachial artery, the radial artery originates in the cubital fossa and traverses the lateral aspect of the forearm. It supplies the palmar arches that provide adequate blood circulation to the hand. It is palpable at the wrist, proximal to the radial styloid or radial head and slightly lateral. The cannulation site should be at the very distal portion of the arm. The most frequent location for radial artery cannulation is at the proximal flexor crease of the wrist, 1 cm proximal to the styloid process.

Femoral artery: Originating at the inguinal ligament just off of the external iliac artery, lies the femoral artery. It continues posterior to the inguinal ligament, at the median between the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle. The femoral artery is situated medial to the nerve thus lateral to the vein. Due to the increased risk of bleeding as a result of increased diameter of the femoral artery in relation to the radial artery, the initial access site should be 2.5 cm distal to the inguinal ligament. This allows for suitable compression of the vessel if necessary. The femoral pulse should be easily identified with slight pressure placed median the distance between the anterior superior iliac spine and the symphysis pubis.
