Lens abscess is a rarely reported entity in literature. For an astute clinician, it is essential to differentiate traumatic cataracts from lens abscesses as the treatment is poles apart. The prognosis in each case is governed by immune status and posterior segment involvement. If the posterior capsule is breached, there is a high chance of endophthalmitis. Topical antimicrobial therapy and steroids should be used based on the patient's clinical status. Surgical removal of the infective foci is the treatment of choice for lens abscesses.
