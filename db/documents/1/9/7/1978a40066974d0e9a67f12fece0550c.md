Necrotizing periodontal diseases (NPDs) encompass necrotizing gingivitis (NG), necrotizing periodontitis (NP), necrotizing stomatitis (NS), and in extreme cases, NPDs can lead to noma (cancrum oris). These are all considered stages of the same condition due to their shared etiology and clinical presentation. The most typical features of NPDs are pain, gingival necrosis, interdental ulceration, and in more advanced stages, osteonecrosis. This activity outlines the etiology, evaluation, and treatment of necrotizing periodontal diseases, particularly necrotizing gingivitis and necrotizing periodontitis. It highlights the role of the healthcare team in identifying patients at risk for and managing patients currently with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of necrotizing periodontal diseases.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with necrotizing periodontal diseases.
- Summarize the management of a patient with necrotizing periodontal diseases.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients with necrotizing periodontal diseases.
