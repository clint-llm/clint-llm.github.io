The use of nuclear medicine radiotracers in medicine requires close coordination between various professionals, including:

- The medical physicist - who is often involved in calculating hypothetical radiation doses to a patient and the public

- The nuclear pharmacist - who plays a role in radiotracer preparation

- The NM technician - who plays an important role in screening, preparing, and imaging the patient

- The nuclear medicine physician - who supervises all aspects of nuclear medicine care as well as directing therapy and performing image interpretation

- Inpatient nurses and the inpatient team - who sometimes play a role in inpatient admissions, such as in the case of admission during treatments and/or complications thereof

- The referring provider - who often plays a central role in the patient selection and their initial education regarding the role of nuclear medicine in diagnosis and treatment

The involvement of multiple professionals is critical, considering the radiation dose often incurred on the public during the administration of certain radiopharmaceuticals. Close communication between members of the treatment team is critical in relating the amount of radioactivity to be expected, the way to shield workers and the public from radiation exposure, and the way to optimize patient treatment either in the setting of the diagnostic evaluation of disease or in the setting of therapy.
