**Precautions**

**Pediatric Patients:**The use of pentoxifylline in patients below 18 years of age is not advised because its safety profile and efficacy have not been established.

**Geriatric Patients:**The elderly population exhibits higher peak plasma levels of the metabolites of pentoxifylline.

**Pregnancy and Breastfeeding Considerations:**Pentoxifylline crosses the placenta in mice; evidence in humans is lacking. Therefore, it is not recommended for pregnant women unless the benefits outweigh the risks. Pentoxifylline and its metabolites are secreted in milk; hence, nursing women should avoid it. It is classified as FDA risk category C.

**Patients with Renal Impairment:**There is an increased risk of side effects in patients with diminished renal function when CrCl is less than 80mL/min.
