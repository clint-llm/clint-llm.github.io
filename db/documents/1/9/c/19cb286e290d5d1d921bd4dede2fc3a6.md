Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis appears at birth with generalized erythroderma. Skin fragility causes blisters, peeling/exfoliation, erosions, and widespread areas of denuded skin, even with minor trauma. After several months, the erythema and blistering decrease and marked hyperkeratosis develop. Occasionally, skin fragility persists, and patients periodically shed large plates of the superficial epidermis. Hyperkeratosis characteristically resembles “corrugated cardboard” when overlying flexural areas or "cobblestoning" when overlying the extensor surfaces of joints. Occasionally, severe scalp and neck involvement occur, leading to encasement of hair shafts and alopecia. Bacterial colonization of the macerated scales causes a distinctive foul odor resembling rotten eggs. Commonly associated symptoms include xerosis, pruritus, painful fissuring, anhidrosis, and decreased range of motion of joints.

Researchers have identified several different phenotypes of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis. In 1994, DiGiovanna and Bale described two main clinical categories: with palmoplantar keratoderma and without palmoplantar keratoderma.
