Chilaiditi sign is mostly an incidental finding on chest x-ray or abdominal computed tomography. There are reports that between 1.18% to 2.40% of cases were demonstrated with abdominal CT, and between 0.025% and 0.280% were found on the plain chest and abdominal films. These findings can present temporarily or permanently. The following criteria must be med to diagnose Chilaiditi sign based on radiological findings: the right hemidiaphragm must be elevated above the liver by the intestine, the bowel must be distended by air to illustrate pseudo-pneumoperitoneum, and the superior margin of the liver must be depressed below the level of the left hemidiaphragm. The sign can divide into anterior and posterior types depending on the position of the interposed bowel relative to the liver. Usually, the part of the bowel that most commonly interposes is the hepatic flexure, ascending colon, or transverse colon, but there have been reports of small bowel involvement. If free air is visible on abdominal plain films, it is advisable to obtain an abdominal CT to confirm the presence of the free air (which would indicate surgery) versus Chilaiditi syndrome, which would receive conservative treatment.
