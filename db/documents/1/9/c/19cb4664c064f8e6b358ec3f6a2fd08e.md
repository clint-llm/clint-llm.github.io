The PFC is supplied by the internal carotid artery which gives rise to the anterior and middle cerebral arteries. The lateral and anterior aspects of the PFC is mainly supplied via the middle cerebral artery, whereas the superior and medial surfaces are supplied by the anterior cerebral artery. The middle cerebral artery provides the prerolandic and orbitofrontal branches, and the anterior cerebral artery provides the orbital, frontopolar, and callosomarginal branches. Venous drainage of the PFC is via superficial cerebral veins which drain into the superior and inferior sagittal sinuses.

The brain was not thought to have true lymphatics; however, recent evidence shows the presence of lymphatic drainage referred to as the “glymphatic system” or “glial-related lymphatics.” This glymphatic interstitial fluid collects within perivenous spaces. It then follows the meningeal sinuses, large deep veins, and lateral-ventral caudal rhinal veins to drain primarily into cervical lymph nodes.
