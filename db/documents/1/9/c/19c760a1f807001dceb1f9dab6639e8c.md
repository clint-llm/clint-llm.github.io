Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (slipped upper femoral epiphysis) is a common hip pathology in pre-adolescents and adolescents. It occurs when the femoral epiphysis is abnormally displaced posteriorly and inferiorly relative to the femoral head and neck. This often presents as a young adult patient with a complaint of atraumatic hip, thigh, or knee pain, which may be associated with limping or an inability to bear weight. Most cases of SCFE are idiopathic. Often there is no history of trauma or injury before the onset of symptoms. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of slipped capital femoral epiphysis and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for those with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of slipped capital femoral epiphysis. 
- Outline the treatment options for slipped capital femoral epiphysis. 
- Describe the workup of a patient with slipped capital femoral epiphysis. 
- Summarize the importance of effective interprofessional communication among clinicians to ensure optimal delivery of care for those with slipped capital femoral epiphysis.
