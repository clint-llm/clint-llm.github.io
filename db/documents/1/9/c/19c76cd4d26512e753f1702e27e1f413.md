The radial forearm free flap is one of the most commonly utilized reconstructive modalities in the head and neck. The ability to harvest a partial thickness segment of radial bone for an osteocutaneous radial forearm free flap provides a powerful, versatile option in the armamentarium of the reconstructive surgeon. It is an alternative to other osseous free flaps, namely, the fibular, scapular, and the iliac crest free flaps. Understanding the advantages, disadvantages, and complications associated wtih each reconstruction can help the surgeon and patient set realistic expectations and optimize the outcomes of surgery.
