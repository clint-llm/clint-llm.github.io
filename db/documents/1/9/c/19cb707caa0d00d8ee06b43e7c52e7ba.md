The presence of light chain ladders in samples is a complicating phenomenon. Polyclonal light chains, usually kappa, can produce a characteristic banding pattern after electrophoresis and immunofixation electrophoresis. These light chain ladders are not Bence Jones proteins but commonly appear in the urine samples of elderly patients suffering from tubular proteinuria due to inflammatory disease. Moreover, Bence Jones proteins can sometimes co-migrate with the bands in these ladders. These ladders must be carefully examined to ensure no concomitant accompanying Bence Jones proteins. However, the clinical presentation and other investigative findings help confirm the presence of the BJP.
