The cause of most cases of gynecomastia is idiopathic. However, it has been proven to be associated with imbalances in the hormones estrogen and testosterone.

This condition can appear transient at birth; this is thought to be due to an increased level of circulating maternal estrogens. Adolescent boys may also suffer from this condition due to an imbalance of estradiol and testosterone. In men older than 65 years, hypertrophy is thought to be due toÂ a decline in testosterone levels and a shift in the ratio of testosterone to estrogen. In addition, older men are more likely to be taking medications that cause gynecomastia.

Underlying medical conditions such as breast cancer, obesity, hypogonadism, adrenal disease, thyroid disease, cirrhosis, renal failure, and malnutrition may contribute to this condition. Tumors of the adrenal glands, pituitary, lungs, and testes can impact hormonal changes resulting in imbalances and ultimately gynecomastia. Medications that have been shown to contribute to this condition include digoxin, thiazides, estrogens, phenothiazines, and theophylline. Use of certain recreational drugs including marijuana has also been associated with this disease. Chemotherapeutic drugs known to cause gynecomastia include methotrexate, alkylating agent, imatinib and vinca alkaloids. The most common drugs, however, have estrogen-like activity and include cimetidine, spironolactone, ketoconazole, and finasteride.
