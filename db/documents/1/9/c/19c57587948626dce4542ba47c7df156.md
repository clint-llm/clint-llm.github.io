Clinical examination is required for all patients presenting with acute or chronic thumb injuries.  Clinical examination alone is not enough for the differentiation between Rolando and Bennet fractures, nor does it allow identification of comminuted fracture patterns.  Thus, radiographic imaging is necessary for the comprehensive evaluation of these injuries.

Rolando fractures maintain an intact volar carpal ligament, which prevents displacement of the volar fragment, whereas the dorsal fragment gets displaced by the abductor pollicis longus (APL). The thumb metacarpal shaft suffers displacement by the adductor and extensor pollicis longus (EPL).
