Aortic arch anomalies can give rise to vascular rings, a rare vascular anomaly with significant health implications. This activity deals with understanding the embryology of the aortic arch, the anatomy of a normal aortic arch and its anomalies, types of aortic arch anomalies that can give rise to a vascular ring, its symptomatology and how to diagnose and manage a patient with a vascular ring. It will also review the role of an interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the embryology of an aortic arch ring.
- Outline the typical imaging findings associated with an aortic arch ring.
- Review the management options available for an aortic arch ring.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of patients with an aortic arch ring and improve outcomes.
