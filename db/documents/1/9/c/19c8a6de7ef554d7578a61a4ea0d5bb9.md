Patients with HIV/AIDS are prone to opportunistic infections given their immunosuppressed state; this risk is exaggerated with the weakening of the immune system as the disease progresses. In addition to the infections, some of the noninfectious complications include HIV-related encephalopathy, high-grade B-cell lymphoma, HIV-induced wasting syndrome, HIV associated nephropathy.
