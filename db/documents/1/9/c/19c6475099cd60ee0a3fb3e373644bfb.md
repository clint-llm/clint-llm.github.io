The tendon adapts to the morphology of the muscle. A flat muscle will have a flattened tendon or aponeurosis, while a muscle with a larger diameter will have a cordiform tendon. Tendon health allows the muscle to function properly and to better adapt to the functions that compete with it. Moreover, a healthy tendon allows an optimal mechanotransduction mechanism to the contractile fibers, with a better performance.
