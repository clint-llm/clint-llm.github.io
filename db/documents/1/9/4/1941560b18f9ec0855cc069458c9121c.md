In a review of 904 cases by Zhang et al., homonymous hemianopsia appeared in a nearly even distribution among genders (52% male, 48% female) with an average age of around 50 years old. An increased likelihood of left-sided HH (55%) to right-sided (45%)Â was noted. Incomplete HH was more common than complete, 62.4% to 37.6%, with the most common incomplete presentation being homonymous quadrantanopia (29.2%). HH appeared as an isolated deficit in 46.5% of patients, while 53.5% experienced motor symptoms, cognitive changes, or a combination of the two.
