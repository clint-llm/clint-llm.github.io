If the medication inducing the gingival overgrowth can be changed to a drug that is less associated with this complication, the gingival tissue may return to normal with the aid of adequate plaque control. The gingival enlargement can persist, despite drug substitution and good plaque control, and in this case, surgical management to restore normal gingival contours is required. These modalities of treatment, although effective, do not always prevent the recurrence of the enlargement. DIGO recurrence in surgically treated cases may appear as soon as three to six months after the procedure. In general, the results last for at least twelve months.
