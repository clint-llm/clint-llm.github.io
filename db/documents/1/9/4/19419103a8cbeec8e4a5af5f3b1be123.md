Tobacco contains nicotine, which is an addictive substance.  Therefore smokers must contend with not only the habit of smoking but also a serious addiction to nicotine.  A habit develops as a smoker's routine when they use cigarettes or tobacco products for stress relief, relaxation, to decrease hunger, or many other reasons.  An addiction to nictoine can occur as soon as the first exposure to nicotine; therefore avoiding tobacco use altogether is important, making prevention a key intervention in tobacco control efforts.
