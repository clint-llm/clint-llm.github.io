The most important element in testing patients with frontal lobe impairment is to perform a thorough neurologic exam. History should also be obtained from family and close contacts to get a “real idea” of how the patient lives. During the exam, it is important to note for behavioral changes such as abulia, inappropriate jocularity (Witzelsucht), insight impairment, confabulation, utilization behavior and environmental dependency (i.e., patients putting on glasses that are not theirs), perseveration, persistence, spontaneous frontal release signs, and incontinence. A mental status exam should be completed to evaluate attention (digit span forward and backward, months forward and backward), memory, perseveration and set-shifting ability (Luria alternating sequencing, Trails B, Wisconsin card sorting test), ability to suppress inappropriate response (auditory, visual go-no-go tasks, Stroop testing), word generation (FAS word generation), abstract reasoning, judgment, language, and testing for hemineglect. Other exams include olfaction, optokinetic nystagmus testing (with lesions contralateral to the decreased fast phase), hemiparesis or upper motor neuron signs, motor impersistence, gegenhalten (inability to relax muscles for testing of passive range of motion), primitive reflexes, frontal magnetic gait disturbance, and skull shape to suggest a frontal meningioma. However, during the exam, it is important to note if the patient was subject to past abuse, recent trauma or psychiatric stress.
