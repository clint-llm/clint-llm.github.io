An MRI can provide some guidance for clinicians and patients about the potential for improvement. Based on a systematic review of MRI findings by Tetreault et al. in 2013:

- High-intensity changes on T2 and low intensity on T1: poorer recovery rate, worse motor symptom improvements

- A high ratio of T2 signal intensity between non-compressed and compressed (C7 through T1) was associated with a poorer JOA recovery rate.

- More frequent high signal intensity on T2 predicts worse recovery.
