Patients should undergo assessment for signs and symptoms of dehydration and fluid overload. Indications that a patient may receive inadequate volume include elevated lactate and creatinine concentrations in the absence of an alternate cause. The urine output also requires monitoring. An ideal urine output target of 0.5 mL/kg/hr indicates adequate hydration but may not be useful to assess volume status in patients with renal impairment.

To monitor for fluid overload, patients at high risk of developing this complication should receive frequent re-evaluation. Providers should assess for new or worsening crackles. These sounds may indicate pulmonary edema secondary to volume overload. Additionally, any new or worsening peripheral edema in the extremities is also a potential indication of excessive crystalloid fluid administration.

In patients receiving hypertonic saline for severe hyponatremia with neurologic sequelae, frequent neurologic checks are necessary to assess clinical improvement. Such monitoring can also help identify worsening neurologic function as a potential indicator of cerebral edema or central pontine myelinolysis.

Patients receiving large volumes of crystalloid fluids should be monitored for electrolyte imbalances caused by crystalloid fluid administration.
