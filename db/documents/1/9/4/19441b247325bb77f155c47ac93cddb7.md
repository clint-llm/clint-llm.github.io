Triamterene is most often given in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, and thus more contraindications exist due to the combination of these drugs. Contraindications include hyperkalemia, pregnancy, severe hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, metabolic or respiratory acidosis, acute myopia, and secondary angle-closure glaucoma.
