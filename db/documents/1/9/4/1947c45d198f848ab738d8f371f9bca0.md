ALA's chemical reactivity is dictated by its dithiolane ring. There are two forms of ALA: oxidized lipoic acid (LA) and reduced dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA). Both are capable of scavenging a variety of ROS. DHLA is a potent antioxidant that can neutralize free radicals without becoming one in the process. Furthermore, ALA simultaneously regenerates other antioxidant factors such as vitamin C and E, subsequently increasing glutathione synthesis.

In the pathogenesis of inflammation, factor NF-kB modulates inflammatory cytokines, including interleukins (ILs) such as IL-1β and IL-6. ALA expresses its anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting I Kappa B kinase, a converging enzyme for the activation of NF-kB, thus suppressing the activation of other inflammatory cytokines.
