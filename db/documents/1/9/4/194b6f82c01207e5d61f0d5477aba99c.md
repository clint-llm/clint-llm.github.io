Patient education is vital. Once the physician diagnoses MEN1, the patient's family should see a genetic counselor to learn about the disease and how it may impact the patient and the patient's family. A genetic counselor should also encourage the rest of the family to get genetic testing done. Complete knowledge of the disease can help the patient to make an appropriate and informed decision.
