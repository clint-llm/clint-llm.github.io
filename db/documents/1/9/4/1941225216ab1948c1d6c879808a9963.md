Nabothian cysts are often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally during colposcopy examination. However, if the cyst is large and complex, it may be mistaken for malignancy or a tumor, as it may cause symptoms such as dyspareunia, pelvic pain, irregular vaginal bleeding, and vaginal discharge. It may also present as pressure symptoms if it presses on an organ, for example, if it presses on the rectum it may lead to abnormal defecation and tenesmus, urinary retention, amenorrhea, and lower abdominal pain.
