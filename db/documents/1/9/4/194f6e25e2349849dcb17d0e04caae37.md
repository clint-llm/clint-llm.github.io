Any patient complaining of any ocular symptoms while receiving IFN treatment requires a thorough examination. One should especially be vigilant in older patients, those receiving higher doses of IFN or combination with other medicines, and patients with preexisting morbidities like hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Visual acuity testing, pupil examination, and dilated fundus examination are mandatory. Fluorescein angiography may reveal areas of capillary dropout, hemorrhages, and cotton wool spots that may cause blocked fluorescence. Optical coherence tomographyÂ may help to diagnose macular edema, especially in subtle cases.

The recommendation is that all patients receiving IFN therapy should have a thorough ophthalmological examination before starting treatment. Any preexisting retinopathy should be ruled out. Monthly monitoring of patients should be in place while receiving therapy if there is preexisting retinopathy and every three months in asymptomatic patients unless they complain of defective vision.
