Lethal overdoses of caffeine in adults are rare but, when encountered, are commonly caused by an intentional overdose of medications.

Over-the-counter drugs containing large doses of caffeine purchased for their stimulant properties can also complicate caffeine exposure. Some examples include health food products, diet aids, decongestants, bronchodilators, or stay-awake pills.
