Healthcare budgeting is an extensive interprofessional process in any healthcare organization. When performed well, healthcare budgeting invites interdisciplinary participation from clinical staff (e.g., physicians, advanced practitioners, nurses, and pharmacists), operational staff (e.g., clinical engineering, environmental services, and nutrition services), and administrative staff (e.g., executives and managers). Nurse managers play a vital leadership role in budgeting, as evidenced by Baker, Lindholm, and Searle, because they can combine clinical experiences with operational understanding to make sound budgetary decisions.

Given the importance of budgeting to patient care, organizational success, and public health, it is ever more critical for healthcare professionals to understand the fundamental principles of budgeting.
