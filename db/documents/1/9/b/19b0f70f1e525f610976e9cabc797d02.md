The indications of single-lung ventilation aim at facilitating surgical exposure by isolating the lung away from the field of surgery or preventing further lung trauma by providing selective ventilation and preventing infection or secretions from entering the healthy lung.

**Surgical Exposure**

- Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), including pneumonectomy and wedge resections

- Pulmonary resections include pneumectomies and lobectomies.

- Mediastinal surgery

- Thoracic vascular surgery

- Esophageal surgery

- Spine surgery

- Minimally invasive aortic or mitral valve replacement surgeries

**Lung Isolation**

For protective isolation to prevent contamination or spill of secretions to the other lung:

- Massive pulmonary hemorrhage

- Infection/purulent secretions

- Whole lung lavageÂ in cases of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis

For control of ventilation to decrease pressure or airflow through the affected side:

- Tracheobronchial trauma

- Broncho-pleural/broncho-cutaneous fistula
