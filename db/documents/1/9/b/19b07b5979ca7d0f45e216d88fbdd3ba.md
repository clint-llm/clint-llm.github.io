Limited studies have assessed octreotide toxicity. However, isolated studies have shown a mild degree of bone marrow suppression and impairment in spermatogenesis due to inhibition of serum inhibin B and concomitant increase in FSH in supratherapeutic doses. There is a need to conduct significantly larger studies and trials to define and establish the therapeutic index of octreotide and identify its toxic effects and its management.
