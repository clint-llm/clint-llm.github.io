Epilepsy affects about seventy million of the global population and is a chronic, debilitating condition,

- Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (MTLE): Involving the anatomy of the innermost structure of the temporal lobe, including the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdala; this is the most common form of temporal lobe seizures and is usually secondary to a pathological process known as hippocampal sclerosis (HS).

- Lateral Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (LTLE): Also referred to as neocortical temporal lobe seizures.  These are very rare and most commonly secondary to genetic or acquired structural/anatomical lesions.

The impact of epilepsy leads to a decrease in quality-of-life indices, shortened life-expectancy, and by extension, bears a significant economic impact for the individual and society.
