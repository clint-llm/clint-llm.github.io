Diagnosis of nevus of Ota and Ito can be made based on its clinical morphology and sites of involvement.

- Mongolian spots – mostly, the lesions are present in the lumbosacral area and rarely present over the face. They spontaneously resolve by the age of 3 to 6 years.

- Acquired bilateral nevus of Ota-like macules (ABNOM)- sclera and oral mucosa are not involved in ABNOM or Sun’s nevus

- Melanoma metastasis

- Ecchymoses

- Vascular malformations

- Drug-induced hyperpigmentation is usually after the ingestion of drugs like minocycline, amiodarone, and gold

- Melasma - typically associated with pregnancy

- Oral melanotic macule - present over the palate, smaller in size with no involvement of sclera
