Male infants with prune belly syndrome display bilateral cryptorchidism where the testes lie intra-abdominally, adjacent to the dilated ureters at the level of the iliac arteries. The reason for the undescended testes is not known.

The massive dilation of the ureters occur at the distal level; however, this finding is variable. Hydroureteronephrosis is seldomÂ due to obstruction within the ureter; instead, the usual culprits include lower urinary tract obstruction (e.g., posterior urethral valves), vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and a histologic deficiency of smooth muscle and preponderance of fibrous tissue in ureters leading to ineffective peristalsis.

The severity of abdominal wall musculature is variable. There are rare cases with completely absent abdominal wall musculature; the abdominal wall deficiency is often present in the lower part of the abdominal wall. The rectus muscles and internal and external obliques are often less well developed, and in severe cases, skin, subcutaneous fat and a single fibrous layer may be all that is overlying the peritoneum.

Besides the characteristic triad, about 75% of children with prune belly syndrome have abnormalities involving other systems.
