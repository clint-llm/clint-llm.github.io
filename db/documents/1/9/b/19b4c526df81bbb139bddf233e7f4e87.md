Ampicillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic and is classified as aminopenicillins.

- The mode of action of beta-lactam antimicrobials on sensitive organisms can be considered a two-step process: In the first step, the drug binds to primary receptors called membrane-bound penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). These proteins perform vital roles in cell cycle-related; formation of cell wall peptidoglycan structure. Therefore, the inactivation of PBPs by bound antimicrobials immediately affects their function.

- The second stage comprises the physiological effects caused by this receptor-ligand interaction. PBPs are involved in the cell wall's late stages of peptidoglycan synthesis. Because peptidoglycan maintains the integrity of the cell wall, which resides in a hypotonic environment, its disruption causes lysis and cell death.

- It is important to recognize that ampicillin is primarily bactericidal against susceptible bacteria due to its inhibition of cell wall synthesis.

- Mechanism of resistance: Penicillinase (a β-lactamase) cleaves the beta-lactam ring and results in resistance to ampicillin. Hence ampicillin is usually combined with β-lactamase inhibitors like sulbactam.

**Pharmacokinetics**

Absorption: Ampicillin injection diffuses readily in body tissues and fluids.

Distribution:  Ampicillin shows low plasma protein binding(20%)) compared to 60 to 90% for other penicillins. Enhanced penetration through the blood-brain barrier and adequate CSF concentration is achieved due to inflammation in meningitis.

Metabolism: Ampicillin is excreted largely unchanged in the urine, and its excretion can be delayed by concurrent administration of probenecid.

Excretion: The half-life of ampicillin is 0.7 to 1.5 hours in adults with normal kidney function. According to a recent study, the pharmacokinetics of ampicillin vary significantly in late preterm and term neonates; clinicians should be cautious when administering ampicillin to preterm neonates.
