INH is a potent antimycobacterial agent that inhibits cell wall synthesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is used in both therapeutic and prophylactic regimens. Since initially being introduced in 1954, INH has contributed toward the treatment of tuberculosis resulting in a significant decline in tuberculosis-related morbidity and mortality.  The recommended dose of INH in adults is 300 mg (5 mg/kg) daily to 900 mg (15 mg/kg) once or twice weekly. Due to the rapid development of microorganism resistance, treatment regimens often include other antibacterial agents. Most of the regimens include INH alone or with other agents including rifampin, pyrazinamide, streptomycin, and/or ethambutol. Common side effects include gastrointestinal (GI) upset, fever, and rash. High doses of INH can cause peripheral neuropathy preventable with concurrent administration of pyridoxine (vitamin B6). The development of hepatotoxicity increases with other contributing risk factors such as increased age, alcohol consumption, concurrent use of medications that induce cytochrome P (CYP) oxidative enzymes, prior or concurrent liver disease like viral hepatitis, previous INH intolerance, female gender, injection drug use, and genetic causes like slow acetylation status.
