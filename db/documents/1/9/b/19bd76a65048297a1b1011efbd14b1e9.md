- Besides increased mortality, Behcet disease is associated with several potential lifelong complications, most of which result from ocular or neurologic involvement. Patients with hypopyon-related uveitis and retinal involvement are at a high risk of blindness.

- Coronary or pulmonary arterial aneurysmal rupture is also associated with Behcet disease, which carries a high mortality risk.

- Centraal nervous involvement can lead to significant morbidity, permanent deficits, and death. Ocular involvement as anterior and posterior uveitis may result in permanent blindness.

- Another complication of Behcet disease is an increased incidence of miscarriages due to the vasculitis of the placenta.
