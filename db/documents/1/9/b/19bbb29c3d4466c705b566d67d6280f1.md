A multidisciplinary team approach is crucial in the treatment of hydrocephalus, especially in children. Their health care needs are extended beyond childhood and adolescence. Health care transition is a process of leaving the pediatric and entering the adult health care system, but many families and patients face this transition period unprepared. Best practices are identified, and consensus recommendations are provided to facilitate this challenging period. The multidisciplinary team involving a pediatrician, neurosurgeon, ophthalmologist, and rehabilitation specialist offers the patient with integrated care for a good outcome.
