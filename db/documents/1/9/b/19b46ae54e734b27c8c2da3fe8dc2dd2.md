Medical: Nearly 80% of patients born with prune belly syndrome will have at least one documented urinary tract infection (UTI), and one-third of these patients will develop pyelonephritis.

Surgical: Broadly, patients with PBS may undergo three types of surgeries: orchiopexy, procedures involving the urinary tract, and the abdominal wall reconstruction. The timing and sequence of these procedures vary among individuals based on the severity of the urinary tract abnormalities and also the presence of other comorbidities (e.g., pulmonary hypoplasia).

Orchiopexy is almost always an indicated procedure in prune belly syndrome, and the current recommendation for bilateral orchiopexy is at about six months of age. The orchiopexy at an earlier age is recommended but should be weighed against the higher anesthetic risks. A delayed orchiopexy worsens the testicular prognosis as in any other case of undescended testes.

The timing and need for urinary tract reconstructive surgeries vary among clinicians who manage prune belly syndrome, and the decision should be individually based on the clinical severity of each patient.
