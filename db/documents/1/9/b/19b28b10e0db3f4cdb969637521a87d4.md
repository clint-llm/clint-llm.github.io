Although autoimmune encephalitis is often treatment responsive, it can lead to serious complications if left untreated or if there is a delay in treatment. This includes cognitive impairment, sleep disorders, hyperkinesia, autonomic dysfunction, persistent amnesia (anti LG1 encephalitis), coma, status epilepticus. According to a retrospective study by Xu et al., central hypoventilation syndrome is a key risk factor for mechanical ventilation during hospitalization in anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients and therefore needs to be monitored closely.
