# Introduction

Glucose is a monosaccharide sugar that our bodies obtain from food and use as our principal energy source.

The glucose concentration in the blood is regulated by the complex interplay of multiple pathways modulated by several hormones.

# Etiology and Epidemiology

Plasma glucose is measurable in several different ways, and its measurement is most important for the screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of diabetes and metabolic dysregulation presents in conditions such as metabolic syndrome.

# Pathophysiology

Absorption of glucose into cells depends on specific transporters. Some require sodium (Na+) as a cotransporter, while others do not. The Na+-dependent transport of glucose uses the Na+/K+ ATPase pump to generate a negative potential gradient that drives the passive transport of Na+ into the cell.

Once glucose enters these cells, Na+-independent glucose transporters bring glucose into the blood. Na+ independent transport of glucose refers to specialized transporters that vary in type depending on specific tissues.

Glucose homeostasis in the plasma depends on the balance of the hormones glucagon and insulin. Both hormones get released from the pancreas (insulin from beta-cells found in the islet of Langerhans and glucagon from alpha cells) in response to plasma glucose levels.

Insulin exerts its effects through binding to insulin receptors, which possess tyrosine kinase activity, and activation of a series of downstream events beginning with insulin substrate-1 (IRS-1) culminates in the increased expression of GLUT4.

The major target organ for glucagon is the liver, which binds to a specific G protein-coupled receptor, expressed abundantly in the liver and kidney and, to a lesser extent, in other tissues, including the heart, adipose, pancreas, and brain. Glucagon stimulates the production of glucose in the liver predominantly by glycogenolysis.

Insulin inhibits glucagon release from the pancreas and decreases glucagon gene expression, thereby attenuating its biosynthesis.

Importantly, plasma glucose levels undergo regulation through a few key pathways: glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and glycogenesis/glycogenolysis. Insulin can affect glycolysis and gluconeogenesis through dephosphorylation of the phosphofructokinase-2 enzyme (PFK-2), which increases levels of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-BP).

Other hormones that influence glucose homeostasis include incretins such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP). Incretins potentiate the release of insulin in response to oral glucose. Other hormones that influence glucose metabolism include pancreatic amylin, glucocorticoids (increase insulin resistance and gluconeogenesis), thyroid hormones (promote glucose absorption, glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis), growth hormones (inhibit glucose uptake into cells), and epinephrine.

Epinephrine (also called adrenaline), a catecholamine secreted by the adrenal medulla, stimulates glucose production (glycogenolysis) and decreases glucose use, thereby increasing blood glucose concentrations. It also stimulates glucagon secretion and inhibits insulin secretion by the pancreas.

Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in regulating blood glucose levels and is associated with genetic and lifestyle factors, such as family history, race, obesity, and diet. Diabetes resulting from other causes include monogenic diabetes (such as neonatal diabetes), maturity onset of diabetes in the young (MODY), gestational diabetes, pancreatic insufficiency, or drug-induced. High blood glucose levels characterize the disorder due to insulin resistance and ultimate insulin deficiency.

Diabetes occurs most commonly in two main types: type 1 or type 2.

The most practical markers of β-cell autoimmunity are circulating antibodies, which have been detected in the serum years before the onset of hyperglycemia. Almost 85% of type 1 diabetes patients have circulating islet cell antibodies, most of which are directed against β cell glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD).

Type 2 diabetes occurs in the majority of patients with weight gain. This type is more strongly associated with obesity, progressive metabolic dysregulation, and insulin resistance.

In diabetes, glucose stays elevated outside of the cells resulting in starved cells despite high glucose levels in plasma.

# Specimen Requirements and Procedure

In individuals with normal hematocrit, fasting whole blood glucose concentration is approximately 10% to 12% lower than plasma glucose. Although glucose concentrations in the water phase of red blood cells and plasma are similar (the erythrocyte plasma membrane is freely permeable to glucose), the water content of plasma (93%) is approximately 11% higher than that of whole blood.

During fasting, capillary blood glucose concentration is only 2 to 5 mg/dL (0.1 to 0.3 mmol/L), higher than venous blood. After a glucose load, however, capillary blood glucose concentrations are 20 to 70 mg/dL (1.1 to 3.9 mmol/L) (mean approximately = 30 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L); equivalent to 20% to 25%) higher than concurrently drawn venous blood samples.

Glycolysis has been found to be inhibited, and glucose stabilized for as long as three days at room temperature by adding sodium fluoride (NaF) or, less commonly, sodium iodoacetate to the specimen.

Fluoride ions in high concentration inhibit the activity of urease and certain other enzymes; consequently, the specimens are unsuitable for the determination of urea in procedures that require urease and for the direct assay of some serum enzymes.

# Diagnostic Tests

Plasma glucose can be measured with high precision and accuracy using enzymatic methods such as glucose oxidase and hexokinase. Many point-of-care testing analyzers, including blood-gas instruments, measure glucose concentrations using the glucose oxidase method.

# Testing Procedures

**Glucose Meters**

Portable meters for measurement of blood glucose concentrations are used in three major settings: in acute and chronic care facilities (at the patient’s bedside and in clinics or hospitals), in physicians’ offices, and by patients or their caregivers at home, work, and school.

These meters use reflectance photometry or electrochemistry to measure the rate of the reaction or the final concentration of the products. Reflectance photometry measures the amount of light reflected from a test pad containing a reagent. In electrochemical systems, the enzymatic reaction in an electrode incorporated on the test strip produces a flow of electrons.

Calibration is automatic on some devices, whereas others use lot-specific code chips or strips. All manufacturers supply control solutions. Recent advances in technology facilitate data analysis and sharing.

Strict adherence to the instructions is necessary to obtain accurate results.

**Laboratory Assessment of Glucose**

Current laboratory recommendations for plasma glucose measurement are to draw fasting blood samples in the morning rather than later in the day, as glucose levels tend to be higher in the morning than in the afternoon.

**Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)**

Serial measurement of plasma glucose before and after a specific amount of glucose given orally should provide a standard method by which to evaluate individuals and establish values for healthy and diseased subjects.

The following conditions should be met before an OGTT is performed: discontinue, when possible, medications known to affect glucose tolerance; perform in the morning after three days of unrestricted diet (containing at least 150 g of carbohydrate per day) and activity; and perform the test after a 10 to 16-hour fast only in ambulatory outpatients (bed rest impairs glucose tolerance), who should remain seated during the test without smoking cigarettes.

**Intravenous Glucose Tolerance Test**

Some patients are unable to tolerate a large oral carbohydrate load or may have altered gastric physiology (e.g., after gastric resection). In these patients, an intravenous glucose tolerance test may be performed to eliminate factors related to the rate of glucose absorption.

The preparation of patients is the same as for the OGTT. The dose of glucose is 0.5 g/kg of body weight (maximum 35 g), given as a 25 g/dL solution. The dose is administered intravenously over 3 minutes ± 15 seconds, and blood is collected every 10 minutes after the mid-injection time for 1 hour.

# Interfering Factors

The essential factor to consider when checking plasma glucose levels is the time at which the patient last consumed anything caloric. Plasma glucose levels tend to be lowest before meals or when fasting.

When processing a sample of plasma glucose, it is crucial to limit the amount of glycolysis that occurs after drawing a sample.

# Results, Reporting, and Critical Findings

The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus has serious consequences. It confers a risk of long-term diabetic complications, including blindness, renal failure, and amputations, as well as an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. It also means a lifetime of dietary restrictions and medications and can seriously curtail lifestyle and employment prospects.

A provisional diagnosis of diabetes mellitus must always be confirmed by laboratory measurements on blood specimens. Normal plasma glucose levels are defined as under 100 mg/dL during fasting and less than 140 mg/dL 2 hours postprandial. Additionally, glucose levels in healthy individuals can vary with age.

Diagnosis of diabetes depends on plasma glucose, which is measurable during fasting, the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or the A1c criteria.

Confirmation of the diagnosis requires two abnormal test results from the same or two separate samples.

Patients at the borderline of these criteria for diabetes are considered prediabetic.

Hypoglycemia is generally plasma glucose under 70 mg/dL, but symptoms may not occur until plasma glucose is less than 55 mg/dL. Such low levels of plasma glucose indicate a dangerous, potentially life-threatening situation characterized by seizures and coma.

Reactive hypoglycemia can present in gastric surgery patients and usually occurs 90–150 minutes after a meal, especially if it is high in sugar or other carbohydrates. Because of the reduced stomach size, glucose is rapidly transported into the small intestine, where incretins are released, leading to excessive insulin response and hypoglycemia.

Factitious (or non-physiological) hypoglycemia occurs when insulin or sulphonylurea is taken or administered deliberately. It is difficult to diagnose and is usually associated with psychological problems in the patient or carers involved. If a confirmed hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemic sample has a low c-peptide level, then the insulin is likely to be exogenous.

Symptoms of hypoglycemia vary among individuals, and none is specific. Epinephrine produces the classic signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia: trembling, sweating, nausea, rapid pulse, lightheadedness, hunger, and epigastric discomfort.

CSF glucose concentrations should be approximately 60% of plasma concentrations and must always be compared with concurrently measured plasma glucose for adequate clinical interpretation. Glucose in the CSF of neonates varies much more than in adults, and the CSF-to-serum ratio is generally higher than in adults.

# Clinical Significance

Measurements of plasma glucose levels are essential for screening metabolic dysregulation, pre-diabetes, and diabetes. Evidence finds that the onset of type 2 diabetes can occur as early as 4 to 7 years before clinical diagnosis. Additionally, plasma glucose levels can monitor diabetes, screen for hypoglycemic episodes, guide treatment or lifestyle interventions, and predict risk for comorbidities, such as cardiovascular or eye and kidney disease.

In a 15-year study of 1939 patients with type 2 diabetes, patients with fasting plasma glucose equal to or greater than 140 mg/dL showed a significantly increased risk of death.

# Quality Control and Lab Safety

For non-waived tests, laboratory regulations require, at the minimum, analysis of at least two levels of control materials once every 24 hours. If necessary, laboratories can assay QC samples more frequently to ensure accurate results.

Westgard multi-rules are used to evaluate the quality control runs. If a run is declared out of control, investigate the system (instrument, standards, controls, etc.) to determine the cause of the problem. Do not perform any analysis until the problem has been resolved.

Consider all specimens, control materials, and calibrator materials as potentially infectious. Exercise the normal precautions required for handling all laboratory reagents. Disposal of all waste material should be in accordance with local guidelines. Wear gloves, a lab coat, and safety glasses when handling human blood specimens.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Routine screening of plasma glucose levels in at-risk patients would aid early diagnosis and intervention to limit the complications and mortality risks of diabetes. In particular, continuous glucose monitoring in intensive care patients has been suggested to help prevent severe hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia and associated mortality risks. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can detect hypoglycemia or hyperglycemic episodes early and provide guidelines for rapid insulin/interventional adjustments. Hence, real-time access to accurate glucose measurements alerts health professionals to the efficacy of treatment and helps decrease the risk of missed episodes of hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia.

If elevated, serum glucose monitoring can inform and direct care for several potentially deleterious sequelae. As a result, everyone on the interprofessional healthcare team must be involved in the testing, patient education, monitoring, and therapy when appropriate. This includes clinicians, specialists, nurses (including specialty-trained nurses), and pharmacists, so everyone is on the same page and directs their efforts to optimize patient care and outcomes.
