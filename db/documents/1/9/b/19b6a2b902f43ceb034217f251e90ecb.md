Regular screening for signs of mental illness during pregnancy and after childbirth should be protocol. Social services, nurses, and other relevant departments may be involved to assess the situation and provide support and assistance if needed; reporting to clinicians whenever there is evidence suggesting a lack of improvement. When a patient seeks prenatal or postnatal care, primary care providers should pay attention to the entire bio-psycho-social model and not just the patient's physical and medical issues related to pregnancy. EPDS (Edinburgh postnatal depression scale) and MDQ (mood disorder questionnaire) are quick and effective screenings to identify telltale signs of possible mental illness in women during and after pregnancy.

Postpartum psychosis requires an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, mental health professionals, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. [Level 5]
