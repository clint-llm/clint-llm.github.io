The Ovarian artery is a branch of the abdominal aorta; it reaches the ovary through the suspensory ligament of the ovary. Even though ovaries are pelvic organs, they derive their blood supply from the abdominal aorta indicating their site origin. The uterine artery originates from the anterior division of the internal iliac artery along with the umbilical artery in a common trunk.

The veins of the female internal genitals usually correspond to the arteries. The uterine vein follows the course of the uterine artery and is also contained within the cardinal ligament; it drains into the internal iliac vein. The ovarian veins receive blood from the ovaries; the right ovarian vein drains directly into the IVC while the left ovarian vein drains into the left renal vein. Malignancies in the pelvis may metastasize to the vertebral column or spinal cord via connections of the pelvic veins.

The lymphatic flow from the uterus, cervix, and vagina drains into the internal and external iliac nodes. Lymph vessels from the ovary and fallopian tube drain directly into the paraaortic nodes.
