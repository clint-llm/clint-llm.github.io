The interprofessional team and healthcare professionals, including laboratory technologists, pharmacists, nurses, and clinicians, need to all work together to ensure the safety and efficacy of administered drugs. After the clinician chooses the choice and dosage of a particular drug, the pharmacist should verify dosing, report any drug interactions, and take notice of special clinical situations that will influence drug levels and hence efficacy as well as adverse events (e.g., albumin levels, changes in weight, malnutrition, renal and hepatic function). In one study in chronic kidney disease patients, pharmacists identified 5302 drug-related problems and made 3160 recommendations with acceptance rates up to 95%.

When possible and indicated plasma levels should be followed. Nurses play a critical role in drug administration and alerting the team regarding errors related to medication reconciliation.
