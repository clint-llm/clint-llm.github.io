Pericardial calcification in the absence of symptoms is a benign condition. However, constrictive pericarditis must be ruled out in such patients. Diagnosis of CP can be challenging and requires multimodal imaging with an interprofessional approach involving invasive and non-invasive cardiologists, radiologists, and cardiothoracic surgeons. The condition is often identified by primary care and emergency providers. CP carries a grave prognosis if missed, and most patients die with medical management alone. Pericardiectomy is potentially curative and carries acceptable mid and long-term outcomes depending on the etiology. Coordination of evaluation by the team will lead to improved outcomes. [Level 5]
