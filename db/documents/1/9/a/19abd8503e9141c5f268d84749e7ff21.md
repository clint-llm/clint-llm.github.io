The term Rolando fracture was described for the first time in 1910 by Silvio Rolando, an Italian surgeon.Bennett fracture.

Rolando fracture patterns are typically represented by a transverse articular component, which extends between the diaphysis and epiphysis in addition to an associated longitudinal intra-articular fracture line that divides the epiphysis into two fragments, one volar and the other dorsal, often resulting in a central depression of the articular surface.  Commonly and contemporarily speaking, all intra-articular fractures with multiple fragments of the base of the first metacarpal classify as Rolando-type fracture patterns.
