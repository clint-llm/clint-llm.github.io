- The anterior tarsal tunnel is an entrapment neuropathy of the deep peroneal nerve or its terminal branches in the anterior ankle.

- It is relatively uncommon and often misdiagnosed.

- The etiology includes any form of compression on the DPN, typically caused by the inferior extensor retinaculum or osteophytes in the dorsal foot.

- Patients may have pain and paresthesia originating from the site of entrapment and radiating down to the dorsal foot, specifically the first webspace.

- There is no specific test to diagnose anterior tarsal tunnel syndrome, and diagnosis relies on a combination of a thorough history, physical exam, imaging, and electromyography and nerve conduction studies.

- Conservative treatment should be attempted in all patients before surgical decompression.

- Be aware of the existence of an accessory deep peroneal nerve derived from the superficial peroneal nerve.
