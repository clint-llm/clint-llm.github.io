Numerous factors can interfere with a 3-phase bone scan. If the patient has a medical condition that affects blood flow unilaterally, then the flow and blood pool phases can be adversely affected, demonstrating relatively abnormal activity to an area that may be normal for the patient. An example is a patient with advanced vascular atherosclerotic disease with decreased flow secondary to claudication or post-operative patients with bypass grafts of the extremities.

Additionally, poor renal function can cause continued activity within the soft tissues on the delayed phase imaging, as the radiotracer cannot be adequately cleared. This may limit the visualization of the bony structures. A 24-hour delayed acquisition (often referred to as the fourth phase) may be used to allow for clearance of soft tissue activity, although the 6-hour half-life of Technetium 99m means that approximately 94% of the radiotracer activity is degraded by the time the delayed imaging is acquired.

Urine contamination or a urinary diversion reservoir can interfere with the normalization algorithm as a focal area of increased radiotracer activity can result in apparent decreased activity within the osseous structures. The contamination can also appear as specious pathology if it overlies osseous structures.

Typically, the labeling efficiency of Technetium 99m to the bone-seeking agent is greater than 95%. Poor labeling results in a significant amount of unbound Technetium 99m-pertechnetate colloquially referred to as "free technetium." Free technetium can be seen with any Technetium 99m labeled agent. Free technetium is used in other imaging studies within the field of nuclear medicine but serves as a confounding agent in skeletal scintigraphy where it can localize to the salivary glands, thyroid, and stomach.
