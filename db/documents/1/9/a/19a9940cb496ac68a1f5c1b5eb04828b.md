The short-term prognosis for patients with OSA is generally good. Treatments for patients with mild obstructive sleep apnea have shown improvement in symptoms but do not show differences in long-term cardiovascular outcomes. However, untreated OSA can be life-threatening. Excessive daytime sleepiness results in patients with OSA having increased death rates from MVCs and other sleepiness-related incidents; patients with moderate to severe OSA have an increased risk of developing cardiopulmonary disease, cerebrovascular incidents, and neuropsychiatric dysfunction if untreated. However, treatments have not been shown to decrease mortality, cardiovascular events, and neurocognitive function in the long term.
