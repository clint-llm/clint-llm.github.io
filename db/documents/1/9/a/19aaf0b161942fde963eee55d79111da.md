Multiple resuscitation formulas are utilized for burn resuscitation. However, the Parkland and modified Brooke formulas have been most commonly utilized, among others. Accordingly, the recommendations for lactated Ringer’s solution with all these formulas range from 2 to 4 mL/kg/day % burn.

One of the most important concerns about pediatric patient resuscitation is the fundamental differences in body surface area and skin thickness.

Another important difference in fluid resuscitation management in the pediatric population is the threshold for initiating fluid replacement. While fluid resuscitation is recommended for burns greater than or equal to 15% of (TBSA) in children, it might be started in adult patients with equal to or greater than 20 % of TBSA.
