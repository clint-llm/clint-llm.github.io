Although the result of all speech production is a series of muscle movements, new research demonstrates that the neurologic mechanisms involved in speech production are not simply limited to motor commands that move muscles. Before motor commands can be sent, the speaker must create a mental image of the sounds comprising the words. This stage can be exemplified by the fact that one knows that the word “snow” rhymes with “blow” but not with “flow” without needing to say these words aloud.
