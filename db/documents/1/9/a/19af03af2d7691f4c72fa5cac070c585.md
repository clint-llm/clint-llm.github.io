Candidiasis is an opportunistic infection. Candida albicans is present in healthy persons colonizing the oropharyngeal, esophageal, and gastrointestinal mucosa. Candida albicans can cause mucosal candidiasis in these areas where they usually are present in an immunocompromised host. In patients who have leukemia, lymphoma because of the consumption of corticosteroids or cytotoxic drugs, their immunity is compromised, leading to candidal infection.

Antibiotic usage is commonly associated with candidiasis. Cancer cytotoxic chemotherapy may result in fungemia caused by Candida albicans, which develop from fungal translocation through compromised mucosal barriers. Fungal commensals in the upper and lower GI tract can transform into opportunistic pathogens due to changes in endogenous bacterial population size or composition, as well as changes in the host environment.

Other predisposing factors of candidiasis include TB, myxedema, hypoparathyroidism, Addison's disease, nutritional deficiency(vitamin A, B6, Iron), smoking, poorly maintained dentures, IV tubes, catheters, heart valves, old age, infancy, and pregnancy. Xerostomia is also a predisposing factor due to the absence of protective antifungal proteins, histatin, and calprotectin.
