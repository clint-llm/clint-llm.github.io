# Introduction

Strain counterstrain (SCS) is a type of indirect osteopathic manipulative soft tissue technique developed by Lawrence Jones in 1955 to passively treat musculoskeletal pain, decreased range of motion, and somatic dysfunction by bringing about a change in cellular function of the tissues being treated.

Facilitated positional release (FPR), developed in 1990 by Stanley Schiowitz, is similar to strain counterstrain in that the physician places the patient in a position of ease based on palpation of the tender-point.

# Issues of Concern

While many studies have shown promising results with the use of SCS and FPR for specific dysfunctions, there is limited research on the physiology. The most significant area of concern is the limited number of clinical studies to determine the physiology of SCS and FPR.

Other studies have also questioned the ability of SCS to reduce pain and disability as well as questioned the length of relief provided from treatment.

Despite studies that question the effectiveness, use, and physiologic foundations of SCS and FPR, the number of promising studies for treating specific dysfunctions suggests a positive impact on medical practice implementation.

# Cellular Level

Strain Counterstrain and FPR work on a cellular level to relieve pain, somatic dysfunction, and range of motion limitations by acting on muscle spindles, Golgi tendon organs, and inflammatory pathways.

Proprioceptors are end organs that sense physical changes in musculoskeletal tissues, muscle length, joint position, and tendon tension.

When a muscle stretches, type 1a sensory fibers and type II sensory fibers fire at increased frequencies to denote velocity and length stretched, respectively.

Intrafusal fibers, the thin muscle fibers found in the muscle spindle, can intensify the strength of the afferent signal produced if the muscle stretches and the intrafusal fibers become contracted, rather than at rest.

Golgi tendon organs are proprioceptors/mechanoreceptors found in tendons and joint capsules and inform the CNS of the tension/force created by the muscle contraction, not stretch.

Inflammatory pathway initiation by strain or stress to muscle tissue causes fibroblasts to release IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, and IL-16.

Substance P and calcitonin G relation protein (CGRP) increase the microcirculation by dilating blood vessels and increasing permeability.

# Development

Derived from mesenchymal stem cells, skeletal muscle fibers and myofibers are created during primary and secondary myogenesis, which occurs during the embryonic and fetal stage, respectively.

Muscle spindles become definitive structures by week 20 and continue to lengthen and grow after birth.

# Organ Systems Involved

The musculoskeletal and nervous systems are the major organ systems treated with strain counterstain and facilitated positional release techniques. The musculoskeletal system, including their proprioceptors, and the local release of cytokines that can create nociceptive pain is responsible for the tender-points treated in SCS and FPR. Additionally, the stretch reflex and gamma-motor neurons that are part of the nervous system are integral to the muscle spindle's function.

# Function

The function of strain counterstrain is to correct somatic dysfunction, pain, and tissue texture changes that have resulted in tender-points. A benefit of SCS is that it may be useful for patients that require a gentler osteopathic technique or patientâ€™s who have not responded to other osteopathic techniques. As described above, SCS is a passive, indirect technique.

Facilitated positional release (FPR) also functions as an osteopathic treatment for somatic dysfunction, pain, and tissue texture changes (tender points) in a shorter amount of time than SCS by adding additional compression or distracting force to initiate a quicker cellular response.

# Mechanism

Treatment using strain counterstrain will begin with the practitioner identifying the patient's tender point associated with dysfunction. Once identified, the tender-point will be monitored during and after SCS.

After identifying the TP, the practitioner moves the patient into a position of comfort in which the TP is at least 70% less tender.

Facilitated positional release differs from SCS because when the patient is placed in the position of comfort, the practitioner will apply a facilitating force of compression or distraction to the tissues in that position for an amount of time that is much less than 90-seconds, such as 5 seconds.

# Related Testing

The tests and imaging capabilities found to be effective on Fibromyalgia patients who suffer from trigger points, small round painful tissue texture changes found in musculotendinous tissue bands, have also been found to help image Tender-Points.

# Pathophysiology

Currently, there are three proposed theories to explain the formation of tender-points and their treatment via strain counterstrain: proprioceptive theory, local inflammatory circulatory effects, and ligamento-muscular reflex.

The proprioceptive theory is the most common explanation for SCS effectiveness.

The shortened muscle can also limit the joint and range of motion.

Quantifiable studies have shown that symptomatic individuals with tender-points: (1) felt tender at lower electrical thresholds, (2) had reduced stretch reflex amplitudes when treated with SCS, and (3) experienced reduced pain and improved range of motion after SCS.

Local inflammatory and circulation effects appear to be another cause of the effectiveness of strain counterstrain and FPR. Repositioning an individual can increase circulation to that area, help with nutrients and waste removal, decrease swelling, and ameliorate tender-point pain caused by ischemia.

The least studied explanation for SCS and facilitated positional release (FPR) effectiveness is the ligamento-muscular reflex. Ligamento-muscular reflex is defined by the contraction/relaxation of muscles in response to the ligament mechanoreceptors to prevent ligament damage.

# Clinical Significance

SCS and FPR are commonly used osteopathic techniques and are especially useful when treating individuals with chronic conditions that cause severe pain, individuals with osteoporosis, the elderly, individuals with acute strain, those who have had recent surgeries, had recent trauma, or are hospitalized or individuals that do not respond to other techniques or desire gentleness.

While there is limited experimental research done to determine the efficacy of FPR in treating pain and somatic dysfunctions, FPR's similarity to SCS would suggest it can be useful for many of the same indications. Research on the use of SCS and FPR for the treatment of piriformis syndrome, iliacus, and psoas dysfunction is also limited; however, it is part of the osteopathic physicians' curriculum and practice. However, like most osteopathic techniques the use of SCS and FPR is contraindicated in individuals whose tender-point is in an area with an inflammatory process that may be caused by problems other than somatic dysfunction (such as infection), a patient is unable to communicate for tenderness feedback, or the patient cannot handle manual therapy.
