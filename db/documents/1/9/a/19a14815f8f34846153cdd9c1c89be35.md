Radial keratotomy correction is indicated for patients with moderate myopia. Patients should be at least 18 years of age because they require stable refraction and be able to provide informed consent for surgery. Contact lens wearers will need to remove the lenses and have several serial corneal topography scans and cycloplegic refractions to ensure refractive stability before proceeding to surgery.
