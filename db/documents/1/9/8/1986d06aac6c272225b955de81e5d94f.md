Management of pustular psoriasis requires an interprofessional team approach, including providers from primary care, dermatology, and infectious disease. A detailed history and complete physical examination are critical in diagnosing cases of pustular psoriasis. A dermatologist can help in the initial diagnostic workup and to assess for complications. Depending on the surface area involved, admission to the hospital may be required (e.g., von Zumbusch subtype). In equivocal cases, a biopsy can be performed, as the differential diagnosis for pustulosis is rather vast. Treatment is targeted to prevent relapses and shorten the duration of flares.
