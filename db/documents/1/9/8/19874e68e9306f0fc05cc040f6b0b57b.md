The major interfering factors are heat, non-specific adsorptive groups on the support medium, and electroendosmosis. As the current and duration of electrophoresis increase, the gel's temperature increases due to heat dissipation. This will increase the random motion of the molecules in the medium, reducing the sharpness/resolution of the separated bands.

Non-specific adsorptive groups present on the support medium lead to the binding of analytes with these groups and hinders their mobility across the gel. As described earlier, electroendosmosis generates ion flow opposite to the direction of analytes motion leading to a reduction in resolution.
