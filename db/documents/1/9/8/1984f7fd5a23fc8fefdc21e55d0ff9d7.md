The syndrome of hemolysis with a microangiopathic blood smear, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count, is more commonly known by the acronym HELLP syndrome in pregnant and postpartum patients. It may represent a complication or progression of severe preeclampsia; however, this relationship has been challenged by the recent evidence that these pathologies may have separate etiologies. This activity reviews the etiology, clinical presentation, evaluation, differential diagnosis, and management of HELLP syndrome.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the risk factors for developing HELLP syndrome.
- Recognize the clinical presentation of a patient with HELLP syndrome and review the diagnostic workup.
- Outline the management for HELLP syndrome.
- Emphasize the importance of collaboration amongst different specialties to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes in patients with HELLP syndrome.
