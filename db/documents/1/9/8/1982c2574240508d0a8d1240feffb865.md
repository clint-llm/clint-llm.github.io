The general principles of surgery for any STS also apply to the patients diagnosed with LMS. The trials presented in this section include patients with LMS; however, the histology is not limited to LMS.

**Soft-tissue Sarcoma of the Extremity/Trunk**

Historically, amputation was the standard of care for patients with STS of the extremity. As evidence built up in favor of wide local excision and RT, amputation was only for patients experiencing local recurrence.

**Soft Tissue Sarcoma of Retroperitoneum**

The general principles of resection are the same as those for the STS of the extremity/trunk. The best outcomes take place with an R0 resection. Due to the massive size of retroperitoneal sarcoma, accurate pathologic assessment of all margins on the resected tumor specimen is challenging. For any patient who has an intraoperative rupture of the tumor, R2 resection and/or piecemeal resection of the tumor correlates with a higher local recurrence rate.

**Uterine Leiomyosarcoma**

Uterine LMS is a separate entity from retroperitoneal LMS. The standard surgical approach for both early and advanced-stage disease is to perform a hysterectomy and en bloc resection of any viable tumor. Oopherectomy is not a procedural choice unless the tumor involves ovaries. It is not yet clear if lymph node involvement translates into a worse outcome. The metastasis rate to lymph nodes is quite low (5 to 11%), which makes lymph node sampling undesirable, especially if there is no evidence of metastatic disease. The American Association of Gynecological laparoscopists (AAGL) and the Federal drug agency (FDA) have strongly discouraged using power morcellation if malignancy is suspected. If morcellation occurs inadvertently, then the patient should at least undergo subsequent trachelectomy (if the cervix is present in situ), peritoneal biopsies (including surrounding previous port sites), and either omental biopsy or omentectomy as part of a reexploration surgery. Additional imaging such as PET/CT to evaluate for disseminated disease is also a viable option before second-look surgery.
