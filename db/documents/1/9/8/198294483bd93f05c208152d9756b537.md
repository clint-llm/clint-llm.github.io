While proper stretching, form, and training technique can help prevent trochanteric bursitis in the young athlete, many cases are secondary to trauma or are idiopathic and, therefore, not preventable. However, it is important to educate patients on the positive prognosis and success of non-operative management. Reassurance, along with initiation of anti-inflammatories and/or corticosteroid injections, typically leads to the resolution of symptoms and patient satisfaction. It is essential that clinicians counsel patients on the potential side effects of NSAIDs and corticosteroid injections before initiating treatment. Patients should understand the risk: benefit ratio before proceeding with treatment.
