Individuals with a clinical presentation and pre-operative diagnosis of focal or segmental XGP can be treated with antibiotics and percutaneous drainage. With no improvement, partial nephrectomy or total nephrectomy can be done.

In patients with a diagnosis of diffuse or advanced stage XGP, the treatment of choice is nephrectomy. The use of antibiotics before and after surgery controls the local infection and avoids septic complications. The aim of surgery is to remove all granulomatous tissue so that there is no fistula formation in the future. Sinuses or fistulas should be repaired if found.

Rare cases of bilateral XGP should be treated with bilateral nephrectomy and long-term dialysis.

There has been debate regarding open versus laparoscopic nephrectomy. Because of the inflammatory nature of the disease, laparoscopic nephrectomy is often challenging, and the conversion rate from laparoscopic to open nephrectomy is 50%. Laparoscopic nephrectomy can be done in selected patients by a surgeon with advanced laparoscopic experience and skills. Laparoscopic nephrectomy is associated with less blood loss and reduced hospital stay in patients with XGP.
