- Ifosfamide belongs to the class of the oxazaphosphorine alkylating agents. It is an inactive compound in its parent form (prodrug). It is metabolized in the liver by CYP450 enzymes to active metabolites. These active metabolites (phosphoramide mustard derivatives and acrolein) bind to DNA and inhibit DNA synthesis.

- There are two mechanisms by which these metabolites act. First, they cause cell damage by forming interstrand or intrastrand crosslinks,Â leading to apoptosis of the damaged cell. Second, the active metabolites also upregulate the reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in irreparable DNA damage and the cessation of protein formation.

- Compared to other alkylating compounds, cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide have more anti-tumor activity as their derivatives. Mainly, phosphoramide mustard derivatives and acrolein are cytotoxic rather than cytostatic. Filtration primarily occurs through the kidney, and dosing requires adjustment according to renal function.
