Aflibercept is a dimeric glycoprotein (molecular weight= 115 kDa) that acts as a soluble protein decoy for VEGF receptors (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2) present on the surface of endothelial cells in the retina.

Through this mechanism, aflibercept prevents ligand-induced dimerization of VEGFR-2, preventing downstream activation of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domains from inhibiting pathologic angiogenesis.

Aflibercept exerts its inhibitory effects on VEGF receptors preventing endothelial proliferation, vascular permeability, and neovascularization. This targeted intravitreal injection therapy aims to inhibit VEGF signaling, which underlies angiogenesis and vascular leak characteristic of NVAMD.

Compared to other VEGF inhibitors, aflibercept is thought to have at least a 200-fold higher affinity for VEGF, which explains optimal therapeutic outcomes of patients receiving intravitreal aflibercept therapy. In addition, the relatively small molecular size of aflibercept allows for enhanced diffusion into the retina and choroid.
