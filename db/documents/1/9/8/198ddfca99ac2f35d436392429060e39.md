**Diet and Activity**

- While there is no specific diet for patients with Paget disease, those who are prescribed bisphosphonates should ensure adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D.

- Aggressive physical activity is not recommended, as the risk of fracture is high. However, muscle-strengthening exercise at a low level is recommended.

**Deterrence**

To date, there is no way to prevent Paget disease since the cause remains unknown. For family members of a patient with Paget disease, some physicians do recommend monitoring levels of alkaline phosphatase levels every 2Â years. If the levels are within the normal range, then imaging of the bone may also be performed.

**Guidelines Summary**

Current endocrine guidelines for Paget disease:

- Obtain plain x-rays of the affected body part.

- Determine the extent of bone involvement with a radionuclide scan.

- Measure levels of serum alkaline phosphatase to evaluate bone formation/resorption amd also assess response to treatment or follow untreated patients.

- Patients at risk for complications like fracture should be started on bisphosphonates with Alendronate 40mg daily being the first choice in the oral category.

- Another easy option is a single 5 mg dose of intravenous zoledronate if there are no contraindications.

- If a patient has normal alkaline phosphatase levels, monitor disease with a specific marker for bone formation.

- One can follow patients with serial bone scans to assess the disease if bone markers are all normal.

- Use of bisphosphonates is effective in slowing down the progression of the disease or the hearing loss.

- If patients with Paget disease need surgery, should consider pre-treatment with bisphosphonates.
