Amniotomy is easily performed with the use of specially designed hooks intended to grab and tear the amniotic membrane. The two most commonly used devicesÂ are an approximately 10-inch rod with a hook on the end of the rod or a finger cot with a hook on the end of the cot. With either device, the practitioner first assesses cervical dilation through the performance of a sterile digital exam. At the same time, assessment of the fetal presenting part is made, ensuring that the presenting part is, in fact, the fetal head and assessing that the fetal head is well engaged in the pelvis. After confirmation of both fetal presentation and engagement, the practitioner can proceed with artificial rupture of membranes.
