The placement of an intrathecal catheter is a minimally invasive procedure aimed at releasing drugs directly into the subarachnoid space for the control of pain in cancer and non-cancer conditions, and for managing severe spasticity in adults and children. This activity illustrates the procedure of intrathecal catheter positioning, reviews the indications, contraindications, activity, adverse events, and other key elements of intrathecal catheter therapy, and highlights the role of the an interprofessional team in managing patients who undergo this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures, indications, and contraindications of intrathecal catheter positioning.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to intrathecal catheter positioning.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and clinical significance of intrathecal catheter positioning.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance intrathecal catheter positioning and improve outcomes.
