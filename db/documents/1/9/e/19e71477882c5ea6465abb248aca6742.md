The dive reflex is a vast physiologic process, but its main mechanisms involve peripheral receptors, neuronal pathways, and chemoreceptors.  Once a mammal holds it's breath and submerges under water two things occur: the face gets wet and the oxygen content in the lungs becomes fixed.  When mammals dive under water, sensory information from the nasal region is relayed to the brainstem, making up the afferent tract of the diving reflex neural pathway.

The neuronal pathways previously described are not the only mechanism associated with the diving response, chemoreceptors in the carotid bodies and aorta also play a role in the active physiologic changes as well.  The carotid bodies sense regulation of partial pressure of oxygen in the lungs.  When oxygen drops below a certain threshold, the carotid bodies send out an afferent signal to the brainstem that travels on the glossopharyngeal nerve.  The resultant efferent signal from the brainstem travels on a number of sympathetic nerves that cause a marked increase in peripheral vasoconstriction that further save blood for vital organs including the brain and heart.  A synergistic relationship exists in the human body to properly activate and achieve the dive reflex.  The overarching goal of the detailed mechanism previously explained is to conserve oxygen while maintaining homeostasis within the body that is suitable for sustaining life.
