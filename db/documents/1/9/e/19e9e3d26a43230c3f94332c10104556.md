Psoriasis is prevalent worldwide with a global prevalence of 1% to 8%. It begins in childhood in approximately one-third of cases. An increase in the prevalence of childhood psoriasis has been reported in recent years.

Psoriasis affects both genders equally. The disorder first appears in individuals between ages 15-22 and then a second peak occurs in individuals aged between 55-70 years. Overall, the disorder appears a few years earlier in females compared to males. Psoriasis is much more common in Caucasians but low rates have been reported in Africans and the Japanese.
