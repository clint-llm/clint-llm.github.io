Computed tomography (CT) is the most commonly used imaging technique that can diagnose PI in combination with appropriate clinical context. CT findings associated with pulmonary infarction include a feeding vessel or "vessel sign," central lucency, and a semicircular shape. The finding of air bronchograms made the presence of a PI less likely.

An x-ray image may be the first clue toward a diagnosis of pulmonary infarction. A "Hampton’s hump" (wedge-shaped consolidation at the lung periphery), Westermark’s sign (radiographic oligemia or increased lucency), and Fleischer sign (prominent pulmonary artery) are specific findings but lack sensitivity to be diagnostically sufficient. It has been quoted that a Hamptom hump had a sensitivity and specificity of 22% and 82% respectively.

In patients suspected of having infective endocarditis, consider that a pulmonary embolism or pulmonary infarction is a minor criterion in Duke's Criteria for Infective Carditis with a reported incidence ranging from 13% to 49%.
