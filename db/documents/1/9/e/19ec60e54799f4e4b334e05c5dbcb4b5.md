Parents of children with cleft hand deformities should seek treatment from a pediatric orthopedic specialist to determine the most appropriate treatment. Surgical intervention has cosmetic benefits, and in some cases, a functional benefit. Correction may be difficult and should be individualized for each patient, but children with a cleft hand deformity frequently lead normal lives with little or no functional limitations when managed appropriately.
