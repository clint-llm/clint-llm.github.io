Cerebral ischemia is a common mechanism of acute brain injury that results from impaired blood flow to the brain. Cerebral ischemia represents a medical emergency; if untreated, it can result in cerebral infarctions or global hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, which can result in death or permanent disability. This activity reviews the etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, and treatment of cerebral ischemia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of cerebral ischemia.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation for a patient with suspected cerebral iscemia.
- Summarize the management options available for cerebral ischemia.
