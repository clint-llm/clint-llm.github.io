The tibialis anterior tendon (TAT) can have varying insertion patterns. Instead of 1 tendon inserting onto the medial cuneiform and the base of the first metatarsal, the tendon can split into two bands that insert each individually. The width of these bands can be equal, or they can differ; for example, the TAT can have a wide insertion on the medial cuneiform but only a fine band of insertion at the base of the first metatarsal. It is also possible for the tendon to insert at only one of the two sites: the medial cuneiform or the base of the first metatarsal.

The muscle might also insert somewhere different altogether. For example, a deep portion of the muscle can insert more proximally into the talus. Conversely, the tendon may extend further and insert into the head of the first metatarsal or the base of the first phalanx.
