Flea bites are common in North America, especially in outdoor or unkempt conditions. Improving the interprofessional team's skills to educate patients on the prevention of flea bites, as well as increasing practitioners' knowledge on how to evaluate and treat flea bites will lead to better patient outcomes and decrease the incidence of diseases that use fleas as their transmission vector. This activity reviews the prevention, presentation, epidemiology, and management of flea bites. It also reviews diseases transmitted by fleas and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with flea bites.
