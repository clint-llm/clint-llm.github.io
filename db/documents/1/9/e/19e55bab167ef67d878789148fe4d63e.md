TxA2 is involved in multiple biological processes via its cell surface receptor, termed the TP. The TP is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) expressed in a variety of tissues and cells including platelets, vasculature (smooth muscle and endothelial cells), lungs, kidneys, heart, thymus, and spleen. There are two highly related isoforms of the TP (alpha and beta) that arise through differential mRNA splicing, a characteristic that is exclusive to the human receptor.
