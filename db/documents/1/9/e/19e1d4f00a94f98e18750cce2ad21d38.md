In individuals without any predisposing factors, atlantoaxial instability is extremely rare. Radiographic atlantoaxial instability is seen in up to 30% of patients with Down syndrome (DS), but only 1% of patients with DS have symptomatic atlantoaxial instability. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are also susceptible to cervical spinal instability and atlantoaxial instability. Ranges of 25% to 80% have been seen, and newer disease-modifying RA drugs may change the course of the disease and decrease the incidence of atlantoaxial instability. Atlantoaxial instability can occur equally in both genders and present at any age. A high risk of atlantoaxial instability is present in patients with Down syndrome and older patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
