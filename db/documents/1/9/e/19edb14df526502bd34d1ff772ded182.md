Abrasions can occur at any time of life, with no particular propensity for any age or sex. Abrasions are primarily accidental throughout all phases of life. Abrasions caused by intentional injuries are found more frequently in the middle age groups as compared to the extremes of ages. Intentional injuries of a sexual nature that are associated with sexual offenses are found to be more common in females. Unintentional abrasions are frequently associated with falls and sports-related injuries among children and with falls in older patients.

Abrasions are the most common form of injury in children accounting for 70.7% of all injuries. The head and torso are the most common sites, comprising 50% of all abrasions. The upper limbs account for 15.4%, and the lower limbs for 34.6% of all abrasions.
