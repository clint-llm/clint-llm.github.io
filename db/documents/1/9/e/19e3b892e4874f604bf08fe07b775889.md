Before starting antiplatelet agents, the patient should undergo an assessment for bleeding risk. Advanced age, female gender, and impaired renal function are important factors to consider. The patient should be aware of the risks, benefits, and alternatives of antiplatelet agents. Monitoring is generally not required for antiplatelet medications; however, if bleeding is present, bleeding time will be helpful to determine if a platelet transfusion is needed or if the medication requires discontinuation. In life-threatening bleeding such as massive upper gastrointestinal bleed, the clinician should stop the drug as soon as possible. If the antiplatelet is an essential therapy, such as in post-coronary stenting patients, the medications should be resumed as quickly as safely possible.

The use of concomitant anticoagulants should be minimized as much as possible as it will increase the risk of bleeding by many times. Discontinuance of clopidogrel and ticagrelor should be at least five days and prasugrel at least seven days before major cardiac or non-cardiac surgery.
