Staging of tubular carcinoma of the breast is determined clinically by physical examination and imaging studies before treatment and is determined pathologically by pathologic examination of the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes after definitive surgical treatment.Â The most widely used clinical staging system for medullary breast carcinoma is the one adopted by both the International Union for Cancer Control (UICC) and the American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC). Its basis is in the TNM system (T, tumor; N, nodes; M, metastases). T, N, and M are combined to create five stages (stage 0, I, II, III and IV) that summarize information about the extent of the regional disease (tumor size, skin, or chest-wall invasion and nodal involvement) and metastasis to distant sites.
