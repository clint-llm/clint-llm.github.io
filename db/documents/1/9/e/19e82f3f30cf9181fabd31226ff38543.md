Nurses and clinical pharmacists are often the health professionals who work at the managed care plan and conduct the utilization and quality management functions. Nurses by way of training and clinical experience are often viewed as well suited to 1) collect the clinical information required for utilization and quality management activities, and 2) help providers interpret the clinical relevance and appropriateness of the information being shared back to the practice.

To help facilitate the resolution of some of the challenges associated with managed care and how it interacts with the providers delivering the care to the patients, the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy Professional Practice Committee determined nineÂ concepts to strengthen the provider and pharmacist relationship. It will also improve patients' outcomes and mitigate the use of resources through utilization management criteria, keeping in mind patient safety with clinical decision-making through evidence-based review and providing transparent care to the patients without any roadblocks in the therapy and facilitating collaboration.
