The primary indication for inverse ratio ventilation is the management of hypoxemia refractory to other ventilation strategies, particularly in patients with hypoxemia secondary to ARDS. Conventional management of patients in ARDS consists of low volume, high PEEP ventilation. Increasing PEEP is used to increase transpulmonary pressure to improve oxygenation; however, some patients cannot tolerate the escalating PEEP or inspiratory pressures required for ventilation due to barotrauma, volume trauma, and alveolar damage. IRV is one possible alternative strategy in these circumstances. IRVÂ is often used as a rescue strategy when other oxygenation methods have been maximized.
