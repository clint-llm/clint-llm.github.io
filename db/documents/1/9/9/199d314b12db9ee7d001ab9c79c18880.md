**Stress-induced cardiomyopathy:**Any form of myocardial stress, like sepsis, and emotional and physical trauma, can lead to catecholaminergic surge, microvascular spasm, and myocardial dysfunction. This is characterized by reversible distal myocardial hypo-contractility with basal hyper-contractility in echocardiography. Its presentation is similar to acute coronary syndrome, and it isÂ a diagnosis of exclusion. Obstructive coronary artery disease needs to be ruled out by cardiac catheterization.

**LV Systolic dysfunction due to myocarditis:**Myocarditis due to viruses like Coxsackie and Parvovirus B19 can lead to transient reversible myocardial dysfunction.

**Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy:**Any tachycardia like atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, supraventricular tachycardia, and atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response can cause reversible myocardial systolic dysfunction. Myocardial function recovers after the rate is controlled.

**Peripartum cardiomyopathy:**Peripartum cardiomyopathy is defined by the development of congestive heart failure in the last month of pregnancy or within five weeks of puerperium. It is thought to be due to the hemodynamic stress of pregnancy on the heart. LV systolic function often improves with time.
