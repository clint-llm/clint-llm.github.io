Histologic analysis of fistula tissue should be sent when an atypical etiology, such an infectious or malignant etiology, is suspected. In general, tissue from anal fistula surgery is not usually sent for pathologic analysis as it does not contribute to the management unless there is an occult process. A study of 84 patients treated for anal fistula evaluated the yield of histopathological analysis in the routine assessment of tissue from anal fistula surgery found a low positive for this tissue except in the setting of a recurrent fistula or when HIV, tuberculosis or Crohn disease was suspected.
