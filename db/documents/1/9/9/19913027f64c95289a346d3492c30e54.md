The neural crest cells migrate along each side of the spinal cord in the thoracic region during the fifth week of embryonic development, forming paired cell masses called ganglia, dorsolateral to the aorta. All these segmentally organized sympathetic ganglia are bound by longitudinal nerve fibers called sympathetic trunks on each side of the vertebral bodies in a bilateral chain. Many neural crest cells displace ventrally to the aorta to form neurons in the preaortic ganglia, like the celiac and mesenteric ganglia. Other neural crest cells make up terminal ganglia in sympathetic organ plexuses near or within the organs by migrating to the heart lungs, and gastrointestinal tract regions. At the development of sympathetic trunks, sympathetic axons from the lateral horn of the spinal cord (thoracolumbar segments) migrate through the ventral root of a spinal nerve, and a white ramus communicans to a paravertebral ganglion. Here they can synapse with neurons, or they may ascend or descend to synapse at other points in the sympathetic trunk. Other presynaptic fibers move without synapsing through the paravertebral ganglia, creating the viscera's splanchnic nerves to the viscera.
