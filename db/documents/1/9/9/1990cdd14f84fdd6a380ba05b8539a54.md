The main feature of promethazine toxicity is CNS depression, tachycardia, respiratory depression, and delirium. For most overdoses, supportive care and monitoring are the treatment as there is no known antidote. Significant overdoses with profoundly depressed mental status or coma may require airway support, hemodynamic monitoring, and a higher level of care. Some studies have shown that early administration of charcoal within 2 hours may be beneficial. However, the evidence is still lacking, and further studies are necessary.

**Management of NMS**

Immediate discontinuation of promethazine, antipsychotic drugs, and other drugs is not essential to concurrent treatment. Intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring Provide treatment for concomitant serious medical problems, where specific treatments are available. There are no general recommendations or specific pharmacological treatment protocols for uncomplicated NMS. However, as reoccurrences of NMS have been reported with phenothiazines class medicines, the reintroduction of promethazine should be carefully done.
