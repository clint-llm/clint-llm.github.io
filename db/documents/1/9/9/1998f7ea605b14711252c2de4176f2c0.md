Prevalence and incidence of NTDs have varied since it was first recognized but overall has decreased with several interventional programs and increased fetal screening. In the US, the overall prevalence of spina bifida between 1999-2007 was 3.17/10,000 live births. Research shows that about 1,300 healthy babies born each year would have had NTDs if folic acid fortification was not introduced into common prenatal practice. Hispanic women seem to have a high rate of pregnancies affected by NTD. Worldwide, Hispanics have a prevalence of 3.8/10,000 live births as compared to non-Hispanic Black or African Americans which have a rate of 2.73/10,000 and non-Hispanic White with 3.09/10,000.

There is also an increased risk for recurrence associated with family history, geographic location, and severity of the defect. It has been reported that there is an increased risk of recurrence of about 3-8% after one affected pregnancy or maternal history of the defect and the risk worsens with an increasing number of affected children.
