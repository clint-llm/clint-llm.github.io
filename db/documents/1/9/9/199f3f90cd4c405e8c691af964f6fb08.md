Secondary polycythemia is a rare disease that involves the overproduction of red blood cells. The overproduction of the red cells can be due to a number of reasons ranging from genetic abnormalities to secondary to other diseases. It leads to an increased blood viscosity that is associated with many complications, including ischemic events in particular. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of secondary polycythemia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of secondary polycythemia.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation of secondary polycythemia.
- Outline management options available for secondary polycythemia.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care coordination for patients with secondary polycythemia.
