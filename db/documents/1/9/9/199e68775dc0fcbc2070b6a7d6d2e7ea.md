Management for lumbar spinal stenosis aims at reducing symptoms and improving functional status. Conservative treatment is the first-line treatment for this condition. Conservative treatment options include physical therapy, oral anti-inflammatory medications, and epidural steroid injections. Although there is no standardized physical therapy regimen, many therapists focus on stretching and strengthening the core muscles, which can lead to correction of posture and improved symptoms.

Barring emergencies such as cauda equina syndrome, surgical management for lumbar spinal stenosis is usually elective, as the goal of treatment is to improve function, rather than preventing neurologic impairment. The most frequently performed surgical procedure is a laminectomy (Wide pedicle-to-pedicle decompression).****This is usually indicated in cases of ongoing pain despite conservative measures for 3 to 6 months and where there is progressive neurologic deterioration e.g motor weakness, bowel and/or bladder dysfunction. A randomized trial has shown that there is a greater improvement of symptoms in patients undergoing laminectomy compared to the non-surgical group; however, the symptom improvement between the surgical and non-surgical groups diminishes over time.
