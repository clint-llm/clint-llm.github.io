The blood supply to the brain divides into an anterior and posterior circulation. The anterior circulation derives blood from the bilateral internal carotid arteries (ICA) and supplies blood to the majority of the cerebral hemispheres, including the frontal lobes, parietal lobes, lateral temporal lobes and anterior part of deep cerebral hemispheres. The posterior circulation derives blood from the bilateral vertebral arteries (VA). It supplies the brainstem, cerebellum, occipital lobes, medial temporal lobes and posterior part of the deep hemisphere, mainly the thalamus. The circle of Willis (CoW) is an anatomical structure that provides an anastomotic connection between the anterior and posterior circulations, providing collateral flow to affected brain regions in the event of arterial incompetency.
