The incidence of spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage is seen in about one per 10,000 people annually. Females are more commonly affected than males. Although this clinical entity is more common with older age, about 55% of patients with a SAH who present are under age 55.

Up to 10% of patients with a SAH report a history of bending over, lifting heavy objects, or performing other strenuous activities, at the onset of their symptoms.
