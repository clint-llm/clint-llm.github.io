Given the complex nature of rotator cuff tendonitis, we recommend the treatment and management be broken down into the following categories:

**Group 1: Partial-Thickness (PTT****) or Full-Thickness RC****Tears (FTTs), Asymptomatic Patient**

Patients presenting with MRI-evidence of PTTs or FTTs often present without any symptoms. The most recent American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) clinical practice guideline (CPG) summary reported the growing awareness of incidental rotator cuff  pathology revealed via shoulder MRIs in asymptomatic patient populations. Although there is evidence of increasing prevalence of rotator cuff  disease in the aging population, there is no reliable evidence that surgical intervention prevents tear propagation or the development of clinical symptoms. Thus, the committee recommended symptomatic management via nonoperative modalities alone.

**Group 2: Partial-Thickness (PTT), Symptomatic Patients**

Patients presenting with symptoms of external impingement/ subacromial impingement syndrome in the absence of FTTs are first managed with nonoperative treatment modalities. There is no agreed upon time interval when it is most appropriate to proceed with surgical intervention in this particular group of patients. The literature ranges from 3 months to 18 months. Surgical intervention should be individually tailored based on the patient’s symptoms, improvement with nonoperative modalities, and overall goals of the patient.

**Group 3: Chronic RC Tears, Symptomatic Patients**

The AAOS CPG reported a “weak” recommendation grade secondary to limited available evidence in the literature comparing rotator cuff repair (RCR) to continued nonoperative treatment modalities in this subset of patients. Certainly, the overall clinical picture must be considered, and the treatment tailored to the individual patient in each scenario.

**Nonoperative Rotator Cuff Syndrome  Treatment Modalities**

**Physical therapy (PT)**

- Physical therapy (PT) remains the mainstay of first-line treatment for RC tendonitis. Even in the setting of PTTs, patients can still be managed with PT alone.

- PT modalities include aggressive RC and periscapular stabilizer strengthening programs, as well as ROM exercises.

**Anti-inflammatory medications**

- First-line nonoperative management also includes the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs) medications in conjunction with PT modalities.

- Although the AAOS CPG reported inconclusive evidence for the use of NSAIDs, iontophoresis, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulations (TENS), and other similar therapy modalities in the presence of FTTs, the committee reported a “moderate” recommendation grade for exercises and/or NSAIDs in the presence of RCS symptoms in the absence of FTTs.

**Cortisone injections**

- For rotator cuff  tendonitis, the most utilized injection includes one into the subacromial space. Patients can experience symptomatic relief almost instantaneously after the injection is given, allowing them to participate in subsequent PT therapy sessions ideally.

**Rest/Activity modifications**

- Patients benefit from an initial period of rest from the exacerbating activity (occupation or sport), especially repetitive overhead activity and heavy lifting.

**Surgical Management**

Rotator cuff syndrome surgical techniques range from debridement, subacromial decompression (SAD), and/or acromioplasty to rotator cuff  debridement and, when indicated, rotator cuff  bursal- or articular-sided tear completion with rotator cuff repair . The latter will not be discussed in this review. Assuming no rotator cuff full-thickness tears are present, the extent of surgical management for external impingement/subacromial impingement syndrome alone includes:

**Subacromial decompression**

- Extensive debridement of the subacromial space is beneficial in patients with persistent symptoms of external impingement/subacromial impingement syndrome after at least 4 to 6 months of failed nonoperative modalities.

- Comprehensive bursectomy allows for thorough and more accurate evaluation of the bursal side of the cuff itself.

- CAL debridement is recommended in the setting of substantial CAL fraying and/or calcification, as this is considered an additional source of impingement.

- A meta-analysis of 9 studies comparing open versus arthroscopic procedures yielded equivalent surgical times, outcomes, and complication rates at 1-year follow-up; the arthroscopic cohort returned to work quicker compared to the open cohort.

**Acromioplasty**

- Shaving the undersurface of the acromion, especially in the setting of significant spurring, improves the environment surrounding the cuff and allows additional clearance distance between the acromion and cuff itself throughout mid-arc and terminal range of motion and impingement positions.

- In the case of hooked acromion morphologies, care is taken to debride this area with a shaver, burr, or rasp to flatten the undersurface.

- The anterior extent of the acromioplasty is demarcated by the anterior deltoid origin. This area should be respected in the debridement process. The anteroinferior region of the acromion is a common site of spurring and causes impingement symptoms in these patients.

**Os Acromiale**

- In the case of persistent symptoms, a two-stage procedure is often utilized. First, the os acromiale is fused using bone grafting techniques, followed by a formal acromioplasty after healing is achieved.
