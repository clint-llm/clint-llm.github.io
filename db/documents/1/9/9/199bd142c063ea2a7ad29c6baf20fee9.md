Lactase enzyme deficiency can occur in individuals with lower levels of this enzyme, resulting in failure to hydrolyze lactose into absorbable glucose and galactose components. There are four leading causes of lactase deficiency.

**Primary LactaseÂ Deficiency**

It is the most common cause of lactase deficiency, also known as lactase non-persistence. There is a gradual decline in lactase enzyme activity with increasing age. Enzyme activity begins to decline in infancy, and symptoms manifest in adolescence or early adulthood. More recently, it has been observed that lactase non-persistence is of the ancestral form (normal Mendelian inheritance), and lactase persistence is secondary to mutation.

**Secondary Lactase Deficiency**

Due to several infectious, inflammatory, or other diseases, injury to intestinal mucosa can cause secondary lactase deficiency.

- Gastroenteritis

- Celiac disease

- Crohn disease

- Ulcerative colitis

- Chemotherapy

- Antibiotics

**Congenital Lactase Deficiency**

There is a decrease or absence of lactase enzyme activity since birth due to autosomal recessive inheritance.

**Developmental Lactase Deficiency**

It is seen in premature infants born at 28 to 37 weeks of gestation.
