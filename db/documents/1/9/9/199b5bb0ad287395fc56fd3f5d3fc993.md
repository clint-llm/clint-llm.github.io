Scarlet fever is best managed by an interprofessional team. The key to treatment is patient education. The pharmacist should emphasize to the patient that full recovery occurs when antibiotic compliance is complete. In addition, the nurse should educate the patient on hand and personal hygiene to prevent transmission of the bacteria to others. Patients should be educated about the skin infection and the general exfoliation, and when to seek medical assistance. The skin symptoms are frequently relieved with the use of emollients and oral antihistamines.

**Outcomes**

For the majority of patients treated promptly, the outcome is excellent. Recovery is usually complete in 3-6 days but the skin symptoms may take 14-21 days to subside. In a few people, the infection can recur. In the era of antibiotics, mortality from scarlet fever is less than 1%. The morbidity of scarlet fever is most likely due to glomerulonephritis, rheumatic fever, sinusitis, and other infections. Complications, though, are rare.
