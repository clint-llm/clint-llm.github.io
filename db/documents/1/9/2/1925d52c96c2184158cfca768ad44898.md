**Tympanostomy tube otorrhea**: The most common complication of TT placement and is seen in nearly 1 in 6 (16%) of children within four weeks of surgery and 26% of children during the entire period, the tube is in place.

**Tympanostomy tube obstruction**: Occurs in about 6-12% of patients. Treatment of obstructed tympanostomy tubes is mainly empiric by manual removal of the blockage or treatment of ear drops such as 5% sodium bicarbonate, 3% hydrogen peroxide, 0.33% acetic acid, or 0.9% sodium chloride drops, with hydrogen peroxide being the least efficacious.

**Granulation tissue**: This occurs in about 4% of patients. Treat with antibiotic-steroid drops. However, if persistent, consideration for tube removal should be made to eliminate foreign body reactions.

**Premature tube extrusion**: This can occur within a few months of tube placement. Patients should be reassessed for candidacy for the replacement of tubes.

**TM perforation after TT extrusion**: occur in 1% to 6% of patients but has been reported to be as high as 10% after TT, which may require myringoplasty or a formal tympanoplasty for repair.

**Displacement into the middle ear**: This is a rare occurrence in approximately 0.5% of patients. This can be observed or removed if an inflammatory reaction occurs. The development of a perilymphatic fistula has been reported.

**Retained TT**: Defined as persistence beyond 2 to 2.5 years. Concerns regarding retained tympanostomy tubes include otorrhea, chronic perforation, granulation tissue, or the formation of cholesteatomas. Options include observation with the treatment of granulation tissue or otorrhea with topical drops as long as they are not persistent versus removing the tympanostomy tube with possible myringoplasty to prevent persistent TM perforation.

Myringosclerosis, tymapnosclerosis, and other tympanic membrane changes are common after TT placement and do not require intervention.
