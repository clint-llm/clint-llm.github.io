The incidence of PNES is unknown. However, in patients admitted to epilepsy monitoring units for unusual or intractable seizures, about 20% to 40% are diagnosed with PNES rather than epileptic seizures with extended video-EEG monitoring. In a recent study of generalized convulsive status epilepticus, 10% of patients thought to have benzodiazepine-refractory generalized convulsive status epilepticus who were given additional antiepileptic drugs after adjudicated review were found to have PNES.
