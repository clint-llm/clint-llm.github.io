Histologically, there is a mononuclear infiltrate in the renal cortex, and necrosis of arterial walls; after successful treatment, the inflammatory infiltrate clears. Graft-versus-host disease is a usual complication of an allograft; skin biopsy shows lymphocytic infiltration with vascular cuffing and basal cell degeneration. A pathologist will make a diagnosis of acute rejection based on infiltrating T cells, structural compromise of tissue anatomy that varies by the graft used, and blood vessel damage.
