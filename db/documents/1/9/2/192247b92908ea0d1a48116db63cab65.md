Complications following esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) are rare, occurring in less than 2% of patients. These could be related to sedation, endoscopy, and complications related to diagnostic or therapeutic maneuvers. The most frequent and serious complications of sedation are cardiopulmonary. Adverse events from over sedation include hypoxemia, hypoventilation, hypotension, airway obstruction, arrhythmias, and aspiration. The complications following diagnostic EGD include infection, bleeding, duodenal hematoma, and bowel perforation. The risk of bleeding following EGD with biopsy is 0.3%. Post mucosal biopsy bleeding can occur as intraluminal hemorrhage or intraluminal hematoma. A duodenal hematoma is a rare complication of EGD with an unknown incidence and seems to occur more often in children than adults. Bowel perforation occurs in less than 0.3 % of cases, and infection is rarely reported. Complications typically are identified in the first 24 hours after the procedure. Bleeding presents with hematemesis or bloody output from the gastrostomy tube. Perforation is identified due to fever, tachycardia, abdominal pain or discomfort. An abdominal x-ray should be done to reveal extra-luminal air. Conservative therapy with bowel rest and antibiotics is the typical treatment, although some patients might require surgical repair.
