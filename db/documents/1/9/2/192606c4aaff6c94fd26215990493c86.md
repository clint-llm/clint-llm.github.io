Frontal bone injuries in the adult usually occur secondary to trauma.  A 2014 retrospective study analyzing close to 4,000 cases of frontal bone fractures noted the most common etiology (about one-third of cases) were secondary to motorcycle accidents.

The management of frontal bone fractures takes into consideration the location and displacement of the fracture(s) as well as the presence or absence of any associated maxillofacial or other head injuries.  Many different surgical approaches have been described, with some common approaches making use of any pre-existing lacerations that have occurred secondary to the injury itself.  One technique utilizes the development of a bicoronal flap in approaching the fracture.  Common surgical fixation options include the use of titanium plates/screws, titanium mesh/screws, or a combination of these methods to obtain an ideal open reduction internal fixation construct.

Common postoperative complications include, but are not limited to the following:

- surgical site infection (SSI)

- supraorbital nerve paresthesia

- facial nerve paralysis (transient)
