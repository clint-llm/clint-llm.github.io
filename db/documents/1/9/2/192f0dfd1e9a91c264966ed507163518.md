**Retinoscopy**

Retinoscopy is a critical tool for measuring refractive errors.

In retinoscopy, light reflected from a mirror projected onto the eye moves according to the eye’s refractive state. Retinoscopy is used to locate the eye’s far point conjugated to the retina, with accommodation at rest. The refractive error of the eye is assessed using the neutralization technique, wherein the movement of the projected light from a preconceived distance into the eye ceases to move. The normal preconceived distance is 67 cm. In patients with myopia of >1.5 D, the reflected light from the retina moves opposite to the direction of movement of the projected light. To calculate the correct refractive error, power is added until the neutralization point is reached, and the working distance and cycloplegic correction are then subtracted (subtract 1.5 D for atropine and 1.0 D for homatropine).

In patients with myopia <1.5 D, the reflected light moves in the same direction as the streak light. Neutralization should be performed in both meridians perpendicular to each other and should be well documented. If the patient’s astigmatism is oblique, the streak light should be rotated until it falls along the line of the reflex. Dynamic retinoscopy can be performed during patient accommodation; however, it is highly inaccurate.

**Autorefractometer**

With the advent of autorefractometers, the diagnosis of myopia has become convenient and easy.

Autorefractometers objectively examine the degree of myopia with high accuracy.

Currently used machines employ the fogging method to relax accommodation. However, the accurate assessment of refractive errors in children with hyperaccommodation requires cycloplegia. Multiple studies have reported that the efficacy of autorefractometers is comparable to that of retinoscopy. Dilated retinoscopy remains the gold standard for identifying refractive errors that do not properly correspond to subjective refraction.

**Corneal Topography**

Corneal topography plays a critical role in the identification of myopia-related corneal disorders.

The mechanism of Orbscan 2 is similar to that of a camera taking a photograph from the top of an island; Orbscan 2 data are converted into a two-dimensional format through false color coding. Orbscan provides a quad map or four maps showing the anterior surface of the cornea (anterior float), the posterior surface of the cornea (posterior float), corneal thickness (pachymetric map), and corneal curvature (keratometric map). Additionally, the Orbscan instrument provides a middlebox consisting of average keratometric readings at the 3-mm and 5-mm zones of the cornea. Ten warning signs should be noted in the quad maps before performing any keratorefractive procedures. More than two red flags contraindicate any patient with myopia from undergoing laser refractive correction.

With the advent of Schiempflug technology, Orbscan devices have become obsolete.

The anterior chamber depth is critical for implanting a phakic intraocular lens (IOL) in candidates contraindicated for keratorefractive procedures. Moreover, in addition to the quad map, Pentacam has a Belin Ambrosio–enhanced ectasia display (BAD), which combines all information on the cornea into a single display. BAD compares the anterior and posterior curvature maps of the cornea with the maps generated by a computer, which are based on the peripheral curvature of the cornea (excluding the central 3 mm area) that is extrapolated to the center.

A significant difference between a patient’s cornea and the computer-generated cornea denotes a contraindication for laser refractive surgery. Similarly, a corneal thickness spatial profile and a percentage thickness increase in the cornea from the center to the periphery are created by the computer based on the pachymetric thickness from the center to the periphery; the profile line created should fall between three reference data lines. Additionally, a reference database is incorporated into the map by comparing the holistic information of the patient’s cornea with that of the normal population, which critically screens all patients with suspicious corneal abnormalities.

**Slit-lamp Examination**

Evaluation of the eye using a slit lamp provides gross information regarding the corneal thickness, anterior chamber depth, iridocorneal angle, lenticular thickness, and optic disc and macula.

The iridocorneal angle can be evaluated using the oblique slit in a preferably dark environment using corneal thickness as a reference. Gross evaluation of the central anterior chamber depth can be performed; however, Pentacam or optical biometers are necessary for quantification and screening. Lenticular assessment is the most critical component of slit-lamp examination. Progressive myopia in the older population may be caused by the cataractous transformation of the crystalline lens. Nuclear expansion of the crystalline lens helps unaided near vision in older patients, also termed “second sight.” Slit-lamp biomicroscopic evaluation of the posterior pole and optic disc can be performed using a 90-D fundoscopic lens, which is the most widely used lens in ophthalmic practice for easier evaluation of the posterior pole in undilated pupils.
