According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 10.4 million people fall ill, and 1.8 million people die from TB each year.

Historically, epidemiologic data of ocular TB has varied widely due to the lack of specific diagnostic criteria. In 1967, a study of 10,524 patients at a TB sanitarium reported an incidence of ocular TB in 1.4% of patients.
