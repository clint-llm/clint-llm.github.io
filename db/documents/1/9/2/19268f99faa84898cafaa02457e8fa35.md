The basis for a diagnosis of monilethrix is mostly upon clinical history and physical examination, and confirmation is usually by microscopy or trichoscopy.

Light microscopy of the hair reveals a beaded appearance with alternate constricted and normal segments placed about 0.7 to 1.0 mm apart.

Trichoscopy represents a simple, non-invasive, and less time-consuming method that enables the practitioner to establish the diagnosis of monilethrix by revealing markedly higher rates of anagen hair as well as a characteristic “necklace” appearance.
