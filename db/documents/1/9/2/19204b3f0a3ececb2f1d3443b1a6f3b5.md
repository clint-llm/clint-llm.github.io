Patients with Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome can expect to experience numerous complications with the progression of the disease. Several features of end-stage AHS may find their explanation with the specific neural structures affected. Blindness is attributable to damage to the occipital cortex. Ataxia is traceable to the loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Loss of central respiratory drive often leads to hypoxia and possibly placement of a tracheostomy tube. Spastic paraparesis results from damage to the cerebral cortex.  This spasticity may lead to difficulty walking, with the ultimate loss of the ability to walk. Decreased bulbar reflexes, in addition to muscle weakness, may cause dysphagia- leading patients to aspirate or become malnourished. If the dysphagia is severe, families may consider the placement of a gastrostomy tube.
