Prolactin has a significant role in the physiology of the breast,Â especially in females. A lack of prolactin secretion or excessive prolactin secretion results in clinically significant, pathologic processes. The level of prolactin hormone is imperative for normal lactational capabilities. Imbalances in prolactin levels can compromise this ability. If the levels are too low, a mother will not be able to produce milk, and if the levels are inappropriately elevated, this can lead to galactorrhea in non-breastfeeding females or males. Furthermore, disruption in the prolactin balance can have significant effects on the menstrual cycle. In females, too much prolactin leads to amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), which results from the prolactin inhibition of GnRH release. In males, however, prolactin level imbalances have different clinical implications. Too much prolactin in males results in headaches and decreased libido. The decreased libido is associated with decreased spermatogenesis as a result of elevated prolactin affecting the hypothalamus-pituitary reproductive axis.
