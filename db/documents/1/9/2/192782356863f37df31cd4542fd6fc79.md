Patients can generally receive education from their providers regarding recurrence risk following nonoperative and operative management. In general, the prognosis depends on a multitude of factors.

In 2007, the Instability Severity Index Score (ISIS) was originally described to guide orthopedic surgeons regarding the open versus arthroscopic management of shoulder instability surgical procedures.

Risk factors associated with the recurrence of instability include:

- Younger age (especially under 20 years of age)

- Male gender

- Underlying joint hyperlaxity or generalized hyperlaxity in other joints

- Level and type of sport participation

- Higher-level athletes participating in contact or overhead sports (football, rugby) have a higher risk of recurrence following both nonoperative and operative management

- History of shoulder instability, prior shoulder instability event recurrence episode(s)

- Osseous lesions

- Glenoid, humeral, and bipolar lesions in consideration

The ISIS is a 10-point scoring system based on these parameters.[64]Â  Patients should be educated to expect, in general, that fewer of the risk factors mentioned above have been shown to result in the following 5-year overall success rates (i.e., no instability recurrence):

- 94% with 1 to 2 risk factors (ISIS score less than or equal to 3)

- 85% with an ISIS score of 4 to 6 points

- 55% with an ISIS score of greater than 6 points
