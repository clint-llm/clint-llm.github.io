Lattice corneal dystrophy (LCD) is an inherited disorder of the eye characterized by the deposition of amyloid resulting in steadily progressive loss of vision. These deposits create linear, "lattice-like" opacities arising primarily in the central cornea, while the peripheral cornea is often spared. This activity will discuss lattice corneal dystrophy and its variants with regards to signs and symptoms, genetics, and pathology. It will review the evaluation of the disease, as well as methods of distinguishing its subtypes. It will cover the various treatment modalities for LCD, including indications, risks, and prognosis. Additionally, this article distinguishes between true lattice corneal dystrophies and disease processes with similar manifestations. It will cover the role of the interprofessional team in detection, diagnosis, and treatment.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of lattice corneal dystrophy.
- Explain the common physical exam findings associated with lattice corneal dystrophy.
- Summarize the various treatment modalities for lattice corneal dystrophy.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with lattice corneal dystrophy.
