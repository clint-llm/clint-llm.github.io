They appear reddish-gray, representing bands of fibrin with entrapped white blood cells (WBC) and red blood cells (RBC). Thrombi are classified into 3 major groups depending on the relative amount of platelets and RBC. Three major groups are white thrombi, characterized by a predominance of platelets; red thrombi characterized by a predominance of RBC; and mixed with features of both white and red thrombi. Thrombi may be mobile, a characteristic that has been associated with a higher embolic potential. On occasion, fresh thrombi take on a cystic appearance. This is due to a combination of factors including varying degrees of maturity of the clot and results in acoustic boundaries between relatively fresh and more organized regions.
