Scuba divers who decide to fly right after the water activity are at risk for microembolism. Thus, an interprofessional team,Â including the nurse, should advise all divers to take an 18 to 24 hour break before flying. If the diver sustained decompression sickness, then this rest period should be prolonged. On an airplane, if microembolism were to occur, the outcomes would most likely be poor.
