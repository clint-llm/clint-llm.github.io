A transthoracic echocardiogram is used to characterize the variant of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (concentric, apical, septal, or asymmetric hypertrophy).HCM patients undergoing alcohol septal ablation are selected based on the following criteria:

- Dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction with resting gradients ≥ 30 mm Hg or ≥ 50 mm Hg with provocation in the systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve and septal hypertrophy

- Patients who have severe, drug-refractory, NYHA Class III, or Class IV symptoms

- The septal wall thickness of at least 15 mm

- No significant mitral valve disease

- No indication for the cardiac surgical procedure
