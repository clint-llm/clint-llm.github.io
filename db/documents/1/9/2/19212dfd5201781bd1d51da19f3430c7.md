Physostigmine functions as a cholinergic medication by increasing the amounts of acetylcholine present at cholinergic synapses in the central and peripheral nervous systems. It accomplishes this by reversibly binding to and inactivating acetylcholinesterase. This medication inhibits the actions of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, enzymes that normally break down acetylcholine.

Nicotinic effects are those affecting striated muscle or sympathetic ganglia. Symptoms consist of cramps, fasciculations, twitching, weakness, elevated blood pressure, and tachycardia. Central nervous system effects are ataxia and convulsions, eventually leading to a coma.
