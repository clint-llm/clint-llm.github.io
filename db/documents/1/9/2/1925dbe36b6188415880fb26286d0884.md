Scaphoid fractures are the most common carpal fractures and tend to occur in younger, active individuals. They account for 2% to 7% of all fractures and 60-70% of carpal bone fractures. Scaphoid fractures are not uncommonly missed initially on clinical and radiographic examination. These injuries can be misdiagnosed initially as simple wrist sprain. This misdiagnosis can lead to increased morbidity for the patient as the risks of non-union can be high (14-50% if displaced). If left untreated, arthritis, deformity, and instability invariably develop within five years, leading to a significant disability. As these injuries often happen in young, active patients, the associated morbidity and cost implications secondary to disability are significant. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of scaphoid fractures and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the common mechanisms of injury that lead to scaphoid fractures.
- Summarize appropriate evaluation and examination procedures, including diagnostic imaging, for a suspected scaphoid fracture.
- Describe the appropriate management options for scaphoid fractures.
- Explain how careful planning and discussion among the interprofessional team members will improve outcomes for scaphoid fractures.
