There is no proven treatment effective for atrophic papulosis. Anticoagulants and medications that facilitate blood perfusion, including acetylsalicylic acid, pentoxifylline, dipyridamole, ticlopidine, and heparin, have achieved partial regression of skin lesions in single cases. Thus, they are a reasonable first-line therapeutic approach in newly diagnosed patients. Eculizumab, which decreases C5b-9 membrane attack complex deposition, improved initial cutaneous and intestinal lesions but did not hinder the development or progression of systemic disease. Subcutaneous treprostinil was successful in a case of eculizumab-resistant malignant atrophic papulosis with intestinal and cerebral manifestations. Fibrinolytic and immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine A, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, or corticosteroids have been unsuccessful.

Due to the severe and potentially life-threatening variant of the disease, annual follow-up is mandatory.
