A left ventricular aneurysm is one of the worst complications after acute myocardial infarction. The natural course leading to the formation of a ventricular aneurysm involves a full-thickness infarct that has been replaced by fibrous tissue. This inert portion cannot take part in the contraction and herniates outward during systole. Most of the LV aneurysms are asymptomatic and are found in follow-up echocardiography. However, large symptomatic LV aneurysms can cause heart failure, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. LV aneurysms are manageable through medical treatment directed towards its complications with anticoagulation, surgical resection of an aneurysm in a large aneurysm, valvular dysfunction, or worsening complications. This activity reviews the role of an interprofessional team in the diagnosis and treatment of LV aneurysms.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of a ventricular aneurysm.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of ventricular aneurysm.
- Review the management options available for the ventricular aneurysm.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to manage ventricular aneurysms and improve outcomes.
