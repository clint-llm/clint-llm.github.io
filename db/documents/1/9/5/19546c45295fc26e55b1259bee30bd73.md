The piriformis muscle is an external (or lateral) rotator of the hip along with the superior and inferior gemellus, quadratus femoris, and obturator internus, and externus. The piriformis muscle rotates the femur during the hip extension and abducts the femur during flexion of the hip. The abduction of the femur is critical during walking as it shifts the bodyweight to the opposite side, preventing one from falling.
