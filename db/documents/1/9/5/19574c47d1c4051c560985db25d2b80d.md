Many biochemical processes involving signal relays from the dermal papilla to the hair follicle occur to form lanugo hair.Â These processes result in the activation of downstream signaling pathways and the activation of transcription factors. These biochemical pathways include, but are not limited to, Wnt, Sonic Hedgehog, Notch, Ectodysplasin A, and Bone Morphogenetic Protein.
