Transluminal coronary atherectomy is performed on heavily calcified and stubborn coronary lesions otherwise not amenable to a conventional percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Cutting balloon angioplasty, orbital atherectomy, and percutaneous transluminal rotational atherectomy are the main techniques employed in plaque ablation. This procedure is not appropriate to treat severely angulated vessels or thrombus laden grafts. This activity reviews the efficacy and safety of coronary atherectomy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for transluminal extraction coronary atherectomy.
- Describe the equipment, preparation, and technique in regards to transluminal extraction coronary atherectomy.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and their clinical significance from transluminal extraction coronary atherectomy.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance transluminal extraction coronary atherectomy and improve outcomes.
