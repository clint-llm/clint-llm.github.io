Airways suctioning is indicated for multiple reasons. Most commonly, suctioning is done for the removal of secretions from the respiratory tract, but sometimes also for the removal of blood or other materials like meconium in specific cases. Airway suctioning is also performed for diagnostic purposes. For example, airway secretions may be sent for microbiological and histological review. Additionally, suctioning is performed to maintain the patency of artificial airways such as an endotracheal tube or a tracheostomy tube.
