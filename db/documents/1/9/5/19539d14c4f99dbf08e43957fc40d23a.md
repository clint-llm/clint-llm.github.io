In female patients of reproductive age, gynecological pathologies can often be mistaken for acute appendicitis. Gynecologic pathologies and acute appendicitis can both present with Rovsing’s sign, defense, elevated leukocyte count, and elevated temperature in a statistically significant number of cases. When working with this population, healthcare teams need to consider the probability of gynecological pathologies when working up a case of acute abdominal pain—doing so can improve patient outcomes and reduce patient harm.
