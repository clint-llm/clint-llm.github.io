Hurthle cell carcinomas are considered to be more aggressive and carry a higher rate of metastases and lower overall survival than follicular thyroid carcinomas in case reviews.

Older age, larger tumor size at diagnosis, extra-thyroid extension, female sex, and higher stage at diagnosis are considered poor prognostic features for Hurthle cell carcinomas.
