In any psychotic episode, regardless of etiology, there is always risk danger to self or others. These patients require admission to a safe and therapeutic medical setting. Involuntary admission criteria will vary by state/country.

Paranoia, fear, suspicion, or other symptoms of psychosis may prevent a patient from getting the help they need initially, as well as hinder their capability for medication and treatment compliance.

There are significant side effects with antipsychotic medications, which may include extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), metabolic syndrome, cardiac abnormalities, anticholinergic effects, sexual side effects, tardive dyskinesia, and many more.

Psychotic disorders can lead to significantly decreased daily functioning, along with an increased risk of suicide compared to the general population. The suicide rate in patients with schizophrenia is about 5%.
