Although POW virus infection is rare compared to other flavivirus infections, globally, cases have been steadily on the rise in endemic areas. Human infections have been primarily identified in Canada, Russia, and the United States. Within the US, most cases have occurred in New England and the Great Lakes regions, with the highest number of cases reported annually in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, and New York.

Seroprevalence studies support a much wider POW distribution across Europe and North America than previously identified by clinical case reports. In Canada and the United States, serologic surveys have shown POW from coast to coast, even extending into parts of northern Mexico.

Few contemporary epidemiologic studies have examined the seroprevalence of POW in endemic areas, but older studies suggest prevalence rates range between 1% to 6%.

Over the past decade, there have been several outbreaks of the POW virus. In 2001, a cluster of neuroinvasive cases occurred in Maine and Vermont after years of inactivity, and similar outbreaks have occurred across New England and the midwestern United States.
