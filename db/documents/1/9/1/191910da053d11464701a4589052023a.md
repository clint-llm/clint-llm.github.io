Apert syndrome is an autosomal dominant inherited craniosynostosis syndrome. Males and females are equally affected. The incidence of the disease significantly increases with paternal age and is felt to provide a selective advantage within the male spermatogonial cells. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of Apert syndrome and highlights the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of Apert syndrome.
- Review the physical features of Apert syndrome.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for Apert syndrome.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of Apert syndrome and improve outcomes.
