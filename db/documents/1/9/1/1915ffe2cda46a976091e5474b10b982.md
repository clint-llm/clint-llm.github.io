Hirschsprung disease (HD) is a congenital disorder defined by the absence of ganglion cells (GC) at the Meissner's plexus of the submucosa and Auerbach's plexus of the muscularis in the terminal rectum that extends in a variable distance proximally.

Once consideredÂ deadly, surgical treatment has reduced the disease mortality to 3% in developed countries.
