Peripheral nerves, including the sciatic nerve and its divisions, receive their blood supply from 2 sources, the extrinsic and intrinsic systems. The extrinsic system consists of contributions from nearby arteries and veins that comprise the vasa nervorum.

The intrinsic vasculature of the sciatic nerve includes arteries and veins that run longitudinally just deep to the epineurium. This vasculature connects with extrinsic vasculature at various junction points. The flow within the nerve's vasculature is highly variable and consists of many collateral networks. When comparing the branches of the sciatic nerve, the tibial portion of the sciatic nerve has a richer blood supply than the fibular branches.
