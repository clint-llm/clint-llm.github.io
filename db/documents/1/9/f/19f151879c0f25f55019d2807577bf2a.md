Penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) or optical penetrating keratoplasty (OPK) is a technique of performing full-thickness corneal transplantation where a diseased cornea is removed and replaced with a healthy and viable donor corneal button.

**History of Corneal Transplantation**

In 1813, K. Himly made a significant contribution to the field of corneal transplantation by proposing the concept of replacing a cloudy or opaque cornea from one animal with the cornea of another animal. This pioneering work in animal corneal transplantation laid the foundation for further advancements in the field of corneal surgery and transplantation.

In 1965, Troutman designed the surgical instrument and microscope in 1968. Maurice developed the first specular microscope. In 1974 came the concept of storage media, where B McCarey and H Kaufman developed the first corneal storage media. In 1985, air bubble-assisted DALK dissection was performed by Archila EA. In 1998, Melles performed the DALK and posterior lamellar keratoplasty. In 2001, Mark Terry first performed deep lamellar endothelial keratoplasty (DLEK). In 2006, Price and Gorovoy proposed the concept of Descemet's stripping endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK) and Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK). In 2006, Melles first performed the Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK).
