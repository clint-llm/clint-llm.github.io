**Route of Administration**

Sevoflurane is an inhaled halogenated anesthetic delivered via a sevoflurane-specific calibrated vaporizer attached to an anesthesia machine. Sevoflurane is delivered via the lungs as a volume percent of inspired gas. **Pharmacodynamics/Kinetics**

For sevoflurane to exert its effect, the agent must be passed from the inspired gas into the blood of the pulmonary capillaries, then circulated into the central nervous system. The onset of action of sevoflurane is determined by the inspired concentration of the agent, partition coefficients, the patient’s minute ventilation, and the patient’s pulmonary blood flow. These four factors are responsible for the speed of equilibration between the concentration gradient of sevoflurane between the alveoli, pulmonary blood flow, and the central nervous system, and therefore responsible for the speed of anesthetic induction.

**Dosing**

**Adults MAC Values for Surgical Levels of Anesthesia**

- Age 25 years: Sevoflurane in oxygen: 2.6%

- Age 40 years: Sevoflurane in oxygen: 2.1%

- Age 60 years: Sevoflurane in oxygen: 1.7%

- Age 80 years: Sevoflurane in oxygen: 1.4%

**Pediatric MAC Values for Surgical Levels of Anesthesia
**

- Newborn to 1-month-old full-term neonates: Sevoflurane in oxygen: 3.3%

- One to  younger than six months: Sevoflurane in oxygen: 3%

- Six months to younger than one year: Sevoflurane in oxygen: 2.8%

- One to younger than three years: Sevoflurane in oxygen: 2.8%

**Metabolism**

Sevoflurane undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism or renal excretion.

**Clearance**

The clearance of sevoflurane and the termination of its anesthetic effects depend on the same factors that influence the agent’s uptake.

**Factors Affecting Inhalatio****nal Sevoflurane Upta****ke and Clearance**

- The concentration of inhaled anesthetic

- Partition coefficients (blood:gas, brain:blood, tissue:blood, oil:gas)

- Patient’s minute ventilation

- Patient’s pulmonary blood flow
