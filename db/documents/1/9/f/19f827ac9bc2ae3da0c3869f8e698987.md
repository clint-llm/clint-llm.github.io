Microcystic adnexal carcinoma is a difficult diagnosis both clinically and histologically. The presenting plaque or papule has often been present for a long time before an accurate diagnosis is established with histopathologic confirmation. An accurate diagnosis depends on a proper (deep) biopsy technique prompted by a high index of suspicion.

It is sometimes critical for patients with microcystic adnexal carcinoma to be able to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that may include a dermatologist, an otolaryngologist, and sometimes even a radiologist for appropriate imaging. Nurses play an essential role in the interprofessional group by assisting with patient care and education. A pharmacist may assist by ensuring the patient is on appropriate analgesics and antibiotics during any postoperative period or assist further if chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy is used. Radiology also may play a role in determining the extent of tissue involvement, including the occasional intraorbital spread and perineural invasion. This interprofessional paradigm with open communication will utilize the best expertise of each member and help drive better outcomes. [Level 5]

Therapeutic radiology may also play a role in chemoradiotherapy or treatment of perineural invasion when needed. Following an exhaustive review of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals, dermatology guidelines have been developed to determine appropriate management based on current evidence.
