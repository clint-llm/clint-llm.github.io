Following a clinical diagnosis, supportive therapy and medical management are commonly initiated. This involves elevation of the patient’s head as a simple maneuver with the goal of decreasing venous pressure. Further management is guided by the patient’s underlying SVC syndrome etiology. For patients with thrombus related to an indwelling intravascular device, removal should be considered along with anticoagulation therapy and catheter-directed thrombolysis. Multidisciplinary treatment planning for those with obstruction due to malignancy is important as tumor type, and staging can help to guide appropriate chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Open surgical repair through bypass grafting with spiral saphenous vein, femoral vein, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft, or Dacron graft have traditionally been considered to overcome SVC obstruction. However, this is now reserved for cases in which recanalization through endovascular repair is either not possible or has previously failed. With expanding treatment options for both benign and malignant etiology, endovascular therapy is now widely considered the first-line treatment for SVC syndrome. Less invasive endovascular management can offer patients immediate relief of symptoms. Acute or subacute thrombus can be managed with catheter-based thrombolysis or thrombectomy prior to venoplasty and stent placement.
