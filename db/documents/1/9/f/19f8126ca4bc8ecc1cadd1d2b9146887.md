**Electrocardiogram**

It usually shows right ventricular hypertrophy and right axis deviation, but may have atypical features like dominant R in lead V4R, with only an rS complex in V1. These electrocardiographic abnormalities are attributable to the absence of hypertrophy of the distal right ventricular chamber.

**Echocardiography**

Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) often serves as an initial diagnostic modality, but it has been reported to be often less effective than transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), cardiac catheterization, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The diagnostic effectiveness of TTE has limitations because of the right ventricleâ€™s irregular shape, retrosternal position, and proximity to the precordium; the mid-cavitary turbulent jet on TTE can also be confused for an intracardiac shunt or high right ventricular pressure may be incorrectly assumed to represent pulmonary hypertension.

**Cardiac Catheterization**

The pressure data characteristically shows a low pressure tracing in the pulmonary artery, and the infundibular chamber, while the pressure is high (often supra systemic) in the right ventricular apex. Angiography should merit consideration if the pressure gradients cannot be evaluated by echocardiography or if the patient needs evaluation for suspected co-morbid coronary artery disease.

**Cardiac MRI**

This modality can be helpful as an adjunct to TTE and/or TEE. It is a non-invasive option that can help to confirm the presence of any associated cardiac anomalies, quantify the pressure gradient in the right ventricle, and evaluate the wall thickness of the right ventricle.
