Management of sulfur mustard poisoning is usually with an interprofessional team that includes poison control, a toxicologist, emergency department physician, nurse practitioner, internist, a burn specialist, and an internist; time is of the essence.  When exposure to sulfur mustard is suspected, immediate decontamination including removal of clothing and scrubbing with soap and water is imperative. Management is largely symptomatic treatment and supportive care.

Most patients with low-concentration cutaneous exposure will survive the injuries but may go on to have extensive scarring, as the median lethal dose (LD50) for cutaneous exposure is 100 mg/kg. Sequelae include hypopigmented areas and scars that can be disfiguring depending on the location and extent of the injury. Long-term sequelae include the development of malignancies later in life, particularly in long-term, chronic, low-concentration respiratory exposures (such as in Japanese sulfur mustard factory workers).
