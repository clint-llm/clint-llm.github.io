Deformational plagiocephaly usually corrects with frequent repositioning of the baby; however, it can produce cosmetic deformities if not treated adequately. Untreated unilateral coronal plagiocephaly may cause strabismus, astigmatism, amblyopia, and mandible malalignment.

Surgical complications after synostotic plagiocephaly correction are usually relatively few and minor and do not produce permanent sequela.
