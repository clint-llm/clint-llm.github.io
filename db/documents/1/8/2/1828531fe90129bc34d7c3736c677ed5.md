The incidence of Kohler disease is not well known, considering that not all patients with Kohler disease are symptomatic. One publication estimated Kohler disease to be present in 2% of all children. Kohler disease is five times more likely to affect males than females, and it is most commonly seen in children 4 to 7 years old.
