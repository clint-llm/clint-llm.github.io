**Signaling Pathways**

- Autophagic-lysosomal pathway

- IGF-1 pathway

- Dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC)

- Calcium-dependent proteolysis system

- Mitogen-activated protein kinases

- IL-6, JAK/STAT pathway

- Myostatin/activin pathway

- Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase.

- NF-kB-dependent pathway (including TWEAK)

- Ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP)

The multiple signaling pathways that cause muscle atrophy are interdependent. Inhibition or activation of a single pathway often causes a cascade affecting muscle protein balance.

**Reactive Oxygen Species and Oxidative Stress**

Cancer cachexia results in metabolic reprogramming of muscle and adipose tissues. Fatty acids are catabolized by cancer cells to provide energy for tumor growth. Invasion of adipose tissue by cancer cells induces the release of free fatty acids from adjacent adipocytes. Autophagy and lysosomal degradation result in muscle wasting. HSL and ATGL knockdown studies reveal that they mediate muscle degradation.

**Selective Parasitism**

There is selective parasitism by the tumor of the host. There is competition for substrates with tumors acting as nitrogen traps independent of protein intake. Given that the total tumor mass in most patients is usually less than 550 g and that patients with very small tumors can have cachexia, it is doubtful that simple competition for nitrogen is responsible for cachexia.
