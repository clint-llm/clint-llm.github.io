Since medical simulation has been well-proven to enhance the learner's baseline knowledge and skill, the development of a clinically-integrated POCUS curriculum canÂ serve to improve the learner's experience and achieve their fitness to incorporate this skill into practice.

Recent literature revealed that learners who spent time on a simulator where they could repeat tasks without the clinical pressures of scanning at the bedside responded positively to this approach.

In this regard, an approach to curriculum development of simulation-based POCUS should include establishing comprehensive learning objectives. One such objective commonly used in medical and health care education is Bloom's taxonomy of learning, which emphasizes three main categories: knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Knowledge commonly reflects the assimilation of learned information. The skills category denotes the development of psychomotor and coordinated aspects of machine and examiner interaction. Attitudes represent the combination of knowledge and skills as it relates to learner integration of the concepts into clinical decision-making and professional behavior.
