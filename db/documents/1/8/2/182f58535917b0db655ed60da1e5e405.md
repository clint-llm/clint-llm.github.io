The internal iliac artery (IIA) arises at the level of the sacroiliac joint, where the common iliac artery bifurcates into external and internal iliac branches. Branches of the internal iliac artery supply numerous structures of the pelvic wall, pelvic viscera, perineum, and gluteal region. Visceral branches of the internal iliac artery supply the urinary bladder, rectum, and urethra in both sexes. In males, the visceral branches of the IIA also serve the prostate, ductus deferens, seminal vesicles, ejaculatory ducts, whereas, in females, they serve the uterus and vagina.

Lymphatic channels run along branches of the internal iliac vessels to the internal iliac, or hypogastric, lymph nodes. These lymph nodes are nestled on and around branches of the internal iliac artery and receive lymphatic fluid from pelvic portions of the digestive tract, urinary organs, and reproductive organs. Afferent lymph vessels convey lymphatic fluid towards the internal iliac nodes, and efferent lymph vessels convey lymphatic fluid to lymphatic collectors located superior to the nodes, primarily the common iliac lymph nodes.
