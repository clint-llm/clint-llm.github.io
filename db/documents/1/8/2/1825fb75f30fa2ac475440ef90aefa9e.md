Asthma is often diagnosed based on non-specific "classic" symptoms, leading to difficulty in diagnosis. Bronchoprovocation testing provides a valuable tool to assess airway hyperreactivity, which will aid in diagnosis and management when done correctly. This activity outlines the evaluation of hyperreactive airway disease via methacholine challenge testing and guides the role of the interprofessional team in the appropriate administration of the test as well as the interpretation of test results.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications of methacholine challenge testing.
- Describe the technique of methacholine challenge testing.
- Review the clinical significance of methacholine challenge testing.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance methacholine challenge testing and improve outcomes.
