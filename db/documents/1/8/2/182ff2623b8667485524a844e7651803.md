Clinicians should keep a broad differential diagnosis when patients present with ear pain and/or ear discharge. In the pediatric population, it is important to consider otitis media with ear drainage from a ruptured tympanic membrane as part of the differential diagnosis. Since it may be difficult to differentiate OE from otitis media with perforation, if differentiation is unclear, it is prudent to treat both conditions. Other conditions that can mimic OE include:

- Acute otitis media

- Contact dermatitis of the ear canal

- Psoriasis

- Furunculosis

- Herpes zoster oticus (Ramsey Hunt syndrome)

- Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome

- Foreign body

- Carcinoma of the ear canal
