Isosorbide is relatively safe within the therapeutic range. The oral lethal dose LD50 of isosorbide is 2010 mg/kg in rats and 1771 mg/kg in mice. Lethal dose LD50 of isosorbide has not been a topic of sufficient research in the human population. The symptoms of isosorbide overdose may arise from its vasodilating property causing profound systemic hypotension, heart block with bradycardia, syncope, nausea, vomiting, increased intracranial tension (probably along with persistent throbbing headache, fever, confusion), diaphoresis, dizziness, and palpitations. There is limited clinical information available for the management of isosorbide overdose. The venous hypotension and the arterial hypovolemia of isosorbide overdose can be managed clinically by:

- Administring normal saline. However, this may be hazardous in renal failure and congestive heart failure patients.

- Passive elevation of the patient's legs to reduce the venous pooling of blood

- Invasive monitoring of central fluid volume is advised in renal failure and congestive heart failure patients.

- The usage of epinephrine and other vasoconstrictors is generally not recommended.

- The methemoglobinemia associated with isosorbide toxicity is manageable by supportive care and cessation of isosorbide. Methylene blue can work as an antidote.

There is currently no evidence of teratogenicity or carcinogenicity potential of isosorbide.
