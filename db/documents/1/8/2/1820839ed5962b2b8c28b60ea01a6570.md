Chronic exertional compartment syndrome is typically considered a rare cause of lower extremity pain, with a reported incidence rate in active patients presenting with exercise-induced leg pain to be 33%.

Waterman et al., in their retrospective study involving a military population, showed an average annual incidence of 0.49 per 1000 at-risk person-years. CECS is relatively common, especially amount young adult athletes involved in running, endurance training, soccer, field hockey, and lacrosse.

In a retrospective study, Brujin et al. looked at 1411 heterogeneous patients who had complaints of lower extremity pain and had dynamic intracompartmental pressures performed. Of the 1411 patients included in the study, 698 patients had a diagnosis of CECS.
