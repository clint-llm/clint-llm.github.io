Among all causes of short stature in children, a fifth is pathological, caused by poor nutrition, chronic diseases, known genetic causes, hormonal disorders, and treatment modalities, such as medications and radiation.

The majority (remaining four-fifths) are considered normal variants of growth and are equally divided between FSS and CDGP. In the Utah Growth Study, among 555 children with SS, around 18 percent of boys and 16 percent of girls had combined FSS and CDGP.

FSS is reported throughout the world in all races, geographical areas and occurs equally in both sexes.
