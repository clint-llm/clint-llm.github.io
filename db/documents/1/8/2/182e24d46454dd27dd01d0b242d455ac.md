Historically, a bilateral exploration was performed for the treatment of hyperparathyroidism. However, in 85% of cases of hyperparathyroidism, a single adenoma is the cause. With the advent of increasingly accurate localization studies, a minimally invasive approach to parathyroid surgery is emerging as a standard of care. This activity describes the indications, technique, contraindications of minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP) and highlights the role of the health team in the preoperative workup.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for minimally invasive parathyroidectomy.
- Review the preoperative workup of a patient undergoing minimally invasive parathyroidectomy.
- Summarize the complications of minimally invasive parathyroidectomy.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients undergoing minimally invasive parathyroidectomy.
