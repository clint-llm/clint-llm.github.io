Patients with mild protein S deficiency are prone to recurrent episodes of VTEs, including DVT. VTE induces significant morbidity and mortality. However, there is little evidence to suggest that thrombophilia related to protein S deficiency results in deteriorated prognosis for VTE. The development of recurrent thrombotic events in individuals with thrombophilia can contribute to increased morbidity. Furthermore, extended periods of anticoagulation treatment with warfarin can lead to an increased risk of bleeding.

Neonates presenting with severe protein S deficiency have a poor prognosis. Complications from frequent infusions of plasma, such as fluid overload, contribute to a high infant death rate. There is limited data regarding the long-term outcome of patients with severe congenital protein S deficiency.
