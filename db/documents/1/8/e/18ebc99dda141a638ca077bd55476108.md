Patients with PPSM will report a history of chronic use of PPS, which they may have already discontinued. If they are unable to report the use of the medication, they may also report having used a drug to help with bladder pain.

Although patients can be asymptomatic, they may also present with any of the following symptoms in order of decreasing frequency: decreased visual acuity, nyctalopia, metamorphopsia, paracentral scotoma, and delayed dark adaptation.

Regarding visual acuity, the decrease experienced by patients is typically mild, with many studies reporting an average of 20/25 unless the patchy areas of the atrophic retina coalesce into the central fovea.

Delayed dark adaptation was also studied objectively, and although many patients were found to have an increased rod intercept time, the wide variability of the results caused the test to have a low sensitivity for detecting PPSM.

Patients are not affected by decreased contrast sensitivity until late in the disease state.
