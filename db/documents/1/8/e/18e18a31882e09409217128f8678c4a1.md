Patients with craniofacial malformations require workup and treatment by an interdisciplinary team that can include craniofacial surgeons, otolaryngologists, neurosurgeons, ophthalmologists, plastic and reconstructive surgeons, speech and language pathologists, clinical dietitians, dentists, orthodontists, geneticists, and social workers. When considering craniofacial distraction osteogenesis, preoperative workup by the interprofessional team is essential to delivering desired outcomes. Nutritional status should be optimized, and expectations of the patient and family must be managed. Preoperative assessment of the patient's occlusion, cranial shape, and position of the orbits should be performed. Preoperative photographs and imaging studies (including cephalometry, nasometry, high-resolution CT scans, and MRI scans, to name a few). The imaging required will vary depending on the individual patient. High-resolution 3-D computed tomography is especially helpful prior to surgery.

Postoperatively, patients will be admitted to the hospital for several days and may require a period of intensive care immediately postoperatively, particularly those who have undergone LeFort 3 or monobloc advancement, as they require neurologic monitoring and may have lumbar drains. Many mandibular distraction patients may remain intubated during the distraction phase, and a specific airway plan should be in place in case the endotracheal tube becomes dislodged. Nurses taking care of the patients should be made aware of the daily distraction schedule, and what potential complications may arise. They should pre-medicate the patient for pain relief before each distraction activation (often 1Â to 2 times per day) and be aware of any local wound care needs for percutaneous devices. Appropriate physical, occupational, and speech therapy should be provided in the postoperative period. Creating a standardized postoperative pathway that involves the entire interprofessional team has been proven to improve patient outcomes.
