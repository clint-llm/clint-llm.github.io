Effectively identifying and ultimately treating the risk factors of SDB and UARS in patients suffering from diurnal or nocturnal symptoms require individualized therapy and effective interprofessional communication throughout the entire diagnosing process.

UARS requires an interprofessional team approach to diagnosis and management. When discussing UARS, the interprofessional communication could begin with the dental professional identifying the patient's risk factors during the dental exam, a routine visit with a primary care clinician (MD, DO, NP, or PA), or a specialist. Further, follow-up questioning is performed by the patient's healthcare provider, then a visit to the sleep medicine doctor, where if no changes in the patient's breathing and oxygen levels are detected during periods of sleep, that patient's symptoms can be managed and treated by an appropriate device such as positive airway pressure (PAP) or simple oral device, created by their dentist. Nursing staff will also be involved in patient education, demonstrating how to use any prescribed devices and serving as a contact point between various clinicians involved in the patient's care. Any team member who notes an issue or signs of therapeutic failure should document their findings in the patient's record and report it to the other team members so appropriate action can be taken. Better patient outcomes are achievable with interprofessional team-based care coordination and open communication. [Level 5]
