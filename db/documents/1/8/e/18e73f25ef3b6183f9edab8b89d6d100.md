MAC often may be clinically indistinguishable from other skin-colored growths on the head and neck. MAC may have perineural spread where patients can complain of numbness, tingling, pain, burning, and itching sensations. The key to

diagnosis is taking an appropriate pathology specimen is needed, and the key to diagnosis. The tumor largely lies within the deep dermis. A superficial biopsy can lead to an incorrect diagnosis. If MAC is suspected, avoid a superficial shave biopsy.

An incisional biopsy is recommended in the evaluation. However, punch biopsies and excisional biopsies are options in evaluation.

**Full Skin Examination**

- If a biopsy results in a diagnosis of MAC, a full-body skin examination should take place.

**Lymph Nodes**

- Lymph node examination should be performed to assess for regional metastases, albeit rare.

- Fine needle aspiration (FNA) or excisional biopsy of enlarged lymph nodes should be performed if detected on examination.

**Imaging**

Consider the need for imaging (CT or MRI) or fat-suppression MRI protocol for perineural invasion or intraorbital tumors.

**Dermoscopy**

Dermoscopy does not offer a definitive diagnosis of MAC. MAC is a rare tumor, so dermoscopic findings are limited to case reports with the most characteristic finding appears to be the presence of whitish clods of variable size. These whitish clods likely representing keratinous cyst.
