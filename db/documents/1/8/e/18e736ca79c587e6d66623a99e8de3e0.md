In nearly all cases of cervical radiculopathy, the key pathophysiologic feature is inflammation. That inflammation can result from acute herniation of an adjacent cervical disc that subsequently impinges on the nerve root. The inflammation also can exacerbate degenerative changes to such a degree that osteophytes or changes associated with disc dehydration can impinge on the nerve root. It is the direct compression of the nerve root that creates the symptomatology.
