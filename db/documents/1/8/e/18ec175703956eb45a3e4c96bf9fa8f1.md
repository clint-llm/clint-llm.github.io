**Blood Supply**

The anterior circulation of the brain derives from the bilateral ICAs, branches of the common carotid arteries (CCA). The posterior circulation derives from the bilateral VAs, branches of the subclavian arteries.

**Lymphatics**

There is no evidence to date supporting the existence of conventional lymphatic vessels within the central nervous system (CNS). Recent research, however, has described functional lymphatic vessels in the dural sinuses of the CNS and a perivascular network of glial cells (the glymphatic network) that acts to eliminate waste and distribute molecules throughout the brain.
