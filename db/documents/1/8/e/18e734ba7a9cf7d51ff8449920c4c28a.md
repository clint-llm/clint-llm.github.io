The route of exposure determines the toxicokinetics of sulfur mustard. Sulfur mustard can be found in all solid organs andÂ in the blood after absorption from significant exposure. It has the highest concentration in fat and lipophilic organs and is excreted through the liver and kidneys. The metabolite of sulfur mustard, thiodiglycol, can be detected in urine for two weeks after significant exposures.
