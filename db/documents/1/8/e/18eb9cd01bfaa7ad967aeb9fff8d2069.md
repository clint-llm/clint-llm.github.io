Clinicians use external fixation in orthopedic trauma, pediatric orthopedics, and plastic surgery for an array of different pathology. Below are a few of the indications for external fixation devices:

- Unstable pelvic ring injuries

- Comminuted periarticular fractures such as pilon, distal femur, tibial plateau, elbow, and distal radius fractures

- Fractures with large amounts of soft tissue swelling

- Fractures in a patient that is hemodynamically unstable or cannot undergo an open procedure

- Comminuted long bone fractures

- Fractures with significant bone loss

- Open fractures with soft tissue loss

- Limb deformity and limb lengthening

- Osteomyelitis with bone loss

- Immobilization of joint after soft tissue flap

- Arthrodesis

- Nonunion

- Malunion

- Infection

- Traction to aid in intraoperative fracture reduction
