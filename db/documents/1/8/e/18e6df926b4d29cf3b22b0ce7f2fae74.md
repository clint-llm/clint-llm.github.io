Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is a benign, self-limited condition that can present in infants of any gestational age, shortly after birth. It is caused due to delay in clearance of fetal lung fluid after birth which leads to ineffective gas exchange, respiratory distress, and tachypnea. In the nursery, it often poses a significant, diagnostic dilemma in the care of newborn babies with respiratory distress.
