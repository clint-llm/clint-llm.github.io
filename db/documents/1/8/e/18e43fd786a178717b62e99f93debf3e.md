Management of intermittent exotropia varies from observation to non-surgical or surgical intervention based on the patient's deviation, control, and complaints. A prospective observational study of 183 children between 3 and 10 years old with intermittent exotropia showed that the probability of deterioration at 3 years (constant exotropia or decline in stereopsis) was 15%.

**Non-surgical Treatment**

The aim is to encourage the use of both the eyes together by elimination of suppression), aiding recognition of double vision when eyes are misaligned, and building fusional reserves to control the exodeviation. This may be preferred in patients with small (<20prism diopter) deviations, very young patients in whom accurate measurements cannot be made, or surgical overcorrection could lead to amblyopia or loss of fixation.

- Correction of Refractive Error: Uncorrected refractive errors can impair fusion and thus lead to manifest deviations. Cycloplegic refraction should be done in all patients, and a trial of corrective lenses advised. This is particularly beneficial in myopic patients, who might regain their control with refractive correction alone.

- Orthoptics: These may be used to improve the control of the deviation. The aim is to make the patient aware of the manifest deviation. Convergence exercises are helpful in patients with a remote near the point of convergence or who demonstrate poor fusional convergence amplitudes. Active anti-suppression and diplopia awareness techniques are useful in patients with suppression.

- Overcorrecting minus lenses: This is based on the principle of stimulating accommodative convergence and thus reducing an exodeviation.

- Part-time occlusion: This is a passive anti-suppression technique, particularly useful for very young children. Alternate eye occlusion should be advised in patients with equal fixation patterns. This may result in improved control of the deviation, although long-term results are not well studied.

- Prismotherapy: The conventional approach includes the use of a base in prism to enhance bifoveal stimulation. Large amounts of prisms are often required, which might deteriorate vision quality and lead to low compliance.

**Surgical Treatment**

Indications for surgery include preservation or restoration of binocular function and cosmesis. One of the important indications for surgical intervention in intermittent exotropia is an increased frequency or duration on tropia since this indicates deteriorating fusional control. Signs of progression of intermittent exotropia include: gradual loss of fusional control noticed by the increasing frequency of manifest phase of squint, development of secondary convergence insufficiency, increase in the size of basic deviation, development of suppression, and decrease in stereo acuity.

The different surgical approaches include:

- Unilateral medial rectus muscle resection combined with a lateral rectus muscle recession

- Bilateral lateral rectus muscle recessions.

The choice of surgery depends on the surgeon’s preference. Few support bilateral symmetric surgery to avoid horizontal incomitance and prevent the palpebral fissure narrowing that can be associated with horizontal rectus muscle resections. Few authors have advocated bilateral lateral rectus recessions as superior in patients with true divergence excess intermittent exotropia. Most of the surgeons prefer operating for the largest distance deviation that can be documented repeatedly.

- Lateral Incomitance – Patients with preoperative lateral incomitance are likely to be overcorrected with surgery.

- A-and V-patterns: Intermittent exotropia may be associated with inferior or superior oblique overactions and thus A- and V-pattern. In patients with inferior oblique overaction and a significant V-pattern, the inferior oblique weakening should be considered at the time of the horizontal muscles surgery. If significant superior oblique overaction and an A-pattern is present, either an infra placement of the lateral rectus muscles or a superior oblique weakening procedure should be considered. Small vertical deviations with no significant patterns should be ignored since these vertical phorias less than 8 prism diopters usually only disappear after horizontal muscle surgery.

Botulinum toxin injection is also an option for intermittent exotropia, though not much explored. A nonrandomized, case-controlled study among children from ages 3 to 144 months with intermittent exotropia showed results similar to surgical intervention. These children received 2.5 units of Botox injection into each lateral rectus muscle. Results showed that 69% of patients were orthophoric 12 to 44 months following the Botox injection.
