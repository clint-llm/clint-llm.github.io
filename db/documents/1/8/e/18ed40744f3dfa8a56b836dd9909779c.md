Verapamil can be administered either orally (sustained release or immediate release) or intravenously. It is possible to open sustained-release verapamil capsules, and the contents are sprinkled on one tablespoon of applesauce. Patients should receive instructions to swallow immediately with a full glass of cool water. For sustained verapamil products, take with food and swallow whole (they should not be chewed or crushed). When given intravenously, verapamil administration must be over at least a two-minute timeframe.

- The maximum total dose is 20 to 30 mg.

**ACC/AHA/HRS SVT Guidelines**

- Administer 5 to 10 mg (0.075 to 0.15 mg/kg) over 2 minutes

- If the patient has no response to this dose, a second dose can be given 30 minutes after the initial dose, followed by an infusion of 0.005 mg/kg/minute.
