Protein C deficiency may be acquired or congenital. Congenital protein C deficiency results from mutations in the PROC gene. More than 160 PROC mutations have been described and may result in reduced levels of protein C (Type I) or the production of an altered protein C molecule with decreasing levels of activity (Type II).
