Advancing wavelike epitheliopathy (AWE) is a chronic or recurrent disorder characterized by well-demarcated, wavelike plaques of coarse, thickened corneal epithelium. This activity reviews the etiology, epidemiology, and pathophysiology of advancing wavelike epitheliopathy. It also summarizes current recommendations on the evaluation, treatment, and management of patients with this condition. It discusses the role of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of advancing wavelike epitheliopathy.
- Explain the common ocular exam findings associated with advancing wavelike epitheliopathy.
- Identify the treatment considerations for patients with advancing wavelike epitheliopathy.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with advancing wavelike epitheliopathy.
