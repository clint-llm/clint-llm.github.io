Prevention is critical for atheroembolic renal disease as there is no effective treatment available at present. It is useful to act in anticipation and initiate prophylaxis against further events of atheroembolization. As it is a serious complication of many invasive vascular procedures, it is recommended that excess anticoagulation, surgical procedures, and angiography be limited as much as possible in cases with severe atherosclerosis.

Patients should be made aware of their disease and its implications on different systems of the body. Should it indicate the need for dialysis in a patient, a thorough awareness program with the help of an interprofessional team should be carried out in such cases.
