There is ample evidence indicating that patients with carotid artery disease with symptoms doÂ benefit from stroke reduction after surgery. Primary care providers and nurse practitioners who encounter patients with carotid artery disease should initially refer these patients to a neurologist. If the patient is deemed to be a candidate for surgery, a vascular surgery consult is needed. Today, the rate of stroke after carotid artery surgery is less than 1% in most institutions. For patients not deemed candidates for open surgery, carotid artery stenting has also been shown to provide comparable results.
