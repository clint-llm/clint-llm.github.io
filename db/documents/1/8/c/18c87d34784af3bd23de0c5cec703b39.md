It is important to maintain a high index of suspicion for hypothyroidism since the signs and symptoms can be mild and nonspecific and different symptoms may be present in different patients. Typical features such as cold intolerance, puffiness, decreased sweating and skin changes may not be present always.

Inquire about dry skin, voice changes, hair loss, constipation, fatigue, muscle cramps, cold intolerance, sleep disturbances, menstrual cycle abnormalities, weight gain, and galactorrhea.

History of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes should also be sought.

Symptoms of depression, anxiety, psychosis, cognitive impairments such as memory loss can be present.

Patients can also present with carpal tunnel syndrome, sleep apnea, hyponatremia, hypercholesterolemia, congestive heart failure, and prolonged QT interval.

Hashimoto disease is difficult to differentiate clinically; however, some features are specific for this condition such as:

- Fullness of throat

- Fatigue

- Painless thyroid enlargement

- Episodic neck pains and/or sore throat

A careful physical examination may reveal some clues since the signs of hypothyroidism are very subtle. Physical examination may be significant for the following:

- Enlarged thyroid gland

- Weight gain

- The slowness of speech and movements

- Dry skin

- Coarse and brittle hair

- Pallor and jaundice

- Dull facial expressions

- Macroglossia

- Bradycardia

- Pericardial effusion

- Prolonged ankle reflex relaxation time

However, most of the patients have normal thyroid examinations.
