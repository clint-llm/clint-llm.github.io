Cupping therapy can generally be described as a technique that uses cups placed over the skin to create negative pressure through suction.

Cupping therapy dates back to ancient times and was used around the world. In 400 BC, Herodotus listed wet and dry cupping as a treatment for many ailments, including maldigestion, lack of appetite, and headaches.Papyrus Ebers in Ancient Egypt (1550 BC).

There are two types of cupping methods, dry and wet. Dry cupping is noninvasive with no bloodletting. Wet cupping is invasive and includes bloodletting. It is further subdivided into traditional wet cupping and Al-hijamah. Al-hijamah comes from the Arabic word hajm, which means sucking, expansion, and bloodletting.

The specific mechanism in which cupping exerts its therapeutic effect has not been identified. However, a number of theories have been proposed. One method, called Taibah, suggests wet cupping mimics an artificial kidney.

Cupping therapy has been used for centuries to treat a wide variety of health disorders. However, to improve patient outcomes, clinicians should understand that cupping therapy is not a substitute treatment for conventional therapies but a complementary therapy. Health professionals should also be aware evidence to support its use for treating most medical disorders is lacking and that some health professionals may mistake cupping bruises as evidence of abuse.
