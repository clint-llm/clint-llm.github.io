Visual acuity relies on proper refraction or bending of light passing through structures of varying densities as the light is transmitted through the cornea, aqueous humor, lens, and vitreous humor before striking the retina. The lens is the adjustable component of the refractive system: its shape is altered by the contraction or relaxation of the ciliary muscle to focus on objects that are near or far.
