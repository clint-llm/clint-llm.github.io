Any clinician (MD, DO, NP, or PA) can encourage the use of St. John's Wort as it can be found over the counter. Clinicians should be aware of its use in their patients. If a patient uses St. John's Wort, whether by clinician recommendation or self-medicating, an interprofessional healthcare team with clinicians, pharmacists, and nurses, will provide the best management strategy, where all members collaborate their efforts and operate from the same information. Often, general practitioners lack the knowledge that their patients are using this herbal supplement when they self-medicate. The pharmacist should perform a medication reconciliation to ensure no drug-drug interactions exist that may hamper therapy or create a dangerous situation for the patient. If the patient is working with a naturopath, the clinical team would be advised to ask them for specifics regarding their regimen. Other interactions with drugs, including SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, antipsychotics, and others, may lead to serotonin syndrome due to St. John WOrt's serotonergic properties.

The use of H. perforatum without knowledge by a healthcare provider increases the likelihood of harmful implications on the efficacy and safety of the supplement as the potential for dangerous drug interactions does exist, leading to possible therapeutic failure. Patients should receive counsel and monitoring when taking St. John's Wort, and interprofessional coordination is optimal to accomplish this goal. [Level 5]
