Patients with wet ARMD typically report visual distortion or blurring of central vision, especially their near vision. Other patients report metamorphopsia, micropsia, or scotoma, although some may report no symptoms or only vague vision complaints.

On examination, patients frequently have decreased best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and Amsler grid evaluation may reveal areas of central or paracentral scotoma or visual distortion. Ophthalmic examination of the anterior segment of the eye is usually normal. ARMD-related CNV has several different appearances on the dilated funduscopic exam.

- A gray-green membrane deep into the retina is usually associated with an overlying neurosensory retinal detachment.

- There may be the presence of blood, lipid, or subretinal fluid.

- RPE detachments appear clinically as dome-shaped, sharply demarcated elevations of the RPE; these may also be serous, fibrovascular, drusenoid, or hemorrhagic.

- There may be massive subretinal hemorrhage with central vision loss or, less commonly, breakthrough vitreous hemorrhage with peripheral vision loss.

- RPE tears.

- Disciform scars may be present, which may appear as white or yellow subretinal membranes with or without RPE hyperplasia.
