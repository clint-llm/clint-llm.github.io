Erythrocytes undergo many important changes and growth to become a functional cell for oxygen transportation. Erythropoiesis (RBC production and maturation) begins as a hematopoietic stem cell in the bone marrow. This cell can further differentiate into proerythroblasts and later erythroblasts (normoblasts) with the help of specific transcription factors. The enucleation process begins in the erythroblast and occurs via fragmentation and expulsion. Another supplemental theory is that nuclear fragments are a result of the separation of chromosomes during mitosis.

There are two other main mechanisms for removing nuclear fragments from red blood cells. The first is from the spleen. Its function is to remove the inclusions without destroying the cells in which they are confined, which may occur by cell fragmentation. The second process occurs while the normoblast exits the bone marrow through the endothelial pores.

With these theories in mind, one can understand why Holly-Jolly bodies are present in patients with pathologies of nuclear maturation (megaloblastic anemia), and splenic dysfunction.
