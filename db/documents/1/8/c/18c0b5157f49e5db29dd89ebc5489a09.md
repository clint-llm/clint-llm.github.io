Within the variety of FDA-approved therapeutic ultrasound procedures, there are a few similarities in protocols. All ultrasound therapies transmit their waves from a transducer to the target tissues by being placed directly on the skin through a coupling medium. The goal of the coupling medium is to conduct the waves to the target area in an efficient, predictable pattern. Various mediums have undergone testing, but hypoallergenic gels seem to produce strong transduction of waves with minimal interference.

**ESWL**

- The patient gets positioned on a fluoroscopic table

- X-rays undergo review, and the patient adjusted with fluoroscopic images to target stone within the kidney

- The patient may be given a sedative or spinal anesthesia for pain control as shockwaves can cause discomfort

- Vertical adjustments of the table are made to position the stone within the "focus" of the ultrasound wave propagation

- Bursts of shockwaves get delivered at approximately 120 shockwaves per minute

**HIFU**

- The patient is supported while lying supine, prone, or on their side on a table.

- An immobilizer is an option on tissues such as breast

- Local anesthetic (1% lidocaine, 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine) may be used for pain control

- The tissue of interest is visualized and outlined with ultrasound or MRI

- The head of the HIFU probe gets centered upon the tissue of interest

- A test dose gets delivered to the center of the tissue of interest

- If necessary, adjustments to power are made based on the depth of tissue

- Bursts of ultrasonic waves are delivered to the tissue

- Destruction of tissue (hyperechoic for U/S or thermometry for MRI) is verified with an imaging modality

- A burst of ultrasonic can continue to be delivered circumferentially around the tissue until adequate tissue destruction

**Musculoskeletal**

- The patient is positioned comfortably

- Expose skin over the area to be treated

- Turn on the ultrasound machine and set the range at 1 to 3 MHz with an intensity of 1.0W/cm

- Apply hypoallergenic gel to the skin

- Apply ultrasound to skin utilizing a stroking motion

- Ultrasound should remain moving while applied to the skin

- Treatment time should be approximately 10 minutes

- After 10 minutes of treatment, wipe skin clean of ultrasound gel

- The provider can change the frequency to affect the tissue depth. 1 MHz would treat deeper tissues, while 3 MHz would treat more superficial tissues.
