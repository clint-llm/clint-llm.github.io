Any patient presenting with an intraocular hemorrhage for the first time should always undergo detailed ocular screening to find out the root cause of the bleed. The patient should be counseled properly regarding the prognosis of intraocular hemorrhage depending on the location of the bleed. Early diagnosis, management, and follow-up visits at a timely interval depending on the location of bleed and severity of presentation are mandatory. Systemic control of diabetes, hypertension, bleeding disorders, coagulation disorders is necessary to avoid irreversible worsening of intraocular hemorrhage. Subconjunctival hemorrhage and periorbital ecchymosis have a good prognosis with almost full recovery on their own.

Cold compression might help to hasten the recovery. In the presence of hyphema or vitreous hemorrhage, sitting or semi recline position might help keep the blood inferiorly, thereby not obstructing the visual axis causing relatively less discomfort in visual acuity. Lifestyle modification should be done along with proper systemic and topical medications to halt the progression of any bleeding or coagulation disorders. Heavy weight lifting, excessive coughing, sneezing, Valsalva maneuvering, excessive stress, lack of sleep should be avoided in the presence of hemorrhage at any location in the eye. If the intraocular hemorrhage, which is hampering visual acuity, does not clear with medical management, surgical intervention becomes mandatory.
