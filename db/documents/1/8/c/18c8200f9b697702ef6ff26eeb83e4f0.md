Many types of devices are available for home oxygen use. These include concentrators, liquid systems, cylinders, and generators. The choice of an oxygen delivery system depends on the clinical status of the patient and the needed concentration of inspired oxygen and patient tolerance to the device used.

Typical routes for home oxygen therapy include:

- The low-flow nasal cannula is one option, which supplies a low flow of oxygen (1 to 6 liter per minute). For each liter per minute of oxygen flow, about 3% to 4% is added to the oxygen concentration. Oxygen delivered by nasal cannula to the nasopharynx mixes with room air. Consequently, the concentration of oxygen by nasal cannula varies depending upon the patient's respiratory rate, tidal volume, oxygen flow rate, and extent of mouth breathing.

- Simple oxygen masks used to supply a flow of oxygen rates between 6 and 10 L per minute with oxygen concentrations between 35% and 50%, and this depends on the patient's respiratory rate and the mask fit.

- Venturi masks, which allow for a fixed O2%, are available for delivery of controlled oxygen concentrations of 24% to 40%. May benefit patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure requiring LTOT.

- Other interfaces exist that allow minimal head contact but no facial contact.
