In the majority of patients, pityriasis is a self-limited condition with an excellent prognosis. However, about 2-3% of patients will experience a recurrence. The skin disorder is benign, non-contagious and does not require any special precautions. Since the majority of patients first present to their primary care provider when the skin lesions appear, it is important for the nurse, pharmacist and primary care provider to educate the patient that the condition is benign and will not last for more than 2 months. For cases that are severe, a dermatology referral should be made. The biggest morbidity is due to pigmentation changes, especially in dark-skinned individuals. However, scarring does not occur. There are reports that pityriasis during pregnancy may be associated with premature birth- but it is not known if this is just a coincidental observation. Patients should be told to avoid applying irritants to the skin and avoid tanning. The itching is mild and usually resolves with a moisturizer. Exposure to the sun may induce pigmentary changes and should be avoided.
