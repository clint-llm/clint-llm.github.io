PNIs are diagnosed through careful history taking and a thorough neurologic exam with the aid of electrophysiologic testing and imaging modalities such as ultrasound and MRI. Other conditions that will be considered differential diagnoses include those that interfere with sensory, autonomic, and motor responses. Without an identified event that would explain focal PNI, the provider must use additional tools to hone in on the etiology of the patient's deficit(s).

Muscular disease, central nervous system impairment, electrolyte abnormalities, vascular compromise, autoimmune disease, toxin exposure, and infectious causes should be considered. Notably, with the aid of electrophysiologic studies, muscular injury and inflammatory neuritis can be differentiated from focal nerve injury.Â Weeks following injury, electrophysiologic testing can differentiate between axonotmesis and neurotmesis. Serial exams with an observation of spontaneous recovery and documented mode of injury can help differentiate neurapraxia from higher-grade injuries.
