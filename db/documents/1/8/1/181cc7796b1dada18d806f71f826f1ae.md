As mentioned above, the death of one or both twins is a complication of TTTS, with the survival of one twin ranging from 15% to 70% and survival of both twins hovering around 50%. Cardiac complications can also occur in both the recipient and donor; these include atrioventricular valve insufficiency, diastolic dysfunction, and pulmonary stenosis or atresia in the recipient, and vascular changes due to increased collagen synthesis and hypertrophy of the vascular media and smooth muscle layers in the donor.

Complications also differ depending upon management. Expectant management carries the complication risk of further stage progression; this risk of progression depends upon the stage at diagnosis as most (75%) of Stage I remain stable or regress without treatment.
