Mohs micrographic surgery is a tissue-sparing, precise method of skin cancer removal named in honor of the surgeon who developed the technique, Frederick Mohs. It is a surgical approach that offers high cure rates for the treatment of a variety of skin cancers, including basal cell carcinomas (BCC) and squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). The main advantage of Mohs surgery is that it offers precise microscopic control of the entire tumor margin while maximizing conservation of healthy tissue. This activity describes the technique of Mohs surgery, its indications, contraindication and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the diagnosis of skin cancers.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the technique of Mohs surgery.
- Review the indications of Mohs surgery.
- Summarize the clinical benefits of Mohs surgery.
- Describe the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients undergoing Mohs surgery.
