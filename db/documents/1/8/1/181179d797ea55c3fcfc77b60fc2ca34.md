Triamcinolone is an FDA approved synthetic corticosteroid drug used in the treatment of various skin conditions, including atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis (e.g., poison ivy), eczema, bullous dermatitis herpetiformis,****psoriasis, lichen planus, lichen sclerosis, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, seasonal or allergic rhinitis, and numerous others.

Specific indications and dose forms include:

- Intra-articular injection for acute gouty arthritis, tenosynovitis/synovitis of osteoarthritis, epicondylitis, gouty arthritis, acute and subacute bursitis - the branched esters of triamcinolone lead to reduced solubility, allowing the agent to remain in the joint space for an extended period.

- Nasal inhalation spray for season allergic rhinitis

- Intraintravitreal ophthalmic to treat sympathetic ophthalmia, temporal arteritis, uveitis, ocular inflammation unresponsive to topical corticosteroids

- Intralesional treatment of alopecia areata, neurodermatitis, discoid lupus, lichen planus plaques and psoriatic plaques

- Oral topical for oral inflammatory and ulcerative lesions

- Systemic treatment for adrenocortical insufficiency, dermatological conditions, endocrine disorders, nephrotic syndrome, SLE, and other conditions requiring anti-inflammatory and/or immunosuppressive effects

The list above is not all-inclusive, as the indications for triamcinolone are extensive.

Although hydrocortisone is the preferred drug in treating Addison disease and secondary adrenocortical insufficiency, triamcinolone may also serve as a second-line drug. Triamcinolone is given as a prescription by clinicians and is available under several brand names as well as being a generic medication.
