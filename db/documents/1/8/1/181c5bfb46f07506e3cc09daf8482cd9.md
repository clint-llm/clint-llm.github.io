IVP is a tool in the assessment of flank and lower back pain and hematuria. It is useful in diagnosing congenital anomalies of the urinary tract, urinary calculi, enlarged prostate, neoplasms of kidney, ureter, bladder, and scars and strictures of the urinary tract.

Imaging during early bladder filling is important in patients suspected of having a pathology of the urinary bladder. Minimal osmotic diuresis due to the use of low osmolar contrast material can cause delayed filling of the bladder. The presence of contrast can lead to excessive opacification of the bladder, which makes its assessment rather difficult. The release of compression of the abdomen allows the contrast to move into the ureters.

In cases of obstruction, prone or oblique positions can help facilitate the flow of contrast material. In the prone position, the sacral ureter is dependent. The iodinated contrast, which is of higher specific gravity than the ureteral urine gravitates to this region and allows better visualization.
