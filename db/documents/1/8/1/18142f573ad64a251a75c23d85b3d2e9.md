Carcinoid tumor refers to a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor (NET) that originate commonly in the gastrointestinal tract (about 55%) or in other locations such as the lung, kidneys, or ovaries. The exception to this includes pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors which are a separate entity called PNET. The term Carcinoid is the old name of NET originating from the intestine although many physicians are still using the term. The name was derived from the word "Karzinoide" to indicate the carcinoma-like appearance. ItÂ was believed to carry no malignant potential. Our knowledge and management of NETs have significantly developed since then.
