Tumor treatment fields (TTF) are a recent addition to the arsenal in our fight against cancer and have shown promising initial results. Unlike other cancer treatment modalities, it is associated with minimal side effects. This activity reviews the mechanism of action and the role of TTF against various neoplastic conditions and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the role of TTF in the management of neoplastic conditions.
- Outline the mechanism of action of electric fields in inhibiting cell division.
- Summarize the indications and the current evidence for each of them.
- Review the contraindications and side effects of TTF observed by the interprofessional team.
