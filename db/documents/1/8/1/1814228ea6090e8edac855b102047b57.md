Although Fox-Fordyce disease is easily diagnosable by its typical clinical presentation and characteristic histopathology, certain conditions must be considerations in differential diagnoses:

- Folliculitis – erythematous papules and/or pustules; FFD does not have pustules

- Pseudofolliculitis – “ingrown hairs” - typically involving the lower shave-area of the neck in men and repeatedly waxed areas in women.

- Miliaria rubra or profunda – eccrine miliaria are vesicular or popular eruptions with occlusion of eccrine sweat glands. Unlike FFD, the above may occur in any site with eccrine glands.

- Milia – 1 to 2 mm epidermal inclusion cysts, usually on the face, usually white or yellow (used to distinguish from FFD papules)

- Granular parakeratosis – uncommon, hyperkeratotic brown-red papules that coalesce into plaques in intertriginous areas (axilla is most common). Pruritus is common.

- Syringomas – multiple 2 to 4 mm skin-colored, brown, or pink papules. Most common on periorbital skin but may occur in intertriginous areas or other areas. It may need a biopsy to distinguish it from FFD. Histology reveals small collections of epithelial cells with central ducts in the superficial dermis.

- Acanthosis nigricans – hyperpigmented velvety plaques that may have a papular appearance; occurs in intertriginous sites or skin folds, e.g., axillae or posterior neck.

- Graham-Little-Piccardi-Lasseur syndrome - characterized by lichen planopilaris and non-scarring alopecia of other parts of the body, typically axillae

- Darier's disease & Hailey-Hailey disease

- A pruritic generalized variant of Trichostasis
spinulosa - It presents with typical involvement of the face, trunk (interscapular area), and the differential is the dermoscopic finding of multiple vellus hairs bundled in a funnel-like structure.
