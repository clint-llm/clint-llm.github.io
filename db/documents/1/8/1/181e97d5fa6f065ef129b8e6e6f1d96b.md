Flea bites typically have a benign clinical course. Most patients only experience a mild local reaction called papular urticaria. This rash resolves spontaneously and is manageable with anti-histamines and anti-inflammatory medications. Secondary infections such as cellulitis and abscess are possible and should have treatment per current clinical guidelines. Fleas can be vectors for secondary infections such as Yersinia pestis and murine typhus as well as parasitic infections. The prognosis for these patients is related to the secondary infection and not the flea bite.
