Research and clinical experience have reported adverse effects of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors. These effects are primarily sexual and include erectile dysfunction, decreased ejaculatory volume, a decrease in libido, as well as gynecomastia.  Decreased DHT is partially responsible for these symptoms, but it is also the shunting of additional testosterone to estradiol that can result in the side effects mentioned. Orthostatic hypotension has also been documented in patients taking 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors.  Since dutasteride therapy is often in conjunction with tamsulosin, an alpha-1 blocker, orthostatic hypotension is more common and reported in up to 18% of patients. As a result, there are reports of orthostatic hypotension, symptoms of dizziness, and weakness.

In rare instances, side effects have failed to resolve after treatment is discontinued. This condition is a post-finasteride syndrome, and current research is underway to understand this condition further.

It is also possible that 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors are associated with decreased fertility. Studies demonstrate that this decrease in fertility is reversible upon cessation of treatment and that patients are often still able to conceive while receiving treatment with 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors.
