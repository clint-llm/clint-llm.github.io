Shaving the head of all the hair is the best way to get rid of this fungal infection. However, this option may not be acceptable to females for aesthetic reasons.

Topical antifungal agents in the form of cream or shampoos are effective; 2% ketoconazole or 2% miconazole shampoo applied once a week for three weeks is effective. Non-surfactant-based leave-on lotions are also an option. Ciclopirox (0.77%) lotion or 1 to 1.5% shampoo have also been used successfully.

Older treatments include benzoic acid compound (BPC) ointment or a 1 to 2000 solution of mercury perchloride act as antifungal preparations for application to the hair after shampooing.

Oral antifungals such as terbinafine and itraconazole have been used successfully in cases resistant to topical medications.

Topical keratolytics such as 1% salicylic acid (SA) may also be added in cases non-responsive to monotherapy with antifungal shampoos.
