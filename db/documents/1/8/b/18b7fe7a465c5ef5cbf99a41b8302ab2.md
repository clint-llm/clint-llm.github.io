The diagnostic tests for biotin deficiency are urinary 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid and biotin and the status of propionyl-CoA carboxylase in lymphocytes.

Biotinidase deficiency confirmation is done by DNA analysis, either allele-targeted methods or full-gene sequencing. Currently, all newborn screening programs in the U.S. and more than 30 other countries carry out screening for biotinidase deficiency.

Various MRI changes have been reported in individuals with biotinidase deficiency.

- Encephalopathy

- Low cerebral volume

- Ventriculomegaly

- Widened extracerebral cerebrospinal fluid spaces

A complete reversal of these findings occurred with biotin use in two patients.
