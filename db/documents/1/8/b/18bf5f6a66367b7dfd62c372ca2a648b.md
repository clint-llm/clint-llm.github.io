Surgical cutdown of the superior ophthalmic vein is typically well-tolerated. Complications include damage to orbital structures, particularly the superficial nerves and extraocular muscles. Few such complications have been reported in the literature, however. During endovascular treatment, vessel rupture with subsequent hemorrhage is possible. In one observed case of SOV rupture, no retro-orbital hematoma was noted, and the patient was successfully managed conservatively. Aggressive embolization of the cavernous sinus may lead to cranial nerve deficits.
