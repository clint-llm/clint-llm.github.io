As mentioned above, early diagnosis, timely medical management, and adequate surveillance and monitoring are imperative to decreasing both maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality associated with preeclampsia. An essential part of providing adequate patient care is patient education and identifying patient-specific barriers to receiving care. This begins with proper counseling of patients by healthcare providers regarding the definition of preeclampsia, associated “red-flag” signs and symptoms, and patient-specific factors that place the patient at high risk.

Maternal mortality associated with preeclampsia is significantly higher among low-socioeconomic and lower education populations. It is the healthcare provider's onus to understand the community to which they serve, to establish a strong rapport with patients at greatest risk of developing preeclampsia, and to identify several methods of delivering complex medical education and associated complications from non-adherence to suit the level of understanding for each patient.
