The majority of sunburns will heal on their own without any further intervention. However, patients can take the following steps to treat their sunburns:

- Avoid the sun to avoid further skin damage

- Use Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories to decrease pain

- Drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration

- Apply topical creams such as aloe vera or hydrocortisone cream while avoiding local anesthetic creams

- Cool colloidal oatmeal baths may help soothe the skin

If a patient presents with a severe sunburn that leads to large areas of blistering and massive fluid loss with electrolyte imbalances, the use of the Parkland formula for rehydration is indicated. Additionally, the patient should be transferred to a burn unit where specialty care can be provided.

- 4 mL x (body surface area %) x weight (kg) = volume of Ringer's lactate

- Administer one-half of the solution for the first 8 hours. Give the remaining half for the next 16 hours.
