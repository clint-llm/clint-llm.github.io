Fetal hemoglobin has a vital role in the transport of oxygen from maternal to fetal circulation. Oxygen transfer from the maternal circulation to the fetal circulation is made possible by HbF having a high oxygen affinity but decreased affinity to 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate relative to HbA. The HbF oxygen dissociation curve is left-shifted in comparison to HbA. The partial pressure at which HbF is half saturated with oxygen (P50) is 19 mm Hg, compared to 27 mm Hg for HbA. This value indicates that HbF has a high affinity for oxygen, giving HbF the ability to bind oxygen more readily from the maternal circulation. HbF also shows a decreased affinity for 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), a metabolic intermediate produced in tissues with high energy use (low ATP, high acid production). A higher binding affinity to 2,3-DPG causes a right shift in HbA, favoring the unloading of oxygen. 2,3-DPG is essential for proper oxygen unloading in the postnatal circulation. Another property of fetal circulation, allowing for oxygen transfer to the fetus, is fetal hematocrit. Fetal hematocrit (15g/dL) is higher than that in the mother (12g/dL), yielding a higher potential oxygen content per liter of blood. In the fetal systemic circulation, the low oxygen tension allows for proper unloading of oxygen, despite HbF's oxygen affinity. The lower oxygen tension in the fetus is important for development, particularly angiogenesis.
