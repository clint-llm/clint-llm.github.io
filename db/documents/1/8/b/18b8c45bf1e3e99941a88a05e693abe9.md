**The Joint Commission**

The Joint Commission strongly believes that completely removing dangerous medical abbreviations is a far better option than healthcare institutions undertaking secondary measures like quality control or restricting the use of only certain abbreviations. In many hospitals, many prescriptions written by clinicians have to be clarified and/or corrected by pharmacists to prevent errors. To avoid this type of recurrence, the rule should be that no prescription should have any medical abbreviations. Nurses should ask healthcare workers to rewrite orders that contain abbreviations. All interprofessional healthcare team members should be on the same page regarding the non-use of medical abbreviations.

Other remedies to counter medical abbreviation usage include education, a reward for non-usage, accountability for habitual offenders, and education. The healthcare staff who continue to use medical abbreviations need to be identified and cautioned. This applies to all clinical staff, including physicians, pharmacists, and nursing. Furthermore, the use of stickers and posters on the dangers of medical abbreviations should be posted on the chart and the nursing floors. Sometimes education may not be adequate to change the writing habits of certain healthcare professionals. In such cases, these individuals may have to be reprimanded, or their ordering privileges be suspended.****
