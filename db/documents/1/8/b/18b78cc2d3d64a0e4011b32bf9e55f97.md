The developmental milestones evolve with the child as he or she ages. It is imperative for clinicians to develop familiarity with the normative dynamic process of maturation so that delays can be promptly identified. Responsiveness to intervention is most prominent in early childhood. The later the developmental aberration is identified, the more pronounced the risk becomes for developing emotional, social, and academic dysfunction.

Delays in development can be overlooked for a multitude of reasons. Sometimes the delay is subtle and undetectable on a brief exam. Furthermore, parents may negate the existence of a perturbation and not report any abnormalities to providers. Because delays can be missed, it is important to maintain routine surveillance.

Developmental delays can be specific (present in one area), or global (present in greater than 2 areas). Children can present initially with only a specific delay but can go on to develop subsequent delays in additional areas of functioning, thus advancing to a global delay.
