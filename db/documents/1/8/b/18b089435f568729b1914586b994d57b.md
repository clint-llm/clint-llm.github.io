Arsenic can cross the placenta and is teratogenic. Arsenic demonstrates poor excretion through lactation, and studies have shown that exclusive breastfeeding decreases arsenic exposure risk to infants in pandemic regions.

Serum arsenic levels are not an effective or reliable marker for arsenic toxicity due to rapid clearance of arsenic from the bloodstream.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the World Health Organization (WHO), set the safe contaminant level of arsenic in drinking water to be less than 10 ppb (0.010mg/L)

The National Institute for Occupational Safety Health (NIOSH) recommends an exposure limit of 2 micrograms per cubic meter of air for no more than 15 minutes.
