Early lesions of anetoderma are generally asymptomatic or pruritic erythematous macules, plaques, or nodules that enlarge until they reach their final size. They may also form in an area of pathologic skin, such as in the secondary type. The lesions may be single or multiple and are configured in discrete flaccid areas of loose, wrinkled skin that may be depressed or protruding bulges above the skin.Â With palpation of the lesion, a normal ring of the skin can be felt on the perimeter, and centrally the lesion will herniate inward with pressure. The lesions do not change over time once the lesions become end-stage.
