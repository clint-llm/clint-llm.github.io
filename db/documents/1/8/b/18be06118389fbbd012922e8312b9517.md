Injuries to the PHCA are uncommon but may occur as a result of compression or disruption secondary to trauma.

- Vascular quadrangular space syndrome (vQSS) is an underdiagnosed cause of ischemia in the upper extremities of overhead throwing athletes less than 40 years old who are otherwise healthy. The mechanism of vQSS is still unclear but is thought to result from impingement of the neurovascular structures within the quadrangular space due to trauma, fibrous bands, or hypertrophy of a muscular border. Other rare causes include labral cysts, hematomas secondary to fracture, osteochondroma, lipomas, axillary schwannomas, the existence of anatomic variations and accessory muscles, and as a rare complication of thoracic surgery. Axillary nerve compression or repeated arm abduction and external rotation from overhead activities (i.e., swimming, baseball, volleyball) may also cause distraction injury of the PHCA as it courses through the quadrangular space causing dissection and aneurysm formation. Embolism may occur as a thrombus from this arterial injury travels down the arm and results in the symptomatic presentation of ischemia which includes pain, pallor, paresthesias, diminished or absent distal pulses, cyanosis, and coolness of the digits and hand. Later stages of presentation may include ischemic ulceration and gangrene. Early recognition and awareness of this syndrome among coaches and athletic trainers are essential to optimal treatment. Initial therapy involves physical therapy, physical activity modification, NSAID use, and maybe even perineural steroid injections. Surgical decompression is recommended when patients are unresponsive to conservative measures for at least 6 months and depends on the extent of damage to the PHCA. Patients with a PHCA aneurysm undergo surgical resection. Patients with a thrombus undergo PHCA ligation and division with or without thrombolysis. Last, patients who have a thrombus in their PHCA and digital emboli usually undergo thromboembolectomy. When treated early and promptly, athletes may return to baseline.

- The PHCA may also suffer disruption in the case of a proximal humeral fracture and dislocation, which can lead to a life-threatening hemorrhagic complication during surgical fixation. Obtaining earlier angiographic studies is imperative in the course of management and treatment of this condition.
