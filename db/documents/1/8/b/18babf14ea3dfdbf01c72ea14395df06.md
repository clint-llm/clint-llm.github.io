Hypopigmented conditions are mostly acquired, rarely congenital.

Congenital conditions include;

- Albinism- Autosomal recessive inheritance

- Piebaldism- Autosomal dominant inheritance

- Hypomelanosis ito (chromosomal defects)

A few of the etiologies associated with acquired hypopigmented conditions are discussed below;

- Normal aging- Idiopathic guttate melanosis (IGH)

- Environmental factors (cumulative sun exposure and microtrauma)- IGH

- Nutritional deficiencies- Kwashiorkor (a severe protein malnutrition condition), vitamin B12 deficiency, copper and iron deficiency

- Inflammatory causes- Pityriasis alba (association with atopic dermatitis)

- Vascular causes (venous congestion)- Bier's spots

- Autoimmune causes- Vitiligo, hypopigmented sarcoidosis

- Infectious causes-  1. fungal by Malassezia species- Pityriasis versicolor, 2. bacterial infection by Propionibacterium acne- Progressive macular hypomelanosis (PMH), Mycobacterium leprae - Leprosy, and Treponema pallidum - Leukoderma syphiliticum, 3. protozoal by post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis, 4. postviral exanthem- Eruptive hypomelanosis

- Chemical inflammation- Lead-based cosmetics, skin bleaching agents like hydroquinone, etc

- Post-inflammatory changes- Secondary to any cutaneous inflammatory conditions (eg., lichen striatus, atopic dermatitis), infections (eg., Tinea versicolor, Herpes Zoster, Syphilis), procedures (eg., cryotherapy, dermabrasion) and miscellaneous causes (eg., burns)

- Malignancy- Hypopigmented mycosis fungoides, the tumor of follicular infundibulum

- Inherited conditions- Ash leaf spots in tuberous sclerosis
