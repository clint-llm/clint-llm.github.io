The radial artery graft is considered the second option as a conduit after the left internal mammary graft. Multiple studies have shown better patency rate and survival with radial artery graft than saphenous vein graft.

As compared to the right internal thoracic artery, the radial artery is not associated with increased sternal wound infection. Compared to the right gastroepiploic artery and the inferior epigastric artery, radial artery graft is usable in obese and in patients with previous abdominal surgery.
