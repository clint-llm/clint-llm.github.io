HIV attaches to the CD4 molecule and CCR5 (a chemokine co-receptor); the virus' surface fuses with the cellular membrane, which allows it entry into a T-helper lymphocyte. After integration in the host genome, the HIV provirus forms and then follows transcription and viral mRNA production. HIV structural proteins are made and assembled in the host cell. Viral budding from host cells can release millions of HIV particles that can go to infect other cells.
