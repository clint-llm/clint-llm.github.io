Many patients undergo extensive testing that includes complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic profile, lipase, urinalysis, gallbladder ultrasound, and possible CT scan of abdomen and pelvis. These tests are often repeated with subsequent episodes while trying to determine a cause. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is often performed as well.

There are several sets of criteria to consider for diagnosis of CVS.

**Rome IV Criteria**

Rome IV criteria include the presence of all of the following:

- Stereotypical episodes of vomiting regarding onset (acute) and duration (less than one week)

- Three or more discrete episodes in the prior year, and two episodes in the past 6 months, occurring at least one week apart

- An absence of vomiting between episodes, but other milder symptoms can be present between cycles

The criteria should be fulfilled for the last 3 months with symptom onset at least 6 months before diagnosis.

**Supportive Criteria**

- History or family history of migraine headaches

**North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition(NASPGHAN)**

A consensus by the NASPGHAN suggests the following diagnostic criteria(all of which must be met). These recommendations apply to children and adolescents.

- At least five attacks in any interval or a minimum of three attacks during a 6 month period

- Episodic attacks of intense nausea and vomiting lasting 1 hour to 10 days and occurring at least 1 week apart

- Stereotypical pattern and symptoms in the individual patient

- Vomiting during attacks occurs at least four times per hour for at least 1 hour

- Return to baseline health between episodes

- Not attributed to another disorder
