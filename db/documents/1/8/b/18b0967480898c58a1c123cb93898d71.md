Cortisol levels are continuously monitored in the body to maintain homeostasis. Unregulated levels can be detrimental.

**Hypercortisolism**

Cushing syndrome occurs when the human body is exposed to high cortisol levels for an extended period of time. The different etiologies for Cushing syndrome can be categorized as ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent. In the ACTH-dependent subtypes, there is an excess of ACTH due to either a pituitary tumor or an ectopic source, such as a neuroendocrine tumor.

**Hypocortisolism**

Primary adrenal insufficiency, also known as Addison disease, is most commonly caused by autoimmune adrenalitis.
