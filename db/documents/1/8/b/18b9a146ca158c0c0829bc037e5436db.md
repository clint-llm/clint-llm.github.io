Adrenal hypoplasia is a condition in which there is underdevelopment or hypotrophy of the adrenal cortex due to several clinical conditions. It falls into two categories: primary adrenal hypoplasia and secondary adrenal hypoplasia. Primary adrenal hypoplasia is caused by the adrenal hypoplasia congenita (AHC) or intrinsic defect during adrenal gland development. Secondary adrenal hypoplasia results from pituitary or hypothalamic dysfunction. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of adrenal hypoplasia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of adrenal hypoplasia.
- Review the evaluation of adrenal hypoplasia.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for adrenal hypoplasia.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance adrenal hypoplasia and improve outcomes.
