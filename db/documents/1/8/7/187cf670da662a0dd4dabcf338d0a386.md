Ludwig angina is a rapidly progressive cellulitis that can quickly cause airway obstruction. Risk factors for increased mortality and complications are age older than 65, immunosuppression, diabetes, and alcohol consumption.

Due to the rarity of the condition, many emergency physicians have limited experience in managing Ludwig angina.
