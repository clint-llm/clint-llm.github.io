Once a trigger point has been identified and the overlying skin cleansed, the clinician should use their non-dominant index finger and thumb to pinch the point between their fingers and stabilize the tissue. Once stabilized, using the dominant hand, the clinician will insert the needle attached to the 5 or 10mL syringe at a 30-degree angle into the trigger point and rhythmically continue needling the area by repeatedly inserting and retracting the needle without completely withdrawing the needle from the muscle. The clinician should continue this motion in multiple directions until muscle twitching has subsided, or until the muscle feels adequately relaxed. A "crunching" or "pulling" may be felt as the clinician inserts and retracts the needle within the tense muscle; this will likely decrease throughout the treatment. If dry-needling is the method, then treatment of that point is completed once the trigger point is relaxed. If an injection is the planned intervention, then the clinician should then aspirate to ensure the needle is not in a vascular structure and then inject 0.2 to 1 mL of selected solution into the point. A direct or fanning approach may be used. If treating multiple points then repeat the above steps. There are comparable results between dry needling and injection of local lidocaine; however, it has been shown that less post-needling soreness is associated with the injection of local anesthetic.
