The field of compressed air work (CAW) includes caisson workers, tunnel workers, commercial divers, and inside observers working in multiplace hyperbaric chambers and any environment with increased atmospheric pressure.  To summarize, this field includes all workers who perform duties at increased atmospheric pressure.  This article will reference all of the workers in these varied environments as compressed air workers (CAWs).  CAWs use compressed air during tunneling jobs to prevent flooding by groundwater and/or the entrance of toxic substances such as methane gas. The CAW field has undergone significant change since tunnels and caissons were first constructed in the 1800s.
