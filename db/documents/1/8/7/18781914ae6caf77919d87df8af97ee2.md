While there are several benign causes of erythema annulare centrifugum, clinicians need to be aware that this particular skin rash is part of a paraneoplastic process. The detection of unsuspected paraneoplastic erythema annulare centrifugum is particularly crucial, since it may lead to the discovery of a previously undiagnosed underlying cancer. To improve outcomes, if one is not sure about a skin eruption, a dermatology consult should be in order.

If there is no cause identified, the primary care provider, nurse practitioner and dermatology nurse practitioner may treat the symptoms with topical steroids and/or antihistamines to relieve the itch.
