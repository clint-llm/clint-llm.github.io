ICU critically ill patients are exposed to multiple risk factors for delirium. Although some of them such as age and disease severity cannot be corrected, many of these factors can be corrected or ameliorated beforehand. For this purpose, multidisciplinary approaches must be implemented. These strategies require the involvement of nurses who play a key role in assessment and evaluation over time but also of other professional figures such as psychologists, occupational therapists, physical therapists. The aim is to design multi-component strategies that are tailored to the patient. Finally, these paths must involve non-pharmacological interventions (e.g., light cycles, presence of family members) with particular attention to often underestimated problems such as pain management and the use of sedatives in a rational way.
