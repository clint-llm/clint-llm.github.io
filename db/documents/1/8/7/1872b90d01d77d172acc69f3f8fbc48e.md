Use caution when dosing in the elderly. Additionally, there is a warning for suicidal ideations in those treated with fluoxetine, especially in the younger children and 18 to 24-year age range.

Fluoxetine is not recommended for use during pregnancy. However, depending on the scenario, treatment may be necessary during pregnancy.

Fluoxetine exposure early in pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of septal heart defects.
