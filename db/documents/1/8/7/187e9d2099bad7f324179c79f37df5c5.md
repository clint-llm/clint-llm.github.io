A process called neurulation begins at the beginning of the third week after fertilization. It starts when a region of cells overlying the ectoderm thickens and forms the neural plate. The neural plate leads to the neural tube and neural crest cells. The neural crest cells will lead to the neurons in the peripheral nervous system, including the sciatic nerve. Additionally, Schwann cells, responsible for myelination of the peripheral nervous system, are also derived from neural crest cells.
