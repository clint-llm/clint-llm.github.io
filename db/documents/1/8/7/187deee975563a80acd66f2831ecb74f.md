The hyphema due to the Amsler sign is usually mild. Active bleeding from the angle into the anterior chamber may stop spontaneously.Â In cases with continuing intraoperative hemorrhage, forming the anterior chamber with a viscosurgical device or raising the intraocular pressure usually stops the bleeding. The hyphema typically does not worsen the visual outcomes, and most cases of FHU will have mild perioperative hemorrhage after cataract surgery. Hyphema may not be present on the first postoperative day. For postoperative mild hyphema, a medication regimen of antibiotic and steroid drops are usually enough to control inflammation. In severe hyphema or severe postoperative inflammation, topical cycloplegics are necessary to prevent posterior synechia. Though posterior synechia is otherwise uncommon in FHU, postoperative inflammation can cause posterior synechia and thus requires control with both steroid and cycloplegics. Typically, the outcome of cataract surgery is good in FHU with cataract though some cases may have anterior chamber reaction, deposit over the intraocular lens (IOL), decentration of IOL, glaucoma, vitreous inflammation/haze, posterior capsular opacification, cystoid macular edema, corneal edema, and macular hole.
