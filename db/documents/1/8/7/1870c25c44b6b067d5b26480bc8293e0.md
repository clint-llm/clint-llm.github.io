The nasopharyngeal tonsil, "adenoid pad," or "the adenoids," is a grouping of lymphoid tissue located on the posterior wall of the nasopharynx at the level of the soft palate. The adenoids, along with the faucial tonsils, lingual tonsils, and tubal tonsils of Gerlach make up what is known as Waldeyer's ring, a circumferential collection of lymphoid tissue that surrounds the upper aerodigestive tract, named for Heinrich Wilhelm Gottfried von Waldeyer-Hartz, a German anatomist at the turn of the 20th century.

The adenoids are present at birth and enlarge throughout childhood, reaching peak size by age seven. In most individuals, they will regress in size during puberty and may be nearly absent by adulthood. For this reason, adenoiditis is commonly a problem in childhood and adolescence. Adenoiditis occurs when there is inflammation of the adenoid tissue resulting from infection, allergies, or irritation from stomach acid as a component of laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). Adenoiditis rarely occurs on its own and is more often involved in a more extensive disease process such as adenotonsillitis, pharyngitis, rhinosinusitis, etc. Continual irritation may lead to adenoid hypertrophy, which is responsible for many of the complications of adenoid disease, including Eustachian tube dysfunction and recurrent acute otitis media. Adenoiditis can be classified as acute or chronic.

**Clinical Anatomy**

The adenoids receive their blood supply from the ascending pharyngeal artery, maxillary artery, and facial artery. Venous drainage occurs through the pharyngeal veins. Innervation is supplied by the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves. Adenoid size is graded on a scale of zero to four:

- 0 absent

- 1+ <25% obstruction of the nasopharynx

- 2+ 25-50% obstruction

- 3+ 50-75% obstruction

- 4+ >75% obstruction
