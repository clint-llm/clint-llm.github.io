Patients should be educated about the common symptoms of primary hyperaldosteronism and be aware of the common family history findings to report to their physicians. Patients should be mindful of bringing up any early family history of hypertension or stroke in an immediate family member. When diagnosed with hyperaldosteronism, patients should understand the importance of compliance with medical therapy as this is the only treatment besides surgical intervention. Patients diagnosed with essential hypertension at a young age that have been refractory to treatment on multiple medications should mention to the primary care physicians of their compliance and provide a record of blood pressure readings as this will help their physician evaluate further causes of hypertension.
