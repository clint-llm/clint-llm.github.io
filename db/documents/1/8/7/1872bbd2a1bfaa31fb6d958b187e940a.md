Simulation research can functionally stand alone or be part of a mixed-methods design. In this way, it can support healthcare research from the bench of the simulation "wet lab" to the bedside. In the literature, it is helpful to differentiate how simulation relates to the research process: assessment of simulation efficacy as a training methodology vs simulation utilization as the investigative technique.
