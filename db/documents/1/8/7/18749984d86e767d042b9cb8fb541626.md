The main tumor suppressor gene that plays a crucial role in maintaining the cell cycle is p53, which is a transcription factor that plays a role in promoting growth arrest, DNA repair, and eventual apoptosis, or regulated death by the cell in damaging situations.

One of the major DNA repair mechanisms is called Base excision repair, which is responsible for repairing mismatched bases throughout the entire cell cycle. Additionally, p53 also regulates the expression of many inhibitory proteins likeÂ p21, GADD45. These proteins can inhibit Cdc2, which is crucial for the cell to progress through mitosis or meiosis. The protein p21 also plays a role in allowing the cell to move on from through the S phase by regulating another protein CDK2, an important kinase in DNA synthesis. Without this suppressor gene, these proteins would not be inhibited correctly, leading to cancer in the cells.

Cancer may also develop during the S phase if repair mechanisms like the ones discussed previously are not functional or if DNA polymerase loses its function to proofread mismatched pairs during the S phase, leading to unstable DNA and possible frameshift mutations result in nonfunctional regulator proteins.
