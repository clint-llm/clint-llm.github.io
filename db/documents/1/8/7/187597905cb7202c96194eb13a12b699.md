This condition is a clinical diagnosis; therefore, a thorough medical history and physical, ocular history and focused visual exam are essential. Historical inquiry of progression and risk factors can narrow the differential. There have been clinical criteria established by Defazio and Berardelli for the identification of clinical and physical exam phenomenology, with validation from expert neurologists and neuro-ophthalmologists.

If a central nervous system cause is suspected, a head computed tomographic (CT) scan or a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without contrast is performed.

Extensive serum laboratories and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, including systemic immune, autoimmune, and infectious causes, may be useful to exclude secondary causes of blepharospasm.
