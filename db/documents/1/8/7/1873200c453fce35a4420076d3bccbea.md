Bladder stones do not present any particular or specific symptoms, or there may not be any symptoms at all. They are usually associated with various types of incomplete bladder emptying problems, most commonly BPH. There may also be a combination of other urinary symptoms such as terminal hematuria, suprapubic pain, weak stream, dysuria, etc. Terminal gross hematuria with a sudden voiding stoppage is a common sign of a large bladder calculus. Various degrees of pain may be present at the tip of the penis or anywhere in the scrotum, pelvis or perineum. A distended bladder may be palpable in some cases, but the stone typically is not. Since the signs and symptoms of bladder stones are relatively vague, a definitive diagnosis is not typically made without cystoscopy or imaging.

In the past, a definitive diagnosis was sometimes made by the passage of a Van Buren sound. When contact was made with a stone in the bladder, it would produce a "sound" or click along with a transmitted vibration. This is of historical interest only and is not used anymore due to the common availability of modern imaging technology and flexible cystoscopy.
