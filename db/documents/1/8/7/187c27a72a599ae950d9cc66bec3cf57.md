Breast augmentation is a surgical procedure where the breast size is enhanced. Augmentation can be from the placement of an implant, or less commonly, thru fat transfer. Breast augmentation is one of the most commonly performed plastic surgery procedures in the United States. The FDA put a restriction on silicone filled implants for cosmetic enhancement starting in 1992. However, most reconstructive patients continued to receive silicone implants after mastectomy. This ban was due to concern over the risks of silicone implants which has now been resolved. This activity describes the indications, contraindications, and complications of breast augmentation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the pre and postoperative management of these patients.
