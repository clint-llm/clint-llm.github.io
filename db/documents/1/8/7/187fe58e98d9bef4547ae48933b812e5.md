Hypotension and anaphylaxis are known complications of immunoglobulin therapy. Hence, healthcare providers should monitor vital signs, shortness of breath, and urticaria. Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) can occur within six hours of transfusion. Monitor for clinical signs and symptoms such as hypotension, vomiting,  dyspnea, and hypoxemia, as TRALI requires immediate workup, cessation of infusion, and supportive treatment with close monitoring.
