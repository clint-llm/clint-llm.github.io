The marginal artery of Drummond is a large collateral vessel that supplies the splenic flexure of the colon and is of importance when there is occlusion of one of the major vessels supplying blood to the colon. Several disorders can affect the colon, including diverticular disease, colon cancer, bowel obstruction, lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding from polyps and AV malformations, strictures, and peristalsis.

Colonic perforation can be a rare cause of retroperitoneal abscess if the perforated portion of the colon is either the ascending or descending colon.
