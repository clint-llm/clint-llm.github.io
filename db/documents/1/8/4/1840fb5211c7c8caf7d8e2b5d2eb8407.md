Isolated fractures of the ulnar shaft are most commonly a result of either a direct blowÂ to the forearm or a hyper-pronation or hyper-supination loading injury that occurs during a fall. Therefore the prevention of nightstick fractures is best centered around providing appropriate walking aids to those with impaired mobility or at increased risk of falls.

Patients who have sustained a nightstick fracture should seek counsel from a trained orthopedist with experience in the management of upper extremity fractures to obtain appropriate radiographs and rule out any concomitant injuries that may require further intervention.
