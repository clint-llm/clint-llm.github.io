Most hospitals have policies or protocols regarding labor induction, medication administration, fetal heart rate monitoring, oral intake during IOL, pain control, maternal observations, and obstetric emergencies. As noted above, fetal heart rate should be monitored, along with the contraction pattern and adequacy of contractions if an intrauterine pressure catheter is present. Electronic medical records often have flowsheets and checklists available for nurses to record events during admission. Depending on the patient's medical history, such as a hypertensive disorder or diabetes mellitus (gestational or pregestational), the hospital may have protocols for the frequency of blood pressure or blood glucose assessments, respectively.

Patients on high-alert medications during induction, such as antihypertensives, magnesium sulfate, or insulin, may need more frequent monitoring depending on the hospital's specific protocol. Changes noted by the nurse during these assessments warrant notifying the obstetric care provider to see if further intervention is required, such as administering additional antihypertensives or administering glucose in the setting of hypoglycemia. Other monitoring during IOL may include the timing of amniotomy and theÂ color of amniotic fluid that can be crucial to inform further management.
