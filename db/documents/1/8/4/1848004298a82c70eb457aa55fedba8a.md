The most effective treatment involves complete surgical excision of the cyst with the cyst wall intact. The complete excision should be delayed if an active infection is presentÂ as the planes of dissection will be difficult. In these cases an initial incision and drainage may be indicated with a potential for reoccurrence in the future A local anesthetic with epinephrine is preferred to minimize bleeding. The anesthetic should be injected around the cyst, with avoidance of direct injection into the cyst. A small diameter elliptical incision with the inclusion of the central core, or punctum can be utilized. For optimal cosmetic results, maintaining the incision in the minimal skin tension lines is important. A multiple-layered subcuticular and epidermal closure will yield an optimal outcome. An alternative surgical approach can also be done with a punch biopsy and expulsion of the intact cyst through the small defect or standard excision. If there is surrounding inflammation, intralesional triamcinolone may be used to help decrease inflammation in addition to a delay in surgical removal. If the cyst has ruptured and the lining destroyed, the cyst will not reoccur. However, removing of the entire cystic lining is important in decreasing recurrence.
