Various labs offer 24-hour urine testing which provides clinicians a detailed laboratory report stratifying stone risk based on the laboratory data points. Typically, 24-hour urine tests for nephrolithiasis prophylaxis will include urinary volume, pH, calcium, citrate, magnesium, phosphate, sulfate, oxalate, and uric acid. Supersaturation ratios for various stone types can then be calculated. In patients with a history of cystine stones or a positive cystine cyanide test, 24-hour cystine levels can also be measured.

Finding or selecting a laboratory for processing 24-hour urine chemistries can sometimes be challenging. Optimally, all the testingÂ is done in a single laboratory, and the results are presented clearly on just 1 or 2 pages. The 24-hour totals and the relative concentrations should both be given. Be aware that "normal" values are not necessarily "optimal" values for urinary chemical constituents. Optimal urinary chemistry reference values are not reported which makes interpretation a little more complicated. Try to use a laboratory that performs a lot of 24-hour urine testing and reports all the results together. When multiple reports from several laboratories have to be combined to retrieve all the data, it is far more difficult to correlate and analyze.
