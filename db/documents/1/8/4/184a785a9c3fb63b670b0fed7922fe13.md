All though there seems to be no consensus on the treatment protocol according to the size of the tumor. Thus all patients with symptomatic tumors are advised excision or enucleation of the tumor. The conventional surgical approach has been by an open thoracotomy.  After this, an enucleation of the tumor with an esophageal myotomy or a resection of the tumor with the esophagus is performed. Esophageal resection may be indicated in giant leiomyoma of the esophagus or tumors involving long segments of the esophagus. Tumors of the middle third can be approached using a right thoracic route and tumors of the distal one-third can be accessed through a left-sided approach. The main morbidity associated with open thoracotomy approach are wound pain and atelectasis. Minimally invasive approaches or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) have progressively gained acceptance in the last few years. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery is the preferred approach for enucleation of upper two-thirds leiomyoma.
