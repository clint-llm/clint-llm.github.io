The subscapular nerve originates from branches of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus (C5 to C7) and trifurcates into the upper, middle, and lower subscapular nerves. The upper and lower subscapular nerves innervate the subscapularis muscle. The upper subscapular nerve innervates the cranial half of the muscle, while the lower subscapular nerve bifurcates into two branches, with the cranial branch innervating the caudal half of the muscle. The inferior branch of the lower subscapular nerve provides innervation to the teres major, and the middle scapular nerve, also known as the thoracodorsal nerve, innervates the latissimus dorsi muscle.
