The patient should be in a supine position, with the upper limbs supinated and the lower limbs in the neutral position. Incision lines should be marked on the patient and the area prepared and covered to maintain sterility. Structures at risk should be marked, such as the ulnar nerve at the medial epicondyle of the humerus and common peroneal nerve at the neck of the fibula, so that extra care can be taken to avoid damage to deep structures.
