Lanugo plays an essential role in binding the vernix caseosa to the skin of fetuses. Vernix caseosa is the viscous white covering on newborns that protects their skin, prevents water loss, plays an important role in thermoregulation, and contributes to innate immunity. It protects the fetus from damaging substances found in amniotic fluid, most notably urea and electrolytes.

After removal of the vernix, small amounts of lanugo can temporarily remain on the neonate. Lanugo can thus be present on the neonate for the first few weeks of life. Its presence can, however, indicate premature birth in a minority of cases. When present in an adult, lanugo can be a sign of serious underlying disease states. These include, most notably, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, various forms of malnutrition, and the presence of a teratoma.
