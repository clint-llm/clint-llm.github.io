Complications of silicosis are represented by:

- Progressive massive fibrosis

- Tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacteriosis: they should be suspected clinically when there is rapid enlargement of small nodules or when nodules undergo cavitation.

There are reports of an increased incidence of scleroderma in patientsÂ who suffer chronic exposure to silica but this phenomenon remains unexplained. Reports of acute glomerulonephritis are also in the literature.
