“Cuboid syndrome” is a condition that involves disruption or subluxation of the calcaneocuboid joint; this occurs as a result of overuse, excessive pronation, and/or ankle sprains. Disruption of the CC joint leads to an abnormal cuboid position, which can irritate surrounding ligaments, the joint capsule, and peroneus longus tendon. Symptoms of the cuboid syndrome are similar to symptoms found in a ligament sprain. These include lateral foot pain, swelling, ecchymosis, and/or erythema. Patients may also have limited active and passive range of motion of their foot and/or ankle. Diagnosis of cuboid syndrome is clinical, and other pathologies such as fractures should be ruled out. Treatment is conservative and includes cuboid manipulation techniques, physical therapy, and cuboid padding.

Cuboid fractures are rare due to the anatomy and protected location in the midfoot. They can occur with forced plantar flexion and abduction of the foot, and usually, are seen in combination with other foot fractures and dislocations. Cuboid fractures can be the result of a direct impact injury such as a heavy object falling on the dorsum of the foot, or an avulsion injury involving any of the cuboid’s ligamentous attachments. An isolated cuboid fracture, also known as a “nutcracker fracture,” can occur when severe abduction of the forefoot compresses the cuboid between the anterior surface of the calcaneus and the base of the fourth and fifth metatarsals. Patients will complain of indistinct pain in the area of the cuboid, and often present with swelling and ecchymosis. The diagnosis of cuboid fractures begins with plain radiographs. CT scans and MRIs are options if further detail about the fracture is needed. Cuboid fractures get classified into three main groups depending on location and complexity as per the Orthopedic Trauma Association. Treatment depends on fracture type and extent.
