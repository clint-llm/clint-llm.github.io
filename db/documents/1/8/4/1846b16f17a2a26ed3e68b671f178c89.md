The overall prognosis depends on the cause of the glossitis. While generally a benign condition, it can be chronic or lifelong with periodic flare-ups (i.e., geographic tongue). Some patients are extremely sensitive to and bothered by the visual appearance and/or physical symptoms. Anxiolytics can be employed. Many causes of glossitis are reversible with treatment of the underlying condition. If there is any question of malignancy, the area should be promptly biopsied not to delay treatment.
