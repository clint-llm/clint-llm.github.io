Withdrawal from drugs and alcohol is a common medical problem. According to data from the National epidemiologic survey on alcohol and related conditions, the estimated lifetime prevalence of alcohol use disorder was 12.8% and 4.8% annually.

As many as 5% of these patients may develop delirium tremens (DT) when they withdraw from chronic alcohol use. **The number of people addicted to opioids, sedatives, and stimulants is not known.**Though benzodiazepine withdrawal is a medical emergency due to the onset of withdrawal seizures, benzodiazepine intoxication is relatively benign. Opiate withdrawal is uncomfortable, but fatalities are rare. Withdrawal from cocaine and amphetamine results in sedation and a state resembling adrenergic blockade, death is rare.
