The action of endogenous opioids is regulated by their action onÂ the specific opioid receptor. Three major classes of opioid receptors have been identified. Three major categories of opioid receptors have been identified and cloned: mu-opioid receptor (MOR), kappa-opioid receptor (KOR), and delta-opioid receptor (DOR), with differences in affinity and selectivity to endogenous peptides.

- Pain modulation: This is one of their major effects, and studies have shown that the levels of beta-endorphins rise after oral, gynecologic, and abdominal surgeries.

- Neuroprotection: Research has shown that activation of DOR increases the pro-survival signals and decreases oxidative injury in neurons.

- Respiratory depression: The degree of respiratory depression depends on the stimulated receptor. MOR produces a significant decrease in the respiratory rate than DOR and KOR.

- Ionic homeostasis: Activation of DOR decreases the hypoxia-induced ionic imbalance.

- Constipation: This is due to decreased muscle movement in the gastrointestinal tract.
