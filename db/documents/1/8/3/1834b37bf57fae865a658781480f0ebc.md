Patients with sciatica usually experience pain in the lumbar spine, and almost invariably, the pain will be unilateral. A common characteristic is that pain may be radicular to the ipsilateral affected extremity. Often, patients may describe pain or a burning sensation deep in the buttocks, and frequently they will describe paresthesia that accompanies the pain. Less commonly, there is associated ipsilateral leg weakness. These patients may describe the affected leg as "feeling heavy." A straight-leg raise has variable sensitivity and specificity and may or may not be present depending on the underlying cause. The straight-leg test is a passive examination; it is performed by having the patient lay in a relaxed, supine position. The examiner then lifts the leg from the posterior aspect, flexing at the hip joint and keeping the knee in full extension or keeping the leg straight. Typically pain that is reproduced between 30 to 70 degrees of hip flexion and experienced primarily in the back is likely due to a lumbar disc herniation. Pain and parenthesis felt in the leg are likely due to lateralizing compression of a peripheral nerve. While not absolute, musculoskeletal causes of the pain usually reproduce pain above 70 degrees of flexion and below 30 degrees of flexion.
