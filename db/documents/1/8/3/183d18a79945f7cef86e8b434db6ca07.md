The differential diagnosis will vary depending on the clinical presentation as well as age; the most common differential diagnosis in infancy is the failure to thrive followed by cardiac abnormalities. As children grow the diagnosis becomes broader.

Delayed puberty: The patient will have short stature, but will also have other features that point towards a delay in puberty.

Hypothyroidism: Most often this condition is diagnosed in the first week of life, for some cases that are either mild at birth or go unrecognized, growth is very slow compared to GHD, having a very low percentile in their growth height.

GH insensitivity: there are reports of rare cases of patients who have malfunctioned GH receptors.

Turner syndrome: growth failure is universal in individuals with Turner syndrome, which results from haploinsufficiency of SHOX. Sometimes this disease has no evidence of skeletal dysplasia or other clinical anomalies but just the short stature.

There is also a mass effect that results in comorbidities such as diabetes insipidus, hypopituitarism, GH deficiency.
