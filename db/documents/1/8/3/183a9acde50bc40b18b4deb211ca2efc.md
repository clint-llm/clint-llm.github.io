Initially, PCP was believed to be secondary to reactivation of latent infection acquired early in life since antibodies against Pneumocystis jirovecii were found in children. However, the genotypic analysis showed that primary infection is more common than previously thought and that immunocompetent patients can be asymptomatic carriers of the infection. While both means of developing PCP appear to be prevalent, the latter is much more common, especially in immunosuppressed post-transplant patients.
