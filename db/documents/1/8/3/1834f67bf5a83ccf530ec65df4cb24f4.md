The current survival of patients without brain involvement can be up to 50%-80% but the survival drops to 20% with brain involvement. The morbidity and mortality in rhino-orbital cerebral mucormycosis is determined by the reversibility of underlying risk factors, the time of initiation of IV amphotericin, and the time of initiation of surgical debridement. A delay in any of the above measures could affect survival.

There is significant associated morbidity in survivors. The duration of antifungal treatment can be approximately 7 months. Significant post-surgical disfigurement can psychologicallyÂ impair many patients as well as relatives. Neurologic deficits of variable degrees could persist if there is a delay in treatment. Long-term prophylaxis may be required in certain immunosuppressed****patients.
