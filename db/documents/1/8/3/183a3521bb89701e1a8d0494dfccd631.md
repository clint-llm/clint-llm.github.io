Arsenic poisoning is a global health issue affecting millions of people worldwide through environmental and occupational exposure, as well as intentional suicide and homicide attempts. Although arsenic homicides are commonly publicized, the primary source of arsenic toxicity to the general population is by contaminated water, soil and food products. Arsenic (As) is a nearly tasteless odorless toxic metalloid element that is found ubiquitously in the environment. Arsenic comes in four common valence states: As(o), As(III), As(V) and Arsine gas and three common forms: inorganic salt, organic salt, and gaseous form. This activity reviews the evaluation of arsenic toxicity and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of arsenic poisoning.
- Review the risk factors for arsenic toxicity.
- Outline the clinical presentation of patients with arsenic poisoning.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional teams to improve outcomes for patients with arsenic toxicity.
