Indomethacin toxicity is rare; only a few cases are reported in the literature. Cases in the literature have demonstrated headache, tinnitus, dizziness, lethargy, drowsiness, confusion, disorientation and restlessness, and acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to indomethacin toxicity.

Management: Provide patients with supportive and symptomatic care following indomethacin overdosage. There is no specific antidote to indomethacin toxicity. For adult patients, consider emesis or giving 60 to 100 gm of activated charcoal to decrease the absorption of NSAIDs from the upper GI tract. Osmotic cathartics can be used in symptomatic patients seen within four hours of overdose or in patients who ingested 5 to 10 times the recommended dosage of indomethacin. Call the local poison control center for detailed information on the treatment protocol.
