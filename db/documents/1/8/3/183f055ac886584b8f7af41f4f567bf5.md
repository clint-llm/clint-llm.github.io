Choriocarcinoma is a rare, aggressive neoplastic type of trophoblastic disease. The 2 major types of choriocarcinoma are gestational and non-gestational, and they have very different pathophysiology and prognosis. Choriocarcinoma predominantly occurs in women but can also occur in men, usually as part of a mixed germ cell tumor. This activity reviews the clinical evaluation of choriocarcinoma and the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this disease.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the expected history and physical findings in patients with gestational and non-gestational choriocarcinoma.
- Describe the evaluation of gestational choriocarcinoma and how it differs from the evaluation of non-gestational choriocarcinoma.
- Summarize the management of gestational and non-gestational choriocarcinoma.
- Review how improved coordination of the interprofessional team can lead to more rapid recognition of choriocarcinoma and thereby decrease any delay in diagnosis, enhancing detection and improving outcomes.
