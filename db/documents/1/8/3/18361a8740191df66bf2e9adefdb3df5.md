The dermatopathology of seborrheic dermatitis is non-specific, but the surface and infundibular epidermis usually show a superficial perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes, acanthosis, focal spongiosis, and focal parakeratosis.

Histological progression from acute to chronic SD characteristically demonstrates a transition from spongiosis to psoriasiform hyperplasia and the development of a lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate.Severe SD is often associated with keratinocyte necrosis, focal interface destruction, and leukocytoclasis.
