As discussed before, the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve supplies the cricothyroid muscle. The function of the cricothyroid muscle is to tense the vocal cords, thereby increasing vocal pitch. The external laryngeal nerve also gives branches to the pharyngeal plexus and the superior portion of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor. The recurrent laryngeal nerve innervates the majority of the intrinsic laryngeal musculature, responsible for vocal production. These muscles include the major abductor of the vocal cords, the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle. Adductors innervated by the recurrent laryngeal nerve include the lateral cricoarytenoid muscles,  arytenoid muscles (transverse and oblique), and the aryepiglottic muscle; these muscles contribute to the physiologic "cough." The lateral cricothyroid, thyroarytenoid (vocalis), and transverse and oblique arytenoid muscles. All these muscles are involved in vocal production. Other important muscles include the thyroarytenoid muscle in charge of relaxing the vocal folds and also approximate them, the vocalis muscle, which lies lateral to the vocal ligament and is in charge of shortening the vocal cords and finally the thyroepiglottic muscle which depresses the epiglottis and widens the laryngeal inlet.
