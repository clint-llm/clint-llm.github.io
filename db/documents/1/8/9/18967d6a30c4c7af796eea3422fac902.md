Hyperglycemia results when there is a relative lack of insulin compared to glucose in the blood. In type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance first leads to increased insulin production by the beta cells of the pancreas. When the beta cells are unable to produce enough insulin to maintain euglycemia, hyperglycemia results. Hyperglycemia has damaging effects to multiple organs, including kidneys, eyes, heart, and nerves. Further, hyperglycemia puts children at risk for other electrolyte disturbances.

Comparatively, type 1 diabetes mellitus is characterized by autoimmune destruction of beta cells in the pancreas leading to a lack of insulin production.
