Ubiquitination is the beginning of intracellular protein catabolism. Testing the function of this process to understand specific pathologies involves combining cultured cells with plasmids containing a protein with epitope-tagged ubiquitin. The next steps include the addition of stabilizing buffers, lysing, and sonicating the cells, followed by rounds of incubation. Because the ultimate form of analysis involves immunoblotting with SDS-PAGE gel, conjugated antibodies against the protein must be formed

There are ways to test for the enzymes released by the exocrine pancreas, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase. One test is the fecal elastase test, in which the stool is analyzed for the concentration of elastase, thus confirming patency of the pancreatic duct, the secretive function of the exocrine pancreas, and the presence of activating trypsin.
