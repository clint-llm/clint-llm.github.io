The prognosis of hypercarbia varies and depends heavily on the underlying etiology. For acute hypercarbia, if a reversible underlying cause is quickly diagnosed and treated, the prognosis is fair. For patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic hypercarbia, there is higher associated mortality compared to patients with COPD without chronic hypercarbia.
