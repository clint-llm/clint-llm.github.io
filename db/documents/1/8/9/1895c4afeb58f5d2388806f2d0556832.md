Many patients have various degrees of spinal deformity. The patient should be encouraged first to seek physical therapy to increase joint mobility and muscle strength for those who have symptoms. Surgery is the last resort for spinal deformities. Spinal osteotomy is an umbrella term for techniques used by spinal surgeons to correct spinal deformity. They can be performed on pediatric or adult patients. The purpose is to establish normal range spinal curvature, relieve pain, and improve quality of life. These can be broken down into posterior column osteotomy (PCO), including Ponte osteotomy and Smith-Petersen osteotomy (SPO), pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO), or vertebral column resection (VSR). The SRS-Schwab classification nomenclature grades osteotomies from 1 to 6 by the amount of bone or disc removal. The overall prognosis for patients who undergo correction of the spine is fair. There are several complications that can be serious and lead to disability. Thus, an interprofessional team approach to care is necessary in these cases, including all clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), therapists, specialists (spinal, orthopedic, neurologic), and specialized nursing staff; this approach to care will yield the best possible results.
