An awareness among ophthalmologists is needed in correctly identifying and then treating the disease. On late diagnosis, the disease course becomes prolonged and adds to the morbidity of patients. Though the diagnosis of the disease (microsporidial keratoconjunctivitis) is mainly clinical, the role of microbiologists cannot be underestimated. In atypical presentations, direct smear examination helps establish early diagnosis and helps clinicians understand the prognosis. Considering the inability to culture microsporidia in routine culture media, the direct smear examination becomes more important.

As far as stromal microsporidial keratitis is concerned, a pathologist plays an essential role in identifying theÂ organisms in the histopathology slides of corneal biopsy or corneal button. A well-coordinated interplay between an ophthalmologist, microbiologist, and pathologist helps treat the disease at the earliest, thereby decreasing morbidity and improving the quality of life.
