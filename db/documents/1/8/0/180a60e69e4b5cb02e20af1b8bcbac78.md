Sports coaches and personal trainers working with children and adolescents especially those practicing gymnastics, football, or weight lifting, should be aware of the symptoms of spondylosis and spondylolisthesis. They should be able to identify cases when pain does not improve after rest and basic stretching and strengthening exercises. These sportspersons need to be referred for specialist evaluation to diagnose and treat. This is particularly important as braces that prevent extension and activity reduction have shown excellent results.

Affected patients should be educated about the importance of activity modifications and physiotherapy andÂ engage with core muscle strengthening and flexion exercises for symptomatic treatment.

They should receive reassurance that most of the symptoms are transient. But at the same time, especially those with a high risk of slip progression should be followed up by a specialist Orthopedic surgeon and educated about symptoms and signs of slip progression and potentially serious complications like cauda equina syndrome.
