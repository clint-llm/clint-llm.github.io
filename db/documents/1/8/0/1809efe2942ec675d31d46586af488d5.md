The most common abnormality, a total T3 level reduction, occurs in about 40% to 100% of cases. In hospitalized patients, 10% are found to have low TSH levels measured, an abnormality unrelated to thyroid pathology. The highest incidence occurs in the most severely ill group. The probability of death correlates with the level of serum total T4. When total T4 levels drop below 4 mcg/dL, the probability of death is approximately 50%, and when serum T4 levels are measured below 2 mcg/dL, the probability of death reaches over 80%.
