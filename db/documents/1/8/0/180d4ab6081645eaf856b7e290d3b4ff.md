**Tinea Capitis Favosa**

Favus is the most severe clinical type of tinea capitis. It has an insidious course, without an acute phase, leading to the diagnosis delay.

**Favus of the Glabrous Skin**

Tinea favosa of the glabrous skin and nails are reported in only 7% of cases. Clinically, favus of the glabrous skin presents as papulovesicular and/or papulosquamous circinate eruptions in which typical scutula may be evident.

**Onychomycosis Favosa**

Nail involvement was noticed in 2.4% of cases of favus.T. schoenleinii infection.

**Generalized Favus**

Generalized involvement of favus on the scalp and glabrous skin was common during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. With the improvement of living conditions, cases were only reported in poor and rural areas.

**Atypical Presentation**

In up to 5%, the classic scutular form of favus is replaced by atypical clinical features including pityroid, papyroid, follicular, impetiginous, and psoriasiform form without alopecia. These atypical presentations cause a delay in diagnosis and treatment.
