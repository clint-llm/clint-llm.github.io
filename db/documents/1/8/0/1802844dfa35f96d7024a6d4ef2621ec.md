Corneal topography evaluates the anterior curvature of the cornea while corneal tomography includes the posterior curvature and corneal thickness. This article compares and contrasts the various methods of obtaining corneal data. Corneal imaging is most applicable when evaluating keratorefractive surgery candidacy and keratoconus-risk. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with corneal pathologies.

**Objectives:**
- Review the principles of corneal topography and tomography, and the standard maps produced by such techniques.
- Identify the most definitive test for evaluating corneal pathologies for the intended purpose.
- Outline the risk factors for developing keratoconus or keratorefractive surgery complications.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication among health care professionals to enhance the delivery of care for patients receiving the ophthalmic evaluation.
