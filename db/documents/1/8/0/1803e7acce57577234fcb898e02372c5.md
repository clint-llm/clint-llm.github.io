The trapped lung is defined as the inability of the lung to expand and fill the thoracic cavity because of a fibrinous restrictive pleural layer that prevents normal visceral and parietal pleural apposition. It is caused by remote inflammation of the pleura and typically presents as chronic stable pleural effusion. To avoid the high morbidity associated with multiple invasive diagnostic procedures, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the etiology, evaluation, and treatment of trapped lung and highlights the role of interprofessional diagnosis, timely evaluation, and management.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the concept of the non-expandable lung.
- Describe the evaluation of the patient the trapped lung.
- Explain the treatment and management options available for trapped lung.
