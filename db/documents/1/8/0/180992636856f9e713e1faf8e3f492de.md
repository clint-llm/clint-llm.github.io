Innervation of the superior oblique muscle is distinct from the remaining extraocular muscles in that its nerve supply is from the trochlear nerve (CN IV). Most of the remaining extraocular muscles are innervated by the oculomotor nerve (CN III), except for the lateral rectus, which receives innervation via the abducens nerve (CN VI).
