The diagnosis of pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) requires a high index of suspicion, as this a rare condition. It is crucial to consider PAVM in the differential of patients presenting with complaints of epistaxis, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, and exercise intolerance. Besides, any patient presenting with radiographic evidence of pulmonary nodules, suspected or known diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, or unexplained findings such as hypoxemia, dyspnea, hemoptysis, cyanosis, clubbing, or brain abscess should prompt further investigation.

A thorough evaluation with history, physical exam, ancillary imaging such as contrast-enhanced CT to further support the diagnosis. As this condition is highly associated with HHT, patients should routinely undergo genetic testing, especially those with a family history. Lesions that are identified on CT should undergo further evaluation with pulmonary angiography. Although there are no clear guidelines in the definitive management of PAVMs, it has been recommended that those with a feeding artery diameter of less than 3 mm should undergo embolization therapy (Level II).

The importance of diagnosis and treatment in this condition is to prevent the life-threatening and debilitating complications of untreated lesions such as stroke, seizures, and brain abscesses. All patients should be educated on these complications and the importance of interval follow-up and imaging. It is recommended that patients with HHT should be followed at an HHT center.
