Patients with cystic hygromas may exhibit non-specific signs and symptoms, such as a painless neck lump. The cause may be due to a myriad of diagnoses, including congenital, neoplastic, infective, inflammatory, and vascular etiologies. Although cystic hygroma can be diagnosed clinically, imaging studies are must prior to any further management.

Specialist pediatric surgeons will most likely be involved with the management of pediatric patients presenting with cystic hygromas; however, it is important to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that include a pediatrician, radiologist, and ENT surgeons due to the potential infiltration of surrounding structures.

The nurses are also a vital member of the interprofessional group as they will monitor the patient's vital signs and assist with the education of the patient and family. In the postoperative period for pain and wound infection, the pharmacist will ensure that the patient is on the right analgesics, antiemetics, and appropriate antibiotics. The radiologist also plays a vital role in determining the cause when it comes to interpreting images. The need for meticulous planning and discussion with other professionals involved in the management of the patient is highly recommended to lower the morbidity and improve outcomes.
