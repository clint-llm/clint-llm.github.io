Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia encountered in the United States. The prevalence of atrial fibrillation dramatically increases with advancing age. The increasing life expectancy of individuals in the United States, in conjunction with the increasing frequency of risk factors associated with atrial fibrillation such as hypertension and obesity, likely will lead to a continued increase in the number of individuals with atrial fibrillation. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation, its presentation, and available treatment options and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of this arrhythmia.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the anatomy of the left atrium and pulmonary veins.
- Explain the technique for performing pulmonary vein catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation.
- Review the complications of catheter pulmonary vein ablation of atrial fibrillation.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients undergoing cryoballoon pulmonary vein catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation.
