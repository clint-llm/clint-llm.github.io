There is no definitive diagnostic test to confirm the nevus of Ota and Ito. They are diagnosed mainly by clinical examination and history. Dermatoscopy shows bluish to slate grey homogeneous pigmentation. Skin biopsy isÂ mandated if the overlying skin develops ulceration, or there is a variation in pigmentation with the development of papules.

Superficial variants tend to occur on the cheeks, while deeper variants affect periorbital areas, the temple, and the forehead. Periodic re-evaluation with an ophthalmologist should also be performed annually to rule out ocular complications.
