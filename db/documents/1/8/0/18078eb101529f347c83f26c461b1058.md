The contra-indications to the use of fibrate therapy are:

- Known hypersensitivity to the drug class.

- Active liver disease, as fibrates are shown to be hepatotoxic if pre-existing liver inflammatory states exist.

- Active gall bladder disease as fibrates cause a PPAR-Alpha mediated downregulation in bile acid production, which, in turn, is responsible for an increased tendency to form gall stones.

- Severe renal dysfunction, including patients receiving dialysis therapy.
