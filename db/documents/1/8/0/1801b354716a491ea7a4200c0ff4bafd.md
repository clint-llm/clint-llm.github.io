Nucleic acid testing originally came into being as a method to screen donor blood to reduce blood transfusion infections. Later, it developed into an indicator of diseases, such as HIV and cancer. RNA genetic testing has proven to be an effective supplement to DNA genetic testing by clarifying inclusive results and improving outcomes for genetic testing of hereditary cancers.

RNA sequencing has the potential to be an efficient clinical diagnostic tool because of its ability to measure gene expression outside the physiological range, allele-specific expression, and defects in alternative splicing.
