HO is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes orthopedic nurses. The condition is not only difficult to diagnose because of lack of specific markers but its treatment is not satisfactory. Current treatment recommendations consist of mobilization with ROM exercises, indomethacin, etidronate, and surgical resection. Early treatment with a passive range of motion exercises should be implemented once the presence of HO is confirmed to prevent ankylosing of joints. Absolute treatment consists of surgical resection of mature bone once the HO has fully matured. Surgical consultation with an orthopedic surgeon is warranted only if there will be an improvement in function as demonstrated by mobility, transfers, hygiene, and ADLs.
