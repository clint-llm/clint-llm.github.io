The thalamus is a paired structure located in the center of the brain. Each side can divide into three groups of thalamic nuclei: a lateral nuclear group, a medial nuclear group, and an anterior nuclear group. These three groups get split by the internal medullary lamina, a Y-shaped structure present on each side of the thalamus. There is also an area of thin, midline thalamic nuclei next to the third ventricle, and an enveloping thalamic reticular nucleus that covers each lateral thalamus.

In addition to grouping by anatomic location, the thalamic nuclei can be categorized by function as well. There are three categories

- Relay nuclei (lateral nuclear group, medial nuclear group, anterior nuclear group)

- Reticular nucleus

- Intralaminar nuclei

Relay nuclei represent the majority of the thalamus. Their projections to the cortex localize to more specific regions than the reticular and intralaminar nuclei. Relay nuclei subdivide into the three groups, as mentioned above, of lateral nuclear, medial nuclear, and anterior nuclear. The most clinically relevant nuclei all fall into the lateral nuclear group. These include the ventral posterolateral, ventral posteromedial, lateral geniculate, medial geniculate, and ventral lateral nuclei. The discussion of their relevance appears in detail in the section on Clinical Significance.

The reticular nucleus envelops each lateral thalamus. Lateral to it is the internal capsule. This nucleus is unique in that its projections do not go to the cortex. Its projections circle back to the thalamus itself, from which it received its inputs. Thus, the reticular nucleus serves to regulate the activity of the thalamus.

Intralaminar nuclei also send projections to the cortex. Their inputs, however, come from the basal ganglia.
