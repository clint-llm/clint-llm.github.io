Very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), along with chylomicrons, low-density lipoproteins (LDL), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL), and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) are the five major types of lipoproteins. These lipoproteins are responsible for transporting hydrophobic lipids such as phospholipids, triglycerides, and cholesterol in the plasma and extracellular fluids. Lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids are the main components of cellular life. Lipids are vital for synthesizing cell membranes, energy storage, intracellular messaging, and transporting other essential organic substances such as vitamins. Lipoproteins allow for the transport of hydrophobic lipids in the hydrophilic environment of the bodyâ€™s systemic circulation.

The synthesis and secretion of VLDL into circulation by the liver is a highly complex and regulated process that plays a fundamental role in the overall homeostasis of lipids in the body. Recent evidence has shown that the enhanced production and secretion of VLDL or alterations in its regulatory system directly contribute to the development of multi-organ diseases such as atherosclerosis.
