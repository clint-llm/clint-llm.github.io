Physicians and dentists not achieving complete mandibular nerve anesthesia is a common problem due to many physiological variations. Temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD) is caused by a group of conditions that cause pain and joint dysfunction in the jaw joint and muscles that control jaw movement. Many branches of the mandibular nerve are responsible for the control of jaw movement and dysfunction can result in TMD. The auriculotemporal nerve may be damaged during TMJ surgery, which may cause paresthesia of the auricle and the ear region.

Trigeminal neuralgia is commonly seen with damage to the mandibular branch and can be treated by cutting the sensory root. Classical trigeminal neuralgia is due to vascular compromise of the trigeminal nerve root. Secondary trigeminal neuralgia is due to major neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis or tumors with possible involvement of the mandibular nerve branches.

Ear pain due to radiation along the auriculotemporal nerve with a patient with lingual cancer has been documented. Tonic tensor tympani syndrome results in ear pain, fluttering sensations, or fullness of the ear. Increased activity of the tensor tympani muscle develops in many people with hyperacusis as a part of the startle response to certain sounds.
