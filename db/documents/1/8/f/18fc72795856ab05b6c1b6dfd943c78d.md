Under transmission electron microscopy, the lamellar structure and Schwann cell cytoplasmic content can be visualized clearly, including mitochondria, microtubules, and microfilaments. Osmium tetroxide is used to stain the myelin, allowing the dark (osmiophilic) myelin of myelinating Schwann cells to be clearly distinguished from the lighter membranes of the non-myelinating Schwann cells. Myelinating Schwann cells can be seen surrounding a single axon with a myelin sheath, though it may also have unmyelinated axons associated with its outer cytoplasm. Bundles of unmyelinated axons are visible, settled into the cytoplasm of a non-myelinating Schwann cell. Endoneurium, the loose connective tissue sheaths that surround individual nerve fibers, can also be visualized.
