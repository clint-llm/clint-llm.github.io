The characteristic morphology of Nocardia is a branching, filamentous, gram-positive rod when observed under the microscope. Nocardia can resemble Actinomyces species on gram stain.  However, Nocardia is an obligate aerobe that stains weakly positive on acid-fast staining.

Nocardia is typically weakly acid-fast after traditional carbol-fuchsin staining and positive on modified acid-fast staining due to the presence of mycolic acid in the cell wall. Unlike mycobacteria (also acid-fast positive), Nocardia has a “beaded” appearance on acid-fast staining.Nocardia is catalase-positive and urease positive.
