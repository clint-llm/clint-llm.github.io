The Convergence Insufficiency Treatment Trial (CITT) published two randomized clinical studies through a collaborative multicenter effort and was the first large-scale placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial to study the various treatment options of convergence insufficiency. The first landmark study demonstrated that computer exercises, combined with OBVT, were more effective than pencil pushups or computer exercises alone for CI in children, ages 9 to 18 years old.

The second CITT landmark study found comparable results for young adults, ages 19 to 30 years old. Vision therapy/orthoptics was compared head to head to pencil pushups and placebo and were the only treatment that produced clinically significant improvements in the NPC and PFV.
