Morphology is used to determine Hodgkin lymphoma variants and NLP-HL. Nodular sclerosis HL shows a partially nodular growth pattern, with fibrous bands and inflammatory background. RS cells are rare. However, lacunar cells are more common. Mixed cellularity HL shows a diffuse or vaguely nodular growth pattern without sclerosis bands in an inflammatory background. Fine interstitial fibrosis may be present, and classical diagnostic Reed Sternberg cells are common.

Lymphocyte-rich HL commonly shows a nodular growth pattern in an inflammatory background that consists predominantly of lymphocytes, with rare or no eosinophils or neutrophils. RS cells and mononuclear Hodgkin cells are usually present. Lymphocyte depleted HL has a diffuse hypocellular growth pattern with increased areas of fibrosis, necrosis, and uncommon inflammatory cells. RS cells are usually present. NLPHL is characterized by overall nodular architecture with LP cells in a background of small B lymphocytes, follicular dendritic cells, and follicular T lymphocytes. In conclusion, morphology and immunophenotype of both the neoplastic cells and the background infiltrate are crucial in diagnosing HL and its different subtypes. In summary, correct morphological and immunophenotypic assessment in HL is important for the correct diagnosis of the disease entity.
