In preparation for this procedure, a theater team brief should take place where team members are introduced, roles established, cases briefly discussed, including the list order, equipment required, and patient position. Prior to the start of the procedure, the surgical team should complete the World Health Organisation (WHO) surgical safety checklist. The patient is positioned supine with the affected arm on an arm board. The patient should then be prepped and draped to above the elbow.
