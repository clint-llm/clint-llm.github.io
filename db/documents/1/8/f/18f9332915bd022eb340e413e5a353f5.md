Acute chest syndrome occurs due to vaso-occlusion within the pulmonary vasculature of patients with sickle cell disease. This results in deoxygenation of hemoglobin and sickling of erythrocytes, which can then cause further vaso-occlusion, ischemia, and endothelial injury. Acute chest syndrome can progress quickly and is the most common cause of death in patients with sickle cell disease. This activity reviews the etiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of acute chest syndrome and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of acute chest syndrome. 
- Explain how a patient with acute chest syndrome might present. 
- Explain how to evaluate and treat a patient with acute chest syndrome. 
- Identify interprofessional team strategies to provide well-integrated care and improve outcomes for patients with acute chest syndrome.
