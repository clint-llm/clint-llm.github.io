The exact pathophysiologic pathway for iNPH remains unclear.

- The hyperdynamic flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the aqueduct

- Reduced compliance of the subarachnoid space

- Increased CSF pulse pressure

- Reduced reabsorption of CSF in the venous system due to increased resistance

- Reabsorption of CSF through abnormal mechanisms like transependymal flow, rather than through Pacchionian granulations

- Cerebral blood flow reduction

- Altered expression of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tumor necrosis factor-alpha (which is known to regulate CSF production) and transforming growth factor-beta

- Failure of drainage of vasoactive metabolites (Silverberg 2004) - Abnormalities in CSF production and turnover may lead to a failed clearance of toxic molecules - an inability to clear amyloid-b peptides and tau protein could lead to an increase in their concentration in brain interstitial fluid, creating a potentially hostile environment for neuronal function and survival

- Loss of the Windkessel effect in the skull base arteries - The imbalance of CSF production and resorption is not due to overproduction but because of increased resistance to CSF outflow. The loss of elasticity of blood vessels may be either primary due to atherosclerosis or secondary due to low craniospinal compliance impeding the expansion of the skull base arteries. The increased brain pulsations result in higher compressive stress and shearing forces in the cerebral parenchyma. Due to the physical and physiological differences between superficial and deep (periventricular) brain tissue, the damage and loss start mainly in the periventricular areas as a result of cerebral auto-compression. This focal brain damage manifests as ventriculomegaly. The loss of the Windkessel effect also results in the lowering of cerebral blood flow, which leads to the simultaneous occurrence of iNPH and cerebral hypoperfusion; the latter, in turn, lowering CSF turnover.

Causes of gait abnormality:

- The increased intracranial pressure leads to stretching and compression of the fibers of the corticospinal tract in the corona radiata that supply the legs, which pass in the close vicinity to the lateral ventricles as a result of interstitial edema

- Poor perfusion of periventricular white matter and prefrontal regions

- Compression of brainstem structures, such as the pedunculopontine nucleus

Cause of dementia:

As the ventricles continue to enlarge and the cortex pushes against the inner table of the calvarium, radial shearing forces lead to dementia.

Cause of bladder incontinence

At an early stage, the periventricular sacral fibers of the corticospinal tract are stretched causing a loss of voluntary (supraspinal) control of bladder contractions (Gleason 1993); in later stages of the disease, dementia may contribute to incontinence (Corkill 1999).

Also, in patients with iNPH, the role of comorbidities should be considered according to the International Society for Hydrocephalus and Cerebrospinal Fluid Disorder.
