Injury to the pericardium leads to the release of inflammatory cells, fibrin, and fluid. Most commonly, acute pericarditis is idiopathic, and in 90% of the cases, an etiology remains undetermined. The remaining 10% are secondary to bacterial and viral infections, autoimmune disease, uremia, myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery, malignancy, trauma, and radiation.

Malignancies associated with fibrinous pericarditis include lung and breast cancer, lymphomas, leukemia, and metastatic disease. Tuberculosis is one of the common causes of pericarditis in countries where tuberculosis is endemic. Several autoimmune and inflammatory conditions like lupus, scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis, and mixed connective tissue disorder are known to cause pericarditis.
