The exact pathological mechanism behind CNH remains unknown; however, several risk factors have been identified, as mentioned above. Perichondrial vasculitis theory, described in 2009 by Upile et al., proposes that the disease process begins as a result of pressure on the auricle, potentially exacerbated by same-side sleeping and prominauris, which subsequently causes arteriolar narrowing in the perichondrium of the helix. This leads to ischemia, necrosis, and extrusion of underlying cartilage. Ultimately, a foreign body reaction ensues, resulting in a severe localized inflammatory reaction and the development of CNH.
