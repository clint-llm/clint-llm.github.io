Fanconi anemia resembles a large variety of diseases. Other hematological problems that manifest clinical features of FA and congenital structural defects that are associated with FA should be excluded.

Acquired aplastic anemia: It is due to acquired hematopoietic stem cells' destruction of bone marrow following various toxicogenic agents. Pancytopenia is the cardinal feature of Fanconi anemia due to bone marrow failure. Hypocellularity of bone marrow is sufficient for the diagnosis of acquired aplastic anemia, which does not show chromosome fragility by chromosome breakage test. Fanconi anemia shows chromosome fragility test positive, and gene sequencing is required to confirm the diagnosis.

Other inherited bone marrow failure syndrome: Because bone marrow failure is distinct in Fanconi anemia, differentiation of other causes of bone marrow failure is essential. Diseases with short telomerase such as dyskeratosis congenital is associated with bone marrow aplasia. Bone marrow aplasia caused by reticular dysgenesis is a combined immunodeficiency disease due to AK2 gene mutation. However, sensorineural hearing loss and adaptive immune deficiency in infancy is a prominent feature of reticular dysgenesis. Diamond-Blackfan anemiaÂ is pure red cell aplasia that typically presents with bone marrow abnormalities.

Denovo myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS): It is a clonal myelodysplastic disease characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and peripheral cytopenias. MDS is also associated with Fanconi anemia, but de novo MDS is not susceptible to chromosome breakage test, does not have FA mutation, or congenital anomalies. Suspected MDS patients with associated FA should be tested with skin fibroblasts chromosome breakage tests rather than peripheral lymphocytes.

Drug-induced or infection-associated pancytopenia: Exposure of many cytotoxic drugs, mainly cancer chemotherapy, viral and bacterial infections, and chemicals cause transient bone marrow hypoplasia and pancytopenia in children, but unlike FA, this pancytopenia lacks congenital anomalies and also pancytopenia is reversible with removal of the agents. The chromosomal breakage test is negative.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH): It is due to mutations of PIGA gene encoding anchoring protein glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), mainly in hematopoietic progenitor cells which leads to nocturnal hemolysis due to activation of the complement system in the acidic environment during shallow breathing at night. Patients are anemic, have an increased risk of thrombosis, hemoglobin in the urine, and jaundice. Bone marrow failure is mainly due to acquired autoimmunity rather than inherited. The abnormal chromosomal breakage test is absent.

Other rare chromosomal breakage syndromes (CBS): A number of chromosomal instability diseases in the presence of irradiation, DNA cross-linkers, and chemicals are evident but rare, which mimic FA and necessitates their exclusion for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. These disorders include Bloom syndrome,
