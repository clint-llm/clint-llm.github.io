Proper technique is imperative. The underlying anatomy must be kept in mind. The aspirating needle should enter the bursa parallel to the ulna. In general, the posterior approach is most common, but an anterior approach may be used, staying in line with the ulna. Occasionally, an approach from medial or lateral to the bursa maybe use, but this approach risks striking the underlying olecranon, injuring the periosteum. In the event of infection, this could raise the risk of osteomyelitis, although this is rare.

Once the aspirating needle is inserted into the bursa, general traction is applied to the plunger.

When the bursa is decompressed, the needle is removed, and a sterile dressing is applied. Consider adding a compression bandage over the sterile dressing.

In general, unless the final diagnosis of the bursitis is known, medications are rarely injected into the bursa.

The installation of steroids makes little difference to irritative causes of bursitis except for uric acid.

Antibiotics are generally not injected into the bursa. If the bursa is suspected of being infected, it should be irrigated.

Sclerosis of the bursa is to be discouraged as this would erase its purpose, lubricating and cushioning.
