This rod-shaped bacterium is a gram-positive, weakly acid-fast, non-facultative anaerobe that grows optimally in blood or serum-enriched medium at 37 degrees C with 5-10% carbon dioxide. Chemically, A. haemolyticum is catalase-negative, oxidase-negative, indole-negative, and urease-negative. Clinical microbiology labs can often miss the diagnosis of A. haemolyticum because streptococci undergo beta-hemolysis quickly on sheep agar, within 24 hours, while A. haemolyticum hemolyze slowly between 48 to 72 hours, therefore, plates are often discarded before an appropriate amount of incubation has occurred.

Additionally, many clinicians rely on rapid streptococcal antigen tests from the pharynx which, if negative, could be a clue that A. haemolyticum may be involved. Therefore, clinicians must coordinate with their laboratory if there is a concern that A. haemolyticum is the cause of pharyngitis. It has been proposed that a selective medium enhanced with mupirocin can improve the isolation of A. haemolyticum but this technique has not been employed in most clinical settings.

With advancements in technology, biochemical and spectroscopy tests are performed for diagnosis as well. A reverse Christie-Atkins-Munch-Peterson (CAMP) test will be positive in patients with A. haemolyticum.
