X-linked ichthyosis is the second most common form of ichthyosis, with ichthyosis vulgaris the most common type. X-linked ichthyosis is equally reported in all ethnic groups and races worldwide. As the name of the disease suggests, X-linked ichthyosis almost exclusively affects males. The incidence of X-linked ichthyosis is reported as 1 out of 2500 to 1 out of 6000 males. Three X-linked ichthyosis female cases have been described, all of these patients were offspring of an affected father and a carrier mother.
