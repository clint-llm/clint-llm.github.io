Broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics are required to treat omphalitis. Antibiotic coverage should be directed against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Initial empiric treatment with antistaphylococcal penicillin and aminoglycoside is recommended. If there is a high prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin should be administered while awaiting culture results. If there is suspicion for maternal chorioamnionitis or the patient has a foul-smelling discharge from the stump, clindamycin or metronidazole is indicated to cover for anaerobes.
