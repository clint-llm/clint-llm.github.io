Carisoprodol is available in 250 mg and 350 mg tablet dosages taken by the mouth up to three times a day and once before bed. This medication is also available in various co-formulated forms: carisoprodol combined with acetaminophen and caffeine, carisoprodol combined with gamma-aminobutyric acid, and carisoprodol with acetylsalicylic acid and codeine.

Although the safety and pharmacokinetics of carisoprodol in patients with renal impairment have not undergone evaluation, caution is recommended since this medication's metabolite is excreted renally.  Of note, carisoprodol is dialyzable by hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.

Carisoprodol is pregnancy category C. However, animal studies indicate that carisoprodol adversely affected fetal growth and postnatal survival. Based on the limited post-marketing data, the primary metabolite meprobamate did not demonstrate any increased risk for particular congenital malformations.

Although carisoprodol prescribing appears to be declining to number 214 of the previous year down from number 181 of the top 300 commonly prescribed medications, it is still a commonly prescribed medication in the U.S., with over 3.4 million prescriptions in 2017.

The efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of carisoprodol have not been established in patients under the age of 16 or patients over the age of 65.
