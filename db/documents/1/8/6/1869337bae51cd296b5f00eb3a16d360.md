Potential complicationsÂ accompanying dermatomyositis include:

- Dysphagia; can occur when esophageal muscles are affected, leading to weight loss and malnourishment.

- Aspiration pneumonia; issues affecting swallowing can also lead to the inspiration of food particles, liquids, or saliva.

- Problems breathing; if there is the involvement of the chest of thorax muscles, it can result in dyspnea.

- Calcium deposits; as the disease progresses, can present in the muscles, connective tissues, and skin.
