Histologically, MS plaques are characterized primarily by inflammation and myelin breakdown. Other features include neurodegeneration and oligodendrocyte injury. Multiple histologic stains are employed with adjunct immunohistochemistry aiding in diagnosis:

- Hematoxylin and eosin staining

- Myelin stains (i.e., Luxol fast blue)

- Monocyte and macrophage markers(i.e., CD68)

- Axonal and astrocyte stains

Active plaques are characterized in varying degrees by the following features:

- Extensive macrophage infiltration

- Myelin debris frequently contained within macrophages

- The presence of major myelin protein (in late active plaques)

- Perivascular inflammatory infiltrates

- Presence of lymphocytes (particularly CD8-positive cytotoxic T cells)

- Plump shaped and mitotic astrocytes

- Variable degrees of oligodendrocytes injury

- Activated microglia (particularly the peri-plaque white matter zone)

Chronic plaques characteristically demonstrate circumscribed demyelinated lesions. They occur more frequently and are characterized by the following features:

- Hypocellularity and demyelination

- Macrophages laden with myelin

- Perivascular inflammation, relatively decreased compared to active plaques

- Resolving edema

- In remyelinated plaques, there are thinly myelinated axons and axons with newly formed myelin sheaths

- The appearance of oligodendrocyte precursor cells(classically in remyelinated plaques)
