Unfortunately, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is not only one of the most severe forms of inherited muscular dystrophies but also the most common hereditary neuromuscular disease. Sadly, there is no known treatment modality that halts the progression of the disease; available treatment options are palliative. Affected patients usually die in their twenties due to respiratory muscle weakness or cardiomyopathy. Current therapy is centered on treatment with glucocorticoids and physiotherapy to prevent orthopedic complications. This activity illustrates the pathophysiology and current management options for DMD and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients and families.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
- Describe the management options available for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, as well as the limitations of current management options.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and improve outcomes.
