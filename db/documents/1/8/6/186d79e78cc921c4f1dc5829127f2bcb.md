Anatomical variants of the following venous morphologies occur in up to 35% of individuals.

- Trifurcation of the main portal vein

- The right posterior branch, which arises from the main portal vein

- The right anterior branch which originates from the left portal vein

Duplication of the portal vein and non-branching portal vein variants exist as well but are rare.

Congenital anomalies of the portal venous system can occur. The most common congenital anomaly is agenesis of the left or right portal vein. This variant can lead to the development of collateral vessels of the portal venous system as a result of portal hypertension. The most common of these collaterals are gastroesophageal, paraumbilical, inferior mesenteric, and splenorenal collateral vessels.
