Patients starting atorvastatin should have liver function tests and a lipid panel performed at baseline, with a repeat lipid panel after six weeks of therapy. Liver function tests should be repeated as clinically indicated. Once the patient is stable, lipids can be checked every 6 to 12 months. It may also be prudent to periodically monitor serum blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes or at risk for diabetes.
