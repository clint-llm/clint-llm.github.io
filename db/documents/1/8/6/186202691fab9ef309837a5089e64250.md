Patients may seek medical care for this dermatosis, but it often occurs as an incidental finding on a physical exam. Patients are usually asymptomatic, but some may complain that the affected area burns, itches, or stings.

Historical findings should focus on contact with any heat source in the area of the rash. On physical exam, the skin will initially present as easily-blanching macular erythema broadly in one area. This will ultimately evolve into the classic reticulated (net-like) dusky hyperpigmentation that is non-blanching.
