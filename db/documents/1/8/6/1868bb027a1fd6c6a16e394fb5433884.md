After light reaches the cones in the fovea and other parts of the eye, signals are conveyed to the brain through the optic nerve. The retina converts light energy into electrical energy, and the corresponding information is transmitted to the brain through the optic nerve. The optic nerve is relatively close to the fovea, but at that point, there are no cones. The result of this anatomic structure is the physiologic blind spot.
