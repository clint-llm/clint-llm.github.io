In regards to prevention, it is clear that connecting the two nerve endings will provide the best outcome, so patients with nerve symptoms should go on a theatre list where there is an operating microscope, also loupe magnification available. Often these are extremity injuries, and patients would benefit from having an anesthetist on the list who can perform regional blocks.

The evidence does not provide clear guidance yet when it comes to operating on formed neuromas but seems to point towards excision and transposition or neurolysis and coverage as the most effective method of pain relief.
