The term complement references a set of serum proteins that cooperates with both the innate and the adaptive immune systems to eliminate the bold and tissue pathogens. Like the components of the blood clotting system, complement proteins interact with one another in a catalytic cascade known as complement cascade. The complement system is made up of approximately 40 proteins of an enzymatic, receptor, and regulatory nature, which all participate in a very well-functioning immune system.

At the Institute of Pasteur in the 1890s, Jule Bordet showed that antiserum from sheep causes membrane destruction of bacteria, but this membrane destroying or bacteriolytic activity gets destroyed on heating the antiserum of sheep. The famous immunologist Paul Ehrlich, working independently in Berlin, carried out similar experiments in 1899 and introduced the term “complements” for this heat-labile substance in the sera that were responsible for antimicrobial immunity in addition to antibodies.
