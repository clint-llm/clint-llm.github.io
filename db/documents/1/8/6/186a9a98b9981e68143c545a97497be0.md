Salivary gland neoplasms most commonly affect women with an overall male to female ratio of 1 to 1.5 and a male to female ratio of 1:1.6 for benign tumors.

The parotid gland is the most common location for salivary gland tumors, comprising 60-75% of all cases.

The submandibular gland encompasses 10 to 15% of all salivary gland tumors with an even distribution of benign and malignant neoplasms. The most common benign submandibular tumor is a pleomorphic adenoma, which consists of 36% of all submandibular tumors.

Sublingual gland tumors are extremely rare.

Minor salivary glands comprise 9.5% to 14.7% of all salivary gland tumors, with the most commonly affected site being the palate.

In a series of 216 benign salivary tumors, 138 (64%) were pleomorphic adenomas (PA), followed by Warthin's tumor (23%), recurrent pleomorphic adenoma (5.1%), oncocytoma (2.8%), myoepithelioma (1.9%), cystadenoma (1.4%) and basal cell adenoma (0.9%).

- **Pleomorphic adenoma**, also known as a benign mixed tumor, is the most common salivary gland tumor and comprises 60 to 70% of all benign salivary gland neoplasms.

- **Papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum,**also known as a Warthin tumor, is the second most common benign salivary tumor and comprises 15% to 36% of all benign salivary gland tumors with 94.7% of cases located in the parotid.

- **Myoepithelioma**occurs in the parotid in 40% to 90% of cases. The palate is the most common site when minor salivary glands are involved.

- **Lymphadenoma**is most commonly found in the parotid in over 80% of cases. It has no gender predilection and usually affects patients after the 3rd decade of life.

- **Sebaceous adenoma**accounts for 0.1% of all salivary neoplasms. Approximately 60% of cases occur in the major salivary glands, mainly in the parotid gland. When found in the minor salivary glands, the most common site is the buccal mucosa.

- **Oncocytoma**accounts for 2% of all salivary gland neoplasms and is mainly found in the parotid gland. It has a predilection for those in the 5th to 6th decade.

- **Cystadenoma**comprises 4% of all benign salivary gland tumors.

- **Sialadenoma papilliferum**consists of 0.4% to 1.2% of all salivary gland tumors, with 80% occurring on the hard palate.

- **Ductal papilloma (Intraductal type)**occurs mainly in the minor salivary glands with rare appearances in the parotid.

- **Ductal papilloma (Inverted type)**is more common than the intraductal type. It is almost always reported in the minor salivary glands, with exceedingly rare cases found in the major salivary glands.

- **Canalicular adenoma**is virtually mostly seen in the minor salivary glands. Approximately 60 to 80% are seen in the upper lip, followed by the buccal mucosa and hard palate.

- **Basal cell adenoma**accounts for about 1.8% to 5% of all salivary gland tumors. Around 75% to 80% are seen in the parotid glands, followed by 5% in the submandibular glands. The upper lip is the most common site for minor salivary gland involvement. It has a predilection for females, patients in the 7th decade of life, and in western countries.
