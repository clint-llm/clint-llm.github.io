There is no specific diagnostic testing for breath-holding spells. The diagnosis is usually made by the description of the episode. A history of any inciting event should be elicited especially to distinguish any seizure disorder, as history is very typical for breath holding spells. The color of the patient during the episode may help to differentiate the type of the episode. If an incident can be recorded on video for the doctor to review, this often can be helpful in making the diagnosis. Since it may be confusing to distinguish seizure disorders from breath holding spells, an electroencephalogram (EEG) is frequently being done but shows no seizure activity. However, if breath-holding spells persist for more than 2 minutes, EEG may be done to rule out seizure disorders. Neuroimaging studies are unnecessary since these patients have normal anatomy. Other causes of syncope and seizure should be ruled out such as epileptic disorders and cardiac arrhythmias. Since iron deficiency is prevalent among this children complete blood count should be drawn.
