The standard of care for monitoring while using all NMBDs is to use peripheral nerve stimulation. The most common locations to place the electrodes are over the facial nerve on the lateral face, the ulnar nerve at the medial wrist, or the posterior tibial nerve at the medial ankle. Stimulation of these nerves will cause muscular contraction of the orbicularis oculi, adductor pollicis, and flexor hallucisÂ longus, respectively. Peripheral nerve stimulation measuring a twitch response should serve to measure the depth of muscle paralysis. The most common pattern to test nerve stimulation is with a train of four (TOF), but sustained tetanus and double burst stimulation (DBS) is another option. TOF stimulation is four repetitive electrical impulses of 2 Hz in 2 seconds. In the presence of NMBDs, repetitive stimulation causes a diminished release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, leading to a decreased amplitude of muscle contraction. With the return of the TOF ratio to 0.9, esophageal tone and pharyngeal coordination returned toward baseline.
