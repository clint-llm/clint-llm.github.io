Individuals with impulse control disorders are at a disadvantage from an early age. Refraining from innate impulses is a sign of maturity and has been proven to be a measure of future success. Unfortunately, ICDs are pervasive and often chronic disorders with limited available treatments. Acknowledging the severity of this spectrum of illness, the treatment team (parents, teachers, therapists, and providers, etc.) must work efficiently to provide the best means of care. Therapy strategies will involve psychologists and social workers implementing psychotherapy, as well as case managers coordinating care outside of the clinic. Although commonly associated with poor prognoses, early and appropriate intervention from a diligent treatment team can lead to a significant reduction of ICD symptomatology.
