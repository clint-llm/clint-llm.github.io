The diagnosis is usually clinical. Detailed evaluation of the central nervous system, skeletal system, and the eyes is required in suspected cases of NC syndrome. A skin biopsy shows the typical dilated follicular ostia filled with keratin. Immunohistochemistry studies have shown an increased expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), HLA-DR, and CD68. Electron microscopy has shown an increased number of Langerhans cells. Usually the clinical diagnosis is quite obvious with the history of early age of onset and the typical morphology, but in case of atypical presentations other conditions to consider as differentials include atypical acne (e.g., segmental acne and other mosaic acneiform conditions), other acneiform conditions such as chloracne, Favre- Racouchot syndrome (i.e., nodular elastosis with cysts and comedones), and familial dyskeratotic comedones. This last is a relatively rare, autosomal dominantly inherited condition characterized by hyperkeratotic, comedonal lesions. Histological examination shows comedones with associated dyskeratosis.

Recently, dermoscopy has been reported to be useful in the diagnosis of nevus comedonicus. Dermoscopy highlights the typical comedonal lesions. The typical dermoscopy findings described include multiple light and dark brown, circular or barrel shaped homogenous areas with prominent keratin plugs.
