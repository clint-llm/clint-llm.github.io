The etiology of Blount disease is thought to be multifactorial. Mechanical overload and genetic susceptibility are considered as risk factors. Mechanical overload leads to osteochondrosis of the medial proximal tibial physis and epiphysis, later progresses to a physical bar. Overweight children, in particular in specific demographic populations such as Hispanics and Blacks, are reported as more likely to develop this condition.
