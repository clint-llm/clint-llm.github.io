As most CSF leaks are secondary to either accidental or iatrogenic trauma, the history of a patient presenting with rhinorrhea or otorrhea should raise suspicion for a CSF leak; thus, one should obtain a recent history of trauma or a surgical procedure. The most common presenting symptom across all skull base leaks is clear rhinorrhea that may be accompanied by a headache, neck pain, or stiffness.

Orthostatic headache is the hallmark symptom of  SIH, presumably caused by positionally exacerbated meningeal traction. Occasionally, this evolves into a non-positional chronic headache. Rarely, the headache may be paradoxically improved when upright; prior authors have speculated that this may be due to worsening engorgement of the dural venous sinuses when recumbent.

Other atypical presentations of chronic CSF leak include obtundation, memory deficits, dementia with frontotemporal features (frontotemporal brain sagging syndrome), parkinsonism, and ataxia.

Radiculopathy, brachial amyotrophy, and myelopathy can occur in SIH, both secondary to spinal cord superficial siderosis or/and CNS compression.
