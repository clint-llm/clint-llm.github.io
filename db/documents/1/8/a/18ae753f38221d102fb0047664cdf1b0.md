Sickle cell disease occurs due to a point mutation at the six position of the beta globin chain where valine replaces glutamic acid, producing HbS (sickle hemoglobin). Sickle cell disease is characterized by chronic hemolytic anemia and has different variants such as the homozygous form (HbSS disease) or the heterozygous forms characterized by the combination of Hemoglobin S and HbCÂ (HbSC disease) or Hemoglobin S and beta thalassemia (HbS beta-thalassemia) and other rare variants. Although individuals with the HbSS genotypes are more prone to systemic complications of sickle cell disease, those with HbSC genotype are more prone to develop sickle cell retinopathy and at risk of visual loss.

Beta thalassemia is a condition characterized by insufficient production or absence of beta globin chains, due to beta plus or beta mutations. Homozygosity for a beta mutation causes beta thalassemia major. The absence of one of the alpha-globin chains causes alpha thalassemia.
