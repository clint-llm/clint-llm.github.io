The primary nerve contained within the femoral triangle is the femoral nerve, arising from L2, L3, and L4. The femoral nerve enters the femoral triangle inferior to the inguinal ligament, external to the femoral sheath, and is the most lateral of the significant structures contained within the triangle. The nerve is encased within the iliopsoas during its course through the femoral triangle. The femoral nerve has anterior and posterior divisions that arise near the level of the lateral circumflex artery; there are known anatomical variations of the branch point.

The anterior division provides innervation to the sartorius and gives rise to the medial femoral cutaneous nerve. The posterior division innervates the quadriceps femoris muscles and gives rise to the saphenous nerve.
