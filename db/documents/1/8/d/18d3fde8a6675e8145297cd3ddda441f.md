The AIN provides motor innervation to deep forearm muscles, including flexor digitorum profundus (radial half/index and middle finger), flexor pollicis longus, and pronator quadratus. It also provides someÂ sensation to distal radioulnar and carpal joints and joint capsule. It does not provide cutaneous innervation.
