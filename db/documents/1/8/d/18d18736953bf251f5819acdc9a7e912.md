Although the measurement of plasma glucagon levels is not recommended in the diagnosis and management of diabetes, the role played by glucagon in the pathogenesis of diabetes, particularly TIIDM, has been confirmed by drugs that modulate the incretin axis such as GLP-1 receptor agonists that inhibit glucagon and decrease hyperglycemia and the DPP4 inhibitors that increase endogenous GLP-1 and hence inhibit glucagon and hyperglycemia.
