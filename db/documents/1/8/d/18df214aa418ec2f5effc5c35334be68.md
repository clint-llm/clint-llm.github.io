In infants, macroglossia is manifested by noisy breathing, drooling, and difficulty while eating. It can also result in a lisping speech. The pressure exerted by the large tongue against the mandible and teeth can produce mandibular prognathism and open bite. Cleft tongue if present can lead to difficulty while eating.  In breastfeeding infants, ankyloglossia can cause feeding problems resulting in untimely weaning. It may also lead to speech defects and dental problems.  It leads to the blanching of soft tissue during extrusion of the tongue and also exerts force on mandibular anteriorly. Moreover, it interferes in the process of tooth brushing, favoring the risk of plaque accumulation, followed by tissue inflammation and gingival recession.
