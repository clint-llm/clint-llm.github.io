Hydrogen sulfide can be found in many environments, and toxicity can arise from both direct contact and as the chemical enters the bloodstream. At high levels of toxicity, rapid clinical deterioration can occur, highlighting the need for prompt diagnosis and management. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of hydrogen sulfide toxicity and explains the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the epidemiology of hydrogen sulfide toxicity.
- Outline appropriate evaluation of hydrogen sulfide toxicity.
- Summarize the management options available for hydrogen sulfide toxicity.
- Explain the importance of improving coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with hydrogen sulfide toxicity.
