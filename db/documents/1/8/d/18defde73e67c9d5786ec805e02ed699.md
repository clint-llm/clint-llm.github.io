The main abnormality in dAVFs is a connection between the dural arteries and veins within the venous sinus wall via small vessels that areÂ approximately 30 micrometers on average.

Patients with idiopathic fistula usually have prior asymptomatic thrombosis of a dural venous sinus, secondary to inherited prothrombotic conditions (antithrombin, protein C deficiency, and protein S deficiency) or systemic illness or diseases producing prothrombotic conditions.
