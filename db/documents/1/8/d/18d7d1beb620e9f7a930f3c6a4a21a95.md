Tuberous sclerosis is mainly diagnosed based on clinical criteria, but it can also be diagnosed with genetic testing. If a patient fulfills the clinical criteria, genetic testing is not required, although it may provide useful information for other family members.

As per the recommendations of the 2012 International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Conference, the diagnostic criteria for tuberous sclerosis include the following major and minor features:

**Major Features**

- Hypomelanotic macules (more than 2, and at least 5 mm in diameter)

- Angiofibromas (more than 2) or fibrous cephalic plaque

- Ungual fibromas (more than 1)

- Shagreen patch

- Multiple retinal hamartomas

- Cortical dysplasias

- Subependymal nodules

- Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma

- Cardiac rhabdomyoma

- Lymphangioleiomyomatosis

- Angiomyolipomas (more than 1)

**Minor Features**

- Confetti skin lesions

- Dental enamel pits (more than 3)

- Intraoral fibromas (more than 1)

- Retinal achromic patch

- Multiple renal cysts

- Nonrenal hamartomas

Definitive diagnosis is established in patients with two major features or one major feature with at least 2 minor features, while “possible diagnosis” is recognized in patients with one major feature or at least 2 minor features.

The appropriate diagnosis should be made using either the clinical criteria or genetic testing. As most patients present with dermatological features, the physical examination should include careful skin examination with the use of a Wood’s lamp, in addition to the funduscopic examination. Imaging tests will prove useful to identify lesions such as cardiac rhabdomyomas through echocardiography, and tubers and subependymal tumors through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT). Renal angiomyolipomas can be adequately characterized with the help of either ultrasonography, CT, or MRI.
