Although most patients with takotsubo cardiomyopathy recover, the risk of complications among hospitalized patients is similar to that of acute myocardial infarction. The reported mortality among patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy ranges from 0 to 8%, with a mortality of 4.1% in the International Takotsubo Registry study.

Despite the low prevalence of takotsubo cardiomyopathy in males, they often have a worse prognosis. This can be explained by the fact that males possess a higher prevalence of acute critical illnesses with elevated circulating catecholamines, potentially resulting in higher in-hospital mortality.
