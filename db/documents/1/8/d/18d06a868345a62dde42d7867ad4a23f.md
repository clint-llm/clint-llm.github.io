Therapeutic communication as a concept emerged early in medicine and has since shown significant benefits borne out in research. Two of the earliest reported cases of therapeutic communication, which primarily involved the idea of the therapeutic relationship and the benefits of such a relationship, were documented during the moral treatment era of asylums.

In the late 1800s, Florence Nightingale had previously commented on the importance of the “communication that develops between the nurse and the patient” in the late 1800s.

In the 1950s, Harry Stack Sullivan and Jurgen Ruesch, prominent figures in interpersonal theory and communication, respectively, both published the importance of communication in providing therapeutic benefit, specifically in mental illness.

Of note, Hildegard Peplau published her original paper in 1952 and later published subsequent reviews and revisions in 1991 and 1997, which provided a foundation for the concept of therapeutic communication.

“Therapeutic communication” ultimately emerged as a term in PubMed-indexed literature as early back as 1964 to 1965, in the setting of psychotherapy, psychiatry, sociology, medicine, rehabilitation, and nursing literature.
