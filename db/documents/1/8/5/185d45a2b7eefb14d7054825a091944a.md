To decrease known morbidity and mortality risks, transfusion guidelines based on evidence-based data have been developed. Results demonstrate that these guidelines can lead to fewer transfusions, better patient outcomes, and, concomitantly, cost reductions for hospitals. GuidelinesÂ alone cannot ensure these benefits, as they must be accompanied by physician education and clinical consideration. Additionally, many transfusion strategies recommend the transfusion of one unit and checking lab values to assess effectiveness. This minimizes the risk of over-transfusion as well as circulatory overload.
