Branchial cleft cysts are congenital epithelial cysts that comprise approximately one-third of congenital neck masses. They are benign lesions and can present at any age. The majority are second branchial cleft cysts and appear as a non-tender fluctuant mass along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. They typically present after an upper respiratory tract infection as a waxing and waning neck mass that parallels the course of the illness.
