Left heart catheterization, especially percutaneous coronary intervention, requires high skills and expertise and good peri-procedure patient care. Therefore, it is required to have a system to ensure the completion of all patient care aspects. In the pre-procedure assessment and discussing the pros and cons of the procedure, the assessment must ensure that the patient fulfills the procedure's criteria. Proper sterile technique is fundamental to better outcomes.

In post-procedure care, patients need regular monitoring by trained nursing staff for complications. After recovery, every patient with coronary artery disease should undergo cardiac rehabilitation. It is now recommended to have a multidisciplinary team approach that may include an intervention cardiologist, cardiac surgeon, cardiac rehabilitation specialist, a cardiac nurse, and a cardiac pharmacist to enhance patient care, optimize procedural success and minimize periprocedural complications.
