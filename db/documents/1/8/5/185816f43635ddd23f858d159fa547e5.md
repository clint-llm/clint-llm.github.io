Although most patients will improve with appropriate treatment, some develop progressive respiratory failure.

Particularly in patients with HIV, factors that correlate with poor prognosis include:

- Increasing age

- Prior episode of PCP

- Presence of cytomegalovirus in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid

- Elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration

- Low CD4 cell count
