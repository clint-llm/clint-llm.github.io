Yellow nail syndrome is an extremely rare diagnosis. It can go undiagnosed for misdiagnosed for years before other more common conditions are ruled out. The interprofessional team and caretakers must advocate for further investigation and consideration of differential diagnoses if standard therapy is not successful. There is no specific treatment for YNS; therefore, patients must be aware of the potential harms and limited success of any intervention.
