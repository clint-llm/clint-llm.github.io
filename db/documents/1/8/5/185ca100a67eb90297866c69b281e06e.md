Rickettsial infections are caused by a variety of obligate intracellular bacteria in the genus Rickettsia and are grouped into one of four categories: spotted fever group, typhus group, ancestral group, and transitional group.Rickettsia rickettsii causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever, the most severe and most well-known of the rickettsial infections in North America.Rickettsia africae, the cause of African tick bite fever in sub-Saharan Africa, and Rickettsia conorii which causes Mediterranean spotted fever in Europe and North Africa. Rickettsia prowazekii and Rickettsia typhi present as typhus syndromes. Researchers continue to discover new species of Rickettsia as molecular techniques advance.
