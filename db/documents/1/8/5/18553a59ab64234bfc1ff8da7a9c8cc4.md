Any patient presenting with ocular toxocariasis should not only receive treatment by an ophthalmologist as it requires an interprofessional team evaluation by pediatricians and physicians. Interprofessional communication can lead to better patient management. The patient will most often present to the primary clinician, and these professionals should be aware of the condition as it is treatable.

Retinoblastoma is a close differential; therefore, prompt referral to an ophthalmologist is necessary. These patients can then be followed by their primary clinicians and should ensure compliance with treatment. The nursing staff will be the first to the department to come in contact with patients on follow-up. It can assess treatment progress, evaluate compliance with medication and lifestyle measures, and report any issues to the primary care clinician. This collaborative, interprofessional approach to care can ensure optimal patient outcomes.
