Periapical cysts are commonly treated with non-surgical endodontic (root canal) therapy. If the tooth remains symptomatic after endodontic therapy, surgical endodontic therapy or extraction will be required. Surgical endodontic therapy, apicoectomy (removing the root apex), and curettage of the cyst produces reliable bone healing. Extraction with curettage or enucleation of the socket is also effective at eliminating the occurrence of a residual cyst. Overall, surgical endodontic therapy results in 95% bone healing compared to 66% bone healing with non-surgical treatment.

Treatment for residual cysts is enucleation.

Treatment for paradental cysts depends on the location of the cyst and its associated tooth. If associated with a first or second molar, the cyst is typically enucleated and allowed to heal. If associated with a third molar, extraction is the treatment of choice.

Treatment for dentigerous cysts is the extraction of the associated tooth followed by curettage and enucleation.

Eruption cysts are self-limiting and therefore do not require treatment. The cyst will typically rupture on its own as the tooth erupts. If symptomatic, the cyst can be unroofed to reduce any associated inflammatory pressure.

Lateral periodontal cysts are treated with curative enucleation. Curettage in conjunction with enucleation is often necessary for botryoid odontogenic cysts.

Odontogenic keratocysts are treated with various modalities, depending on the size and location of the lesion. Smaller OKCs are manageable by enucleation and possible peripheral ostectomy to achieve healthy bony margins. Larger OKCs may require marsupialization or a resection. With a high recurrence rate, patients are clinical and radiographic followed-up.

Orthokeratinizing odontogenic cysts are treated with surgical excision, which is curative. Unlike OKCs, they have a low recurrence rate.

Glandular odontogenic cysts are treated with enucleation and curettage. Some of the more extensive cases may require resection. Regardless of the treatment option, close follow-up is needed.
