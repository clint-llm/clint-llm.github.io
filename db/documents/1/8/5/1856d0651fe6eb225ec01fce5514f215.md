Thoracic spine surgeries provide unique challenges to the surgeons due to:

- The narrow canal diameter

- The close relation to important vascular structures including the aorta (covers T3-T7 on the left side), sympathetic chain (T1-T12), and azygous vein (crosses lateral spinal column at T4-T5)

- Narrow pedicles
