Pancytopenia may present with the following emergencies:

- Neutropenia (new diagnosis or associated with fever/infection)

- Metabolic emergencies (e.g., symptomaticÂ hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, tumor lysis syndrome)

- Disseminated intravascular coagulation

- Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis

- Abnormal peripheral blood smear (e.g., microangiopathy, blasts)

- Severe aplastic anemia

- Symptomatic anemia (e.g., cardiac ischemia, hemodynamic instability, worsening congestive heart failure)

- Thrombocytopenia (platelets <10,000/microL, or <50,000/microL associated with bleeding)
