Finasteride is an FDA-approved pharmacologic agent for treating benign prostate hyperplasia and androgenic alopecia (male pattern hair loss) in men. The drug is also sometimes used to treat hyperandrogenism and hirsutism. All male patients should receive risk versus benefit information, including the risk of high-grade prostate cancer. Female patients of childbearing potential should be informed about the possibility of medicine causing harm to the fetus and the importance of contraception while using the drug. Nurses should only administer medicine after verifying the dose for appropriate indications and patient understanding for the use of finasteride. Pharmacists should perform medication reconciliation, check for potential drug interactions, counsel patients, and report any concerns to prescribers. When prescribing this medication, all interprofessional healthcare team members, including clinicians, mid-level practitioners, nurses, and pharmacists, should share information and coordinate their efforts to optimize patient outcomes.[Level 5]
