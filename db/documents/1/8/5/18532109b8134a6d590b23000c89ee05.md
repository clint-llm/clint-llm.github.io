Bacteroides fragilis are part of the normal human colon flora. In a longitudinal analysis of the stool specimens collected from 15 healthy adults, B. fragilis was cultured from 87% of the cohort.Bacteroides fragilis plays an intricate role in the human colon and has a beneficial relationship with the host. Still, if there is a breach in the integrity of the mucosal lining either by surgery or trauma, it can cause significant morbidity.

A review of surgical site infections in Japan showed that in 12.8%of cases, Bacteroides species were isolated.B. fragilis were more frequent in patients with recent surgery. Total mortality was 10.9% and was associated with bacteremia or malignancy.

Between January 1, 1969, and December 31, 2012, 20 episodes of Bacteroides periprosthetic joint infections were observed in 17 patients at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN.
