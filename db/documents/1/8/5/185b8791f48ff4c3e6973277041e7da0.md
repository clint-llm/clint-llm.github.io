Carbamate toxicity results from increased acetylcholine levels at ganglionic synapses of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems; the muscarinic receptors on parasympathetic nervous system target organs; the central nervous system; and nicotinic receptors in skeletal muscle tissue.

Acetylcholinesterase is reversibly inhibited, leading to increased acetylcholine neurotransmission and resulting in parasympathetic symptoms (DUMBBELS: defecation, urination, miosis, bronchospasm, or bronchorrhea, emesis, lacrimation, salivation) as well as potential sympathetic symptoms of tachycardia and hypertension. Flaccid respiratory muscle paralysis secondary to nicotinic receptor stimulation is a major cause of death in carbamate toxicity.

Diagnosis should be based on clinical history and presentation of a cholinergic toxidrome. While laboratory testing is available, results often take many hours to return, and lifesaving treatments should be instituted before laboratory diagnosis.

**Major Goals of Treatment**

- decontamination

- respiratory evaluation, and if necessary, intubation

- atropine administration, often at large doses, to reduce cardiopulmonary symptoms;

- benzodiazepines for seizures, and

- administration of pralidoxime in undifferentiated cases possibly involving toxic organophosphate exposure
