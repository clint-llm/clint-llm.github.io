Beta-lactam antibiotics, including cephalosporins, are commonly used for surgical prophylaxis, so it is crucial to identify when these antibiotics are contraindicated. If a patient has an immunoglobulin (IgE) mediated (i.e., type 1) allergy to penicillin, then penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems should not be administered. A type 1 reaction would be considered anaphylaxis, urticaria, or bronchospasm that occurs 30 to 60 minutes following administration of the antibiotic. Cephalosporins and carbapenems are considered safe in patients who have not had a type-1 reaction or exfoliative dermatitis (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis). Obtaining a thorough allergy history from each patient is vital to determine whether the patient's allergy is a real and significant allergy that would impact the usual preoperative surgical prophylaxis.
