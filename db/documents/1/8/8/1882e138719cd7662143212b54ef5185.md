The anatomical position of the rectum is vital in the digital rectal exam in men. The prostate sits anterior to the wall of the rectum, which allows for manual palpation to assess for nodules, shape, and size of the prostate in carcinoma screening. In women, the cervix, uterus, and vagina sit anteriorly to the rectum, and a digital rectal exam is often in conjunction with the manual pelvic exam. Posterior vaginal wall weakening could result in a rectocele where the rectum herniates into the vagina.
