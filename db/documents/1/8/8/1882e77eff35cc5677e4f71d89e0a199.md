Multi-slice abdominal computerized tomography (CT scan) with IV contrast is the ideal diagnostic imaging modality to diagnose SAA and other visceral aneurysms. CT is useful in detecting small SAAs and assessing anatomy for operative planning. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an alternative to CT, especially in patients with chronic renal insufficiency. Contrast angiography (CA) is the most specific imaging test to identify SAAs and may also be therapeutic. Endoscopic ultrasound can reliably distinguish SAAs from other extrinsic lesions such as pancreatic pseudocysts.
