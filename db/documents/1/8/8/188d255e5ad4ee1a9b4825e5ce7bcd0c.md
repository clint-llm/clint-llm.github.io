The diagnosis of autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 is made by diagnosing at least two of the three major components or having mutations in both the AIRE genes. However, it can be difficult because of the rarity and varied presentation of the disorder. However, it is essential to make the diagnosis as it helps anticipate or discover the presence of other associated disorders. Genetic testing may help families make informed decisions about family planning.
