Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is a rare entity and involves the central nervous system (CNS), which includes the brain, spinal cord, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), leptomeninges, and eyes and has no evidence of any disease outside the CNS. Unlike the other primary CNS tumors, they respond well to chemotherapy and radiation but have inferior survival compared to other lymphomas outside the CNS.
