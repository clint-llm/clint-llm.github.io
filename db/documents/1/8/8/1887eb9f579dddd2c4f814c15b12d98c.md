Anemia can lead to a high-output cardiac failure/myocardial ischemia. As the cardiac system attempts unsuccessfully to keep pace with the oxygen delivery demands, the myocardium becomes dysfunctional, resulting in effusions, edema, and ascites due to hydrostatic pressure increases. This combination of fluid accumulation in at least two extravascular compartments (pleural effusion, ascites, pericardial effusion, or subcutaneous edema) is referred to as hydrops fetalis.

Unconjugated bilirubin is lipid-soluble, thus giving it the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and cause kernicterus. The risk of kernicterus is higher with indirect bilirubin levels greater than 20 or rising levels despite phototherapy.
