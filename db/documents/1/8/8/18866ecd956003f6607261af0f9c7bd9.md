Night eating syndrome is a type of eating disorder that is characterized by hyperphagia in the evening with 25% or more of daily caloric intake after dinner with not less than two nocturnal awakenings during the week to eat food. The prevalence is 1.5% in the general population of the United States. The syndrome is complicated with obesity problems such as diabetes.
