The assessment of the prevalence of inflammatory back pain is approximately 5 to 6% in United States adults age 20 to 69. However, a gap exists between the prevalence of IBP and a relatively much lower prevalence of spondyloarthropathies in the U.S., only reaching 0.9 to 1.4%. Studies in Asia demonstrate a very low incidence of ankylosing spondylitis in that population, near 0.001%. Further, only 36% of Asian populations with inflammatory back pain also meet the criteria for spondyloarthropathy. This gap between the prevalence of inflammatory back pain and seronegative spondyloarthropathy has led some to search for other associated causes or to suggest that IBP may be a unique condition separate from other inflammatory immune-mediated conditions.

One UK study noted variability of findings with a prevalence of inflammatory back pain ranging from 3% to as high as 7% depending on the diagnostic criteria employed. One study in Mexico found the prevalence of inflammatory back pain to be 3.0% in that population. Findings of the frequency of IBP in populations vary greatly depending on diagnostic criteria employed; however, the prevalence in most studies does not exceed 8%.

Inflammatory back pain is more prevalent among non-Hispanic white persons than non-Hispanic black persons (5.9% vs. 3.3%) in at least one large study. Little evidence exists to demonstrate a significant difference in rates of IBP across gender or by age group.
