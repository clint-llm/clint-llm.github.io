Intensive immunosuppression and remission are associated with an improved long-term neurological outcome. Approximately 75% of patients (especially children) with opsoclonus or OMS will experience relapses especially related to the timing of tapering of immunosuppressive therapy. Relapses tend to be associated with worse long-term outcomes and, in children, often significant developmental sequelae; thus, the appropriate duration of treatment and cautious taper should be considered.

All patients presenting with opsoclonus or OMS require extensive investigation to exclude the presence of occult tumors. Paraneoplastic opsoclonus in adults is commonly due to SCLC, breast carcinoma, or ovarian cancer whilst in children, neuroblastoma is the most common etiology. Immunotherapy is key in preventing relapse and worsening neurological outcome.
