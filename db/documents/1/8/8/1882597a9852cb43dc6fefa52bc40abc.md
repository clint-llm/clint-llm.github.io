Febuxostat is a medication used to manage and treat hyperuricemia and gout. It is in a class of drugs known as xanthine oxidase inhibitors. Due to an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality with febuxostat versus allopurinol, the FDA recently recommended limiting the use of febuxostat to patients for whom allopurinol is not efficacious or who experience severe adverse effects with allopurinol. This activity will describe the indications, mechanism of action, administration, adverse event profile, contraindications, and monitoring of febuxostat. It also highlights other key factors of dosing, pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and relevant interactions pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with gout and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of febuxostat.
- Describe the adverse effects of febuxostat.
- Outline the appropriate monitoring for patients taking febuxostat.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance febuxostat and improve outcomes.
