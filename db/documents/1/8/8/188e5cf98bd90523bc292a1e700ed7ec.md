Pain is usually adequately controlled with NSAIDs. Nasal lavage and topical or oral decongestants can help to equalize pressure. Prophylactic oral antibiotics may be indicated due to the damaged mucosa. First-line treatment is amoxicillin. If allergic, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is recommended. Cephalosporins are also an option.

Preventative actions include avoiding diving with concurrent upper respiratory infection and/or active allergic rhinitis. Prophylactic oral decongestants such as oxymetazoline spray, pseudoephedrine, and topical intranasal glucocorticoids can also be used.
