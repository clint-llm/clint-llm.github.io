Pain management in chronic diseases may be time-consuming and tedious for the patient. It is essential to have regular follow-up visits to assess the progression of the disease and the efficacy of therapy and to make any necessary modifications. The patients should be encouraged to stay motivated and evaluated for any improvement or progress.

The vital signs of hospitalized patients receiving opioids should be monitored regularly to check for adverse effects; this is particularly true for the respiratory rate. In addition, bed-ridden patients should receive proper care to maintain hygiene and avoid complications likeÂ pressure ulcers and deep vein thromboses.
