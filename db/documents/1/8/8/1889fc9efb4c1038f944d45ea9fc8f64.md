Melanoacanthoma is a rare benign lesion of the epidermis; however, its actual incidence remains to be established. Melanoacanthoma is seldom the diagnosis considered by the clinician who evaluates the patient; most often, when a biopsy specimen is submitted, either melanoma or a seborrheic keratosis or both was the diagnosis suggested. Complete removal of the melanoacanthoma is recommended since the lesion may persist following partial removal.
