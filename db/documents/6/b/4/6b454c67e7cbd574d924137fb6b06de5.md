Indications for SPECT imaging are developed by imaging societies, and some important ones are listed below.

- Evaluating patients with suspected dementia

- Localizing epileptic foci preoperatively

- Diagnosing encephalitis

- Monitoring and assessing vascular spasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage

- Mapping of brain perfusion during surgical interventions

- Detecting and evaluating cerebrovascular disease

- Predicting the prognosis of patients with cerebrovascular accidents

- Corroborating the clinical impression of brain death

- Several indications in the field of oncology are listed in this article.

In addition, the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology has developed an extensive list of indications for cardiac SPECT studies.

- Evaluating patients for coronary artery disease.

- Assessing treatment response and guidance of future therapy in patients with coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, and heart failure.

- Diagnosing coronary artery disease in patients unable to perform a standard exercise stress test.

- Pre-surgical evaluation of patients with suspected or confirmed coronary artery disease.

SPECT scans are also indicated for non-cardiac and non-neurological conditions such as osteomyelitis, spondylolysis, parathyroid disease, pulmonary embolism, and abscess localization.
