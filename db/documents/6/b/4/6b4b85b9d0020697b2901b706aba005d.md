Sulindac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Like other NSAIDs, sulindac is used primarily to treat conditions characterized by acute or chronic inflammation. However, as per the manufacturer, the indications are broad.

- Sulindac is indicated for a short duration for acute treatment of musculoskeletal shoulder pain (acute subacromial bursitis/supraspinatus tendinitis).

- Sulindac also has FDA approval for other forms of arthritis, including wear and tear osteoarthritis and inflammatory arthritic conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylarthritis.

- Sulindac also has approval for use in the treatment of acute gouty arthritis.

- Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a condition characterized by pediatric adenomas in the lower gastrointestinal tract and frequently results in colonic adenocarcinomas. Several chemopreventive strategies have been the object of research in an attempt to delay the development of colonic adenomas and subsequent adenocarcinomas. Sulindac has been one of the most extensively studied drugs used in this chemopreventative strategy.
