Plasmacytoma can occur anywhere in the body and leads to different complications.

SPB causes lytic bone lesions that lead to bone pain and fractures of bones, and associated nerve and soft tissue damages.

POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, multiple myeloma, and skin changes) syndrome is a paraneoplastic disorder associated with plasmacytoma in the bone.

Plasma cell disorders produce immunoglobulins that lead to relative immunodeficiency reducing antigen immune response.

Renal impairment is primarily related to light chains with decreased molecular weight eliminated as the Bence–Jones protein in the urine as described in a case of plasmacytoma in the chest wall of a 44 years old male.

Plasmacytoma is also associated with gastrointestinal bleeding in some cases of MM.

A rare case was reported in which an extramedullary plasmacytoma was ulcerating through the gastric mucosa and presenting as a massive upper GI bleed. Such cases can be complicated by obstruction and perforation in the gastrointestinal system.

Moreover, drug toxicity should be considered if the patient is treated with melphalan, as certain complications like acute leukemia and sepsis are well-known complications of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.
