The most common malformations sonographically identified during the prenatal period are congenital abnormalities of the urinary tract and kidneys, with obstructive uropathies being the most common.

Color Doppler can make it even easier to identify both renal arteries. Fetal urine production begins at nine weeks gestation, increasing significantly beyond 16 weeks, at 20 weeks, nearly 90% of amniotic fluid is urine produced by the fetus. The fetal bladder can be visualized from 13 weeks onward. From 15 weeks onwards, visualizing the urogenital system via ultrasound becomes easier due to ongoing differentiation.

It is vital to diagnose abnormalities during the prenatal period and treat any critical obstructions or urinary tract infections (UTIs) for the best potential outcome of the affected child. After diagnosis with prenatal ultrasound, about 60% of affected children have surgery for either urinary tract or renal problems in their first five years of life.

A routine fetal ultrasound of the urogenital tract consists of the assessment for the size, location, and presence of both kidneys and bladder, along with the evaluation of their structure and echogenicity, as well as the development of the external genitalia and amniotic fluid quantity.
