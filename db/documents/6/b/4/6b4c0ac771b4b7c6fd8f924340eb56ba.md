Fatty liver is on the rise in the US primarily because of an increase in obesity, type 2 diabetes, and consumption of alcohol. The condition can be reversed if detected early but it requires an interprofessional approach.

Education of the patient is vital to ensure that there is complete abstinence from alcohol. For those who do not remain compliant, end-stage liver disease can develop which carries a high morbidity and mortality.

The nurse should also emphasize the importance of lifestyle changes and a healthy diet. Exercise and a healthy weight can help reverse the disorder and markedly improve the quality of life.

The pharmacist must be closely involved in the management of these patients because several studies show that the use of oral hypoglycemics and lipid-lowering agents may be helpful by lowering the risk of heart disease.

For patients who are not able to lose weight with conservative measures, a bariatric surgery consult may be helpful. There is evidence showing that appropriate weight loss surgery can significantly lower the risk of diabetes and heart disease.

**Outcomes**

Several studies show that if there is early intervention before the onset of fibrosis, the prognosis is excellent. However, if the treatment is delayed, and end-stage liver disease develops, the prognosis is poor. In order to reduce the morbidity of fatty liver, evidence suggests that one should adopt an aggressive an interprofessional strategy for managing obesity, diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome.
