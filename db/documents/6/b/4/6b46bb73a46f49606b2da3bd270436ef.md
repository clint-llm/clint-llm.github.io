Pentalogy of Cantrell (POC) is a collection of five congenital midline birth anomalies that present a distinctive challenge for providers and surgeons. Those five defects are of the heart, pericardium, diaphragm, sternum, and abdominal wall. This condition has been divided into two categories, complete or partial.

Following initial management, additional surgery involve covering the midline defects, separating the abdominal and pericardial compartment, and repairing the diaphragm. Advanced reconstructive techniques are utilized for additional closure, including the use of flaps, skin closure only, and bioprosthetic agents.
