Neoplastic Reed-Sternberg cells comprise only 1% of the tumor mass. The majority of the infiltrate is made up of non-neoplastic T cells, B cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and plasma cells. The inflammatory background is vital to the clinical behavior of Reed-Sternberg cells as there is bidirectional signaling between the cells and their environment.
