Patients who develop delayed effects of radiation present most commonly with radiation cystitis, radiation proctitis, vaginal radionecrosis, soft tissue radionecrosis, or laryngeal radionecrosis.

Patients who have undergone radiation to the head and neck for soft tissue and palate or bone cancers may develop osteoradionecrosis of the jaw. This can be manifested by exposed bone (usually the maxilla or mandible) in previously irradiated tissue that has failed to close spontaneously or with treatment for at least six months. These patients may also develop chronic draining sinus tracts and fistulae from the bone.

It is important to document when the radiation treatment was completed and what the total dose was given.

Total doses of more than 6500 cGy are associated with the development of osteoradionecrosis and soft tissueÂ radionecrosis.

Note if the patient has undergone recent bone biopsies, salvage surgery, trauma due to an oral or dental prosthesis, dental or periodontal disease, or extraction.

Often, women who have received radiation for breast cancer develop post-radiation tissue fibrosis and hypovascularity of the chest-wall tissue which can make successful reconstruction and healing difficult, if not impossible.
