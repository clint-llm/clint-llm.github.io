- The treatment of LAD-I is an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). By the age of 2 years, the disease is fatal in severe cases without HSCT.

- Ustekinumab, a monoclonal antibody of the p40 subunit common to IL-12 and IL-23, had been used successfully to treat refractory periodontitis and sacral ulcer in a case report with mild LAD I.

- Recombinant human interferon-gamma treatment has been used in LAD-I.

- A trial of fucose supplementation is recommended in all patients diagnosed with LAD II

- Recombinant factor VIIa is considered effective in treating and preventing severe bleeding in a child patient with LAD III

- The use of prophylactic immunoglobulin therapy was successful in two patients with a severe form of LAD.

- More conservative treatment is directed against specific infectious agents. Patients are infected with common pathogenic agents but no with opportunistic ones and should respond well to antimicrobial therapy. The most common pathogens affecting patients with LAD include Proteus, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococci.Â  Early aggressive treatment should be used or given as prophylactic therapy (e.g., dental procedures).
