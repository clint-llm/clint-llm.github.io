Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is most often defined as an estimated fetal weight less than the 10th percentile for gestational age by prenatal ultrasound evaluation. The condition is associated with a number of short-term and long-term complications that can severely impact the quality of life. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of fetal growth restriction and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of fetal growth restriction.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation of fetal growth restriction.
- Outline the management options available for fetal growth restriction.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of fetal growth restriction and improve outcomes.
