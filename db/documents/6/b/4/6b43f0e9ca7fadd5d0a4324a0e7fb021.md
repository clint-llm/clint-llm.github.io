The diagnosis of cystic fibrosis-associated liver disease remains a challenge due to the non-availability of a sensitive and specific test. Most hepatic manifestations are not seen until the development of cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Nevertheless, the early diagnosis of CFLD relies on comprehensive clinical assessments, biochemical tests, and imaging modalities.

Ultrasonography plays a significant role in the diagnosis of CFLD and should be considered early as it is more sensitive in detecting hepatic steatosis, focal biliary fibrosis, multilobular cirrhosis, and biliary duct defects. However, a normal ultrasound examination does not translate as a low risk for the development of fibrosis, as patients with CF with normal ultrasound examinations have been shown to progress to cirrhosis.

Although liver biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis and staging of CFLD, it is not routinely recommended owing to the invasive nature of the test and patchy nature of the disease.
