Knowledge of both normal and variant anatomy is of utmost importance, especially for surgery. The branching patterns of the portal venous system are often assessed prior to surgery via imaging techniques. Color Doppler Ultrasound (US) is the most useful imaging technique for identifying aneurysms and/or thrombosis of the portal vein. Helical CT is a valuable tool for visualizing the branching pattern of the portal venous system.

Portal vein thrombosis is a frequent occurrence in patients with hypercoagulable diseases, such as malignancy and cirrhosis, and can be a challenge at the time of liver transplantation. Due to the increased morbidity and mortality associated with this condition at the time of transplantation, this thrombotic state is considered a relative contraindication to a liver transplant.

Due to the large quantity of blood contained within the liver and flowing through the portal system, patients that suffer liver injuries are at increased risk for hemorrhagic shock and death from blood loss. Cross clamping the hepatic pedicle, known as the Pringle Maneuver, stops the blood flow to the liver and allows for better visualization of the surgical field and aids in preventing hemodynamic collapse.
