When patients present with a claw hand, an interprofessional team that includes a hand surgeon, neurologist, neurosurgeon, physical therapist, emergency department physician, and nurse practitioner should be involved in the diagnosis and management. Because there are several causes of a claw hand, the initial referral should be to the neurologist. The treatment depends on the cause and extent of nerve injury.

The treatment depends on the acuteness of the condition and the severity of the injury. Physical and occupational therapy is necessary for all individuals.

Extensive rehabilitation is required, and patients should be urged to be compliant with treatment. Other comorbidities like diabetes should be treated, and the pharmacist should urge the patient to discontinue smoking and abstain from alcohol. Since many patients do develop anxiety and depression, a consult with a mental health nurse is recommended. The occupational and physical therapists should continue with exercises that strengthen the hand muscles. Close communication with the team is highly recommended to ensure good outcomes.

The prognosis for most patients is guarded.
