It is important to consider that often sodium and water retention in edematous states can be an appropriate compensation to restore tissue perfusion. Consequentially diuretics may improve symptoms due to edema but may reduce tissue perfusion. The hemodynamic effects are drastically affected by inappropriate renal fluid retention. In this case, interstitial volumes expand, and it is critical to remove the excess fluids.

Edema rarely occurs with minor changes in hemodynamic forces. In fact, studies have identified that a 15 mmHg increase in the gradient favoring filtration is needed to identify edema clinically.
