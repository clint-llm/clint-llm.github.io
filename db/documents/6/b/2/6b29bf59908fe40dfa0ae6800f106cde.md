The current recommendation for screening for hypercholesterolemia is starting from age 21 if they have risk factors (level B). Risk factors include smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, BMI>30, family history of premature cardiovascular disease or previous personal history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease). It is repeated every 5 yrs, if normal. HDL and total cholesterol levels are measured if non-fasting which can be used to estimate atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk score. If the cholesterol levels are moderately elevated, dietary changes are recommended for 4-6months. If high the patient is started on lipid-lowering therapy.

Strong recommendation(Level A) is from age 35 for males and age 45 for females.

Determination of LDL-C mutation causing alleles and determination of genetic score is recommended to detect polygenic hypercholesterolemia.

The degree of thickening in the carotid artery as measured by ultrasound, as well as coronary calcium score is less in polygenic hypercholesterolemia when compared to monogenic hypercholesterlemia.
