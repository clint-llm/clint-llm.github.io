Caffeine is a stimulant that has been utilized globally for centuries secondary to its ability to improve mental alertness. As many as 85% of Americans consume caffeine daily with the average cup of coffee containing anywhere from 40 to 150 mg of caffeine. Caffeine can be found in many over-the-counter preparations (energy drinks, appetite suppressants, stimulants, exercise supplements, decongestants, bronchodilators, and mental stimulants), increasing the risk of toxicity with inadvertent overuse or severe toxicity with an intentional overdose. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of caffeine toxicity and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of caffeine toxicity.
- Review the signs and symptoms of caffeine toxicity.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for caffeine toxicity.
- Outline the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of caffeine toxicity and improve outcomes.
