Consultation with a cardiothoracic surgeon should be scheduled in patients whose aortic diameter is more than 4 cm. Genetic counselor consultation is also beneficial. Patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) who are pregnant should consult a high-risk obstetrician. Ophthalmologic consultation is a strong consideration in patients who have a cataract, glaucoma, lens subluxation (ectopia lentis), and retinal detachment.
