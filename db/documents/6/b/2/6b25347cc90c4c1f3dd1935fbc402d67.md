Cytochemistry is the analysis, visualization, and identification of microanatomical locations of biochemical content and its environment, within a cell. This visualization is carried out on histological sections and referred to using electron microscopic techniques or biochemical analyses. Many sophisticated methods are useful for cytochemical analyses such as enzyme cytochemistry, microincineration, microspectrophotometry, radioautography, cryo-techniques, X-ray microanalysis, and immunocytochemistry. These techniques are instrumental in providing discrete information about the ultrastructure and organelles of the cells. Microincineration techniques can provide insight into the distribution of mineral elements, such as calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), potassium (K), etc., in cells, tissues, and organs. Enzymes can be localized within the cell or tissue by of enzymatic conversion of specific chromogenic substrates to give visible results. It is thus a method of cytochemical staining that gives enzymatic colorimetric reactions. Alternatively, microspectrophotometry can measure the spectra of intracellular organelles using electromagnetic radiation of different wavelengths. Organelles and ultrastructures are visualizable by their differential interaction with these wavelengths. Radiography and X-rays help to visualize the pattern of the positioning of radioactively labeled isotopes in cells and tissues. Immunochemical techniques employ the use of specifically labeled antibodies to visualize anatomical structures and their localization based on the specific protein or antigen in cells to the specific primary antibody. Overall, cytochemistry of the cell implies to detection and identification of the biochemical content within a cell. It has helped to elucidate the functional features of cells and also tissue under different pathological, physiological, and experimental conditions.

In contrast, histochemistry is the identification and distribution of chemical components within and between cells. It utilizes a combination of histological and biochemical techniques like stains and indicators and employs light and electron microscopy to study the chemical constituents of the cells and tissues. The technique is imperative to visualize biological structures. Histochemical methods help with understanding the molecular basis of different pathologies and, most specifically, cancer progression. With the advent of modern technology, live-cell staining is also possible. Fluorescent dyes such as intrinsic fluorophores, genetically encoded fluorophores, self-labeling, or ligase based tag systems, have enabled the use of histochemical analyses on live cells. The application of histochemistry in investigating the structure and function of hard tissues such as odontoblasts has provided therapeutic approaches towards dentin mineralization.
