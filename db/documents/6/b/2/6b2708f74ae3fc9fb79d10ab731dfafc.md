The clinical significance of surgical error prevention cannot be overstated. Over 300 million major surgeries are performed annually worldwide, and approximately 50 million are performed yearly in the United States.

Surgical errors can have several negative consequences for patients, including lengthier hospital stays, increased healthcare costs, and a higher risk of complications and mortality. In addition to the direct impact on patients, surgical errors can also take a significant emotional and psychological toll on patients and their families. A rarely discussed aspect of surgical error is its effect on the clinician. For example, surgical errors that cause permanent disability or death of a patient can significantly harm the mental health, work performance, and interpersonal relationships of the clinician.

Mainstream healthcare systems have created and adopted numerous strategies to mitigate surgical errors. These strategies often rely on the fundamental tenets of decreasing error frequency and increasing error detectability. Early detection of surgical errors permits the mitigation of downstream effects before patient harm occurs. Surgical error prevention strategies have gained insight from other systems, such as the United States Navy nuclear submarine program, the Federal Aviation Administration air traffic services, and nuclear power plants. These highly reliable high-risk operational organizations have achieved lower-than-expected error rates. Studies have also demonstrated that these systems share a supportive culture emphasizing effective communication, a creative work environment, trust, and attentiveness. This suggests that such a culture could improve overall patient safety within healthcare systems.

Creating a culture of safety within a healthcare system requires constant assessment and a commitment to safety throughout the entire system. An evidence-based approach to identifying organizational characteristics that promote a culture of safety will likely improve patient safety. Frequently shared characteristics include promoting error reporting behavior, easy accessibility to resources that address safety concerns, and collaboration across positional rankings to seek solutions.
