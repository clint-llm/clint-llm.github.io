Effective peristalsis requires an active myenteric plexus. Depression or complete blockade of peristalsis can be seen in the congenital absence of the myenteric plexus, termed Hirschsprung disease, or by utilizing atropine to paralyze the cholinergic nerve endings of the myenteric plexus. Alterations in the function of peristalsis have also been implicated in motility disorders such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), gastroparesis, and achalasia.
