Tissue preparation varies based on the intended use, but there are specific steps that are universal. All samples need to be clearly labeled and marked with unique identification numbers that tie the piece back to the particular patient. Gross examination and dissection also change based on the reason for the biopsy. For example, in biopsies taken to evaluate alopecia, different methods are used to obtain horizontal and/or vertical sections. Horizontal sections are particularly useful for evaluating the total number of hair follicles and assessing the proportion of hairs of different sizes and growth cycle phases. Vertical sections are better for evaluating the epidermal changes and the level of the pathologic changes.

Once the tissue has been dissected, fixation is the method whereby tissue is preserved, hardened, and infectious agents are devitalized. This process can alter the protein structure and shrink the tissue. Artifacts of tissue preparation are sometimes used as a diagnostic clue; for example, basal cell carcinomas tend to show retraction clefting around the palisading lesions under light microscopy.
