Molecular genetic testing has a unique range of indications, most of which are quite different from the uses of traditional clinical laboratory testing and even molecular biologic testing in other disease classes (e.g., infectious disease, cancer).

FISH is indicated in patients with a family history of disease with a known deletion and has recently been used to detect deletions in single blastomeres on a preimplantation genetic diagnosis.

MLPA has a variety of applications, including the detection of mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms analysis of DNA methylation, relative mRNA quantification, chromosomal characterization of cell lines and tissue samples, detection of gene copy number, detection of duplications and deletions in human cancer predisposition genes such as BRCA1, BRCA2, hMLH1, and hMSH2 and aneuploidy determination.

NGS has been used for rapidly sequencing whole genomes, deeply sequencing target regions, utilizing RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to discover novel RNA variants and splice sites, quantifying mRNAs for gene expression analysis, analyzing epigenetic factors such as genome-wide DNA methylation and DNA-protein interactions, Sequence cancer samples to study rare somatic variants, tumor subclones and Identify novel pathogens.
