While the immune system is meant to protect the individual against threats, at times an exaggerated immune response generates a reaction against self-antigens leading to autoimmunity. Also, the immune system is not able to defend against all threats at all times.

- Transplantation rejections are immune-mediated responses, represent a hindrance to transplantation

- The etiology of many autoimmune disorders is obscure - the reality is that the prevalence of these disorders increases and manifests more aggressively

- Type-I hypersensitivity disorders are immune-mediated and include allergic bronchial asthma, food allergy, and anaphylactic shock

- Immunodeficiency disorders are rare, but they affect some children

Vaccination is required to induce an adequate active immune response to specific pathogens:

- Live attenuated vaccines: Induce both humoral and cellular response. Contraindicated in pregnancy and immunocompromised states. Examples include adenovirus, Polio (Sabin), Varicella, Smallpox, BCG, Yellow fever, Influenza (intranasal), MMR, Rotavirus, etc

- Killed or inactivated vaccines: Induce only humoral response. Examples include rabies, influenza (injection), Polio (Salk), Hepatitis A, etc

- Subunit vaccines: Examples include HBV, HPV (types 6,11,16 and 18), acellular pertussis, Neisseria meningitides, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenza type b, etc

- Toxoid vaccine: Examples include Clostridium tetani, Corynebacterium diphtheria, etc.
