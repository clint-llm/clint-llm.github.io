PCA is a slow-growing tumor that is often curative on resection. The best prognostic factor is total resection. The survival rate at 10-years is approximately 95% if completely resected.

If there is incomplete resection, recurrence may occur with progression of symptoms. Risk factors for recurrence have been identified, including solid tumor, exophytic component, and tumor invasion.

Patients younger than one year have the worst prognosis.

For completely removed tumors, a maximum of three-year surveillance imaging is recommended due to the minimal risk of recurrence in pediatric PCA.
