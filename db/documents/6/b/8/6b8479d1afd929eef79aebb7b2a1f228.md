The makeup of the nucleus pulposus allows it to play an essential role in the flexibility and stability of the spine. It is made up of water, type II collagen, chondrocyte-like cells, and proteoglycans (sulfated glycosaminoglycans). These constituents help the NP to be elastic, allow it to be flexible under stress, and resist compression.
