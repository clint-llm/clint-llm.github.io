According to WHO’s Global Burden of Disease Project 2000 (GBD 2000), iron deficiency is responsible for 841,000 deaths worldwide with the major burden of mortality seen in Africa and parts of Asia.

In the US, iron deficiency is seen in 9% of toddlers between ages 1 and 2 years. Compared to white toddlers, Hispanic toddlers are twice as likely to have an iron deficiency. The prevalence in adolescent girls and women in the reproductive age group is between 9% to 11%. It is most common in multiparous women from low-income minority populations. In males, it is seen in around 1% of the population with a slightly higher prevalence of 2% to 4% in middle-aged and older men.

There is a positive correlation between obesity and the risk of developing iron deficiency.
