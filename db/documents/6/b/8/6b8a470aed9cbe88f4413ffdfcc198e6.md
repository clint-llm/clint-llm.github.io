The history and physical examination of these injuries are relatively simple. As with any trauma history, the mechanism of injury is of utmost importance. Like with every trauma case, one should ascertain if there are any other injuries and to make sure this is not a distracting injury to something more pressing.

During the physical examination, inspection is key, and one must assess for any clinical deformities. Additionally, general principles for the assessment of any bruising, swelling, or bony tenderness around the site of injury may indicate a fracture. One must also be aware that although radiographs may show a buckle fracture if a clinical deformity exists, there may also be a plastic deformation that requires correction.

Finally, with children, one must always be wary of non-accidental injury (NAI). Therefore, an ever-present high index of suspicion is required, particularly if any inconsistencies in the history, delayed presentation, multiple injuries of different ages, or if the mechanism of injury does not equate to the given fracture pattern.
