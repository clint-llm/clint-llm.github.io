The symptoms of motion sickness can be diverse, ranging from the most common, nausea and vomiting, too cold sweating, pallor, headache, drowsiness, yawning, loss of appetite and increased salivation.

Less commonly, severe symptoms may occur.  These include the inability to walk, incapacitation, postural instability, intractable retching, and social isolation.  The failure to diagnose the early and more mild symptoms of motion sickness may delay treatment.
