As stated previously, a full trauma workup should be administered to rule out any concomitant injuries to determine the most appropriate consultations (e.g., neurosurgery, ophthalmology, orthopedic surgery, plastic surgery, otolaryngology, oral-maxillofacial surgery, vascular surgery, etc.).

NOTE: OcularÂ injuries occur in 20 to 60% of ZMC fractures. There should be a very low threshold for ophthalmology consultation if an orbital injury is suspected.
