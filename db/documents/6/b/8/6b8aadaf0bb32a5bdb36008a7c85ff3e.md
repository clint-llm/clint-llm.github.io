The dysfunction of myocardial contractility, followed by myocardial ischemia and reperfusion, eventually regains full functionality. Nonetheless, stunned myocardium can be assessed using various modalities to evaluate for myocardial viability, including transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE), myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET).

**Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE)**

Myocardial necrosis is associated with myocardial thinning; preserved end-diastolic wall thickness (EDWT) may provide a simple index of myocardial viability that can be assessed with a resting echocardiogram. EDWT less than or equal to 0.6 cm exclude myocardial viability.

**Dobutamine Stress Echocardiography (DSE)**

It can help assess myocardial contractile reserve. A low dose of dobutamine can increase contractility of viable dysfunctional segments, whereas a higher dose can either improve or diminish myocardial contractility of the viable myocardial segments. Scarred tissues do not demonstrate such a phenomenon with either dose of dobutamine.

**Myocardial Contrast Echocardiography (MCE)**

This diagnostic tool has a high sensitivity for diagnosing myocardial viability and is good at predicting the functional recovery of myocardial tissues after revascularization. The contrast used in MCE is acoustically active gas-filled microbubbles. These microbubbles remain in the intravascular space and can help delineate the left ventricular border. Contrast in the myocardial segments reveals viable myocardial tissues, whereas lack of contrast augmentation reflects nonviable myocardium.

**Single-photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT)**

The most commonly used tracers for SPECT include thallium-201 (Tl) and technetium-99m (Tc) â€“labeled compounds. Myocardial uptake of Tl 4 to 24 hours after injection reflects the integrity of sarcolemma, revealing tissue viability.

**Positron Emission Tomography (PET)**

PET evaluates cellular metabolism, thereby assessing the cellular integrity of the myocytes. The most commonly used tracer for a PET scan is FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose). Uptake of FDG reflects viable tissue, whereas the absence of tracer uptake is a reflection of scar tissue.
