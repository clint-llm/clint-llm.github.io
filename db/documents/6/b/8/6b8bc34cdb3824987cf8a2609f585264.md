The mainstay of treatment when initially evaluating a patient after a caustic ingestion is airway assessment, recognition & management of circulatory shock, and stabilization. Signs suggestive of airway compromise and serious esophageal injuries are stridor, drooling, and vomiting.

Laboratory testing is important mostly for evaluating intentional ingestions or any ingestion where significant injury is suspected. Useful labs include blood gas to assess for acidosis; comprehensive metabolic panel to assess for hepatic function abnormality, electrolyte disturbances, and renal failure; complete blood count to evaluate for anemia and hemolysis; coagulation profile to assess for coagulopathy; blood type and screen in case surgery or blood transfusion are necessary; acetaminophen and salicylate levels to evaluate for possible co-ingestions. In caustic ingestions tissue injury and shock lead to lactate production, thus reflect an anion gap acidosis. ECG is also prudent to assess signs of ischemia, arrhythmia, or interval abnormalities.

Radiographs of the chest and abdomen may be obtained to assess for signs of perforation or the presence of alkali-containing products, such as disk batteries.
