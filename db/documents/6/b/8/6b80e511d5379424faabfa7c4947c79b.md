The pathophysiology of classic Vohwinkel syndrome is, in part, explained by the role of connexin proteins in forming the building blocks for gap junctions. The connexin proteins that compose gap junctions are integral for the transportation of nutrients, ions, and neurotransmitters from cell to cell. Specifically, connexin 26 is found in the epidermis of palmoplantar skin, sweat glands, and cochlea.

The pathophysiology of loricrin keratoderma, a Vohwinkel variant, can be appreciated by recognizing the role that the loricrin protein plays in the cornified envelope and the importance of the cornified envelope in maintaining the integrity of the stratum corneum. The stratum corneum is the outermost layer of the epidermis that serves as a barrier to transepidermal water loss.LOR gene is mutated, the structure of the loricrin protein is distorted and cannot make its way into the cornified envelope. This leads to transepidermal water loss and resultant ichthyosis.
