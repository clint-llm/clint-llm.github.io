Due to the neuroanatomy of the abducens nucleus and its proximity to the fibers of the facial colliculus, infarcts affecting the dorsal pons can produce an ipsilateral facial palsy and a lateral rectus palsy.

Similarly, infarcts of the ventral pons can affect the fibers of the abducens nerve as it exits the pontomedullary junction near the corticospinal tract. This produces a contralateral hemiparesis (remember that the fibers of the corticospinal tract cross at the level of the medulla).

Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) is another syndrome associated with abducens nerve palsy. It is usually associated with thiamine deficiency due to excessive alcohol use. The classic triad patients present with confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia. The ophthalmoplegia results from atrophy of the floor of the fourth ventricle, as well as other regions of the brain (the mamillary bodies, the thalamus, the periaqueductal gray, the walls of the third ventricle, the cerebellum, and the frontal lobe). As stated above, this can affect the fibers of the abducens nerve and result in horizontal nystagmus.
