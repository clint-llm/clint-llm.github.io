The spinal cord is a tubular structure composed of nervous tissue that extends from the brainstem and continues distally before tapering at the lower thoracic/upper lumbar region as the conus medullaris.  The spinal cord is anchored distally by the filum terminale, a fibrous extension of the pia mater anchoring the spinal cord to the coccyx.
