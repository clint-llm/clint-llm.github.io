Canavan disease is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with a gene locus on chromosome 17. It is caused by a mutation in the ASPA gene that encodes the enzyme aspartoacylase. This mutation results in an aspartoacylase deficiency and the accumulation of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in the brain. NAA is believed to cause oligodendrocyte dysfunction, consequential spongiform changes, and degeneration of myelin in the phospholipid layer of axons.
