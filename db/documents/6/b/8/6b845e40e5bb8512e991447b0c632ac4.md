According to Boyle’s law, which states that at a constant temperature, a volume of a gas varies inversely with the pressure to which it is subjected, P1V1= P2V2.

Transpulmonary pressures of more than 60 to 70 mmHg can cause an alveolar rupture.

According to Henry's law, the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the pressure exerted on the gas and liquid. Thus when the cap of a soda pop bottle is removed, soda begins to bubble as gas is released from the liquid. As such, when nitrogen in a diver’s tank dissolves in the diver’s fatty tissues or synovial fluid at depth, nitrogen will move out from those tissues as the diver ascends to the surface (a lower pressure environment). This happens slowly and gradually if the diver ascends progressively and slowly, and the nitrogen from the bloodstream enters the lungs and is exhaled out. However, if the diver ascends rapidly, nitrogen exits tissues quickly and forms bubbles. When bubbles are formed, they can affect tissues in many ways. They can constrict blood vessels causing ischemic injury. This can be deleterious when occurring in critical areas in the brain. The bubbles can also form a surface to which proteins in the bloodstream can cling, unravel, and begin a clotting or inflammatory cascade. This cascade can lead to endothelial breakdown and permanent tissue damage.
