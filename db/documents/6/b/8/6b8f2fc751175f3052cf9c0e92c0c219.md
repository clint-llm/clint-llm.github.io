During fetal development, the structures in the face and neck form from the brachial apparatus. The brachial apparatus is made up of the brachial clefts, the brachial arches, and the brachial pouches. The brachial arches are responsible for developing the muscles, nerves, and bones. The brachial arches are made up of neural crest cells and mesoderm. The mesoderm will develop into the muscles and some of the bones while the neural crest cells will develop into the peripheral nerves and some of the facial bones. The maxillary nerve and the mandibular nerve branches of the trigeminal nerve are derivatives of the first brachial arch. As the mandibular nerve continues to develop and elongate, it will branch and form the inferior alveolar nerve as one of its branches. The inferior alveolar nerve will branch into the mylohyoid nerve, making the mylohyoid nerve a derivative of neural crest cells in the first brachial arch.
