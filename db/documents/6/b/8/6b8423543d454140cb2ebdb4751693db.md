**Antiplatelet Therapy and Indication in Percutaneous Coronary Intervention**

- Aspirin 162 to 325 mg is given on the day of PCI.

- Unfractionated heparin may be used at the time of PCI

- Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors: (abciximab, tirofiban, and eptifibatide) have shown a reduction in complications with PCI.

- Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is a combination of aspirin (usually low dose, 81mg) with a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor).

- Duration of DAPT after PCI:
- PCI after Acute Coronary Syndrome (STEMI and non-STEMI): The minimum duration is 1 year irrespective of stent type.
- In patients with stable ischemic heart disease, who required PCI, DAPT should be continued for at least

- 1 month in patients who required BMS
- 6 months in those who required DES.




- Interruption of DAPT:

- High bleeding risk:
- Reasonable to stop after 6 months in patients with ACS who had PCI
- Reasonable to stop after 3 months in patients with SIHD who had PCI with DES
- Reasonable to stop after 1 month in patients with SIHD who had PCI with BMS
