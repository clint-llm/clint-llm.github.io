In discussing breast cyst complications, the most apparent complications would present after an attempt at aspiration. Local edema or hematoma can occur after aspiration, as well as the possibility of contamination of the site leading to abscess formation. The presence of a breast cyst and its changes to the surrounding tissue architecture, the fine needle aspiration, and edema, or hematoma that may complicate it, may all reduce the mammography performance and produce false-positive results. For these, it is best to postpone mammography by 2 weeks from the aspiration or the resolution of the edema and to clearly report to the radiologist the clinical details.

If not performed under sterile conditions, fine-needle aspiration can introduce contaminating organisms into the breast, predisposing the patient to mastitis and breast abscess. It is also important to note that fine-needle aspiration or other biopsies of the cyst can cause tumor seeding of the adjacent normal breast tissue if there is an underlying malignancy.
