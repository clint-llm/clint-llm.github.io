Growth factors are important in both normal physiological processes such as wound healing and abnormal processes such as cancer and diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy can result from the abnormal growth of retinal blood vessels and is a major cause of blindness. Mutations in kinases and phosphatases are common in cancer cells. Some cancer drugs block the action of growth factors.
