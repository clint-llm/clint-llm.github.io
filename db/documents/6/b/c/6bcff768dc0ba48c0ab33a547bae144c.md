Healthcare workers like the primary care provider and nurse practitioners commonly encounter patients with chest pain. CCTA is one other modality of investigation of cardiovascular disease. The imaging modality is cost-effective, rapid, and avoids the risks associated with invasive coronary angiography. Non-contrast portions of the CCTA study can also yield prognostic information, while post-processing techniques such as three-dimensional volumetric formatting can provide insight into cardiac anatomy. Risks of CCTA include radiation and contrast exposure, but continued refinements of CT technology will likely mitigate these shortcomings in the future. However, before ordering the test it is important to consult with a cardiologist to ensure that it is the correct diagnostic procedure of choice.
