One important aspect of achieving high-quality eye care for patients is an interprofessional team working towards a common goal. A team includes physicians, nurses, assistants, medical technicians, front office staff, and many others who work in unity to provide individualized care to each patient. Each member of the interprofessional team should be appropriately trained and should work in accordance with their skill level in a professional manner putting patient care above all else.
