**Myocardial Bridging:**Although coronary vessels run over the epicardial surface of the heart, sometimes the artery courses intra-myocardial under a muscle “bridge.”  Bridging is found in 0.5% to 40% individuals when identified clinically and 15-85% on autopsy studies.

**Absent Left Main:**In some cases, the left main coronary artery is absent, and both the LAD and the circumflex arteries arise from a single cloacal opening.  In other cases, these two arteries arise from completely separate openings directly from the aorta.

**Coronary Fistulae:**Coronary fistulae are rare in adults, but account for 50% of pediatric coronary anomalies. A fistula between a coronary artery and the cardiac cavity is called acoronary-chimeral fistula, that between a coronary artery and vein is called an arterio-venous fistula.  Most fistulae are congenital.  Acquired ones are usually iatrogenic or traumatic.

**Anomalous Origin:**Anomalous origin of left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is a rare malformation (incidence of 0.25–0.50%) in children with abnormal cardiac development leading to a mortality rate of 90% in unoperated infants.
