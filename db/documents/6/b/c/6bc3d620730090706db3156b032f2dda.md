Nyctalopia refers to night blindness or difficulty of the eye in visualizing under dim light or at night. Daytime vision, however, is unimpaired. Nyctalopia is due to the eye's inability to adapt quickly from lightness to darkness. The principle cell-type associated with Nyctalopia is rod cells. Rods are a type of photoreceptor cell present in the retina that transmitsÂ low-light vision and is most responsible for the neural transmission of nighttime sight. Rods have a singular photopigment, rhodopsin, which utilizes the protein scotopsin and the Vitamin A-derived cofactor, retinol.
