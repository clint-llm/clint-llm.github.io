Delusions can precipitate in isolation or as psychiatric sequelae of underlying conditions. In isolation, as in delusional disorder, epidemiologists can feasibly produce estimates of prevalence. However, when manifesting as psychiatric sequelae, accurate estimates prove untenable. With this prefaced, the prevalence of the delusional disorder in the United States, as reported by the DSM-V, is estimated at 0.02%. The female-to-male ratio ranges between 1.18 and 3 to 1. Men are more prone to develop paranoid delusions. Women are more likely than men to develop delusions of erotomania. Socioeconomic factors associated with delusions include being married, employed, recently immigrated, financial stressors, celibacy, and widowhood.
