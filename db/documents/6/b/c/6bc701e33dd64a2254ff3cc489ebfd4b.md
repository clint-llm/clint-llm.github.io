Numerous studies have demonstrated that a surgery followed by radiation therapy is most effective for the treatment of keloids. A literature review of over 70 studies showed that radiotherapy after surgical excision had significantly lower recurrence rates (22% +/- 4%) compared to radiation as a single modality of treatment (recurrence rate of 37% +/- 12%). The same meta-analysis revealed that among the radiation therapy modalities used for keloid treatment, post-excisional brachytherapy had the lowest recurrence rate at 15%, compared to 23% recurrence for post-excisional electron beam therapy and post-excisional x-ray therapy.

In addition to treatment modality, the rate of keloid recurrence also varies by anatomic location. Compared to keloids located on the ear, head, and neck, or extremities, keloids located on the chest and truck had the highest rate of recurrence at 34%. Keloids localized on the ear were found to have the lowest rate of recurrence (12%). This variation in recurrence rates based on anatomical location is thought to be due in part to the difference in the tensile strength of skin in each of those areas.
