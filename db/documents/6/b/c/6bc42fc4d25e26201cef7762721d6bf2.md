Ashman phenomenon was first described in 1947 by Dr. Gouaux and Dr. Ashman. In their initial description, they showed that the earlier in the cycle a premature atrial contraction (PAC) occurs, and the longer the preceding cycle is, the more likely it is that the PAC will be conducted with aberration, and the conduction deviates from the normal pathway. However, this is an electrocardiogram (EKG) finding and has no impact on mortality or morbidity.

Ashman phenomenon is often misinterpreted as a premature ventricular contraction (PVC) because of its appearance on the EKG as a single wide QRS complex, and in patients with atrial fibrillation as narrow QRS complexes. It has also been seen in other supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Single, wide QRS aberrant complexes are almost entirely caused by the Ashman phenomenon. Because the Ashman phenomenon is an EKG finding and not a disease process, there are no symptoms associated with this. Instead, any symptoms the patient would feel would be due to the underlying cardiac condition, which in many cases, is atrial fibrillation.
