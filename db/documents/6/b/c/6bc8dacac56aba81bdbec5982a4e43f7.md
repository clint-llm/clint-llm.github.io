Vasculitis is a chronic systemic illness requiring an interprofessional team for its management. Shared decision-making and communication are crucial elements for a good outcome. Patients, rheumatologists, primary care physicians, nephrologists, ophthalmologists, pulmonologists, and other specialties, including pharmacists, would need to work closely, to achieve remission and improve the quality of care and quality of life for such patients.

Nursing will also play a key role in managing vasculitis cases, from administering medication to observing for disease or drug-related adverse effects and reporting these to the rest of the team. The pharmacist should verify all dosing and perform medication reconciliation to prevent drug-drug interactions, also alerting the team when these are present so a therapy change can occur proactively. The ordering/prescribing physician (MD, DO NP, PA) should work in concert with these other professions so that the interprofessional team model can drive optimal patient outcomes with minimal adverse events.
