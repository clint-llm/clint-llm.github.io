Cosmetic disfigurement and absent visual potential are a few of the most worrisome complications of this complex disorder.

Surgery-related complications include bleeding, secondary infections, extensive cicatrix formation post-operatively, contracted socket, recurrence, and orbital hematoma.

Graft-related complications include fat atrophy and necrosis in the case of DFGs. It is worth noting that the incidence of atrophy of fat is rare in the pediatric age group, making it a viable alternative for volume replacement.
