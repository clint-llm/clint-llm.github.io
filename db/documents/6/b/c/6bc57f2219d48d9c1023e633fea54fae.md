The diagnosis and management of neonatal seizures require an interprofessional approach to avoid the complications from the underrecognition of clinical seizures and the adverse effects of the medications administered.

Referral to critical care services (neonatal or pediatric) should be performed early to place the patient under the care of neurocritical care experts and to ensure that the patient is stabilized from an oxygenation and hemodynamic standpoint.

Pediatric neurology should be consulted to evaluate the patient and confirm the diagnosis of neonatal seizures.

Electroencephalography technicians need to be readily available to initiate monitoring as well as screen for electrographic seizure activity that may be subclinical.

The medications utilized to control seizures need to be ordered, obtained, and administered in a timely manner. Pharmacists with pediatric expertise should be available to safely provide these medications as well as assist providers in understanding specific pharmacological characteristics in relation to the unique renal and hepatic physiology of the pre-term or term neonate.

Finally, the bedside nurses are vital to helping providers to identify clinically evident seizure activity, annotate pertinent events, and help ensure the patient is safe from the adverse effects some antiepileptic agents have.
