Approximately 5% to 15% of the population will be affected by a kidney stone, and of those, 50% will have a recurrent stone within five to seven years of the initial presentation if preventive measures are not taken. Over 70% of stones occur in people 20 to 50 years old, and they areÂ more common in men than women by a factor of about 2:1. Patients with obesity, hypertension, a positive family history of nephrolithiasis, irritable bowel syndrome and/or diabetes are at increased risk for kidney stone formation.
