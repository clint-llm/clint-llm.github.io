The diagnosis of Henoch-Schönlein purpura is made based on the presence of petechiae (without thrombocytopenia) or palpable purpura that predominantly affects the lower limbs plus at least one of the following four characteristics

- Abdominal pain

- Arthralgia or arthritis

- Renal involvement (proteinuria, red blood cell casts, or hematuria)

- Proliferative glomerulonephritis or leukocytoclastic vasculitis with predominant deposition of IgA on histology

Clinicians should order a urinalysis to identify hematuria, proteinuria, or red blood cell casts. If the urine dipstick is positive for protein, a 24-hour collection must be obtained to quantify the protein excretion.

The measurement of serum IgA levels is non-diagnostic. There are no definitive tests for the diagnosis of Henoch-Schönlein purpura.
