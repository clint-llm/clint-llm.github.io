Primary hyperparathyroidism is a relatively common endocrine disorder. Because hypercalcemia can affect many organs, the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a radiologist, endocrinologist, urologist, surgeon, and internist. To ensure a successful surgery and minimize complications, parathyroid surgery should only be performed by surgeons who are highly skilled and experienced in parathyroid procedures.

Asymptomatic patients with mild hypercalcemia and no complications related to high parathyroid hormone levels can be observed. However, they need period re-evaluation, usually with annual blood tests and bi-annual DEXA scans, to see if they develop criteria that warrant surgery.

All symptomatic patients and those with complications related to high parathyroid hormone levels need surgery.Â If hypercalcemia is left untreated, it can severely affect many organs. After surgery, most patients have a favorable long-term outcome.

Following a surgical cure of primary hyperparathyroidism, follow-up can be done by the primary care provider, including nurse practitioners and physician assistants, and monitoring renal function, bone density, calcium levels, and mood changes.
