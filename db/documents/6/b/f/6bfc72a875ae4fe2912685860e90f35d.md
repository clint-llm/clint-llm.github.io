Healthcare in the United States is primarily based on diagnosing disease and subsequently treating the disease. Consider several of the most prominent medical advances of the past century:

- Antibiotics to treat various infections

- Cardiac catheterization to treat the obstructed coronary vessel(s)

- Beta-blockers to treat high blood pressure

Though widely accepted to result in better outcomes at lower costs, preventative medicine has received far less fanfare. One issue is that preventive medicine is less profitable than other measures. Another problem is that our understanding of individual risk for individual diseases is lacking. For example, while we know that risk factors such as smoking and pollution increase a populationâ€™s rate of lung cancer, we cannot reliably predict the risk of lung cancer in a given individual even if smoking and pollution status is known; after all, not every person who smokes or lives next to a freeway will develop lung cancer. As a result, our current approach to preventative medicine is to apply a one-fits-all intervention universally; seatbelts, vaccinations, diet, and exercise are prime examples.

However, there is a limited understanding of individual risk for a disease when considering additional preventative measures. If new interventions were applied entirely, vast amounts of resources would be wasted on implementing those measures on individuals who were never at risk for that outcome. For instance, consider the waste, complications, and moral implications in a hypothetical scenario of performing universal mastectomies to prevent breast cancer.
