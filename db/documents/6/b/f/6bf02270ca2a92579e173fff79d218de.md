The veins in the upper extremities can suffer from conditions that are commonly associated with the lower extremities. The veins in both the upper and lower extremities can be affected by deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The veins in the upper extremities can also be affected by inflammation and infection; this results in a condition called thrombophlebitis. Thrombophlebitis is treatable, but if thrombophlebitis reoccurs in different locations, this is termed "migratory thrombophlebitis." Migratory thrombophlebitis is associated with adenocarcinoma, predominately pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
