Nitrous oxide is a widely used option for labor analgesia and dentistry. One reason for limited use in the United States is the limited availability of anesthesia coverage. The nursing staff has shown that nitrous oxide administration and management are safe, cost-effective labor analgesia options.

Hospitalists or internists usually check preoperative assessment.

Nitrous oxide is also widely used in dental settings. Dental hygienists and assistants are authorized to administer nitrous oxide in certain states. According to CDC, chronic occupational exposure to nitrous oxide may lead to neurological complications and an increased risk of miscarriage. Hence, an interprofessional approach between dentists, dental hygienists, and dental assistants is needed when administering nitrous oxide to prevent occupational hazards.

A meta-analysis of 35 RCTs showed no differences in the in-hospital fatality rates of nitrous oxide-based and nitrous oxide-free anesthesia. Still, clinicians should avoid nitrous oxide in patients with poor pulmonary function and patients at higher risk for postoperative nausea and vomiting.
