Promethazine is a relatively safe medication that is very useful in several circumstances, such as nausea/vomiting, allergic conditions, prevention of motion sickness, and pre/post-operative or obstetricÂ sedation. However, any prescriber of the medication should be aware of the potential side effects and contraindications. In addition, providers must be mindful of the two black box warning associated, which include the potential to cause severe tissue damage with IM/IV injection and potentially fatal respiratory depression in children under two years of age.

Therefore, close interprofessional coordination between providers (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare workers is necessary to improve patient outcomes and decrease adverse events when using promethazine. Pharmacists can reconcile the patient's medication profile and report to the nurse or prescribing clinician if any interactions exist. Nurses will often be the first to see the patient and monitor for apparent adverse effects, either reporting to the prescriber or checking with the pharmacist regarding the adverse event profile of promethazine. Nursing is also in charge of IV administration to have first-line exposure to issues such as extravasation and can inform the clinician. The entire interprofessional healthcare team must collaborate, each discipline bringing its expertise to support positive outcomes. [Level 5]
