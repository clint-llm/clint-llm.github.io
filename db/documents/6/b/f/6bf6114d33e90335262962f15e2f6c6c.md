HealthcareÂ professionals who prescribe fluconazole should be aware of its indications and contraindications. While fluconazole is generally well tolerated, its use requires caution in patients with prolonged QT syndrome. An EKG is a strong recommendation before initiating drug therapy in these patients. Additionally, liver and renal function monitoring are essential to adjust dosages. An interprofessional healthcare team, including clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), infectious disease specialists, nurses, and pharmacists, operating as a cohesive unit and using open communication can optimize patient outcomes with fluconazole therapy and minimize adverse events and interactions. Given the potential adverse events and drug-drug interactions of fluconazole, it is incumbent on all interprofessional team members to monitor the patient and document any changes in status, including signs of therapy failure, and report these to other team members as appropriate.
