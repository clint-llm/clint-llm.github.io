There is a great deal of physiologic variation between individuals in the morphology of the hand bones. One of the tools utilized to discuss the variance in hand anatomy is the digit length ratio of the second to the fourth digit, otherwise referred to as the 2D to 4D ratio. This number has been demonstrated to be 0.98 among the general population but shows variability between ethnicities, races, and sexes, as well as the handedness of the patient. The third digit is consistently the longest of the digits. The most significant source of variance in the hand bones is the result of differences in size.
