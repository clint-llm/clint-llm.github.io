The sensory homunculus can be useful in narrowing the area of infarction or ischemia in strokes. Even though most strokes involve the infarction or ischemia, both motor and sensory, the motor and sensory homunculus are so close together and have the same blood supply. This knowledge makes it possible to determine the artery that is most likely to be affected in strokes. The ischemia/infarction can be due to hemorrhagic bleeding, occlusion of the arteries, or merely a decrease in perfusion pressure.

If there is ischemia/infarction that affects the anterior cerebral artery, the individual will present with weakness, decreased, or complete loss of motor and sensory in the contralateral lower extremity. These findings are due to the perfusion territory of the anterior cerebral artery and the distribution of the homunculus.
