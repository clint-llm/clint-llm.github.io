Laryngopharyngeal reflux can usually be treated with lifestyle modifications, though LPR can be frustrating because it often does not respond as readily to lifestyle changes as GERD does. With time and appropriate intervention, LPR symptoms can resolve, and the need for anti-reflux medication will abate. For this reason, patient education becomes a crucial aspect of management. Patients should be counseled regarding lifestyle modifications including weight loss, reduction in meal portion size, and refraining from lying down within 3 hours after a meal. Dietary modifications including adherence to a low fat and low acid diet, avoiding carbonated or caffeinated beverages, and reducing alcohol intake are imperative.
