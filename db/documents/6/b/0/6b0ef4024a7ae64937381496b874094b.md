The etiology of postoperative wound infection is complicated by the heterogeneous nature of these infections. They vary by geographical region, surgical subspeciality, and the wide array of procedures performed.

Risk factors can be divided up into patient factors and procedural factors.

Patient risk factors for wound infection include advanced age, malnutrition, hypovolemia, obesity, steroid use, diabetes, use of immunosuppressive agents, smoking, and coexistent infection at a remote site.

Procedure-related risk factors include the formation of a hematoma, the use of foreign material such as drains, leaving dead space, prior infection, duration of surgical scrub, preoperative shaving, poor skin preparation, long surgery, poor surgical technique, hypothermia, contamination from the operating room, and prolonged perioperative stay in hospital.

When looking at the theatre environment, appropriate planning, maintenance, and training are essential to minimize the rates of SSI. An appropriate theatre block should allow optimal patient flow and the separation of clean and contaminated areas. Furthermore, the operating room layout and item materials should be arranged in a way to maintain a clean and sterile environment. When considering ventilation, positive pressurization, filtering, laminar airflow systems, and the number of air exchanges are important factors.

The type of surgical procedure is also a significant risk factor. Surgical procedures and, therefore, wounds are further classified as clean, clean-contaminated, contaminated, and dirty-infected with very different rates of postoperative wound infection rates.Classification is defined as follows from the CADTH report 2011:

- Clean — a procedure in which no inflammation is encountered during incision, approach, or main part of the operation, and sterility is maintained. The gastrointestinal, urogenital, and pulmonary tracts are not entered.

- Clean-contaminated — a procedure where the gastrointestinal, urogenital, and pulmonary tracts are entered in a contained manner, but there is no contamination.

- Contaminated — a procedure during which asepsis is not followed or an incision through acutely inflamed tissue (non-purulent). Also, traumatic wounds (older than 24 hours), or if there is a significant release from the gastrointestinal, urogenital, or pulmonary tracts.

- Dirty/infected — a procedure on perforated hollow viscera, or an incision through acutely inflamed tissue (purulent). Also, traumatic wounds (older than 24 hours) with necrotic tissue present or sustained through a dirty mechanism (contact with fecal material).
