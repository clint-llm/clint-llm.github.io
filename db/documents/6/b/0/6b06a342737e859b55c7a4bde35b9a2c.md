Lumbar radiculopathy is a self-limited injury to the nerve roots of the lumbar spine. It can present as excruciating, burning, or stinging pain, radiating down the leg, decreased sensation of the legs, numbness and tingling, and in more severe cases, muscle weakness.

The recommendation is for patients to see their healthcare provider for further evaluation if they present with radicular pain symptoms.

Most symptoms resolve within six weeks with moderate activity and over-the-counter pain management.

Patients with symptoms persisting for over six weeks can benefit from an epidural corticosteroid injection.

If lumbar radicular pain symptoms continue to worsen and the patient develops numbness and tingling between their legs, bowel or bladder incontinence, difficulty walking, and or sexual dysfunction, this warrants an immediate emergent evaluation and surgical consultation.
