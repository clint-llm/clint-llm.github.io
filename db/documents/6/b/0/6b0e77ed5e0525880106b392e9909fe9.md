When a patient presents with signs and symptomsÂ that cause concern for an inborn error of metabolism, the usual systematic approach of good history and physical examination are required.

Additional questions should focus on developmental delays (expressive language impairment), hyperactivity, and the progression of the patient's clinical manifestations as they become older children.

Physical examination findings that are suspicious for nonketotic hyperglycinemia are nonspecific but include lethargy and impaired mental status (like encephalopathy).

Nonketotic hyperglycinemia is divided into two forms, severe and attenuated. Patients with severe NKH usually have intractable seizures and present no developmental progress, whereas those with the attenuated form of the disease present with varied developmental progress and no epilepsy (or easily controlled seizures).
