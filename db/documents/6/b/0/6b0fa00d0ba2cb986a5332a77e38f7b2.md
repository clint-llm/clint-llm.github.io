The pharmacologic effect of this drug is to raise blood pressure. An overdoseÂ of the drug could result in hypertension. Careful monitoring and titration of the drug should prevent this effect, but in the even that it occurs, the short plasma half-life of angiotensin II means that this toxicity is easily reversible, and no antidote or further treatment should be required. The potential for thromboembolic events in patients treated with angiotensin II dictates the need for DVT prophylaxis during treatment.
