The autonomic nervous system develops from neural crest cells. Precursors of Schwann cells are multipotent cells derived from the neural crest. Precursors of Schwann cells generate Schwann cells, neuroendocrine cells, autonomic neurons, melanocyte, and some other cells. Neural crest cells of the mesencephalon and metencephalon junction contribute to the development of ciliary ganglion.Before the closure of neural tube closure, neural crest cells migrate from midbrain and hindbrain junction. In neural tube, neurons arrange in two lamina- basal lamina and alar lamina. Neurons of the basal lamina are motor in nature and from lateral to medial side arranged in three columns named as somatomotor (somatic efferent), branchio-motor (special visceral efferent) and visceral-motor ( general visceral motor). The dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve, the inferior salivatory nucleus of the glossopharyngeal nerve, the superior salivatory nucleus of facial and Edinger-Westphal nucleus of oculomotor represent viscera-motor component of the cranial nerve. Viscero-motor component of the cranial nerve is associated with parasympathetic ganglions, and from these nucleus preganglionic parasympathetic fibers of concerned ganglion originates.Â Folic acid deficiency, infections, exposure to the teratogen, mutation during the early embryonic period can lead to the defect in the development of neural tube, facial defects, ocular defects, etc..
