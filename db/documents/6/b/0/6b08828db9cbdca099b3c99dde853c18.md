Neutropenic fever is defined as a single oral temperature greater than or equal to 101 F (38.3 C) or a temperature greater than or equal to 100.4 F (38 C) for at least an hour, with an absolute neutrophilic count (ANC) of less than 1500 cells/microliter. In most cases, the infectious etiology cannot be determined and gets marked as a fever of unknown origin (FUO). In severe neutropenia, the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is less than 500 per microliter. Febrile neutropenia is the most common serious and common complication of cancer therapy. This activity reviews the management and highlights the tools needed by an interprofessional team to evaluate patients with febrile neutropenia properly.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of febrile neutropenia.
- Identify indexes used to assess patients with febrile neutropenia.
- Describe the workup for patients with febrile neutropenia.
- Explain the importance of communication and urgency amongst the interprofessional team to improve the outcome in patients with febrile neutropenia.
