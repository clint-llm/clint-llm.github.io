**Complications**

Preterm delivery is more common in infants with gastroschisis at 28% versus infants without 6%. Complications can occur in infants with gastroschisis based on the need for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and resultant line sepsis, bowel configuration leading to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and abdominal wound infections from the gastroschisis closure.

**Risk Stratification**

Patients can be defined as “simple” versus “complex” based on the presence of intestinal complications (atresia, ischemia, perforation, or development of necrotizing enterocolitis). Patients with complex defects have a higher mortality rate, require multiple operative interventions, and have a prolonged hospitalization, increased rates of sepsis, and higher rates of prolonged cholestasis and need for intestinal transplantation due to intestinal failure.

**Management of Intestinal Atresia in the Setting of Gastroschisis**

Up to 10% of neonates with gastroschisis have associated atresia, most commonly jejunal or ileal.

**Closing Gastroschisis**

A “closing gastroschisis” is when the gastroschisis defect size decreases before delivery.
