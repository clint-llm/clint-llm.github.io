In polydactyly of the hand, bleeding and anesthetic complications may occur during the perioperative period. Functionality can be decreased later due to the contracture or ligamentous laxity. A painful neuroma is another complication, especially when using suture ligation, and it occurs at the treatment site. Beneath the suture ligation site, a painful neuroma forms because the digital nerves of the extra digit are cut off at the skin level, so it cannot retract in the soft tissues. As a result, the children are prone to injury to the skin tag resulting in skin breakdown.

In polydactyly of the foot, hallux varus is the most common complication of tibial polydactyly that may lead to subsequent surgical correction. Fibular polydactyly may have a residual angular deformity.
