The most common complication of PVS is shunt blockage. All patients should be instructed to pump the compressible pump of the PVS several times a day in the supine position for maximal drainage. The interventional radiologist should counsel the patient and/or the caregiver regarding clear instructions on how and when to compress the shunt pump before discharging the patient.

Abstinence from alcohol consumption can lead to shunt blockage due to a reduced flow rate, and these patients require careful monitoring. Less common complications, notably coagulopathy and edema, can be prevented by complete drainage of ascitic fluid before shunt placement. Broad-spectrum prophylactic antibiotics help to prevent peri- or post-operative infections; however, complicated infections require shunt removal. Percutaneous PVS has several advantages over subcutaneous PVS as the former is minimally invasive, faster, less painful, cheaper, and doesnâ€™t require sedation.

The interventional radiologist, hepatologist, and liver transplant surgeon should work closely to explore the best treatment plan for each patient.
