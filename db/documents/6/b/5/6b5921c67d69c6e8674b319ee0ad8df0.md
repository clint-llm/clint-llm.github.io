The Rule of Nines is a quick and easy tool used for the initial management of resuscitation in burn patients. Studies find that after examining the fully undressed patient, the percentage TBSA can be determined by the Rule of Nines within a few minutes.

Multiple studies found in a literature review stated that the patient's palm excluding the digits represented approximately 0.5% TBSA and that verification was noted with computer-based applications. The inclusion of the digits to the palm was found to be approximately 0.8% TBSA. The use of the palm, which is the basis for how the Rule of Nines was established, is found to be more appropriate for smaller second-degree and third-degree burns. It has been noted that the more training a specialist has, the less overestimation is present, especially on smaller burns.
