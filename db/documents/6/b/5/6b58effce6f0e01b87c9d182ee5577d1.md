Cholinesterase inhibitors increase the overall amount of acetylcholine available. Thus, symptoms of overstimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system, such as increased hypermotility, hypersecretion, bradycardia, miosis, diarrhea, and hypotension, may be present.

A major concern when prescribing cholinesterase inhibitors or exposure to organophosphates is potentially developing a cholinergic crisis, also known as **SLUDGE**syndrome.

**SLUDGE**is a mnemonic that stands for the following:

- **S:**Salivation

- **L:**Lacrimation

- **U:**Urination

- **D:**Diaphoresis

- **G:**Gastrointestinal upset

- **E:**Emesis

Temporary adverse effects when starting patients on cholinesterase inhibitors include headaches, insomnia, and minor GI issues. Other more concerning effects include lightheadedness, weakness, and weight loss. Prolonged muscle contraction may also be a presenting feature in patients exposed to cholinesterase inhibitors.

Cholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine used post-operatively for reversal of neuromuscular blockade can result in a potential residual neuromuscular block.
