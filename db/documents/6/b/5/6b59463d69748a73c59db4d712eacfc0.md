Benign and malignant space-occupying lesions of the brain parenchyma, as well as extra-axial intracranial mass lesions, may be supratentorial or infratentorial (i.e., relative to the tentorium cerebelli) in location. Extra-axial intracranial mass lesions such as meningiomas may also arise directly from the tentorium cerebelli.

Surgical intervention is made complicated by the fact that the free edge of the tentorium cerebelli lies in close proximity to the brainstem, carrying significant risks of iatrogenic injury to the brainstem. Furthermore, the tentorium cerebelli is quite vascular. As alluded to above, the tentorium cerebelli harbors several venous sinuses receiving tributaries from the supratentorial and infratentorial portions of the brain.
