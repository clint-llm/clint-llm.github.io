The treatment options for upper airway resistance syndrome include addressing the underlying causes of the upper airway anatomical problems such as nasal allergies, dental malocclusion, and abnormal lifestyles. The mainstay therapy is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), with many studies reporting subjective, clinical, and physiological improvements.

Oral appliances are also an excellent treatment option for those patients with UARS who are intolerant of CPAP or those who refuse surgery.

Surgical treatment for upper airway obstruction is considered when a patient is not able to tolerate other therapies (i.e., CPAP and oral appliances). Many surgical procedures are used in UARS, including palatal surgeries.

Pharmacological treatments have been considered investigational therapies, but no drug has FDA approval for this indication to date. Hypnotics are attractive options as they may reduce respiratory-related arousal, improving sleep fragmentation. Studies using nonbenzodiazepines (e.g., zolpidem) have shown mixed results. While some studies showed that zolpidem decreases respiratory arousal threshold and SDB severity, others reported no effect on arousal threshold.
