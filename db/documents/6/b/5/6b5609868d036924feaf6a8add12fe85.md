Physical exam findings commonly noted with both chronic and gestational hypertension are limited to systolic blood pressure above 140mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure above 90mmHg. Severe range blood pressures are above 160mmHg systolic and/or 110mmHg diastolic. An increase in edema is frequently noted in women with pre-eclampsia. Those demonstrating severe features may demonstrate cerebral symptoms (unremitting/severe headache, altered mental status), visual symptoms (scotomata, photophobia, blurred vision, or temporary blindness/visual field defect), pulmonary edema (dyspnea or rales on examination), renal impairement (water retention causing peripheral edema)or hepatic impairment (right upper quadrant pain). In HELLP syndrome malaise and right upper quadrant pain occur in up to 90% of cases. Vomiting is also common
