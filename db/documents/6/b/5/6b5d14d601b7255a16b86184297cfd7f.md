A patient with an injury to the SAN may present with neck pain, asymmetrical shoulders, inability to shrug the shoulder, or weakness in the neck area. The patients can also have complications secondary to treatment. Complications secondary to nerve graft include the formation of a neuroma or fibrotic ingrowth over the graft, interfering with proximal axonal sprouting leading to graft failure. This complication occurred in patients who had radiotherapy postoperatively or where a long and nonvascular type of graft was used. Another complication is associated with harvesting the autologous nerve graft that results in the morbidity of the donor site.
