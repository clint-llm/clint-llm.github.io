The distal extensor tendon is ruptured. The ruptureÂ occurs when the distal phalanx of a finger is forced into flexion while being actively extended. The extrinsic extensor tendon originates in the forearm and courses over the metacarpophalangeal joint, has an indirect attachment to the proximal phalanx, and finally attaches to the distal phalanx. These tendons are responsible for the extension of the digits.
