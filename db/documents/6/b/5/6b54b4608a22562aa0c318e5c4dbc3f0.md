While on fosinopril, the patient requires monitoring for hypotension, potassium levels, renal function, and angioedema. To decrease the possibility of hypotension as an adverse effect among ACE inhibitors, the recommendation is to prescribe fosinopril at a low dose initially. During weeks 2Â to 3 of usage, clinicians should note serum creatine and potassium levels and blood pressure to gauge the patient's tolerance. For instance, a patient with a history of hyperkalemia or a high potassium diet should be closely monitored to avoid exacerbating any preexisting conditions.
