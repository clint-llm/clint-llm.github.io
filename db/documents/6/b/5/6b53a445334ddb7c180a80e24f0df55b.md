Palpitations can be a very concerning symptom for the patient. The etiology of the palpitations in most patients is benign. Therefore, comprehensive workups are not indicated. However appropriate follow up with the primary care provider can provide the ability to monitor symptoms over time and determine if consultation with cardiology is required.Â  Patients who are determined to be at high risk for palpitations of serious or life-threatening etiologies require a more extensive workup and comprehensive management. The level of evidence for evaluation techniques is based upon consensus expert opinion.
