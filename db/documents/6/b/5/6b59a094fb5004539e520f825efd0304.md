In patients with acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) who have undergone thrombolysis, iliac stenting improves vessel patency and lowers PTO rates.

Symptoms in patients with NIVL can vary and can involve chronic pelvic pain, venous claudication, and edema. However, anatomic considerations do not always correlate with patient symptoms. Some patients with anatomic venous compression found on imaging are asymptomatic.
