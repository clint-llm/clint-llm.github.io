Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome is caused by the epidermolytic exotoxin that is produced by some strains of Staphylococcus. There are at least two toxins that causeÂ Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome. However, testing for the specific phage-type is not helpful or available. The disease usually follows a localized infection from the upper respiratory tract, ears, conjunctiva, or umbilical stump. In adults, it may result from an abscess, arteriovenous fistula infection, or septic arthritis, among others. Often a source cannot be identified.

Children are at a greater risk because of the immature renal system lack of immunity and the absence of maternal antibodies in those who are not breastfed. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome may occur as an outbreak in daycares or nurseries. The majority of affected children are less than age 2.
