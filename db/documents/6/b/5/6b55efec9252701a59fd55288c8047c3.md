The musculature of the nose is divided into elevators, depressors, compressors, and dilators; these allow for a wide range of nasal functions. The facial nerve innervates the muscles of this group. The procerus, levator labii superioris alaeque nasi, and anomalous nasi insert into the alar cartilages and function to elevate and shorten the nose, allowing for dilation of the nasal valves.  The nasalis located in the middle two-thirds of the nose acts to both compress and dilate the nares. The depressor septi muscle inserts into the septum and posterior aspect of the alae enabling depression of the nose.
