an interprofessional team ideally performs the management of patients with emphysema and COPD.  Treatment of these patients involves not only their primary care provider but nurses and respiratory therapists.  When patients initiate therapy with inhalers, respiratory therapists prove integral in educating patients on proper use of their inhalers and the use of spacers in conjunction.  Inevitably, if the patient's disease continues to progress, there will be a need to be evaluated by a pulmonologist. Telehealth has also been discussed as a potential avenue for patients, although the cost-effectiveness of this resource still requires further evaluation.
