It is the responsibility of healthcare professionals that the parents of the patient have a good understanding of the disease and the appropriate treatment available for the disease. The diagnosis of congenital lobar emphysema in the newborn is usually distressing and can cause significant anxiety. Healthcare providers need to provide emotional support to the parents of the newly diagnosed patient.

The therapeutic approach to congenital lobar emphysema should utilize an interprofessional team, including primary care physician, pediatrician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, radiologist, and thoracic surgeon to establish a definitive diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment. If the patient has mild or moderate symptoms, treatment is conservative. Primary care providers or pediatricians can closely monitor patients who are asymptomatic and have no local or systemic manifestations. Patients with serious manifestations such as respiratory failure and cyanosis should be referred to a thoracic surgeon for lobectomy.
