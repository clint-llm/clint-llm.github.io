Percutaneous toxicity is uncommon after the conventional use of minoxidil. There is no known antidote for minoxidil toxicity after massive oral ingestion. Accidental oral ingestion of minoxidil can result in vomiting and does rarely require hospitalization. There are reported cases of hypotension, tachycardia, and/or electrocardiogram (ECG) changes after accidental ingestion. Intravenous fluids and vasopressor agents may manage refractory hypotension. Gastric wash and activated charcoal may be necessary to prevent systemic toxicity in massive accidental ingestions of minoxidil.****reported for a young girl where she accidentally ingested a minoxidil cutaneous solution intended for her father. Side effects like hypotension and persistent tachycardia were observed after ingestion.
