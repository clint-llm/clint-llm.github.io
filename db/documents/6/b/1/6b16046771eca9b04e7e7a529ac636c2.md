DPP-4 is an abundant enzyme present on the surface of most cells. It rapidly deactivates someÂ incretin hormones, such as glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). These hormones are both released by intestinal cells in response to a meal. Antagonizing DPP-4 slows incretin metabolism, prolonging active postprandial incretin levels, resulting in increased insulin synthesis and release and decreased glucagon secretion, all of which can help regulate glucose homeostasis.

The drug has a half-life of approximately 21 hours and is excreted in the urine (76%) and feces (13%).
