Most physicians have heard of OMT or work alongside many osteopathic physicians (D.O.s). However, many physicians do not know the utility of these treatments and the wide range of techniques available to trained providers.

Understanding this technique can show other providers the breadth of non-invasive treatment options for musculoskeletal complaints. In addition, in an outpatient setting, physicians and other providers will be able to help improve patients' quality of life and pain within a few minutes.

In an inpatient setting, an understanding of OMT gives the healthcare team more options for improving the patient's pain and discomfort and hopefully decreasing the length of hospital stay. With the information on OMT expanding in the medical community, many providers will and should have opportunities to learn these techniques and their underlying principles.
