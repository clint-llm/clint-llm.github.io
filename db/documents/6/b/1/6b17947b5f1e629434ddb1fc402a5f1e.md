The lungs play an essential role in stabilizing the biochemical environment necessary to preserve vital metabolic processes. They directly participate in the regulation and maintenance of acid-base status through oxygen transport and carbon dioxide excretion. The lungs are controlled by medullary centers in the brain which activate or inhibit the contraction of respiratory muscles. These are guided by chemoreceptors, both peripherally and centrally, which sense changes in hydrogen ions (H+) and cause changes in alveolar ventilation to normalize pH and achieve homeostasis. Although this process is well controlled, it is vulnerable to transient or prolonged external insults including toxins and medications as well as obstructive and restrictive lung processes. These insults may decrease or amplify the effectiveness of the bodyâ€™s ability to cause changes in alveolar ventilation. The carbon dioxide response curve is a representation of the physiologic response of the arterial content of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) on minute ventilation. Here we will discuss the carbon dioxide response curve and the effects that external forces cause on the curve.
