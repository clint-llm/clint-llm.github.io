Hypnic headache is thought to be about 0.07% of all patients that come to the office with the chief complaint of headache.

In the geriatric population, the ratio is 1.4%, according to an Italian study.

However, in recent years HH is thought to be slightly more common than in previous studies. It is estimated to be 0.3% to 0.6% in a French study.
