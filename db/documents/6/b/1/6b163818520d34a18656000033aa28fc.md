The most common complication of any facial cosmetic procedure is dissatisfaction, which is best minimized with appropriate preoperative counseling and patient selection, but numerous other adverse outcomes can occur.

Hematomas are comparatively common and more likely to occur within the first 24 hours of surgery; they are most common in males due to the relatively greater blood supply required to support facial hair follicles. Later in the course of healing, other fluid collections may arise, such as seromas or sialoceles. The former is best addressed with needle drainage and a compression dressing; the latter may also respond to a compression dressing and can be ameliorated with botulinum toxin injections into the parotid gland. Permanent facial nerve injury occurs in <1% of patients, but rates of temporary weakness are slightly higher, up to 2.6%.

Other complications include wound infection, pixie ear deformity - when the lobule is pulled inferiorly by excessive downward tension applied during the closure - poor scarring and alopecia, which may also result from closure under excessive tension, and skin necrosis from poor microcirculation in the flap. Ectropion may occur, particularly when a subciliary approach is employed if excessive tension or cautery are used. First bite syndrome has also been reported as an uncommon sequela of face lifting.
