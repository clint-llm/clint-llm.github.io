The MGS closely resembles an optic nerve head coloboma. Optic nerve coloboma is characterized by a large excavation which is usually decentred inferiorly, corresponding to the position of the embryonic fissure.

Coloboma may occur with systemic conditions such as CHARGE syndrome (ocular **C**oloboma,**H**eart defects, choanal**A**tresia, growth**R**etardation,**G**enital abnormalities, and**E**ar abnormalities), Walker-Warburg syndrome, Aicardi syndrome, Goldenhar syndrome, and Goltz dermal hypoplasia.

MGS is characterized by a central excavated or conical optic disc. It is not decentred inferiorly. It has a central glial tissue and peripapillary pigmentary disturbance, not present in optic coloboma. The retinal vessels exit radially from the morning glory disc, while in optic coloboma, they exit in a branching fashion. Microcornea and iris coloboma are not seen in MGS. It is associated with persistent hyaloid tissue, lid hemangiomas, retinal gliosis, peripapillary contractile staphyloma, optic disc pit, lens coloboma, glaucoma, and Duane’s retraction.

Optic nerve head avulsion (ONHA) can mimic MGS. ONHA is seen after severe blunt trauma.

Optic nerve aplasia (ONA) is another differential to consider. ONA is a congenital anomaly characterized by the absence of the optic nerve head, optic nerve fibers, retinal vessels, and retinal ganglion cells. The patient presents with nil perception of light and afferent pupillary defect. Fundus evaluation reveals an absent optic nerve head and retinal blood vessels. USG B-scan shows an absent optic nerve shadow.

MGS can be confused with optic disc pit (ODP). ODP is a unilateral, single, oval, grey-white excavation in the inferotemporal quadrant of the optic disc. The size of the pit is 1/8 -1/4 of the optic disc size.

Advanced glaucomatous optic neuropathy (AGON) can mimic MGS. AGON is characterized by a generalized or focal enlargement of the cup with a vertical cup disc ratio of 0.9. There is thinning of the neuroretinal rim generally at superior and inferior poles. There is nasalization of vessels and baring of circumlinear vessels. Parapapillary atrophy and laminar dots are present.

Peripapillary staphyloma is another differential that needs to be considered. It is a congenital anomaly in which a deep fundus excavation is present around a normal optic nerve head.
