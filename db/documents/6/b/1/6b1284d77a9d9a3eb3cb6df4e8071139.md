The management of a patient with iritis is interprofessional. Whenever a patient presents with eye pain, tearing, photophobia, vision loss, and red-eye in the absence of trauma, the patient must be referred to an ophthalmologist as soon as possible. The treatment of iritis primarily aims to reduce inflammation and pain and prevent complications. First-line treatment involves topical cycloplegics (dilate the pupil, prevent the ciliary body and pupillary spasm) and topical steroids (decrease inflammation). Depending on the cause, most patients respond well to treatment and retain full vision. However, at least 10Â to 30% of patients may need treatment beyond steroids to prevent vision loss.
