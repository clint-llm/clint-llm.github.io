The history and physical exam findings will guide which laboratory tests and imaging to order to determine the etiology of the water hammer pulse. Examples may include testing thyroid-stimulating hormone or T4 in a patient with suspected thyrotoxicosis, a urine pregnancy test in a woman of childbearing age, genetic testing for Marfan, rheumatological blood work for collagen vascular diseases, complete blood count for anemia, and abdominal ultrasound for cirrhosis.

Chronic aortic regurgitation is one of the more common causes of the water hammer pulse. Therefore, echocardiography such as aÂ transesophageal echocardiogram may be necessary. Examination of the anatomy of the valve, quantifying the amount of aortic regurgitation, defining aortic morphology and size, and evaluating the mechanism of regurgitation between types 1 to 3 will be essential. These actions are particularly helpful to determine whether surgery or valve repair is necessary.
