As brodalumab is an immune-modulating medication, most adverse reactions to therapy relate to an increased risk of infection.

- Nasopharyngitis (27%)

- Upper respiratory tract infections (20%)

- Arthralgia (16%)

- Back pain (11%)

- Gastroenteritis (10%)

- Influenza (9%)

- Oropharyngeal pain (9%)

- Sinusitis (9%)

Researchers noted mild to moderate oral candidiasis in five patients (3%), and there were reports of injection site reactions in fifteen patients (8%). Additionally, a total of 15 patients (8%) reported serious adverse events. Four patients had to withdraw treatment due to infection. Transient grade-2 absolute neutrophil abnormalities occurred in four patients (2%), but all casesÂ achieved resolution without modification in treatment. There are also several reported cases of grade-3 neutropenia.

Furthermore, while not directly establishing a causal relationship, four completed suicides, including one case ruled as indeterminate, were reported in patients receiving brodalumab during phase 3 clinical trials. Therefore, package inserts for brodalumab include a boxed warning for increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior. Patients must be informed about this increased risk and should receive a referral to a mental health professional in the event of new or increasing thoughts of suicide or depression. Brodalumab is only available through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program.
