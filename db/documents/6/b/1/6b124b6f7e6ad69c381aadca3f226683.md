Painful red swelling of the feet and hands in a patient receiving chemotherapy suggests the diagnosis. A high degree of suspicion is the key to diagnosis in patients receiving chemotherapeutic agents. The problem may also occur in patients with bone marrow transplants, as the clinical and histologic features may mimic cutaneous manifestations of graft-versus-host disease.

Dangerous graft-versus-host disease must be differentiated from benign palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia. Patients with graft-versus-host disease will have progression to other body parts whereas PPE will be limited to hands and feet. Serial biopsies every 3 to 5 days may help in differentiating the two disorders.
