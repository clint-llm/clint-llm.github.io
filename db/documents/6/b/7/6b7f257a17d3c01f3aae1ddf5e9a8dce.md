Hydroureter and hydronephrosis are common entities encountered in primary care medicine, emergency medicine as well as nephrology and urology practices. Hydronephrosis is defined as dilatation and distension of the renal collecting system of one or both kidneys due to obstruction of urine outflow distal to the renal pelvis (i.e., ureter, urinary bladder, and urethra). Dilation of the ureter due to obstruction of urine outflow is called hydroureter.

The urinary system is a complex, multi-component organ system that has the primary function of maintaining body homeostasis by regulating the volume of body fluid, electrolyte balance, and excretion of metabolic end products through a final product called urine. Anatomically it includes the kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra. Each kidney has an outer cortex and an inner medulla, which is formed into renal pyramids that extend into the renal pelvis, which is continued as the ureter. Hydronephrosis and hydroureter can present independently or together. They occur in all age groups. The presentation can be acute or chronic, physiologic (very common in pregnant females) or pathologic, unilateral, or bilateral.
