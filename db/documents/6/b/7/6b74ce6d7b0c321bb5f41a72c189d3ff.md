Ziconotide is a synthetic version of a peptide found in the venom of a marine snail, Conus magus. Specifically, it is a 25 amino acid polybasic peptide. Ziconotide blocks N-type voltage-gated calcium channels found in the A-delta and C afferent pain fibers in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.Â Blockade of this calcium channel inhibits neurotransmitter release from nociceptive afferents and subsequent pain transmission. Ziconotide does not bind to opioid receptors. It is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant.
