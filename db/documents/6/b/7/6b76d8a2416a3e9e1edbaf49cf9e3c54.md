Diagnosis begins with a full eye examination, with emphasis on biomicroscopy, which was the original technique to observe the physical findings on the cornea.

Staining of histologic slides is crucial to diagnose some forms of CD, as it may lead to the type of substance deposited in the cornea. Many dystrophies that include a mutation in TGFBI, like LCD and GCD, will stain positive for Congo red, as these dystrophies produce an amyloid-like disease.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is often involved in academic investigations of CD, but it can also be used to confirm the diagnosis in some dystrophies.
