In 2005, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) concluded that there was insufficient data to make recommendations as to when to perform this procedure. Most agree that it be considered in a maternal arrest with pregnancy greater than 23 weeks gestation. Although data regarding the optimal time to delivery post-arrest is limited, in a hospital setting, survival drastically decreases when the time from maternal death to delivery reaches 5 minutes. Hence a 4-minute rule has become standard: Maternal CPR for 4 minutes, infant delivery by the fifth minute

The procedure itself, though uncomplicated, creates intense anxiety and fear among providers for obvious reasons. It is done rapidly, and, while preferably performed by an obstetrician, may be done by advanced prehospital providers, trauma surgeons, and emergency medicine physicians. One should not delay assessing fetal heart tones. Simultaneously with maternal resuscitation and perimortem section, the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and other medical personnel should be preparing for the infant(s) resuscitation.

The following are the steps for the procedure:

- The maternal patient is placed in the left lateral decubitus position and if time permits, a Foley is placed for bladder decompression.

- The surgeon makes an incision from the xiphoid to the symphysis pubis, through all layers of the abdominal wall.

- The bladder should be decompressed via the previously placed Foley catheter. It is retracted manually.

- A second vertical uterine incision is made from the fundus toward the bladder, taking care not to incise too deeply and cause penetrating trauma to the fetus.

- The fetus is bluntly delivered from the uterus.

- As in usual deliveries, suction is performed orally, then nasally.  The cord is clamped and cut.

- Resuscitation continues on the maternal patient and resuscitation begins on the neonate. Note that there is likely to be a large amount of pooled blood in the abdominal-pelvic cavities. Along with the large uterus, resuscitation efforts will be difficult.
