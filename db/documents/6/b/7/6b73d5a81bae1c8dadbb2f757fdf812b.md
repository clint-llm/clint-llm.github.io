- Non-convulsive status epilepticus: Usually occurs after a prolonged seizure and may have minor ictal motor manifestations, but does not show improvement. EEG will show ictal activity.

- Cerebrovascular accident (stroke): This may be distinguished by CT angiography, brain MRI, magnetic resonance angiography, or head CT scan. Care must be taken with the interpretation of a perfusion CT scan, as there could be hypoperfusion following a focal or generalized epileptic seizure similar to a stroke.

- Hemiplegic migraine: This is a rare genetic mutation or familial migraine variant in which the patient presents with severe, typically, unilateral headache, weakness, ataxia, or paralysis.

- Hemiconvulsion (Hemiplegia epilepsy syndrome): This clinical syndrome of infancy or early childhood (generally < 4 years old) is characterized by prolonged hemispheric seizure activity during a febrile disease, resulting in hemispheric atrophy and flaccid hemiplegia followed by focal seizures with an interval of months to years.

- Hypoglycemia: It is a well-known mimic of stroke syndromes.

- Psychogenic non-epileptic seizure: Presentation varies in intensity and does not follow an anatomic progression. Patients will fake an unresponsive state and will show a fast recovery, and can mimic episodes of postictal paresis.
