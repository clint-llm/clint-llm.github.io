The role of transdermal administration of dopamine agonists (DA) is under investigation to improve treatment outcomes in patients with PD. In many patients, switching from oral DA such as pramipexole to transdermal DA such as rotigotine proved beneficial. These include ones with swallowing difficulties and gastrointestinal symptoms. Gastroparesis significantly reduces the absorption of oral medicines, minimizing its therapeutic benefit. Transdermal rotigotine bypasses GI reducing the incidence of nausea and vomiting and preventing the problem of absorption due to gastroparesis. Transdermal patches are an effective alternative in patients on pramipexole undergoing surgery. Many patients had switched to rotigotine before surgery and restarted pramipexole post-operatively. Neurologists and anesthesiologists agree that the transdermal route can be as effective as oral DA in controlling PD symptoms preoperatively.

In patients with renal impairment, transdermal rotigotine can be used instead of pramipexole and other renally excreted oral DA. Evidence suggests that the route of administration and formulation of the DA influences the occurrence of impulse control disorder (ICD). Studies show that the incidence of ICD in patients treated with transdermal rotigotine is lower than in patients treated with oral PD agents like pramipexole. ICDs are attributed to the D3 selectivity of oral DA. Rotigotine being less selective to D3 poses a smaller risk of ICD.

Pramipexole is well known to improve depressive symptoms in patients with PD through direct dopaminergic stimulation. Its efficacy has been recently explored in the cases of bipolar depression and treatment-resistant depression (TRD). A case report from France suggested that a combination of selegiline and pramipexole effectively treated TRD. One study indicated that pramipexole could effectively treat depression resistant to electroconvulsive therapy.

Given the evolving information regarding therapy with pramipexole, therapy requires the efforts of an interprofessional team that includes clinicians, specialists, nurses, and pharmacists, each contributing from their areas of expertise and working collaboratively with other disciplines. Clinicians should prescribe pramipexole and titrate the dose as per the patient's clinical needs. Before administration, nurses can verify the dose and counsel the patients on potential adverse drug reactions. Pharmacists should perform medication reconciliation and check for any potential dosing errors. All health care team members need to communicate openly to contribute to optimized therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse events.[Level 5]
