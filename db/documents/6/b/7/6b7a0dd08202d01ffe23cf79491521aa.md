The embryologic development of structures located within the retroperitoneum is categorized based on the location they originated from within the abdomen. Retroperitoneal structures can be primarily or secondarily retroperitoneal. Primarily retroperitoneal structures are those that were retroperitoneal during the entirety of development. These structures include the adrenal glands, kidneys, ureters, abdominal aorta, inferior vena cava, and anal canal. Structures considered to be secondarily retroperitoneal were initially suspended in the mesentery, and then later migrated behind the peritoneum during development. These structures include the duodenum (except for the first segment), ascending and descending portions of the colon, and the pancreas (except for the tail).
