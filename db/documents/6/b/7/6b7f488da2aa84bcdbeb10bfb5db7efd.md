In hypotonic labor, consultations may become necessary. A patient under the care of a trained obstetric nurse or midwife may require consultations with an obstetrician. In a health facility without an obstetrician, or where provision for cesarean section and instrumental vaginal delivery is unavailable; an early referral to a higher level of care is recommended if protracted labor is diagnosed or anticipated.

At the accepting health facility, the care team must include an obstetrician who should be consulted ahead of a transfer and all records on the progress of labor provided.

Supportive consultation with the anesthetists and pharmacists is recommended where analgesic or anesthetic support is required. Their involvement is necessary during situations of oxytocin complications (hypotension, tachysystole, or oxytocin hypersensitivity).
