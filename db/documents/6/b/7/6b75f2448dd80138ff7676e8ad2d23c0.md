Equipment required for EBP includes a standard epidural kit and an 18-gauge or 20-gaugeÂ angiocatheter from which to draw autologous blood in a sterile fashion. The author prefers to place the catheter and cap it off and saline flush to expedite autologous blood draw once access to the epidural space is achieved.
