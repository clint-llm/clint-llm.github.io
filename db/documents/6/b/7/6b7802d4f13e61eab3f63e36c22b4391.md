Poly-L-lactic acid is microparticles of lyophilized, alpha-hydroxy acid polymers similar in structure to the polyglactin 910 suture material manufacturedÂ in powder form. Poly-L-lactic acid comes in a carton containing two vials. Each vial contains 367.5 g of product and is reconstituted with 4 mL of sterile water and 1 mL of lidocaine, producing a 5 mL suspension of 4.45% poly-L-lactic acid. Higher dilution volumes can be used. Once diluted, it should be allowed to stand undisturbed for 2 to 4 hours and swirled immediately before injection to ensure an even suspension of particles. Some injectors recommend dilution 24 to 72 hours before injection to allow appropriate saturation of the powder.

The product does not require refrigeration once reconstituted. The poly-L-lactic acid is placed into the deep dermis or subcutaneous tissue using a 26-gauge needle, roughly one vial per side of the face. Various injection techniques can be used, including linear threading, depot injection in small volumes, and cross-hatching. Massage should be performed during and after the injection to ensure an even distribution of the material. The patient should apply ice packs to the treatment areas to reduce erythema and swelling.
