The teres major is supplied by the posterior circumflex humeral artery and the thoracodorsal branch of the subscapular artery.

The posterior humeral circumflex artery arises from the third most distal portion of the axillary artery and travels posteriorly through the quadrangular space and around the humeral neck. The axillary nerve travels with the posterior humeral circumflex artery through the quadrangular space. The quadrangular space is made up of the teres major (superior), teres minor (inferior), long head of triceps brachii (medial), and the surgical neck of the humerus (lateral). Along its course, the posterior humeral circumflex artery supplies the teres major, teres minor, deltoid, and long head of the triceps.

The axillary artery gives rise to the subscapular artery, the largest branch of its distal portion, and supplies the latissimus dorsi along with the intercostal muscles and serratus anterior. The subscapular artery has two branches: the circumflex scapular artery and the thoracodorsal artery. This thoracodorsal artery travels inferomedially, running across the lateral angle of the scapula. Throughout its course, this artery supplies the teres major, serratus anterior, subscapularis, and latissimus dorsi.
