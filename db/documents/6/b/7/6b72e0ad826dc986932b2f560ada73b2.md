Rapid assessment of the airway is critical. In one study, patient age as well as edema involving the oral cavity and/or the oropharynx, were predictive of the need for airway intervention while involvement of other sites, etiology and sex were not

If definitive airway management is needed, direct laryngoscopy may be difficult or even impossible due to the inevitable distorted airway anatomy, making awake fiberoptic intubation an attractive alternative. Providers may consider preserving the patientâ€™s respiratory effect during intubation with only mild sedation and no paralysis since the intubation has a high probability of being difficult. Because of this, advance preparation for cricothyrotomy is key in case airway securement becomes impossible.
