Targeting the semilunar ganglion in Meckel’s cave by utilizing anatomic landmarks or image-guided by fluoroscopy or computed tomography may be effective for patients with refractory facial pain due to trigeminal neuralgia, certain headaches, conditions such as recalcitrant herpes zoster ophthalmicus and postherpetic neuralgia. This option is generally considered when medical management with maximal oral analgesia (typically carbamazepine) has been trialed and not provided adequate pain relief. The procedure may also be an option in cases where neurosurgical management is not practical.

The procedure was first described by Belber et al. in 1987

Once access is gained, either balloon compression, glycerol infiltration, or radiofrequency thermocoagulation of the semilunar ganglion can be performed to provide a therapeutic effect.
