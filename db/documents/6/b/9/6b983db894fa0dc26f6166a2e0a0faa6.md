Electronic fetal monitoring is widely utilized intrapartum to assess fetal status, to prevent adverse neonatal outcomes such as fetal asphyxia or cerebral palsy. This activity reviews the physiology, consequences, and management of variable decelerations. Electronic fetal monitoring is used during labor in an attempt to ensure fetal well-being. Interpreting fetal heart rate tracings is complicated, and variable decelerations are just one aspect of that interpretation.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of variable decelerations.
- Review the evaluation of variable decelerations. 
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for variable decelerations. 
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding fetal heart rate tracings and improve outcomes.
