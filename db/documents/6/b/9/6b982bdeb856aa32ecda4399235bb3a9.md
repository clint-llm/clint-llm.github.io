Given the depth of the subclavian arteries supply, a multitude of conditions can occur either through congenital defects, years of pathologic change or idiopathic causes. An aberrant subclavian artery is one that does not arise from the normal location and as such may have an altered pathway in the thorax. Although symptoms are usually benign, in some cases they may cause esophageal narrowing due to a vascular ring compressing the esophagusÂ or voice changes from pressure placed on the recurrent laryngeal nerve.

A similar cause of diminished pulses due to subclavian narrowing is an inflammatory condition called Takayasu arteritis. In this instance, inflammation causes pathological narrowing of the subclavian arteries which may be bilateral. Clinically one may find patients without a radial pulse and may auscultate bruits in the anterior lateral upper thorax.
