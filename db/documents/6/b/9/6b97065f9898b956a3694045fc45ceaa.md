The meninges plays a role in numerous pathological conditions. Bacterial meningitis (BM) is a condition where one gets inflammation of the meninges due to bacteria invading the subarachnoid space, most commonly by the pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitides.

Traumatic and atraumatic intracranial hemorrhages within different locations of the meninges are a common set of conditions that are directly related to the structure and function of the meninges and can be classified by their specific location within the meningeal layers. For example, an epidural hematoma is the collection of blood in the tight potential space between the dura and the skull (i.e., the epidural space).
