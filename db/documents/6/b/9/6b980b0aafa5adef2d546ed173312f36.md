With aging, the periorbital soft tissues migrate inferiorly, potentially creating both functional and cosmetic concerns for the patient. Many techniques, both surgical and non-surgical, have been developed for the management of this age-related process. This activity describes the direct brow lift procedure and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients who undergo surgery for facial rejuvenation, primarily relating to the direct brow lift.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures of significance in the direct brow lift. 
- Describe the equipment/personnel required for a direct brow lift procedure.
- Review the potential complications of the direct brow lift.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the surgical success of the direct brow lift and improve outcomes.
