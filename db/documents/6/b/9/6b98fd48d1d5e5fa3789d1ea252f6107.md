Vascular smooth muscle dysfunction primarily contributes to calcium deposition within the blood vessel walls; this cascade occurs through microvesicle release with subsequent dysregulation of mineralization inhibitors leading to extracellular calcium deposition within the intimal and medial layers of the vessel. Alternatively, although there are reports of intracellular calcium deposition, the precise incidence and significance of the pathophysiology remain unknown at this current time. Computed tomography coronary angiography (CCTA) is a non-invasive diagnostic modality that can detect both medial and intimal coronary vessel calcification with accuracy.
