In the absence of glucose-6-phosphatase, gluconeogenesis is impaired and this precipitates fasting hypoglycemia. This event can occur in Von Gierke's disease when this enzyme is deficient. Von Gierke disease takes an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Glycogenolysis is also limited in the absence of glucose-6-phosphatase because normally when glycogen is broken down to glucose-1-phosphate moiety, it is then converted to glucose-6-phosphate which requires glucose-6-phosphatase to convert it to usable glucose. So in the absence of this enzyme, gluconeogenesis, and glycogenolysis are both impaired. In addition to fasting hypoglycemia, other associated irregularities include hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, and increased lactate levels.
