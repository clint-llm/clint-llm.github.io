Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) has sustained a niche for measuring bone mineral density since its approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use in 1988. The Bone Mass Measurements act in 1998 solidified its validity in light of other diagnostic modalities such as chemical analysis, direct dissection and ashing, quantitative ultrasonography, and later on against CT/MRI images. DEXA is comparatively inexpensive with notably shorter scan times and radiation exposure compared to other imaging options, and there is a long-standing consensus regarding guidelines for interpreting DEXA images. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications of DEXA and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with osteoporosis.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).

- Describe the contraindications for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).
- Review the clinical significance of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).
- Explain the importance of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with osteoporosis and improving their outcomes.
