The management of a diabetic foot ulcer is very complex and if not treated properly can lead to premature amputation. Patients receiving HBO2 still must be followed for regular wound care visits which include regular measurements of the wound, aggressive surgical debridement, appropriate culture-directed antibiotics, good glycemic control with blood sugar goal of 150 or less at all times, and appropriate offloading. The successful treatment and healing of a DFU require an interprofessional team consisting of a hyperbaric medicine specialist/wound care specialist, primary care physician, podiatrist, wound care nurse, and sometimes, endocrinologist and vascular surgeon.

At each visit, the wound must be examined and complete reliance on HBO for cure is not realistic. Without adequate blood supply, no wound can be expected to heal.
