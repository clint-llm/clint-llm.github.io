Muscle energy techniques provide an efficient and relatively safe route of treatment for patients presenting with a multitude of complaints, from low back pain to constipation. Interprofessional communication amongst clinicians treating patients with persistent low back pain despite pharmacologic therapy, including spinal injections and even narcotic analgesics, is particularly important as MET may be a treatment option that the healthcare team has not yet considered. Understanding the principles behind osteopathic medicine used in diagnosing structural dysfunctions, and the knowledge of the capacity for manual manipulation successfully correcting such dysfunctions, allows clinicians opportunities to treat their patients with less invasive and nonpharmacologic options, in hopes of restoring any loss of productivity and happiness in their life due to persistent pain.

In attempts to gain ground in the fight against the opioid epidemic, care coordination by health care professionals through referring patients for osteopathic evaluations and utilizing MET as treatment strategies will enhance patient-centered care and potentially improve favorable outcomes for patients suffering from conditions related to sacral dysfunctions.
