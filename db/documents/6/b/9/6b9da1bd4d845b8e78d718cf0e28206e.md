Patients who have mild QTc elongation or a history of blood pressure fluctuations should have close monitoring throughout treatment regarding the potential development of orthostatic hypotension and QTc interval that exceeds 500 msec. This monitoring is achievable through an echocardiogram and blood pressure measurements. Additionally, the clinician should monitor patients in the first seven days of treatment for efficacy. In instances of resistant disease, clinicians should consider utilizing either a combination or a different therapy modality. Moreover, the CYP2D6 enzyme has been shown to metabolize phenothiazines, and patients possessing reduced amounts of the enzyme require monitoring throughout treatment for increased toxicity. Patients should continue taking phenothiazines for 12 months after the remission of their first psychotic episode to reduce the relapse of symptoms.

Approximately 10% to 30% of patients taking phenothiazines don't display improvement in their symptoms after several rounds of administration, while 30% to 60% showcase partial or not sufficient improvement in their symptoms following usage. It is crucial to monitor these patients for the efficacy of the medications and to undertake a different form of treatment if the results are not satisfactory.
