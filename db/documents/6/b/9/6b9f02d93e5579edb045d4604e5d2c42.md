The DID person, per the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation, is described as a person who experiences separate identities that function independently of each other and are autonomous of each other. The International Society describes alternate identities or alters as independent identities which have their own distinct behaviors, have memories that are distinct from others, and even may differ in language and expressions used. Signs of a switch to an altered state include trance-like behavior, eye blinking, eye-rolling, and changes in posture.

The major hypothesis by Putnam et al. is that “alternate identities result from the inability of many traumatized children to develop a unified sense of self that is maintained across various behavioral states, particularly if the traumatic exposure first occurs before the age of 5 “.
