The liver can be involved in many pathologies so only a few of the most common conditions will be mentioned. When the exocrine function of the liver is impaired either by physical blockage of the bile ducts or hepatocyte damage or dysfunction of conjugation, bilirubin concentration raises in the blood. This manifests as a yellowing of the skin and sclera referred to jaundice and can be associated with itching, mental status changes, edema, and spider vessels.

The liver is highly vascular and is the main site for portocaval anastomosis. Patients with portal hypertension often exhibit signs of venous congestion at points of portocaval anastomoses. This can lead to esophageal varices, rectal hemorrhoids, and caput medusae.

Budd-Chiari syndrome is the blockage of hepatic venous drainage caused by thrombosis of one or more of the major hepatic veins. This condition should be considered in patients with hypercoagulable states that present with signs of portal hypertension, such as ascites, jaundice, or varices. Patients with right heart failure may also present with these signs due to back-up of blood through the inferior vena cava, but these patients are not considered to have Budd-Chiari syndrome. The diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome is made with ultrasound and/or MRI.
