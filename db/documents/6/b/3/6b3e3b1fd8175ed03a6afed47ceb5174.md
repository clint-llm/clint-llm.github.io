A thorough history can narrow the broad differential diagnosis for vision changes in preeclampsia. Prior pregnancy history, ocular history, medical history, therapeutic interventions, specific descriptions of the visual deficit, and the time-course of visual symptoms are all crucial in determining the etiology of the visual disturbance. Patients' complaints of blurry vision may be specified to include diplopia, visual field defects, metamorphopsia, or other distortions.

Physical examination of patients with intracerebral causes of visual impairment can reveal concomitant neurological deficits associated with the location of pathology. Dilated fundus examination findings are common in patients with preeclampsia and most commonly include arterial narrowing, indicative of the hypertensive state. Additional findings may include peripapillary thickening, choroidal thickening, cotton wool spots, retinal hemorrhages, retinal edema, serous retinal detachments, optic nerve edema, or vitreous hemorrhage.
