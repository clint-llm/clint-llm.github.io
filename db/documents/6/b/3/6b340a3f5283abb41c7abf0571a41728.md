The management of inhalation injury is done with an interprofessional team that consists of an emergency department clinician, nurse practitioner, pulmonologist, trauma surgeon, burn specialist, and an intensivist. The key is to ensure a patent airway and prevent worsening of the injury. Smoke inhalation not only causes direct thermal damage to the airways but the patient may have inhaled combustion products like carbon monoxide and cyanide; thus the healthcare workers must be aware of this. The treatment is largely supportive, and a low threshold for intubation is important for patient survival. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has shown some promise for inhalation injury, including carbon monoxide poisoning, but is not standard of care dueÂ and has limited availability.

The outcomes of patients with inhalation injury depend on the severity of inhalation, need for ventilation, the presence of other injuries and comorbidities, and advanced age. [Level 5]
