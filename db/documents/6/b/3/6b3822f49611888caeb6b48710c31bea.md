It is always good to have an inhouse microbiologist so that reporting of direct smears can be done at the earliest. Ophthalmologist and a rheumatologist should also work hand in hand. Many patients are referred to a rheumatologist by an ophthalmologist for systemic evaluation and starting immunomodulators. The patients need to follow at both places. An ophthalmologist can suggest a rheumatologist for titrating the dose of immunomodulators based on clinical response. Apart from these, patients are alsoÂ evaluated for any adverse effect profile. These kinds of work models not only ensure better clinical outcomes and patient safety but also a healthy work atmosphere.
