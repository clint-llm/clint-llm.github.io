Positron emission tomography (PET) is a prime example of molecular imaging, which has contributed immensely to understanding cardiac anatomy and pathophysiology over the last two decades. Similar to other molecular imaging, PET utilizes intrinsic tissue characteristics as the source of image contrast, which leads to a better understanding of integrative biology and provides earlier detection and accurate diagnosis of disease. This article reviews the role of PET scans in the assessment of cardiovascular disease and its protocol and interpretation by the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the role of PET scans in cardiovascular diseases.
- Review the commonly used protocols for a cardiac PET scan.
- Summarize cardiac PET scan analysis and interpretation.
- Outline how interprofessional teamwork can improve the diagnostic value of PET scans and drive better patient treatment and outcomes.
