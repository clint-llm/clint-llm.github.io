Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurs due to the presence of immunocompetent T lymphocytes in the graft attacking the immunodeficient recipient tissue due to histocompatibility differences within 100 days, causing tissue damage. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of graft versus host disease and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of graft versus host disease.
- Outline the physical exam findings for the prompt diagnosis of graft versus host disease.
- Summarize the management considerations for patients with graft versus host disease.
- Describe the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by graft versus host disease.
