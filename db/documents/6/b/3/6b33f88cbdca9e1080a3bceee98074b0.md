**Knee Osteochondral Allograft Transplantation**

**Dowel Technique**

- Medial or lateral parapatellar approach depending on lesion location.

- The first step is to identify the lesion and its size, and then it is templated with the use of a sizer.

- Once it is verified that the defect is completely covered by the sizer, measure the harvest area on the fresh allograft with the same sizer to ensure it is large enough to cover the lesion.

- Select the appropriate reamer according to the sizer.

- With the help of the template, position a guidewire being careful to do it perpendicular to the articular surface and right in the center of the lesion.

- With the help of the guidewire, insert the ream and drill the socket until an ideal 7 to 8 mm depth is reached, being careful not to exceed 10 mm in depth. Irrigate the cutting surfaces copiously during and after reaming to avoid heat necrosis to adjacent bone and cartilage.

- To avoid excessive pressure while inserting the allograft's plug, a dilator cylinder must be used to smoothen recipient site borders. Next, set a mark at 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions and measure each position's depth.

- In case the lesion is deeper than 10 mm, necrotic bone must be debrided with a manual rasp until the viable bleeding bone is reached, in that case, autologous iliac crest or proximal tibial graft can be obtained to fill the defect.

- The allograft is then prepared first by immersion in room temperature saline. Next, the allograft is set in an allograft workstation, and the intended harvest area is marked according to the appropriate sizer. The graft should be harvested at the same location as the defect on the recipient.

- A coring reamer is used to create a plug that is then trimmed with a rasp so that the plug fits with the measures of the recipient socket. Allograft must be copiously lavaged (1-2 L) with room temperature saline to remove remaining bone marrow elements and reduce any chance of an immune reaction.

- Following the marks performed in the recipient site, insert the allograft by pressing gently so that it remains firmly attached by a press fit. Avoid excessive impaction force during implantation. Excessive pressure leads to deleterious effects on chondrocyte viability.

- Verify that the allograft remains attached at the same surrounding cartilage height. If it is prominent by more than 0.5 mm, it must be extracted and corrected by smoothing the subchondral bone. On the other hand, if it is more than 1 mm lower than surrounding cartilage, it must be removed to insert bone graft until it matches the same height.

- Verify there is a full range of motion and possible impingements or a lack of stability.

Some large defects may require multiple osteochondral plugs. If so, a 1 to 3 mm bridge is left between each socket to avoid convergence between tunnels. Convergence creates free spaces between socket walls, thus leading to inadequate press fit.

**Shell Technique**

The shell technique is especially useful for very large and irregular defects because it allows handcrafting the shape and size of the graft. It is usually used for posterior femoral condyles, trochlea, or tibial plateau post-traumatic defects.

- The first step is to identify the lesion and define its borders by debriding its borders, carefully minimizing the damage to healthy cartilage.

- The bony surface of the lesion must be as flat as possible and at least 5 mm in depth. Necrotic and non-viable bone must be debrided.

- Once the recipient site has been defined, the graft is freehand crafted, allowing for some oversize.

- The graft is then gradually downsized until it fits perfectly with the recipient site, and then it can be fixed with absorbable pins or screws.
