**Hyperparathyroidism**

- Primary Hyperparathyroidism

- Secondary hyperparathyroidism - occurs most frequently in patients with chronic renal failure. Impaired renal function leads to an inability to reabsorb calcium or excrete phosphate properly. Potentially compounding this is a failure to activate vitamin D, further disrupting calcium homeostasis. Other, less common causes include severe vitamin D deficiency, malabsorption syndromes, and inadequate sun exposure. In secondary hyperparathyroidism, serum PTH is elevated, but serum calcium is low-normal to decreased.

- Tertiary Hyperparathyroidism - Most commonly occurs when hyperplastic parathyroid glands in secondary hyperparathyroidism patients begin to secrete PTH autonomously. This condition is often discovered when the chronic process causing secondary disease has resolved, e.g., in a renal transplant patient with a persistent increase in PTH. Lab results in tertiary hyperparathyroidism mimic primary hyperparathyroidism, with increases in both PTH and serum calcium.

****DiGeorge Syndrome****

**Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia**- a rare, genetically inherited syndrome, leading to proliferative lesions in various endocrine organs. There are several forms defined by the genes involved, but all have an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.
