Bacterial tracheitis is a serious disorder of the airways which is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a general otolaryngologist, laryngologist, head and neck reconstructive surgeon, pediatric otolaryngologist, anesthesiologist, infectious disease expert, intensivist, nursing staff, respiratory therapy, speech-language pathology, physical therapy, occupational therapy, case management, and social work. The condition can rapidly compromise the airway leading to sudden death if not promptly appropriately managed; therefore, proper identification by an emergency physician, medical team, nursing team, and/or respiratory therapy is crucially important. Pulmonary toilet is paramount, whether via voluntary coughing and nebulizer treatments with the addition of mucolytics in non-tracheostomy patientsÂ or via frequent suctioning and mechanical ventilation in tracheostomy-dependent or intubated patients. Surgical airways are rarely required but must be prepared for in patients without a tracheostomy. Besides antibiotics, the patient will need close monitoring and airway precautions, with a low threshold for intubation or tracheostomy if symptoms fail to respond to more conservative therapies. Some patients require prolonged mechanical ventilation, short-term tracheostomy, or long-term tracheostomy. The outcomes in immunocompromised patients are much more guarded.
