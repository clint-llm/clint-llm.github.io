No laboratory studies are specific for choledochal cysts.

**Radiology**

**Ultrasonography (US)******

Prenatally, choledochal cysts can be identified on abdominal ultrasound as a cystic structure in the region of the porta hepatis.

**Computed Tomography**Cholangiography**(CT Cholangiography)**

CT cholangiography can identify dilatation of the intrahepatic ducts, the distal common bile duct and the pancreatic duct with more accuracy than ultrasound, making this modality better for type IV and V cysts. The sensitivity of CT cholangiography is 90% for diagnosing choledochal cysts but only 64% for characterizing the pancreatic duct. Due to its ability to detect intraductal dilation as well as the extent of dilation, CT cholangiography is also beneficial for planning the surgical approach, such as the need for segmental lobectomy.

**Technetium-99 Hepatobiliary Iminodiacetic Acid scan (Technectium-99 HIDA scan)**

Technetium-99 HIDA scan can be used to distinguish between a choledochal cyst and biliary atresia in neonates. HIDA scan has a very high sensitivity (100%) to diagnose type I CCs, but this percentage drops to 67% when diagnosing type IVA CCs, because of the limited ability to detect intrahepatic duct dilation. This imaging study is also beneficial in detecting spontaneous rupture of the CCs where there would be leakage of the dye into the peritoneal cavity.

**Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)**

MRCP is the gold standard for the diagnosis of choledochal cyst with a very high sensitivity of 90% to 100%.

**Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)**

ERCP has the highest diagnostic accuracy for CCs, but due to its complications, exposure to ionizing radiation, and its invasive nature, its use has been limited in suspected cases of CC. It is believed that patients with long common pancreaticobiliary channels, sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, or dilated ducts have higher risks of developing ERCP associated complications.
