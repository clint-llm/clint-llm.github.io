Sympathetic blocks invariably shift the autonomic nervous system balance in the anesthetized nerve distribution, resulting in a variety of potentially dangerous physiologic effects. Patients undergoing these procedures should be appropriately monitored (typically with noninvasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and 5-lead electrocardiography). Intravenous access and availability of crystalloid solutions for infusion are strongly encouraged if hypotension is anticipated. Resuscitation equipment must be readily available as well.Depending on the image guidance technique used, a mobile C-arm X-ray image intensifier, ultrasound machine, computed tomography (CT), and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner may be used. Additionally, appropriately sized spinal needle(s) and syringes, blunt tip drawing needle, needle for skin infiltration, mask, bouffant, sterile gloves and drapes, topical antiseptics, contrast solution, and medications (i.e., local anesthetic, neurolytic, and/or adjuvant medications) will be needed.
