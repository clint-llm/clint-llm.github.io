Pediatric abusive head trauma (AHT), or shaken baby syndrome, most often involves shaking, blunt impact, or a combination of both in infants and young children, which can lead to neurological injury. The outcome of this condition ranges from complete recovery to significant brain damage and death. Brain and head injuries are the common causes of traumatic death in children less than 2 years old. These patients should be managed with the goal of maintaining low blood pressure, low intracranial pressure while ensuring adequate cerebral perfusion pressure. This activity outlines the diagnosis and management of pediatric abusive head trauma (shaken baby syndrome) and highlights the interprofessional team's role to manage those with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the expected outcome of a patient with abusive head trauma.
- Review the frequency of abusive head trauma.
- Outline the evaluation of a patient with suspected abusive head trauma.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team in identifying pediatric abusive head trauma.
