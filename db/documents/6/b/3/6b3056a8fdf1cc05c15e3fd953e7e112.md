**Laboratory**

Most patients present with elevated troponins, but there are no blood biomarkers currently available which distinguish spontaneous coronary artery dissection from other causes of ACS.

**Imaging**

The diagnosis of spontaneous coronary artery dissection in most patients is made at the time of coronary angiography. In patients for whom the diagnosis is not secured with coronary angiography, intracoronary imaging with optical coherence tomography (OCT) or intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) may be helpful.

The coronary angiographic appearance of spontaneous coronary artery dissection has been classified into three types:

- Type 1: Pathognomonic identifiable false lumen with a linear filling defect or dissection flap. There is often contrast hold-up in the false lumen after clearance of the true lumen (29% to 48%).

- Type 2: Diffuse, long, and smooth stenosis that can vary mild stenosis to complete occlusion (52% to 67%).

- Type 3: Mimics atherosclerosis with focal or tubular stenosis and requiring optical coherence tomography (OCT) or intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) to differentiate the cause (2% to 3.9%).

While spontaneous coronary artery dissection has been reported in all coronary segments, it has a frequent predilection for distal coronary segments. When proximal segments are involved, they more commonly have a type 1 appearance, and distal segments usually have a type 2 appearance. Left anterior descending artery is identified to be the most commonly affected vessel in majority studies.
