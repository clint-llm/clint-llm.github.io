The analgesic ladder was designed to be easily used even by non-pain medicine experts. However, the continued referral of patients to pain specialists proves otherwise.

Another limitation of the implementation of the strategy concerns the placement of drugs. Placing NSAIDs at the bottom of the ladder could lead to a false belief that this represents the most secure treatment. Patients often take these drugs in daily clinical practice, even for long periods. Also, long-term use of NSAIDs combined with opioids for treating moderate pain (second step) can lead to more severe side effects than those described for opioids.

A significant issue of concern regards the management of pure neuropathic pain. This type of pain has complex pathophysiology and mechanisms involving different regions of the central nervous system or specific peripheral nervous system structures. An injury in these regions can trigger a cascade of events culminating in peripheral and central sensitization. In this context, opioids have little or no efficacy, and other strategies are necessary.

Experts in pain medicine found the ladder approach one-dimensional as it concentrated only on the physical aspects of pain. For this reason, other methods have been proposed. For instance, the International Association For The Study Of Pain (IASP) suggested adopting a therapeutic approach more focused on the type of pain (i.e., mechanism) and the mechanism of action of the drugs used to treat it. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to use steroids or NSAIDs in chronic nociceptive pain on an inflammatory basis. On the other hand, low-inflammatory nociceptive pain should receive treatment with opioids and nonopioid analgesics. Finally, neuropathic pain may require antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and specific drugs in certain rheumatologic clinical conditions (e.g., colchicine to treat gout).

There are proposed suggestions to offer a more precise treatment methodology. Leung, for instance, suggested a new analgesic model represented as a platform where pain management follows a three-dimensional perspective that can combine with classical analgesics based on the pain condition.

More recently, Cuomo et al. proposed the "multimodal trolley approach," which emphasizes the physical, psychological, and emotional causes of pain.

The three main principles of the WHO analgesic ladder are: “By the clock, by the mouth, by the ladder.” This means that drugs should be taken regularly and at regular intervals, orally whenever possible, and analgesics should be prescribed starting at Step 1 (nonopioid analgesics) and titrated upward as needed. However, significant issues of concern with the WHO analgesic ladder have arisen over time. One problem is that it does not consider individual differences in pain tolerance or response to medications. Additionally, it is often difficult to accurately assess pain intensity when using this approach because it relies heavily on patient self-reporting. Furthermore, opioids are typically prescribed at Step 2 of the ladder without considering potential risks associated with their use, such as addiction or overdose. Finally, there is a lack of evidence-based research to support its efficacy and effectiveness in providing adequate pain relief for cancer patients.

Despite these issues of concern with the WHO analgesic ladder, it remains an essential tool for physicians in managing cancer-related pain. It provides a framework for understanding how different types of medications can be used to treat different levels of pain intensity and can help guide treatment decisions. However, more research is needed to better understand how this approach can be improved to provide effective and safe pain relief for cancer patients.
