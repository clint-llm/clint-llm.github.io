HPS is a fatal disease that drastically reduces the life span of a patient with liver disease. Most patients will have progressive vasodilation and worsening hypoxemia. Death without liver transplantation is inevitable, as no other medical therapies are currently available.

Post liver transplantation, 80 to 85% of the patients will have improved oxygenation and decreased AV shunts. However, certain patients can develop complications.

- Refractory hepatopulmonary syndrome - These patients fail to improve oxygenation or develop recurrent HPS after liver transplantation.

- Severe post-transplant hypoxemia is a failure to maintain oxygen saturation above 85%, even on 100% oxygen.

- Post-transplant portopulmonary hypertension is a rare complication.
