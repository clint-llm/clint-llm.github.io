# Continuing Education Activity

Left ventricular (LV) rupture is a catastrophic but a common occurrence with acute myocardial infarction patients. The incidence of LV free-wall rupture post-acute myocardial infarction is less than 1%, but mortality is extremely high without prompt surgical intervention. It can also occur in trauma, infections, and malignancies. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of rupture and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of left ventricular rupture emergencies.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of left ventricular rupture.
- Outline the management options available for left ventricular rupture.
- Explain the importance of interprofessional team collaboration and communication to improve patient outcomes in patients with left ventricular rupture.

# Introduction

Left ventricular (LV) rupture is a catastrophic but a common occurrence with acute myocardial infarction patients. Incidence of LV free-wall rupture post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is less than 1%, but mortality is extremely high.

# Etiology

The most common cause of left ventricular rupture is post-AMI. Risk factors associated with left ventricular free wall rupture are no prior history of angina or myocardial infarction, ST elevation in the initial EKG, peak CK-MB above 150 IU/L, female sex, age more than 70 years, anterior location, transmural infarction, and first infarction.

Iatrogenic causes include penetrating or blunt trauma from diagnostic catheterization, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (especially transapical approach), placement of temporary or permanent pacing catheters, balloon valvuloplasty, cardiac surgeries such as mitral valve replacement, and pericardiocentesis.

# Epidemiology

Two to four percent of AMIs have the complication of myocardial rupture.

# Pathophysiology

The right ventricle (RV), LV, right atrium (RA), and left atrium (LA), in the decreasing order of frequency, are the cardiac chambers involved. In the most common cause of the LV rupture (AMI), hemodynamic factors such as increased intracavitary pressure and structural weakness of the myocardium as demonstrated by the necrosis of myocytes, collagen matrix resolution and intense inflammation play important roles in leading to the rupture. It is most commonly observed within 3 to 5 days post-AMI. In the LV, rupture most commonly occurs in the anterior or the lateral wall at the mid-papillary level. Patients can rarely experience ventricular septal and papillary muscle rupture along with the LV free wall rupture. Other consequences are ventricular septal defect (VSD), acute mitral regurgitation (MR), pericardial tamponade, and formation of a pseudoaneurysm. The rupture is sealed by the epicardium or by a hematoma on the surface of the heart of certain patients who survive LV free wall rupture post-AMI. This is identified as LV diverticulum and indicates a subacute pathological state involving free rupture through the pericardial cavity and pseudoaneurysm development.

AMI is the most common cause of LV pseudoaneurysm development. It can also develop following surgical operations, in particular following the mitral valve replacement. As a consequence of cardiac compression between the sternum and the spine, direct impact on the heart (sternal trauma), or deceleration in the setting of an automobile collision, myocardial rupture can occur. This may cause a rupture of the free-wall, interventricular septum, and the papillary muscles. The myocardial injury occurs more often as a consequence of stabbing or gunshot wounds. In the setting of blunt trauma, the ventricular free-wall rupture will result in either pericardial tamponade (when the pericardial wound is obliterated) or intrathoracic hemorrhage which is common in stab wounds and gunshot wounds respectively.Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis.

# Histopathology

Myocardial rupture is typical during the period of collagen degradation and the formation of new fibrous tissue. Findings that favor the rupture post-AMI are intense inflammatory response, presence of matrix metalloproteinases, and intramyocardial hemorrhage.

# History and Physical

The most common cause of shock post-AMI within one day to three weeks is the myocardial rupture, out of which most occur in the first 3 to 5 days. They usually present as circulatory collapse or cardiogenic shock post- uncomplicated, small, first AMIs. Patients with systemic hypertension, older women, and patients with recurrent post-infarction angina are more prone to the myocardial rupture post-AMI.

Cardiogenic shock or hypovolemic shock is the presentation in traumatic myocardial rupture patients. Symptoms include dyspnea, chest pain, hypotension, cold extremities, and occasionally mental status changes. Some patients may manifest cerebral or systemic embolic events from pseudoaneurysms. As a consequence, ventriculopulmonary fistulas formation occurs, presenting as hemoptysis. Some patients present with pericarditis symptoms before the LV rupture post-AMI, such as pleuritic chest pain and friction rub. Tamponade presents with sudden onset bradycardia, clear lung fields, and distended neck veins. Kussmaul sign, muffled heart sounds, and pulsus paradoxus can be observed on physical examination. Hypovolemic shock may occur and manifests as hypotension, tachycardia, cool extremities, and pallor. Friction rubs may be heard in pseudoaneurysms.

# Evaluation

Physicians should have a low threshold in suspicion of myocardial rupture post-AMI. Early diagnosis and emergent surgical intervention can increase the survival rate of up to 75%. Cardiac injuries need to be considered in all high-velocity deceleration blunt traumas. A bedside transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the diagnostic modality of choice. LV wall motion abnormality or myocardial injury is often apparent. Tamponade is seen as pericardial effusion, diastolic RV collapse, atrial collapse, and inspiratory decrease in Doppler flow velocities across the mitral valve. Associated papillary muscle rupture may be seen as a tear in the muscle head or may appear as a mobile echo density that prolapses into the LA in systole. Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) can best accomplish the diagnosis promptly in the event of blunt thoracic trauma.

Pseudoaneurysm is seen as an echo-free space enlarging in systole and communicating with LV by a narrow neck. Chest X-ray (CXR) may show cardiomegaly with clear lung fields in LV rupture and pseudoaneurysm. Hemothorax may be observed with an associated tear of the pericardium. Mediastinal widening may also be seen in the event of aortic dissection. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be useful when TTE provides suboptimal images in stable patients such as pseudoaneurysm. Electrocardiography (ECG) showing persistent ST-segment elevation post-AMI is correlated with a high incidence of myocardial rupture.

# Treatment / Management

Surgical intervention is crucial in the treatment of LV rupture, while medical therapy can play a supporting role

LV free wall rupture is managed by resection of the infarcted area and closure of the area with polytetrafluoroethylene or polyester patches or by biologic glues. Surgical repair is recommended for pseudoaneurysms even if asymptomatic as they carry a high risk of rupture. Associated VSDs are closed by patch depending on the size. If there is associated papillary muscle rupture, it is treated with mitral valve replacement. Coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) is likely needed in most cases while treating mechanical complications post-AMI.

# Differential Diagnosis

- RV infarction: Right ventricular infarction can cause heart failure, and patients present with hypotension, distended neck veins, and clear lung fields.

- Cardiogenic shock: Patients present with hypotension, absence of hypovolemia, and clinical signs of poor perfusion.

- Hemorrhagic shock: Patients present with hemodynamic instability such as hypotension, tachycardia, and also decreased urine output, and altered mental status.

- Cardiogenic pulmonary edema: It can present post-papillary rupture, or VSD can be seen on CXR. A high index of suspicion of papillary muscle rupture is needed in patients with pulmonary edema, even in asymptomatic patients.

- MR: MR can occur from papillary muscle rupture and can present with acute pulmonary edema with manifestations of tachycardia, tachypnea, respiratory distress, diffuse pulmonary rales, and hypotension along with MR signs.

- Cardiac tamponade: It can be a consequence of LV rupture. It is more common with stab wounds. Patients present with dyspnea, tachycardia, and elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP).

# Prognosis

Etiology, size, and hemodynamic factors affect the prognosis of the condition. Hence, early diagnosis and immediate surgical intervention is the key.

# Complications

Cardiac tamponade and hemothorax are the two significant complications of the LV rupture.

# Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care

Postoperative management includes bed rest, blood pressure control, heart rate control, inotropic support, and avoidance of agitation.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

To establish and introduce successful postoperative educational strategies, awareness of the effects of the specific approach, mode of delivery, and dose of educational interventions is important. It is essential to understand the relationships of patient characteristics to outcomes. Physicians and nurses play a vital role in patient education. Content individualization, the usage of interactive media for delivery, one-on-one education provision, and the enhancement in educational and health outcomes in various sessions have shown good results.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

An interprofessional team that uses a comprehensive and structured postoperative care strategy will help achieve the best possible outcomes. The role of nursing care cannot be undermined, especially in the event of surgical wound infections. Consultation with a social worker and community nurses might be necessary if the patient needs to be discharged home with a drain. A physical therapist might be needed in the event of deep vein thrombosis with long term immobility in the hospital. Communication, joint decision making, and cooperation remain the keys to positive outcomes. Early detection of symptoms and signs is the key to decreasing mortality, especially in this acute critical condition of myocardial rupture. Hence, interprofessional treatment should include an organized care framework paired with an evidence-based approach to coordinating and reviewing all collaborative operations.[Level III]

To improve outcomes and decrease the high mortality in LV rupture, prompt consultation with an interprofessional group of specialists is recommended. While cardiothoracic surgeons and anesthesiologists play primary roles during surgical intervention, cardiologists and intensive care specialists play a predominant role in pre/post-surgical management. Nurses play an important role as they monitor the vital signs, pre and postoperative management, and patient education. The pharmacist must ensure that the patient is on the right analgesics, antiemetics, and antibiotics in the event of wound infection.

Postoperative management of the patients required interprofessional integrated work to improve outcomes. Bed rest is essential as it prevents arterial hypertension or hypertensive crisis and is to be carefully checked by nurses. Heart rate control, optimum inotropic support, and avoiding agitation are best achieved by cooperation between the physicians, pharmacists, and nurses. Inotropic support postoperatively prevents tissue hypoperfusion.

In conclusion, left ventricular free-wall rupture is a potentially life-threatening mechanical complication of acute myocardial infarction. It mostly occurs in patients with ST-elevation MI. Other causes, such as infections and trauma, are also responsible. Diagnosis is markedly facilitated by a high index of suspicion and transthoracic echocardiography. Surgical intervention (Oxford CEBM level of evidence III) is the definitive treatment, and medical treatment includes fluids, inotropes, and vasopressors. American College of Cardiology highlights that making the diagnosis early is important, and the threshold for suspicion needs to be low. Emergent surgical intervention and stabilization of the patients improve survival.
