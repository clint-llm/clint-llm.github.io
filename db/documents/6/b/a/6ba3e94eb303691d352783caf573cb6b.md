Other than the clinical history and physical exam, as mentioned above, neuroimaging is helpful in the assessment of athetoid cerebral palsy. 70% of patients with dyskinetic cerebral palsy have lesions found on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain in the basal ganglia or thalamus. Few patients have scans that look normal.

There are also clinical scales and assessment tools to help measure the severity of dystonia and choreoathetosis, which are often complex and hard to measure. These include several measurement scales, such as the Barry-Albright Dystonia Rating scale, Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating scale (BFMS), and the Dyskinesia Impairment scale. These scales can help evaluate the severity of dystonia in dyskinetic cerebral palsy. These scales have limitations in dyskinetic cerebral palsy as there is no measurement for choreoathetosis. This is resolved in the Dyskinesia Impairment Scale (DIS), which was made specifically for the assessment of patients with dyskinetic cerebral palsy.
