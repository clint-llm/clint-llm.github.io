It is essential to have a thorough history and physical examination, as common mimics can be overlooked, resulting in missed diagnosis and delay in treatment. Common mimics of acute mastoiditis include cellulitis, otitis externa, lymphadenopathy, trauma, and tumor. In particular, there have been many case reports of confusing tumors or cancer for mastoiditis, including rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, myofibroblastic tumor. Tumors were more likely to be bilateral, have cranial nerve involvement, and less likely to have a fever.
