Landmarks defining the regions of the hypothalamus include the lamina terminalis, pituitary gland, mammillary bodies, and superior hypothalamic sulcus.

The hypothalamus is a bilateral collection of nuclei divided into three zones surrounding the third ventricle and the mammillary bodies. Generally, the periventricular zone nuclei regulate the endocrine system, and the medial and lateral nuclei regulate autonomicÂ and somatic behavior.

The hypothalamus is centrally located in the brain, and it connects to the brainstem via the dorsal longitudinal fasciculus, cerebral cortex via the medial forebrain bundle, hippocampus via the fornix, amygdala via the stria terminalis, thalamus via the mammillothalamic tract, pituitary via median eminence, and retina via the retinohypothalamic tract.
