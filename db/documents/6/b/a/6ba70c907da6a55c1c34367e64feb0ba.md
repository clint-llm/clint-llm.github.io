# Definition/Introduction

The grasp reflex is an involuntary flexion-adduction movement involving the hands and digits.

There is a similar reflex observed in the foot called the plantar grasp reflex. This reflex is observable by stimulating the medial plantar surface of the foot. When the foot grasp reflex is positive, upon such stimulation, the lateral surface of the foot will react to create an indentation in the plantar surface, resembling a cup.

The grasp reflex is considered a primitive reflex, similar to the suck, snout, and palmomental reflexes.

# Issues of Concern

The reoccurrence of the grasp reflex past the age of infancy is associated with focal lesions in the central nervous system (CNS) or diffuse neurodegeneration, as observed in a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases.

# Clinical Significance

The precise neural circuit mapping of the grasp reflex has not been characterized. Research has shown that ulnar and median nerve stimulation at the wrist will yield a grasp reflex response in 40 milliseconds, suggesting that the reflex gets mediated at the spinal cord level.

Several conditions are associated with the reemergence of the grasp reflex in later life, including Parkinson disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, dementia with Lewy bodies frontotemporal dementia, and normal pressure hydrocephalus.

Although the grasp reflex may be present in a range of neurological disorders, its presence is not always pathologic. Like all primitive reflexes, the grasp reflex is normally present in infancy. The grasp reflex has been reportedly observed as early as the 16th week of gestation and is generally observable by the third trimester.

A paucity of scholarship exists specifically looking at treating the grasp reflex in adults. Instead, research has largely focused on treating the overlying neurological disorders likely responsible for the reemergence of the grasp reflex. However, the presence of the grasp reflex can contribute to disability in patients with neurodegenerative conditions and can hinder their abilities to complete activities of daily living.

A case study of three patients who had alcohol dependence and were already receiving treatment with benzodiazepines reported some success in eliminating the grasp reflex by treating with acamprosate.

Other suggested treatments involve injecting botulinum toxin into the muscles involved in the grasp reflex.

Orthotics such as splints represent another suggested therapy.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions

All health care team members need to recognize that the presence of the grasp reflex can contribute to a patient’s disability and decrease their level of independence. As such, members of the health care team should be ready to assist patients with various tasks involving the hand and dexterity that may be difficult.

As previously discussed, there have been proposals that an orthotic may play a useful role in helping patients with a grasp reflex.

Physiotherapy and occupational therapy can greatly improve this non-physiological reflex in adults, such as in people affected by stroke.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Monitoring

Testing for the grasp reflex is relatively simple, involving stimulating the palmar surface of the hand in a distal direction. All members of the health care team can be trained to perform this test. As such, patients can be monitored for the presence of the grasp reflex by various healthcare team members. The new onset of a grasp reflex or a strengthened response of a preexisting grasp reflex may indicate the progression of underlying pathology. Members of the health care team should be cognizant of this finding’s significance.
