Due to the risk of fulminant hepatic necrosis, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors should not be used in patients with hepatic disease, such as cirrhosis or impaired hepatic function. Liver injury is a rare side effect, but there have been several case reports. The mechanism of hepatic injury is presumed to be due to cross-reactivity with sulfonamide reactions. The damage occurs days to weeks after medication administration. The severity of the hepatic injury ranges from elevations of serum enzymes in a mixed or hepatocellular pattern to acute fulminant liver failure.

Patients with hypersensitivity to sulfonamides should use carbonic anhydrase inhibitors with caution due to the risk of fatal anaphylactic shock.

Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may cause electrolyte imbalances and are therefore not recommended in patients with hypokalemia, hyponatremia, metabolic acidosis, hyperchloremic acidosis, adrenal insufficiency, or marked renal impairment.Â Drug interactions of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors have been reported using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), beta-blockers, oral contraceptives, antifungals, lithium, metformin, clopidogrel, diuretics, and antiepileptics.
