Other conditions require consideration before a diagnosis of premature ejaculation can be made, including severely delayed orgasm in the female partner. The average time to climax in females varies between 12 to 25 minutes; in extreme cases of delayed female orgasm, almost any male would be considered to have premature ejaculation, so the partnerâ€™s sexual response is a factor that merits evaluation. Adverse effects of psychotropic drugs must also be a contributing factor.
