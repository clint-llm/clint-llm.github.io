**Medical Care**

Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy treatment is conservative.

- Antibiotic treatment with prophylactic antibiotics is reasonable if children begin to experience infections.

- In patients who develop severe life-threatening infections or recurrent respiratory tract infections despite antibiotic therapy, a trial of antibody replacement therapy in the form of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is indicated.

- If allergic rhinitis occurs, treat with topical nasal corticosteroids and antihistamines.

- Routine immunizations should be performed, including a conjugated heptavalent pneumococcal vaccine for routine immunization in children beginning at age 2 months.

**Surgical Care**

Due to the frequency of ear infections, the placement of tympanostomy tubes should be considered.Â Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) for chronic sinusitis may also be a consideration.
