It is important to note that a traditional M-plasty, unlike a Z-plasty, does not alter tension vectors. For this reason, the contraindications for M-plasty are the same as the contraindications for primary closures. Primary wound closure is contraindicated when there would be too much tension on the wound to permit a reliable closure. Excess tension can lead to dehiscence and/or necrosis of the wound edges because of stretching and subsequent narrowing of the microvasculature in the subdermal plexus. Increased tension can also lead to poor cosmetic outcomes, such as wide, fish-mouth-like scars. More importantly, excessive tension can cause anatomic distortion of sensitive structures such as the eyelid, eyebrow, nasal ala, auricle, or lips.
