An interprofessional team is essential for providing patient-centered care. One example that requires a team-centered intervention is the occurrence of the oculocardiac reflex, which can result in severe bradycardia progressing to asystole, hypotension, or other bradyarrhythmias. When this is recognized, the anesthesiologist must immediately communicate with the ophthalmologist toÂ remove the surgical stimulation causing this reflex while making the operating room technicians, nurses, and midlevel providers aware of this hemodynamic compromise in the event that advanced cardiac life support becomes indicated. Nurses may assist in drawing up medications or assisting the head of the bed to assist the anesthesiologist in securing the airway if needed.
