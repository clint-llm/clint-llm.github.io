FMF is generally a clinical diagnosis. The classic presentation of symptoms supported by the presence of family history and response to colchicine help confirm a diagnosis. Laboratory and radiographic studies may help support the diagnosis or exclude other causes.

Laboratory analysis can reveal elevated white blood cell count with neutrophil predominance. Elevation of the acute phase reactants such as fibrinogen, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum amyloid A (SAA) protein, and C-reactive protein, although commonly found, are nonspecific. They can be monitored while the patient is on treatment to document the response to the therapy.

Genetic testing can help confirm the diagnosis in cases with atypical presentation of FMF. However, around 10 percent of patients who meet diagnostic criteria based on the clinical presentation do not have any mutation.

Diagnostic criteria

Several criteria sets have been published, but the Tel-Hashomer criteria set of Israel is widely used for the diagnosis of FMF. Its sensitivity and specificity are more than 95% and 97%, respectively.

For the criteria, typical attacks consist of fever (rectal - 38° C), pain due to inflammation, three or more recurrences of the attacks, and duration of 12 to 72 hours.

Major criteria (typical attack with one or more of the following)

- Abdomen

- Joint (hip, knee, ankle)

- Chest - unilateral pleuritis or pericarditis

- Scrotum

- Skin

- Muscle

- Fever alone (usually recurrent attacks with fever only and no other identifiable cause)

Minor criteria (incomplete attack including one or more of the following)

- Abdomen

- Joints

- Chest

- Leg pain on exertion

- Positive response to colchicine

- Nephropathic amyloidosis

Supportive criteria

- Family history of FMF

- Vulnerable ethnic origin

- Early age at onset (under 20)

- Attacks with spontaneous resolution

- No symptoms between the attacks

- Severe attacks requiring bed rest

- Presence of elevated white cell count or elevated acute phase reactants in the blood

- History of laparotomy or appendectomy with no pathology

- Episodic proteinuria or hematuria

- Consanguinity of parents

The presence of one major or two minor criteria, or one minor with five supportive criteria can establish the diagnosis.
