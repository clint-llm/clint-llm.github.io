Atopic dermatitis is typically a clinical diagnosis given the classic distribution of lesions in each age group. The presence of associated findings (e.g., keratosis pilaris) may facilitate diagnosis. A biopsy will show an eczematous pattern. In childhood cases that areÂ recalcitrant to treatment, fluorescent enzyme immunoassays or skin prick testing can be performed to detect immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies against specific allergens, which may or may not be a clinically relevant exacerbating factor.
