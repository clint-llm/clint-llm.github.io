Cystic teratomas are the most common ovarian germ cell tumors comprising 20% of all the ovarian tumors in adults and half of all ovarian neoplasms in children and are usually benign. On the contrary, malignancy is a rare occurrence constituting about 1%.

Over the period of decades, several multicenter studies have observed different rates of incidence of benign cystic teratomas such as Marchetti observed a 20% occurrence of all ovarian tumors, while a large study by Blackwell et al. reported the occurrence to be 5%. Due to the rarity of this tumor, literature is skewed by either isolated case reports or small multicenter groups of cases. Thus leading to a broader range of incidence.
