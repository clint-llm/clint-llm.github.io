Uterine fibroids may present at any age and in any community. However, prevalence varies significantly amongst different age groups and ethnicities. The prevalence of fibroids in women of reproductive age is estimated to be 20 to 40%.

The incidence of fibroids increases with increasing age until menopause. The cumulative incidence of fibroids has been documented to be as high as 80% in black women and approximately 70% in white women. The incidence is higher among women in their fifth and sixth decade of life. Premenopausal women demonstrated a higher fibroid risk than post-menopausal women, likely due to the role of hormones in stimulating fibroid growth.

Studies have consistently shown a 3-fold increased risk of fibroids among black women compared to white women when controlled for other accepted risk factors.Â In addition, black women tend to develop uterine fibroids at a younger age, present with larger uteri at the time of diagnosis. They are more likely to suffer from blood-loss anemia compared to white women. This may be related to the fact that black women generally tend to have had earlier menarche compared to white women.

Other risk factors for fibroids include early menarche, increased interval since last birth, obesity, diet, family history, and hypertension.

The risk of fibroids decreases with an increasing number of term pregnancies, such that women having > 5 pregnancies have a quarter of the risk of women who had none.
