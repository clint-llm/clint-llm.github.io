Women with autoimmune hepatitis have an increased risk of adverse outcomes in pregnancy and neonatal complications. These women must undergo close surveillance, both prenatally and antenatally, by obstetricians, primary caregivers, nurse practitioners, and hepatologists working closely together. Therefore, autoimmune hepatitis requires an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. Pharmacists evaluate treatment regimens, check for drug-drug interactions, and provide patient education. Nurses monitor and educate patients and provide updates to the team. When these disciplines coordinate their activities with clinicians, it will lead to improved patient outcomes. [Level 5]

The outlook for women with AIH who get pregnant is guarded. Those with the more severe disease tend to have poor fetal outcomes despite therapy.
