Addisonian Crisis is a medical emergency requiring hospital admission. In most cases, patients will require close monitoring in the ICU with a critical care consultation due to the high risk of decompensationÂ from multifactorial etiologies. Once stable, endocrinology should be consulted to help manage the dosing for long-term steroid therapy if the underlying cause is adrenal insufficiency. Other specialists such as cardiology, gastroenterology, infectious disease should be consulted as needed to help address and manage the underlying cause of what precipitated the Addisonian crisis.
