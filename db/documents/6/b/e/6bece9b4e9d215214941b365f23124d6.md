Seminoma usually presents as a nodule or painless swelling of the testis. It may be an incidental finding by the patients or his partner. Patients sometimes complain of a dull ache or heavy sensation in the lower abdomen, perineal area, or scrotum. Rarely, acute pain or hematospermia may be the presenting symptoms. Cases of advanced disease, with metastases, present as a neck mass (cervical or supraclavicular lymph node metastases), cough or dyspnea (pulmonary metastases), anorexia, nausea, vomiting, or gastrointestinal hemorrhage (gastroduodenal metastases), bone pain (skeletal metastases), central or peripheral nerve involvement (cerebral, spinal cord, or peripheral nerve involvement). History of cryptorchidism and orchiopexy is noted in some cases.
