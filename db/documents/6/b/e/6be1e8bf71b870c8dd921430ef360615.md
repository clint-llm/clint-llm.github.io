The preferred treatment for chronic cholecystitis is elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. It has a low morbidity rate and can be performed as an outpatient surgery. An open cholecystectomy is also an option however requires hospital admission and longer recovery time. This surgery is indicated in patients who are not laparoscopic candidates such as those with extensive prior surgeries and adhesions. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is usually done whenÂ choledocholithiasis is a concern. These patients usually undergo ERCP prior to elective surgery.

Patients who are not surgical candidates or who prefer not to undergo surgery can be closely observed and managed conservatively. A low-fat diet can help reduce the frequency of symptoms. In patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis, the use of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA or ursodiol) has been shown to decrease rates of biliary colic and acute cholecystitis.
