Infants with galactosemia will typically present within the first few days of life with jaundice, hepatomegaly, lethargy, and severe feeding intolerance once there is any exposure to dietary galactose in the form of breastmilk or most standard infant formulas. Additional findings may include poor weight gain, renal failure, coagulopathy, hypoglycemia, seizures, cerebral edema, cataracts, vitreous hemorrhage, neutropenia, and Escherichia coli sepsis. Once diagnosed, long-term follow-up includes monitoring for cognitive and behavioral impairment, fine and gross motor delays, speech difficulties, low bone mineral density, ataxia or tremor, and primary ovarian insufficiency/failure.
