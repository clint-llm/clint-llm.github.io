Since upper endoscopy is a requirement for tissue sampling or brushing of the candida plaques in the esophagus, a gastroenterologist or general surgeon would be required to perform the procedure. A pathologist will make the diagnosis of esophageal candidiasis through histologic staining. Infectious disease specialists may be needed to help with treating refractory or recurrent esophageal candidiasis. Infectious disease physicians can also manage the patient's treatment for concomitant HIV which is causing their immunosuppression. Hematology/oncology specialists may also be consulted to manageÂ patients with immunosuppression or manage chemotherapy medications which are causing immunosuppression.
