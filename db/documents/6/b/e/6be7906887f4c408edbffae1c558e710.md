The typical presentation of intermittent claudication is lower extremity pain during ambulation that is relieved with rest. The progression of symptoms is gradual. The pain may be localized to the buttocks or the lower leg, depending on the site of occlusion. Patients with aortoiliac disease frequently develop buttock pain.

Physical examination of these patients may show evidence of arterial insufficiency. The affected limb may feel cool and have diminished pulses. The physical examination should include an assessment of femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial artery pulses. The patient’s presentation should be carefully distinguished from other causes of leg pain like neurogenic pseudoclaudication (spinal stenosis), musculoskeletal pain, and venous claudication associated with leg swelling and varicosities. In general, the presence of strong pedal pulses argues against a diagnosis of intermittent claudication.

If pulses are not palpable, one may have to use a handheld Doppler device.  In general, in healthy people, the blood pressure in the arms and ankles should be about the same. In fact, ankle pressure is slightly higher in most people. The ankle-brachial index should be measured in all individuals. Patients with an ankle-brachial index of less than 0.9 may have some degree of vascular disease.
