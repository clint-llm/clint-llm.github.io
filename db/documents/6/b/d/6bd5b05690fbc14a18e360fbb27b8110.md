Some individuals with TVIE may be candidates for shorter duration antibiotic regimens(no evidence of renal failure, the absence of extrapulmonary metastatic infections or simultaneousÂ left sided infection). The 2-week regimens are not used in patients with IE of the aortic or mitral valve, in patients with MRSA, or patients with complicated IE.

Initial empiric antibiotics should include coverage against the most common pathogens. Thus staphylococcus and streptococcus coverage are recommended. Vancomycin is used as an initial choice of antibiotic. These medicines should be tailored based upon blood cultures results. Once an organism has been specified, antibiotics regimen should typically be continued for six weeks from the date of first negative blood culture. Very limited patients can be trialed with a short duration course. These candidates include those with isolated TVIE, those without any complications secondary to IE, and those with IE from HACEK organisms.

Surgical treatment of IE is reserved for individuals with the following:

- TV vegetation > 2cm with septic pulmonary emboli.

- Persistent bacteremia for one week despite adequate treatment.

- Severe tricuspid regurgitation with right-sided heart failure.
