Healthcare workers in clinical practice should be familiar with the SPECT thallium imaging study. It is a tool to assess myocardial viability when other tests are not available. A nuclear-cardiologist usually performs the test with a team of nurses and radiology technicians. One nurse is dedicated to the monitoring of the patient during the test and is responsible for ensuring that resuscitative equipment is present in the suite before the test is started. A pharmacist specializing in nuclear medicine should assist with proper dosing. At all times during the test, vital signs and oxygenation must be recorded every few minutes. If abnormalities are detected, the team should be apprised of the abnormality immediately. A team approach is vital to prevent complications from the SPECT thallium test.

The SPECT stress test has been shown to have excellent diagnostic and prognostic values for IHD. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of SPECT stress test for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease are 82%, 76%, and 83%, respectively.
