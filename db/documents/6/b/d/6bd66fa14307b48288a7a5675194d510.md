Coronary artery dissection is the separation of the coronary arterial wall and can be spontaneous, traumatic, or iatrogenic. This activity will focus on spontaneous coronary artery dissection. It is an uncommon cause of acute myocardial infarction predominantly affecting young to middle-aged women. The increased use of early angiography to assess acute chest pain has resulted in the recognition that spontaneous coronary artery dissection is much more common than previously believed. The condition poses diagnostic challenges and significant therapeutic dilemmas given the lack of research to guide management. This activity outlines the presentation, evaluation, and management of coronary artery dissection and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of coronary artery dissection.
- Describe the physical exam findings of a patient with coronary artery dissection.
- Outline management options for coronary artery dissection.
- Explain a well-coordinated interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to patients with coronary artery dissection.
