Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (bullous ichthyosiform erythroderma) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder of cornification caused by mutations in keratins 1 and 10. It is characterized by erythroderma and blistering at birth, with subsequent development of hyperkeratosis. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (bullous ichthyosiform erythroderma).
- Review the history, physical, and evaluation of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (bullous ichthyosiform erythroderma).
- Outline the treatment and management options available for epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (bullous ichthyosiform erythroderma).
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (bullous ichthyosiform erythroderma) and improve outcomes.
