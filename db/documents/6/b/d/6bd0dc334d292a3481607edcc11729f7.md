The onset of puberty in both males and females relies on the hypothalamus. The intermittent release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus, also known as the hypothalamic pulse generator, signals the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary.

LH stimulates Leydig cells in males' testes to produce testosterone, typically occurring between ages 9 to 14. Testosterone can then be peripherally converted into its more potent counterpart, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), via the 5-alpha-reductase enzyme. Acting on intracellular androgen receptors, testosterone is responsible for the pubertal growth spurt, closure of the epiphyseal plates, deepening of the voice, penile and testicular enlargement, muscle growth, and libido.

In females, both LH and FSH contribute to the development of secondary sexual characteristics.

Puberty is also marked by a period of increased adrenal androgen production, termed adrenarche, which typically occurs around age six. While a specific signaling molecule has, to date, eluded researchers, it results from increased androgen-producing enzymes within the adrenal gland's zona reticularis (ZR) layer. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) acts on intracellular receptors promoting androgen-dependent hair growth. Adrenarche is a common period between both sexes resulting in shared pubic hair growth patterns.
