ATII is a potent vasopressor, acting on vascular endothelial receptors. The two types of ATII receptors present in the heart and vasculature smooth muscle that are responsible for signal transduction in mediating the vasoconstrictive action of ATII are the AT1 and AT2 receptors. Their signaling leads to calcium-dependent phosphorylation of myosin, which leads to contraction of the vascular smooth muscle. This arterial smooth muscle contraction is responsible for raising blood pressure.

Also, ATII interacts with AT receptors at various sites in the nephron to stimulate sodium reabsorption. ATII also acts on the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex to stimulate the release of aldosterone, a steroid hormone that acts on the kidney to promote sodium and water retention.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) may increase the effect of IV angiotensin II, and the use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) may reduce the effect of IV angiotensin II. The mechanism for the interaction with ACEIs is not specified. The interaction with ARBs is by pharmacodynamic antagonism of the drug at the receptor site.
