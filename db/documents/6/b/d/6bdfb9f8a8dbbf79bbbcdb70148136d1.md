There are several common clinical pathologies related to the genitourinary tract:

- Benign prostate hyperplasia, BPH, is a common condition acquired with aging in men. BPH is the enlargement of the prostate, more specifically the growth of smooth muscle and epithelial cells due to the hormone dihydrotestosterone, causing narrowing of the bladder outlet. BPH presents with symptoms such as urgency and nocturia.

- Cryptorchidism is the most common congenital defect where one or both testes fail to descend into the scrotum. Although the cause of cryptorchidism remains unclear, it appears that testicular descent fails during the two hormonally controlled stages of gestation at 8 to 15 weeks and 25 to 35 weeks.

- Hypospadias is a congenital defect that results in a ventral urethral opening on the penis other than the tip. Researchers believe it to be the result of both environmental and genetic factors. The severity of hypospadias depends on the location of the urinary meatus. Anterior hypospadias (70% prevalence) is generally a minor condition where the urinary meatus exits from either glandular or sub-coronal portion of the penis. Posterior and penile hypospadias (30% prevalence) are far more problematic. Hypospadias usually needs to be corrected surgically as it can interfere with both urinary and sexual functions.

- Urethritis is the inflammation of the urethra due to bacterial infections such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis.
