Constipation is a common diagnosis that requires proper evaluation and appropriate treatment. It is important to note that laxative therapy is not the only treatment for constipation. The chronic constipation treatment approach includes patient education, behavior modification, dietary changes, and laxative therapy. Initial management of constipation should include lifestyle changes such as increasing fluids and fiber-rich foods such as asparagus, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and spinach. When constipation is not controlled by lifestyle modification, treatment with laxatives should be a consideration.

Osmotic or stimulant laxatives are considered first-line. Prokinetics and secretagogues are the next steps when osmotic or stimulants are unable to control constipation.
