Spondylolisthesis is a condition that occurs when one vertebral body slips with respect to the adjacent vertebral body causing radicular or mechanical symptoms or pain. It is graded based on the degree of slippage of one vertebral body on the adjacent vertebral body. Any pathological process that can weaken the supports keeping vertebral bodies aligned can allow spondylolisthesis to occur. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of spondylolisthesis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of spondylolisthesis.
- Review the workup of a patient with spondylolisthesis.
- Summarize the treatment options for spondylolisthesis.
