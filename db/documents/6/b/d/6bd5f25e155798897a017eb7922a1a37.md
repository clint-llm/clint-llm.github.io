The syndrome is characterized by the ECG findings of a right bundle branch block and ST-segment elevations in the right precordial leads (V1-V3). This activity outlines the evaluation and management of Brugada syndrome and explains the roles of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with patients with Brugada syndrome.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology and epidemiology of Brugada syndrome. 
- Summarize the pathophysiology of Brugada syndrome. 
- Outline the typical presentation and evaluation of a patient with Brugada syndrome. 
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by Brugada syndrome.
