Management of lipodystrophies is dependent upon the specific subtype and the extent of associated metabolic abnormalities. For patients with severe metabolic derangement, it is important to implement the use of lipid-lowering agents and diabetic medications. With a goal of increasing insulin sensitivity, pioglitazone has been shown to be more efficacious than metformin in this patient population. Severe cases may require insulin. Leptin analogs, particularly metreleptin, have shown efficacy in maintaining normal metabolism in patients who cannot effectively synthesize leptin naturally. Metreleptin is recombinant human leptin and the only FDA-approved replacement therapy for certain patients with lipodystrophy. Hypertriglyceridemia may respond to troglitazone, through interventions may not be very effective in fixing dyslipidemias in these patients. Furthermore, patients with lipodystrophy in cosmetically sensitive areas may be treated with fillers such as poly-L lactic acid and calcium hydroxyapatite. More research needs to be done in the field of lipodystrophies to establish diagnostic and management guidelines. As we learn more about the intricacies of metabolic regulation, it is anticipated that more treatment options will emerge for this patient population.
