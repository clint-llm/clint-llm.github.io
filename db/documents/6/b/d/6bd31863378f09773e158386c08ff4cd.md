The deltoid muscle is a large triangular-shaped muscle associated with the human shoulder girdle, explicitly located in the proximal upper extremity.

- Proximal humerus

- Scapula - anatomic components of the scapula also include the glenoid, acromion, coracoid process

- Clavicle

The shoulder girdle musculature, in addition to the deltoid muscle itself, includes the following:

- Rotator cuff (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, subscapularis)

- Trapezius and other periscapular stabilizing muscles

- Triceps

- Latissimus dorsi

- Pectoralis major/minor

The deltoid is composed of anterior (or clavicular fibers), lateral (or acromial fibers), and posterior (or spinal fibers).
