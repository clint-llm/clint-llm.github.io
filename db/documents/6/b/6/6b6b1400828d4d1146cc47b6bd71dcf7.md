The eye care professional should be familiar with the appearance and evaluation of the optic disc as well as in obtaining a pertinent history and physical.  A timely workup is a priority, and the appropriate specialist referrals should be made.  Optimization of patient care and safety occurs when communication between referring and co-managing healthcare providers is precise and efficient.  For example, the ophthalmologist observing the need for surgical intervention for idiopathic intracranial hypertension should be in communication with neurosurgery regarding appropriate intervention.  Patient autonomy is preserved when presented with risks, benefits, and alternatives provided by different disciplines such as in the case of optic nerve sheath fenestration versus ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
