**Viscosupplementation:**HA injection can be done in the office and is usually a quick procedure typically performed under Local anesthesia. Usually, 2 to 4 ml of HA should be injected directly into the joint capsule to be effective. Patients are advised to avoid excessive weight-bearing in the first 48 hours after the injections. Physical therapy is recommended afterward to improve functioning and range of motion.

**Prolotherapy:**The most commonly used agent for prolotherapy is dextrose; concentrations greater than 10% are considered inflammatory, while those lower than 10% are considered noninflammatory.

**Plasma-rich platelets:**PRP is obtained from the patient’s blood using the two-step centrifugation method. The first step separates whole blood into platelet and cell fractions. The second centrifugation step is performed at a higher speed. It further separates platelet growth factors. The final concentration range for the PRP product is 1.5 to 8 times the whole blood. It is usually activated by calcium chloride, bovine thrombin, or autologous thrombin.

**Mesenchymal stem cells:**About 60 ml of bone marrow aspirate is collected and centrifuged to produce about 6 ml of bone marrow aspirate concentrate. MSCs are multipotent and can be harvested from several tissues, e.g., bone marrow, adipocytes, and amniotic tissue. The usual location for bone marrow aspiration is the iliac crest under anesthesia due to the associated pain and discomfort with the harvest.
