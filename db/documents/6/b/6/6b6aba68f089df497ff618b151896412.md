Aortic valve functional unit is a central outflow tract of the left side of the heart. The operational unit of the left outflow tract consists of aortic valve cusps, commissures, annulus, and sinuses at the root of the aorta.

Moreover, conditions of the aortic root, including coarctation, dissection, and aneurysm, can increase the aortic valve pathology due to increase shear force of blood at the aortic valve disrupting the laminar flow.

The prevalence of procedure performed is low as compared to mitral valve repair as calcific aortic stenosis is the most common valvular pathology seen, which has less success. As compared to repair, aortic valve replacement seems to be relatively simpler, but it has the downside of causing long term complications of structural deterioration, restenosis, infection, and bleeding due to anticoagulation.
