The first step in confronting a difficult Foley catheterization situation is to review the indications for the catheter.

A urinary catheter may be placed to relieve acute or chronic urinary retention, obtain urine for analysis, dilate urethral strictures, splint the urethra after surgery, perform continuous bladder infusions, manage hematuria, drain the bladder after an injury, maintain the hygiene of the immobile patient, and decompress a neurogenic bladder.

Urinary decompression is also indicated in many critical care settings to ensure adequate measurements of urinary outputs and during prolonged surgeries for which the bladder needs to be emptied.

Foley catheters are possibly appropriate for measuring and collecting urine only when fluid status or urinary output cannot be determined by other means. Just being in an ICU does not automatically require the placement of a Foley. Patients who are able to void with acceptable post-void residual volumes and are not being treated for urinary tract-based sepsis or infection probably do not need catheters.

In difficult situations, it may be prudent to avoid extensive urological instrumentation to place a Foley catheter unless absolutely necessary.
