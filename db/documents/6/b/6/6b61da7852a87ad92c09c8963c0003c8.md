Micropenis is an objective diagnosis made based on the meticulous measurement of the penile length. Given the significant anxiety, stress, and psychological impact, the accuracy of making the diagnosis is essential. A multidisciplinary team should manage micropenis once there is a definitive diagnosis. This finding can be isolated or part of other groups of symptoms and signs indicative of hormonal abnormalities or genetics association.
