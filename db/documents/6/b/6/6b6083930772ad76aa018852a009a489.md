Most patients with hydranencephaly die before birth. During gestation, the mother feels normal fetal movements, and the abdominal growth is normal.

Patients who appeared normal after birth start developing a few weeks later, more worrisome signs such as hyperirritability, increased or decreased muscle tone (hyper/hypotonia), increase in head circumference, and wide-open anterior fontanelles. These signs become rapidly more pronounced after several more weeks. Months later, patients can develop seizures and hydrocephalus. Hearing is usually preserved, but in rare cases, sensorineural hearing impairment is noted. Visual impairment is noticeable, and most of the children have cortical visual impairment from the absence of visual cortex but with normal eyes.

Other symptoms/signs that may appear later are:

- Lack of growth

- Spastic diplegia

- Cognitive delay

- Hypertelorism

- Bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia

- Diffuse chorioretinal atrophy

- Pigment clumping

- Dysplastic retina

- Blindness
