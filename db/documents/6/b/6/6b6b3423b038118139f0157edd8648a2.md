Vertigo is most often caused by a dysfunction in the vestibular system from a peripheral or central lesion.

Peripheral etiologies include the more common causes of vertigo, such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and Ménière disease.

Central etiologies of vertigo should always be considered in the differential. Ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes, particularly involving the cerebellum or vertebrobasilar system, are life-threatening and must be ruled out by history, physical and other diagnostic tests if warranted.

Other causes can lead to vertigo. These include medication-induced vertigo and psychologic disorders, including mood, anxiety, and somatization. Medications that have been associated with vertigo include anticonvulsants such as phenytoin and salicylates.
