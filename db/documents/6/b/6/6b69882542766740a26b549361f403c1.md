Because of the extensive clinical spectrum of tuberculosis compounded by the HIV burden, along with the use of immunosuppressive drugs, any delay in the diagnosis can wreak havoc on the patient. Delayed administration of the treatment can lead to various complications, namely

- ARDS

- Multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)

- Tubercular empyema

- Air leak syndromes (pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum)

- Tubercular pericardial effusion and pericarditis

- Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)

- Myocarditis, native and prosthetic valve endocarditis, and intracardiac masses

- Mycotic aneurysm of the aorta

- Tubercular meningitis with focal neurological deficits

- Systemic amyloidosis

- Immune complex glomerulonephritis

- Bone marrow suppression, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
