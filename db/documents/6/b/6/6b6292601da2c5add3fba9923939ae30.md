Endometritis is an infectious inflammation of the endometrium, which is the innermost uterine layer. When the inflammationÂ extends into the muscular layer, the process is termed endomyometritis, and when it extends all the way through to the parametrium, it has been termed endoparametritis.

Postpartum endometritis is the most common postpartum infection. Most cases of postpartum endometritis are polymicrobial, involving both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and are due to the translocation of normal vaginal flora into the uterine cavity during the processes of labor and delivery.

Acute endometritis unrelated to pregnancy is typically classified as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and represents an endometrial infection present for less than 30 days.

Chronic endometritis is a more subtle chronic inflammatory condition unrelated to pregnancy, lasting at least 30 days.
