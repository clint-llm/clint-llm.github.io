The distal humerus is composed of medial and lateral columns. The medial and lateral columns are composed of the trochlea and medial epicondyle medially and the capitellum and lateral epicondyle laterally. The distal humerus narrows proximally from metaphysis to diaphysis. The humerus also thins in its anteroposterior width as the medial and lateral columns merge at the proximal aspect of the olecranon fossa. This creates a point of relative weakness in the supracondylar region of the distal humerus.
