It is the responsibility of basic medical science teachers to teach future clinicians how to approach patients, exercise careful clinical thinking, and apply general principles before requesting laboratory tests. This process begins in medical school by teaching the benefits of high-value, cost-effective laboratory testing. Janssens et al. reviewed various studies and found options to halt the unreasonable demand for laboratory tests. Education and awareness play a vital role, particularly in a teaching university hospital with residents under training. However, it has been found to have limited success due to these institutions' short-term educational opportunities.

Strict protocols need to be followed in the light of clinical reasoning, and proper rationale should be supplied for ordering multiple laboratory tests. The size of the population used to be the predictor of overall laboratory test demand previously. However, an increasing number of primary care physicians might reduce this demand due to fewer visits of patients to emergency departments and urgent care centers. This discourages the practice of defensive medicine and also decreases hospital admissions, surgical operations, and emergency department visits.
