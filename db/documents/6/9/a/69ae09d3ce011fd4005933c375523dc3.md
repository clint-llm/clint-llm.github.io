Fetal akinesia is often lethal within the first month of life. This is due to the many complications associated with this condition.

- Pulmonary complications: Pulmonary hypoplasia, pulmonary hypertension, aspiration pneumonia.

- Oropharyngeal dysfunction: This leads to aspiration and subsequent pneumonia.

- Neurological complications: Seizures and hypothalamic dysfunction.

- Gastrointestinal complications: Short gut syndrome and intestinal malrotation.

- Endocrine dysfunction: Hypothyroidism from hypothalamic dysfunction.

Akinesia in adults can often present as an emergency, known as akinetic crises. Parkinsonian hyperpyrexia, neuroleptic-like malignant syndrome, acute akinesia, and malignant syndrome in parkinsonism are other terms used to describe these akinetic crises. This variant spectrum may vary fromÂ total akinesia with dysphagia, hyperthermia, dysautonomia, the increment of muscle enzymes, and alterations of mental status, to only, the inability or difficulty in initiating movement.
