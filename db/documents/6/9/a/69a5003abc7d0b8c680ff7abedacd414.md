The adverse effects of emtricitabine are similar to those of other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and include headache, muscle weakness, arthralgia, fatigue, fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, depression, anxiety, insomnia, rhinitis, cough, and pharyngitis.

Emtricitabine combined with tenofovir used as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is safe with short-term use of about 2 to 3 years.
