The physical exam should consist of checking the entire body of the patient for any suspicious lesions. Specifically, the ABCDEs should be assessed: asymmetry, border irregularity, color (variation), diameter (more than 5 mm), and/orÂ erythema. Any positivity in the exam should raise suspicion for malignant melanoma, and then the practitioner should obtain a biopsy of the lesion. It is important not to perform a shave biopsy on lesions suspected to have malignant melanoma but rather perform a punch biopsy or an excisional biopsy if the lesion is less than 7 mm. Shave biopsy does not allow to assess the entire depth and may ruin any chance of proper staging.
