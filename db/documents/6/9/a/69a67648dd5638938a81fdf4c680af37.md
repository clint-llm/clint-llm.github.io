Patients with Liddle syndrome respond well to medical therapy such as potassium-sparing diuretics. There aren't any studies available on the long-term mortality of Liddle syndrome. Clinicians often undertreat and misdiagnose these patients. Further studies are needed to establish mortality in the population suffering from secondary hypertension due to this syndrome.
