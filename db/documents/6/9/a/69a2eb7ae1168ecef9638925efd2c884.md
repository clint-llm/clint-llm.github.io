Contrast toxicity occurs when the substances used as contrast agents - iodine, barium, gadolinium, or microbubbles as mentioned above - cause harmful effects to organic tissues. Toxicity may occur when the health history of a patient is not fully understood, especially regarding allergies, cardiac conditions, or renal disease. Special populations including pregnant women, breastfeeding women, and patients taking metformin also merit further consideration of possible injury from contrast use. Radiologists performing contrast-enhanced imaging frequently do not know the patient well and must rely on a referring physician's judgment or a time-limited informed consent process to assess the appropriateness of the requested study.

Further risk of contrast toxicity is incurred by off-label use of contrast agents. Current regulations from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States have a limited number of approved contrast agents for specific uses in specific body areas. Because the FDA has not yet been able to comprehensively test all contrast agents in all populations for all purposes, the actual clinical use of contrast agents by necessity must encompass off-label use not yet assessed by the FDA. Diagnostic needs in MR angiography, cardiac, and pediatric populations are among those least addressed by the FDA that remain frequently required in clinical practice.

Finally, even if a patient is without a health history of any kind and their imaging type of their body type has been approved by FDA guidelines, contrast toxicity may still occur simply due to the interaction of a foreign substance with organic tissue. In short, contrast toxicity can be caused by any contrast agent in any patient who is exposed.
