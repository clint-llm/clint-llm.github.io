Posterior shoulder instability is a rare clinical entity that represents a spectrum of instability ranging from posterior subluxation to posterior dislocation. Posterior shoulder instability is much less common than anterior shoulder instability and is challenging to diagnose. Nonoperative management is the first-line treatment in most patients with operative treatment reserved for those with large bony and/or soft tissue defects after a traumatic event as well as those who have failed nonoperative management. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of posterior shoulder instability and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of posterior shoulder instability
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of posterior shoulder instability.
- Review the management options available for posterior shoulder instability.
- Describe the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients who develop posterior shoulder instability.
