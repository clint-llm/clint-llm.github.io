Renal failure is the most common cause of hyperphosphatemia. A glomerular filtration rate of less than 30 mL/min significantly reduces the filtration of inorganic phosphate, increasing its serum level.

Other less common causes include a high intake of phosphorus or increased renal reabsorption.

High intake of phosphate can result due to excessive use of phosphate-containing laxatives or enemas, and vitamin D intoxication. Vitamin D increases intestinal phosphate absorption.

Hypoparathyroidism, acromegaly, and thyrotoxicosis enhance renal phosphate reabsorption resulting in hyperphosphatemia.

Hyperphosphatemia can also be due to genetic causes. Several genetic deficiencies can lead to hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism, and decreased FGF-23 activity.

Pseudohyperphosphatemia is a laboratory artifact sometimes seen in patients with hyperglobulinemia, hyperlipidemia, and hyperbilirubinemia. This artifact is due to interference in phosphate assay.
