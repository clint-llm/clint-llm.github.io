Lisinopril is a competitive inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and prevents the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which is a potent vasoconstrictor. A decrease in angiotensin II subsequently causes a reduction in aldosterone secretion, which causes a decrease in sodium reabsorption in the collecting duct and decreases potassium excretion that may result in a small increase in serum potassium with lisinopril use. By removing the negative feedback of angiotensin II, lisinopril leads to increased serum renin activity.

The beneficial effects in patients with hypertension derive from the inhibitory effects in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), resulting in decreased vasopressor and aldosterone activity even in low-renin patients.Â On the other hand, ACE also degrades bradykinin, and it is this mechanism through which ACE inhibitors may predispose to angioedema.

**Pharmacokinetics**

- Lisinopril absorption is unchanged by food and is excreted unchanged in the urine.

- Lisinopril does not have good bioavailability after oral intake - ranging from 10-30%.

- The time to peak concentration can vary from 6-8 hours.

- The drug does not bind to albumin or other proteins, and its distribution in patients with heart failure is poor.
