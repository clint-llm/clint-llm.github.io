The prognosis for most patients that receive timely intervention is favorable. Most patients treated within 2 hours of presentation have been shown to attain a visual acuity better than 20/40.Â This is in contrast to those receiving treatment after 2 hours, only 25% of which may achieve 20/40 vision or better.

Some factors that may point toward a poorer prognosis are a presenting visual acuity worse than 20/200, the presence of a relative afferent pupillary defect, an eyelid laceration, and increased time to treatment.

With traumatic retrobulbar hemorrhage and acute vision loss, the risk of permanent blindness is 44 to 52%.
