Many patients do not require any intervention as either they are asymptomatic or their mildÂ and non-disabling symptoms improve with time.

Subclavian artery stenosis is a marker of atherosclerotic disease in many patients and hence indicates the risk of adverse cardiovascular events in such patients. These patients benefit from secondary preventive measures, including control of blood pressure, treatment of dyslipidemia, smoking cessation, glycemic control in diabetes mellitus, and lifestyle changes.

An open surgical bypass is one of the options for symptomatic patients. The most common choice for surgical correction is extra-anatomic revascularization (e.g., carotid transposition, carotid-subclavian bypass).

For patients with short proximal stenosis or occlusion, an endovascular intervention can be a consideration. About 10% of patients can present with less than 70% recurrent stenosis. Such patients can benefit from repeat angioplasty. About 5% of those patients might require surgery.

Antiplatelet therapy and oral anticoagulation can be tried in patients with high surgical risk or with unfavorable anatomy for surgical intervention. However, the effectiveness of this option has not been studied.
