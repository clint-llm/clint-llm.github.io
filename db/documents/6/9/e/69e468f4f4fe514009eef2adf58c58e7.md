The etiology of benign eyelid lesions is best differentiated according to the tissue from which the lesion originates.

- Skin, subcutaneous tissue, and adnexa (upper and lower lids, all sections of lids)

- Orbicularis muscle (upper and lower lids, all sections of lids)

- Pre-aponeurotic orbital fat (upper lid, distal portion)

- Pre-capsulopalpebral fascial fat (lower lid, distal portion)

- Levator aponeurosis (upper lid, middle and distal portion)

- Capsulopalpebral fascia (lower eyelid distal portion)

- Müller muscle (upper/margin/distal)

- Tarsus with the meibomian glands (upper and lower lids, all sections of lids)

- Palpebral conjunctiva (upper and lower lids, all sections of lids)

Adnexal structures in the eyelid skin include eyelashes, sebaceous glands of Zeis, and sweat glands of Moll. The levator and orbicularis muscles are made up of striated muscle, while Müller's muscle is made up of smooth muscle. The marginal part of the orbicularis muscle is called the muscle of Riolan, and the superficial part of this muscle can be observed as a colored line that separates the meibomian gland orifices from the row of eyelashes. This line is called the gray line and is significant as it demarcates the separation of the anterior and posterior lamellae. Lesions in front of the septum are called preseptal and, as in the case of preseptal cellulitis, are less serious than those posterior to the septum, such as orbital cellulitis.

The most common causes of benign eyelid lesions are:

- Inflammation of a blocked gland (e.g., chalazion)

- Infection and inflammation of a gland (e.g., hordeolum)

- Lipid accumulation in the dermis (e.g., xanthelasma)

- Cyst formation of adnexal or epidermis structures (e.g., epidermal inclusion cyst, cyst of Moll, cyst of Zeiss)

- Melanocyte proliferation in the dermis and epidermis (e.g., nevus)

- The proliferation of cells in the epidermis (acanthosis) and hyperkeratosis (e.g., seborrheic keratosis, acrochordon/skin tag)

- Infection of the epidermis (usually viral, e.g., verruca vulgaris, molluscum contagiosum)

Several of the phakomatoses are associated with benign eyelid lesions.

- Neurofibromatosis Type 1 -plexiform neurofibroma

- Tuberous sclerosis -angiofibroma

- Sturge-Weber Syndrome -port-wine stain
