Congenital megalocornea may be asymptomatic for some patients. Thus, the diagnosis may not be made until complications arise.CHRDL1 associated megalocornea generally have normal fundi and optic discs. Electroretinograms have shown some generalized cone system dysfunction in select patients, and visual evoked potentials may show delays in pathway conduction, which may be explained by a decrease in white matter myelination. However, the patient's cognitive ability remains intact, or slightly above average.

Due to the variety of discovered mutations thus far, and the likelihood of additional mutations existing, genetic testing across the entire coding region in the X chromosome is the most definitive diagnostic measure to establish a correct diagnosis and allow for the best possible patient care.
