The QT interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG) represents the duration of the ventricular action potential, and this physiologically correlates with the duration of the ventricular depolarization and repolarization. Cardiac events and fatal arrhythmias may occur when the QT interval is prolonged either congenitally or through acquired causes.
