Education of patients regarding the risk factors for exposure to HPV as well as safe sexual practices in general may reduce the risk of HPV infection.

Vaccines have been developed against high-risk types HPV16 and 18 as well as low-risk types HPV6 and 11.  These are effective at preventing initial as well as persistent infection and their associated SILs.  As a majority of high-grade lesions are associated with HPV16, it is predicted that vaccination can reduce the incidence of HGSIL/CIN2/CIN3 by up to 87%, though it remains to be validated in the general population.
