The right device for the right patient should be the provider's rationale.

Discussion and effective communication between the primary or referring physician, the cardiologist, and the cardiac electrophysiologist shouldÂ be ensured at all times. This will not only minimize the development of the syndrome by selecting the right device for the right patient but will also help in effective management that improves patient outcomes and ensures patient safety.
