Lobectomy surgery effectiveness depends on etiology and the surgical approach (open lobectomy and VATS lobectomy). VATS has been the preferred approach due mainly to the results in postoperative recovery. However, when VATS is not indicated, open lobectomy is performed to improve patient transoperative safety.

VATS lobectomy for infectious focal bronchiectasis or cavities can be performed safely with low rates of mortality (0% to 1%) and morbidity (9% to 23%), the mean length of hospital stay is four days, also VATS lobectomy for congenital lung diseases is feasible and effective in selected patients, with a conversion rate is 4%. NCCN recommends VATS lobectomy for lung cancer resection; research has shown VATS lobectomy to have minor complications rates and better long-term survival compared to open thoracotomy lobectomy for NSCLC.
