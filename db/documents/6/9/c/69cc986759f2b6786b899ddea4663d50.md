Over the past several decades, there has been a significant increase in opioid use, misuse, and abuse,Â although the phenomenon seems to be dramatic, especially in some geographical areas, while in others such as Europe, the consumption and misuse or abuse of opioids is less alarming. This upward trend in opioid use started in the 1990s, especially in the United States, which is the largest consumer of opioid drugs globally, accounting for close to 80% of the opioids produced worldwide. Prescription opioids are now the leading drug of abuse, and their use can produce both medical and psychological side effects. Opioid overdose, indeed, is the most common cause of accidental death among young adults. As of 2018, predictions suggest that there could be close to 500000 opioid-related deaths in the United States over the next decade. The effects of the misuse of opioids are manifold. In the surgical setting, for instance, opioid misuse is associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications, postoperative death, and falls and fractures in the elderly.
