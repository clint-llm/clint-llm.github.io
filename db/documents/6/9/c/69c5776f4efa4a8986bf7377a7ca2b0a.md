"Atypical glandular cells (AGC)" is the term adopted by The Bethesda system of reporting cervicovaginal cytology.

One of the major revisions of the Bethesda system is the substitution of “Atypical glandular cells of unknown significance (AGUS)” with “Atypical glandular cells (AGC).”  AGC is the term used to categorize glandular cells with cytologic features that are too pronounced to be called inflammatory or reactive but cannot be classified as malignant (endocervical adenocarcinoma in situ or invasive). AGC is a significant diagnosis and can include conditions that range from reactive and inflammatory conditions to dysplasia and malignancy.
