The literature indicates that around 30% of women in post-menopausal age and 50% to 80% of men are reported to have additional factors contributing to secondary osteoporosis.

Osteoporosis is a worldwide problem causing more than 8 million fractures annually, resulting in one osteoporosis fracture occurring every 3 seconds. If we use the WHO definition of osteoporosis, this disease affects 6% of men and 21% of women above the age of 50. With these statistics, approximately 500 million people may be affected worldwide.
