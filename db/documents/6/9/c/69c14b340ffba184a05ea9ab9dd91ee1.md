If possible, a thorough history should be obtained to determine the amount, type of substance, and other substances taken. It is also essential to establish whether or not the ingestion was intentional or unintentional. A cardinal sign of alkali ingestion is chemical burns on the mucosa of the oral cavity.

When caustic ingestions occur, splashing can expose other parts of the body to these substances. For example, caustic materials that come into contact with the conjunctiva may cause ocular burns, which are very painful and can cause visual damage to structures in the anterior portion of the eye.  Another physical finding associated with caustic ingestion is “dribble burns,” which are streaks of burns on the chest and face.
