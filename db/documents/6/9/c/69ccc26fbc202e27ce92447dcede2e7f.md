The history of and physical exam is often inconsistent when evaluating for acute myocardial infarction. The history should focus on the onset, quality, and associated symptoms. Recent studies have found that diaphoresis and bilateral arm radiating pain most often are associated with myocardial infarction in men. Associated symptoms include:

- Lightheadedness

- Anxiety

- Cough

- Choking sensation

- Diaphoresis

- Wheezing

- Irregular heart rate

Physical exam, most importantly, should note vital signs and patient’s appearance, including diaphoresis, as well as lung findings, and cardiac auscultation.

- Heart rate may reveal tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, or ventricular arrhythmia

- Unequal pulses if the patient has an aortic dissection

- Blood pressure is usually high, but hypotension if the patient is in shock

- Tachypnea and fever are not uncommon.

- Neck veins may be distended, indicating right ventricular failure

- Heart: lateral displacement of apical impulse, soft S1, palpable S4, new mitral regurgitation murmur. A loud holosystolic murmur radiating to the sternum may be indicative of ventricular septal rupture.

- Wheezing and rales are common if the patient has developed pulmonary edema

- Extremities may show edema or cyanosis and will be cold
