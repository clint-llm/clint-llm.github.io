The physician performing the perimortem cesarean section should ideally be one with the most surgical experience in the room. During normal Cesarean deliveries, the most common types of incisions utilized include the Joel-Cohen incision, Pfannenstiel incision, and midline vertical incision. However, in the setting of a perimortem C-section, a midline vertical incision is the preferred initial approach. The initial incision should begin from the level of the uterine fundus to the pubic symphysis. Other authors have quoted a more optimal approach with an incision from the xiphoid to the pubis. Ideally, a No. 10 blade scalpel should be used for the incision. One should cut through the subcutaneous tissues to get to the peritoneal wall, and blunt dissection can be used to achieve this method as well. Once the peritoneal wall is reached, an incision can be made inferiorly with a scalpel, or scissors (ideally). Subsequently, the peritoneum can be cut vertically with scissors. Once the uterus is delivered, a midline vertical incision should be made on the lower portion of the uterine corpus to avoid the placenta while avoiding the bowel and the bladder. Once the uterine cavity is initially entered, the index and middle fingers should be used to separate the uterine wall away from the fetus, and then the incision can be extended with scissors. The incision should be extended upward until the baby is exposed. Once exposed, the cord should be clamped, and cut. Once delivered the infant should be promptly resuscitated. The open uterus and the abdomen should be packed to prevent further bleeding. Further closure of the incision depends on the maternal response resuscitative efforts. ACLS/ATLS should be continued on the mother until ROSC is achieved, and if achieved further closure should be continued in the OR. Also, if maternal survivability is considered likely, then the patient should receive antibiotic prophylaxis with any broad-spectrum penicillin or cephalosporin in a single dose.
