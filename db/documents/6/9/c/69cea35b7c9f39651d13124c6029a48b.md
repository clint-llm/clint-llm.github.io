If the diagnosis remains unclear on physical exam, further investigation is warranted to confirm the diagnosis and rule out disc edema. Imaging modalities include B-Scan ultrasonography, CT scan, fluoresceinÂ angiography, fundus autofluorescence, and optical coherence tomography (OCT).

For both superficial and deep drusen, ultrasound may demonstrate a highly echogenic focus at the disc, representing calcification.

Fundus autofluorescence will demonstrate optic nerve drusen as bright hyperfluorescent foci in the disc, revealing all visible and most buried drusen.

While ultrasound and OCT provide excellent mechanisms to identify nerve drusen, OCT with enhanced depth imaging provides superior visualization, with one study revealing a 100% detection rate of buried drusen compared to 82% by non-EDI OCT and 41% by ultrasound.

In addition to detecting the presence of nerve drusen, certain imaging modalities can assist the physician in assessing possible complications and effects of the drusen. For example, OCT can help track nerve fiber thinning that can predict visual field loss.
