Specific radiation doses are communicated in Gray (Gy), a measure of absorbed radiation that is the predominant unit used in clinical practice, and the Sievert (Sv), which considers the relative biological effectiveness of the specific type of radiation within the tissue. Both units measure one joule of energy absorbed per kilogram. RICT is both a short and long-term concern, with the median time to diagnosis estimated to be 19 years.

Valvular disease is a late complication. Fibrosis, calcification, and thickening of the valves can occur asymptomatically for over 15 years before becoming clinically apparent. Prominent damage is more common in the left-sided valves and can manifest as stenosis, regurgitation, or a proclivity towards endocarditis. Valvular effects can occur at doses >30 Gy.

Arrhythmias are another late effect of radiation therapy due to toxicity to the sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes and the conduction system of the heart. Transient and asymptomatic arrhythmia may occur within a year of therapy, but permanent damage to the cardiac nodes and bundle branch blocks may manifest ten or more years after treatment completion. The association between the development of arrhythmias and the dose received has not been thoroughly studied; therefore, the absorbed dose associated with arrhythmias is not well described.

Atherosclerosis is worsened by radiation therapy, as the inflammatory effects of radiation accelerate the damage to the vascular endothelium. Therefore, premature or worsened coronary artery disease (CAD) is another potential complication of radiation therapy to the heart and increases the risk of unstable angina, myocardial infarction, and cardiac mortality.

Given the potentially serious consequences of cardiac damage during radiation therapy, techniques for mitigating collateral cardiac irradiation have been developed. One option is using proton or heavy particle (e.g., carbon ion) therapy due to the theoretical advantage offered by reducing the exit dose characteristic to such particles. Treatment in the prone position is an option for breast cancer that allows the breast to displace through an aperture in the treatment table away from the body that has shown to reduce heart and lung dose received over traditional supine treatment.

A promising option for the reduction of heart dose in patients with left-sided breast cancer is the deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) technique, in which a patient is asked to hold a moderately deep breath while lying supine to increase lung filling, thus moving the chest wall target further from the heart [see attached image]. Surface imaging is used to measure chest rise at the time of simulation and treatment, and treatment is only delivered while the lungs are expanded into the appropriate position, allowing for reproducibility during each fraction and assurance of treatment delivery as planned. Multiple studies have shown up to a 40-50% relative reduction in dose received by the heart as a result of this technique, with mean LAD doses of 2-3Gy.

In treating lung and esophageal cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma, or when DIBH is not available for left breast cancer, highly conformal therapies such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) may be used to minimize radiation dose to the heart as compared with older 3D planning techniques.

It is important to identify pre-existing risk factors for heart disease in cancer patients before administering thoracic radiation therapy, with relevant intervention including smoking cessation counseling, as well as ensuring adequate treatment of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. Additionally, a full cardiac evaluation including EKG and echocardiogram should be performed prior to radiation therapy when planned to be combined with anthracyclines or trastuzumab.

There are currently no official screening guidelines for radiation-induced cardiac toxicity. However, given the known interplay of radiation with pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors, it is reasonable to suggest that identifying these at-risk patients and close follow-up for all could facilitate earlier diagnosis and treatment of any radiation-induced cardiac toxicities. When evaluating potential heart disease, imaging including cardiac MRI, CT, echocardiography, and myocardial perfusion studies are high-yield diagnostic tests that may guide further intervention.
