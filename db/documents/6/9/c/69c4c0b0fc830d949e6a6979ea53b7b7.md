Rotor syndrome was first described in 1948 by Rotor et al. in the Philippines. Since then, cases have been reported worldwide, including in the US, Japan, France, Mexico, Papua New Guinea, and Italy. The exact prevalence of the condition is not known. As most patients are asymptomatic, the condition may be picked up based on incidental findingsÂ on investigations done for other reasons. It is the second rare hereditary cause of hyperbilirubinemia, the first being Crigler-Najjar type 1.
