Every healthcare institution must be motivated to equip themselves with a joint, multidisciplinary “Thyroid Clinic” comprising at least an ophthalmologist and an endocrinologist. This interprofessional approach is highly encouraged as this will not only enhance the management outcomes but will also reduce the burden of healthcare cost on these patients, especially in lower-to-middle income countries. Owing to the autoimmune nature of the disease, the patients must be counseled regarding the need for a lifelong follow-up. Due to the lack of Level 1 evidence-based data in DON, randomized multi-center trials must be conducted to understand the exact etiopathogenesis of DON, the role of steroid-sparing immunosuppressive drugs, especially in co-morbid conditions, and alternate surgical approaches to maximize healthcare outcomes and enhance the patient's quality of life.
