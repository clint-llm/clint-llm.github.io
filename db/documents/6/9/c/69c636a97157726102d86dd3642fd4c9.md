Stroke continues to carry high morbidity and mortality. One-year-survival for stroke varies from 60-80%. For those who survive, the recovery is prolonged and the risk of another stroke is high. Most patients following a stroke remain disabled or have partial neurological deficits that prevent them from being active in the workforce.
