CYP enzymes undergo a multitude of reactions, each with slightly different variations depending on the enzyme and substrate involved. As monooxygenases, CYP's primary role is the addition of an oxygen atom to the substrate. In general, the mechanism CYP exhibits in catalyzing reactions depends on a few simple steps.

- CYP enzymes consist of an active site made of a heme-iron center. The iron compound is bound to the protein by a cysteine thiolate molecule.

- Substrate(s) bind to the active site at the heme group, which induces a conformational change of the enzyme's active site.

- Reductases are then responsible for electron transfer from NAD(P)H.

- Oxygen binds to the ferrous-heme group following the reduction of iron.

- Another electron is added via reduction, creating a Fe-O2 group known as a peroxide state.

- The peroxide group is short-lived as it gets protonated twice to release water and another compound known as P450 Compound 1 (FeO3+). This activity allows for the acquisition of the necessary and further hydroxylated to a more excretable, hydrophilic compound. In general, the result of the mechanism appears as such:

O2 + NAD(P)H + H+ + RH â†’ NAD(P)+ + H2O + ROH

Drugs and other compounds that already have a free polar group can skip phase I, where they will proceed directly to phase II for conjugation.
