Riedel thyroiditis must be differentiated from other masses in the anterior neck, which can infiltrate the surrounding extra-thyroidal tissues, namely anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, thyroid lymphoma, and thyroid sarcoma.

Anaplastic carcinoma is an undifferentiated malignant tumor usually seen in older individuals that can clinically mimic Reidel thyroiditis with dysphagia or tracheal compression symptoms. Key differences are those with anaplastic carcinoma are older than 70 to 80 years of age, while those with Reidel thyroiditis are younger women in their fifth decade of life, and biopsy or FNA show no malignant cells.

Other differentials include a fibrosing variant of Hashimoto thyroiditis characterized by high titers of anti-thyroid antibodies, the presence of Hurthle cells, lack of extra-thyroidal extension, and phlebitis.
