Calcium concentration is regulated by plasma membrane calcium receptor, PTH and its receptor, calcitonin and its receptor, and by the actions of vitamin D on kidneys, bone, and intestines. PTH mobilizes calcium directly by enhancing bone resorption, and indirectly, by stimulating one alpha-hydroxylase which increases vitamin D3 production, in turn, leading to increased absorption of calcium from the gut and increased bone resorption. Primary hyperparathyroidism is due to a solitary adenoma or diffuse hyperplasia of the gland. In this condition, there is an abnormal set point in the relation between calcium and PTH levels and calcium-independent PTH secretion.  Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is inherited autosomal dominant pattern and is due to an inactivating mutation in the calcium-sensing receptor gene. Granulomatous lesions cause ectopic vitamin D production. Transient neonatal hypercalcemia can rarely be seen in infants born to mothers with hypoparathyroidism.

Hypercacemia from hyperparathyroidism is mild and could go one for years and be asymptomatic. Hypercalcemia from malignancy is assoicated with rapidly increasing calcium levels
