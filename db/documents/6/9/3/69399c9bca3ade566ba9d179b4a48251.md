Children often have genu varum (bowleg) or genu valgum (knock knee) which are considered normal during certain age ranges. If these conditions persist past a certain age, they are deemed pathologic and may require bracing and surgical treatment. Some individuals suffer from ligamentous laxity that is primary or secondary to connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers Danlos. These individuals are at an increased risk for knee dislocations and other hypermobility injuries that can lead to chronic knee pain. Skeletal dysplasia is often congenital and encompasses hundreds of different diseases that may affect structures of the knee significantly, luckily most of them are rare. There are variants of each knee structure that have the potential to alter the biomechanicsÂ of the entire knee.
