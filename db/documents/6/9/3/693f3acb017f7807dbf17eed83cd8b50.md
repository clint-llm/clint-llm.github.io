Isolated LMI, similar to other acute MI, is caused by acute atherosclerotic plaque rupture with subsequent thrombus formation in LCx or one of its branches. More commonly, LAD is involved in the ensuing anterolateral MI. In patients with recent drug-eluting stents, medication non-compliance can cause stent restenosis resulting in acute MI.  On rare occasions, patients can present with myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA). The prevalence of MINOCA is estimated at around 6% based on a meta-analysis done in 2015.
