In the brain, bombesin is known as neuromedin B and is involved in smooth muscle contraction.

Bombesin causes the release of endogenous gastrin, activating sensory neurons located in the gastric fundus responsible for gastric smooth muscle motility and luminal protection. Activation of sensory neurons causes increased production of nitric oxide through activation of constitutive nitric oxide synthase. Activation of nitric oxide synthase leads to an increase in gastric mucosal blood flow and makes the stomach less susceptible to injury from luminal irritants.

Bombesin is predominantly known to regulate homeostasis within the gastrointestinal tract.

Bombesin can function as a growth factor through autocrine or paracrine mechanisms, which may modulate the growth of various benign and neoplastic tissues. Therefore, the problem this protein can address is that of prostate precision. The fact that radiolabeling cannot differentiate between benign hyperplastic prostate cells and malignant carcinoma cells limits their diagnostic value. Hence, there has been much effort put into developing new prostate carcinomaâ€“specific PET tracers with high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.
