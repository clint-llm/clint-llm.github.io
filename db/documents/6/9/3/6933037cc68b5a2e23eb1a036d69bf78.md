The onset of symptoms will typically occur one to two weeks after arrival in a resource-limited destination, though travelers can develop symptoms throughout their stay or shortly after arrival. Diagnostic criteria for Travelers' diarrhea are three or more loose stools in 24 hours or a two-fold increase from baseline bowel habits. Diarrhea often occurs precipitously and is accompanied by abdominal cramping, fever, nausea, or vomiting. The patients' review of systems should include blood in their stool, fever, chills, or any associated symptoms. A thorough travel history should be obtained, including timeline and itinerary, diet and water consumption at their destination, illnesses in other travelers, and possible sexual exposures.

In most self-limited cases, a physical examination will show mild diffuse abdominal tender to palpation. Providers should assess for dehydration through skin turgor and capillary refill.Â  In more severe cases, patients may have severe abdominal pain, high fever, and evidence of hypovolemia (tachycardia, hypotension).
