Deep cervical lymph nodes lie along the internal jugular vein, mainly on its superficial surface. At the confluence of the left subclavian and internal jugular vein, lymphatics drain via the left thoracic duct. The left thoracic duct is responsible for draining lymph from below the diaphragm and theÂ left half of the upper body.
