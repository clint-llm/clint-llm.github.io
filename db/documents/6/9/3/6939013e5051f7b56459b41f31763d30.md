Normal flexion, also known as withdrawal to pain, can appear similar to decorticate posturing. However, normal flexion is a rapid and variable movement compared with the slow and stereotypical movements of abnormal flexion. In normal flexion, the shoulder abducts away from the body, the wrist is either neutral or extended, and importantly, there is no extension in the lower limbs. In abnormal flexion, the shoulder adducts, and internal rotates, the wrist flexes with forearm pronation. A key feature is the extension of the lower limbs.

Spinal reflexes may still be present following brain death. One study found motor spinal responses present in 22% of patients with confirmed brain death. These can be mistaken for abnormal posturing movements such as decerebration.

Opisthotonus is extra-pyramidal abnormal posturing seen in cerebral palsy, tetanus, drowning victims, TBI, and poisoning. It is abnormal posturing with a dramatically arched back and neck.

Lastly, patients with corticospinal tract injuries, such as ischaemic strokes, hemorrhages, or tumors, can develop spasticity. Usually in the upper limb flexor muscles dominate and extensor in the lower limb, similar to decorticate posturing. The most striking difference between spasticity and abnormal posturing is the preservation of consciousness in spastic patients.
