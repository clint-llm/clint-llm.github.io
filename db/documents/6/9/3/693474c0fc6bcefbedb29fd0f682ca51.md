Prevention of the ilioinguinal neuralgia is possible; surgeons should work to avoid injury of the nerves near the field of the surgery and use meshes that don't induce fibrotic reactions. The diagnosis and treatment of ilioinguinal neuralgia need an interprofessional approach. Collaboration between physiatrists, neurologists, pain physicians, and surgeons should direct a proper approach to therapy to improve prognosis. Nurses and therapists should teach patients a healthy lifestyle to minimize pain and improve the activities of daily living. The pain can be severe, and it is best to involve the pain specialist and the pharmacist early. The pharmacist should educate the patient on pain medications and their adverse effects. The pain specialist may have to try a variety of medical and non-medical measures to obtain pain relief. While some patients do obtain pain relief, a significant number of patients will have chronic pain that can affect the quality of life. Because the pain may lead to depression and anxiety, a mental health nurse should counsel the patient.
