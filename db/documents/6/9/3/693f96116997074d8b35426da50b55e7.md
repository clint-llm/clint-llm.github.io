Clinical disease is due to parasitic nematode larva migration through tissues. The signs and symptoms differ based on the affected organ and the host inflammatory response. There are four types of disease: ocular larva migrans (OLM), visceral larva migrans (VLM), neurotoxocariasis, and covert toxocariasis. The covert disease most often presents with simple, persistent eosinophilia and may be attributed to the continuation of the migratory phase. Interestingly, this migratory phase may last for years.

The larva often accumulate in organs but are not able to complete the life cycle in humans. In the organs, the larva incite a granulomatous reaction or an abscess.
