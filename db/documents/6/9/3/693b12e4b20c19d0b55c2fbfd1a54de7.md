Bacterial endocarditis refers to infection of the endocardial surface of the heart. It usually involves heart valves, but it can occur on the endocardium or intracardiac devices. Acute endocarditis is a febrile illness that rapidly damages cardiac structures and spreads hematogenously which can progress to death within weeks if not treated. Subacute endocarditis has a slower disease process and may be present for weeks to months with gradual progression unless complicated by major embolic event or ruptured structure. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of bacterial endocarditis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of bacterial endocarditis.
- Review the presentation of a patient with bacterial endocarditis.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for bacterial endocarditis.
- Explain the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding the management of patients with bacterial endocarditis.
