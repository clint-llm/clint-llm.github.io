The diagnosis of EILO can be missed or delayed. This is mainly due to receiving an alternative diagnosis like asthma that is more common than EILO, but also to the lack of awareness about this condition in the community. The delay or inappropriate diagnosis can result in patients receiving extensive workups and unnecessary medications.

This highlights the need to increase awareness about EILO in the community, especially primary care providers, school nurses, and sports coaches. Successful management of EILO requires an interprofessional team approach. The team includes:

- Pulmonologists are usually the first-line providers. Understanding the main difference between EILO and other differential is critical, especially asthma. It is also important for a pulmonologist to rule out other conditions.

- Otolaryngologists have a central role in the evaluation of the upper airway structures. Also, in refractory cases, surgical management (supraglottoplasty) might be required.

- Speech and language pathologists have a crucial role in managing EILO and preventing recurrent symptoms.

- Psychology can also assist in behavioral therapy and biofeedback.

- Family clinicians (including NPs and PAs) can help monitor and assess long-term results after release from active therapy. They may also be the first to encounter the condition and initiate a referral for more specialized interventions.

With open collaboration and communication between providers across interprofessional lines, patient outcomes are more likely to achieve optimal resolution. [Level 5]
