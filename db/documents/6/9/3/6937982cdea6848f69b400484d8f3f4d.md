A standard screening tool for obesity is the measurement of body mass index (BMI). BMI is calculated using weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters.

- Underweight: less than 18.5 kg/m2

- Normal range: 18.5 kg/m2 to 24.9 kg/m2

- Overweight: 25 kg/m2 to 29.9 kg/m2

- Obese, Class I: 30 kg/m2 to 34.9 kg/m2

- Obese, Class II: 35 kg/m2 to 39.9 kg/m2

- Obese, Class III: more than 40 kg/m2

Waist to hip ratio should be measured, in men more than 1:1 and women more than 0:8 is considered significant.

Further evaluation studies like skinfold thickness, bioelectric impedance analysis, CT, MRI, DEXA, water displacement, and air densitometry studies can be done.

Laboratory studies include complete blood picture, basic metabolic panel, renal function, liver function study, lipid profile, HbA1C, TSH, vitamin D levels, urinalysis, CRP, other studies like ECG and sleep studies can be done for evaluating associated medical conditions.
