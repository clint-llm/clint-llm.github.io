Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia is very common among middle-aged women of African ancestry with hairs that grow in curled or kinked configuration with a prevalence of 3% to 6%. It is the most frequent cause of alopecia in African Americans. It is uncommon in men and children. The mean age of onset of the disease in women is 36 years.

Currently, there is no well documented published evidence about the involvement of CCCA in the nonblack population.
