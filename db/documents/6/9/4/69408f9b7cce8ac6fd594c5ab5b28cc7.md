The anesthesiologist will sedate and intubate the patient. The patient is placed in the dorsal lithotomy position with candy cane stirrups or Allen stirrups to position her legs. Colposcopy with 5% acetic acid or Lugol’s solution can be performed in the operating room depending on the surgeon’s preference and ability to see the cervical lesion. The vagina is prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion with drainage of the bladder. Surgical scrub solutions of Hibiclens antimicrobial scrub or Betadine are adequate for vaginal prep. There are no indicated antibiotics necessary for this procedure. A vasoconstrictor solution is mixed. It is typically vasopressin 20IU diluted with 50cc saline before the start of the procedure. Lidocaine without epinephrine can be added to the solution to provide local anesthesia simultaneously.
