The spinal meninges, along with the cranial meninges, have a complex embryologic origin. The pia and arachnoid mater, collectively known as the leptomeninges, are derived from the neural crest. The neural crest itself forms from the ectoderm-derived neuroectoderm and neural plate. The dura mater derives from the mesoderm.
