Changes in glomerular dynamics are important factors for clinicians to consider when evaluating the effects of diverse pathologies on the kidney. Afferent arteriole constriction leads to decreased GFR and decreased RPF, resulting in no change in FF. One important function of prostaglandins is to dilate the afferent arteriole. Thus when non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are administered to patients, these changes in the glomerulus are to be expected because NSAIDs reduce the formation of prostaglandins.

One of the most commonly used medications for patients with diabetes or heart failure is an ACE inhibitor. It reduces the formation of angiotensin II, which in turn decreases GFR by preventing the constriction of efferent arterioles. Because ACE inactivates bradykinin, a potent vasodilator, a side effect of using an ACE inhibitor is angioedema from increased bradykinin levels. Another common adverse reaction is a cough. Patients with intolerance should be switched to angiotensin II receptors blockers (ARBs).

In patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing anesthesia, care should be taken to maintain renal perfusion pressures as certain agents are known to decrease the GFR and cause renal injury such as methoxyflurane.
