A predominant area of concern in calculating body surface area is that many different equations are used in the calculation. As such, some of the equations may yield vastly different results from others. In the clinical context, this presents a significant challenge. For example, body surface area is used to calculate the dosing regimen for many medications to ensure the medication’s therapeutic window is maintained and adverse effects avoided. Significant variances in body surface area calculations potentially result in over or underdosing of drugs and failure to obtain the targeted effects of the drug.
