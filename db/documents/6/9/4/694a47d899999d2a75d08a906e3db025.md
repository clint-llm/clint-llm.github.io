Listening to the patient's chief complaint is essential, and determining mutual, realistic goals for the operation is paramount. Important questions to discuss are any history of constipation or difficulty in passing urine, clothing preference, dietary habits, exercise, and general activity level.

Focus special attention on the general length of the abdomen and the relationship of the costal margins to the iliac crest region. The lowest point of the costal margin to the iliac crests determines the waist configuration and potential for increasing definition at the waist. Patients with 5 to 6 cm waist configurations are considered short-waisted, while those with 10 to 11 cm configurations are long-waisted.

The elasticity of the abdominal wall skin should be assessed. Photos should be obtained, and the patient should be cleared for surgery by the internist. It is vital to inform the patient about the risks of surgery, both medical/surgical as well as psychological, in terms of expectations and how any medical complications may affect said expectations. The patient should have realistic expectations about the procedure, and if there is any question in the mind of the medical, surgical, or anesthetic team, consultation with a psychiatrist pre-operatively is prudent.
