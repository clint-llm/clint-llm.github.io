When drawing blood, it is important to prioritize the efficiency of the draw and the overall comfort of the patient. Thus, drawing blood from veins is preferred compared to arteries. This is because veins run superficially. Furthermore, arteries tend to have thicker walls and have more nerves associated with them, resulting in increased pain should they be punctured. Therefore, arterial blood sampling would be indicated for gathering data on arterial blood gases.

The common location for a blood draw is in the medial cubital fossa. In this area, the medial cubital vein is superficial and covers the bicipital aponeurosis in the cubital fossa.

This is in contrast to the dorsum of the hand, which is the preferred location for establishing an IV site. It is extremely critical to distinguish the median cubital vein from the basilic vein, medial along the arm. Extra precaution when drawing blood from the basilic vein is necessary because it runs with the artery and nerve. A puncture here can be extremely painful and uncomfortable for the patient. Severing the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve near the basilic vein results in loss of sensation to the skin of the medial forearm.

Other common locations for blood draws include the lateral plantar surface of the heel in an infant and the cephalic and basilic vein in the cubital fossa.
