Genitourinary tuberculosis is becoming a significant public health problem in the developing world. Patients from an endemic area who present with clinical symptoms or signs of GUTB should be investigated without delay. Early detection of the disease, prompt and appropriate ATT, patient education, and appropriate long-term monitoring is needed to eradicate GUTB. Managing cases of GUTB involves a multi-disciplinary team approach that includes an infectious disease expert, a urologist, a gynecologist, a radiologist, public health clinician, and an infectious diseases pharmacist. With early detection and appropriate management, GUTB has a good prognosis and low relapse rate. [LevelÂ 2]
