A complete history and physical examination should be completed for all patients to screen for contraindications of intragastric balloon placement. The patient's history should focus on any gastrointestinal disorders. Absolute contraindications to an intragastric balloon include any prior gastric surgeries, coagulopathies, severe liver disease, upper gastrointestinal bleeding lesions, pregnancy as well as the desire to become pregnant, alcoholism, drug addiction, and any contraindication for the patient to undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).

Some of the balloons are placed via EGD or swallowing. In circumstances in which a balloon retrieval is necessary due to complications, an EGD can be required for this retrieval process. The relative contraindications to intragastric balloon therapy include a large hiatal hernia measuring 3 cm or greater in size, inflammatory bowel disease including ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease, previous abdominal surgeries, esophagitis, chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug usage, and any prior uncontrolled psychiatric disorders.

Of note, a hiatal hernia larger than 5 cm in size is considered an absolute contraindication for the Orbera intragastric balloon. Psychiatric disorders should be addressed before balloon placement, as this could equate to problems with compliance.
