The inguinal lymph node resides within the femoral triangle. The femoral triangle is bounded by the inguinal ligament, adductor longus muscle, and sartorius muscle. The fascia lata forms the roof of the femoral triangle. The floor of the femoral triangle forms from the iliopsoas and pectineus muscles. On surgery day, technetium-99m radiolabelled nano colloid is injected into the primary site of cancer. The location of the sentinel node is located using a handheld gamma camera. Blue dye is also often injected in the primary site of cancer to assist with visualization of the sentinel node after making the incision.

A surgical approach in this area can give several adverse symptoms for the patient:

- Lymphocele

- Wound dehiscence

- Skin necrosis

- Seroma

- Ventral inguinal hernia
