**Transmission**

Candida auris is efficiently transmitted person-to-person.C. auris is different from most other Candida species in that most cases of candidiasis arise from the host's microflora rather than acquisition from another person. C. auris is not considered a resident commensal organism and is not typically present within the human gastrointestinal tract, as are many other Candida species.C. auris has a particular predilection for skin, particularly the axilla and groin. It has the potential to colonize hosts within days to weeks of exposure, and invasive infections may occur within days to months after colonization.C. auris may persist for many months and possibly indefinitely.

C. auris can spread through contact with contaminated surfaces and fomites when shed from infected or colonized patients. Studies have found that C. auris may be found in patients' rooms and outside the patient's rooms in hallways, chairs, beds, windowsills, counters, electrocardiogram leads, blood pressure cuffs, infusion pumps, and ventilators.C. auris.C. auris persistence show that it may survive on moist or dry surfaces for seven days.C. auris cells might remain viable for up to 4 weeks and culturable for two weeks.C. auris.

**Virulence Factors**

Genetic studies of Candida auris have shown that a significant percentage of its genes are involved in central metabolism, a common trait among pathogenic Candida species that allows for adaptation in divergent environments.Candida auris has numerous virulence attributes that resemble C. albicans, such as enzyme secretion, nutrient acquisition, siderophore-based iron acquisition, tissue invasion, two-component histidine kinase system, and pathways involved in cell wall modeling.C. auris showed different levels of phospholipase and proteinase production.

C. auris has also demonstrated the ability to evade the immune response. In a comparison study between Candida albicans and Candida auris, neutrophils preferentially targeted and killed C. albicans.C. auris evaded the neutrophil attack and the innate immune response, which is in line with another study showing that recognition and ability to stimulate cytokine release and phagocytosis were greater in C. albicans versus C. auris.

C. auris also form biofilms allowing for adherence to surfaces and plastic materials. Biofilm formation is also strain-dependent, and C. auris shows a reduced ability to adhere and form biofilms compared to Candida albicans due to the rarity of pseudohyphae.

In vitro studies have shown C. auris isolates may be aggregating or non-aggregating. The failure of C. auris to release daughter cells after budding results in a large aggregation of cells that is difficult to disrupt by detergent vortexing or detergent.C. albicans.C. auris, growing optimally in temperatures of 37 degrees Celcius and surviving in temperatures up to 42 degrees Celcius, also helps certain strains persist in hospital environments.

**Resistance Factors**

Although C. auris can express the virulence mentioned above factors, the expression is weaker than other Candida species. The primary factor contributing to its high mortality rates is its ability to develop resistance to multiple antifungal agents.

Another study found that C. auris isolates with biofilms did not show susceptibility to any antifungal agent, including fluconazole, echinocandins, and polyenes, compared to planktonic C. auris isolates, which were only resistant to fluconazole.Candida auris have shown expansions of genes linked to drug resistance and multidrug efflux.
