As discussed earlier, many important structures surround the fourth ventricle, namely the pons and medulla of the brainstem, as well as the cerebellum. This anatomic arrangement makes accessing the fourth ventricle very difficult, especially when trying to remove a tumor without severely impacting the rest of the surrounding brain.

In the past, access to lesions of the fourth ventricle was through the cerebellar cortex by opening the cerebellar vermis; this was called the transvermian approach. However, this was shown to lead to disturbances of equilibrium and cerebellar mutism, most likely from damaging the median and paramedian cerebellar structures.

Now, a method called the telovelar approach is gaining favor; this is performed by accessing the fourth ventricle through the cerebellomedullary fissure, a space between the cerebellum and medulla oblongata. This functions as a natural track into the ventricular cavity. The tela choroidea and the inferior medullary velum, which make up part of the roof of the fourth ventricle, come into visualizationÂ and can be opened after elevating the cerebellar tonsils. This approach allows surgeons to access the fourth ventricle without dissecting through neural tissue, thus causing less damage.
