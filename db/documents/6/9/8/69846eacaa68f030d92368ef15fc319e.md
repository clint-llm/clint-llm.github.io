Structure: The rectus femoris is fusiform in shape with superficial fibers that are bipenniform and deep fibers that run straight (rectus) to the deep aponeurosis. The rectus femoris arises from two tendons that originate from the anterior inferior iliac spine and the other from the ridge of the acetabulum. The rectus femoris tendons conjoin at an acute angleÂ spreading into the aponeurosis. The end of the muscle inserts into the base of the patella, forming the patellar tendon with the rest of the quadriceps muscles.

Function: The rectus femoris flexes the hip along with the sartorius and iliopsoas and extends the lower leg at the knee, working in conjunction with the other three quadriceps muscles. The rectus femoris muscle antagonizes the hamstring muscles at the knee and the hip. When seated, the rectus femoris is one of the weaker extensors of the knee. With the knee fully extended, the rectus femoris is relatively short. Consequently, flexion of the hip is limited, which is referred to as active insufficiency. In contrast, when the knee is fully flexed, the rectus femoris is at its longest length, and extension of the hip is subsequently limited; this is passive insufficiency.
