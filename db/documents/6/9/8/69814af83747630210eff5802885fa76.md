Emergency medical service (EMS) practitioners are exposed to many potential dangers on a daily basis. Proper safety measures should be followed at all times to ensure the safety of EMS providers, the team, and patients. During tactical EMS situations, the EMS practitioner has the additional responsibilities of promoting team and public safety while enhancing the probability of special operations mission success. Tactical EMS providers are responsible for implementing the tactics and procedures necessary to protect team members, victims/hostages, bystanders, and perpetrators.  Pre-mission team planning and management are crucial for mission success but often is overlooked.
