The Babinski reflex is part of the routine neurological examination to evaluate the integrity of the corticospinal tract. However, in settings where patients withdraw with plantar stimulation, or if there is a lesion on the lateral plantar aspect of the foot, evaluation of the Chaddock reflex offers a reasonable alternative to the Babinski reflex. Both the Babinski and Chaddock reflex test the integrity of the corticospinal tract. When a lesion occurs anywhere along this corticospinal tract, the examiner may obtain a positive reflex. The examiner watches for dorsiflexion (upward movement) of the big toe and fanning of the other toes. This is referred to as a "positive reflex," or one may state that the "reflex is present." When there is a downward deviation of the toes, this means the reflex is absent. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, performance, and interpretation of the Chaddock reflex and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in assessing patients with neurological deficits.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the indications for the evaluation of the Chaddock reflex.
- Describe the technique involved in evaluating the Chaddock reflex.
- Describe the clinical relevance of a positive Chaddock reflex.
- Explain the importance of a well-coordinated interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing Chaddock reflex evaluation to assess the integrity of the corticospinal tract.
