The pericardium is a fluid-filled doubled-walled membrane sac that surrounds the heart. The fluid is separated by two layers, the fibrous and serous pericardium.

The pericardium can develop an inflammatory process for a variety of reasons and is morphologically classified as follows:

- Fibrinous

- Purulent

- Serous

- Caseous

- Hemorrhagic

The normal pericardium is shiny, glistening, and smooth. In fibrinous pericarditis, the pericardial texture is rough, granular, and has many fibrous adhesions. Fibrinous pericarditis is usually caused by trauma, surgery, acute myocardial infarction, uremia, collagen vascular disorders, and malignancies.
