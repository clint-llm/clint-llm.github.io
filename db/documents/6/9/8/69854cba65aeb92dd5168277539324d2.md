The exact cause of CVS is unknown. In the pediatric patient, CVS is considered by many to be a precursor to migraines later in life. The relationship between the two has been well studied, but no exact cause has been identified. Other studies have made associations with autonomic disturbances or mitochondrial dysfunction. Allergies to foods, stressful triggers, and lack of sleep are also associated with CVS. ThereÂ is an increased frequency during patient menstrual cycles, suggesting a possible hormonal trigger for CVS. Longterm cannabis use has been associated with CVS as well.
