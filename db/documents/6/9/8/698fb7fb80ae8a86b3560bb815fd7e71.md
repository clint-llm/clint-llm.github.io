Initial management of an abused child involves stabilization, including assessing the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation. Once sure that the patient is stable, a complete history and physical examination are necessary. A mandated reporter who has reasonable cause to suspect a child is a victim of child abuse must immediately make a report of suspected child abuse to ChildLine immediately. If there is a child abuse specialist at the pediatric center, their involvement would be optimal. If the patient is seen in an outpatient setting, there may be a need to transfer the patient to a hospital for laboratory and radiologic evaluation and the appropriate continuation of care. Even if a child was transferred to another physician or facility, the physician first involved with the patient care still has the responsibility of being a mandated reporter. Nothing under section 6311 of the PA CPSL (relating to persons required to report suspected child abuse) requires a mandated reporter to identify the person responsible for the child abuse in order to make a report of suspected child abuse. The physician should continue to advocate for the child, ensuring that the patient receives the appropriate follow-up services.

Victims of sexual abuse should have their physical, mental, and psychosocial needs addressed. Baseline sexually transmitted infection (STI) and pregnancy testing should be performed as well as empiric treatment for HIV, gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomonas, and bacterial vaginosis infection for the adolescent victims. This management is possible if the patients present within 72 hours of the incident to receive appropriate care and emergency contraception if desired. Prepubertal patients are not provided with the prophylactic treatment due to the low incidence of STIs in this age group. Urgent evaluation (optimally in less than 72 hours) can prove extremely beneficial for patients needing prophylactic treatment, patients with anogenital injury, for collection of forensic evidence, for patients needing urgent child protection, and in those having suicidal ideation or any other form of symptom and/or injury requiring urgent medical care.
