Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is defined as a resting mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) of more than 20 mmHg.

WHO group 1 is generally referred to as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) is a rare subtype of PAH characterized by progressive obstruction of small pulmonary veins leading to elevated pulmonary arterial pressure and right-sided heart failure.

The clinical features are very non-specific and can resemble congestive heart failure, idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH), and restrictive lung diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis. The gold standard for diagnosis is a biopsy, which is risky and not advisable in pulmonary hypertension due to a high risk of procedure-related complications such as life-threatening bleeding.

No medical therapy is supported by evidence, and the only curative option is lung transplantation.
