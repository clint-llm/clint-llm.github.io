An atypical nevus on the sole can be biopsied with a simple 2 mm punch.  If initial wide excision is chosen, a 1 to 2 mm rim of normal-appearing skin, along with a cuff of sub-dermal fat, is recommended. Once melanoma is found by either the punch or total extensional biopsy, wider excision with surgical margins of 1cm for the 0 to 2 mm thick tumors and up to 5 cm for tumors that are over 2.1 mm in thickness can be planned. This may lead to extensive tissue loss that may require amputation. In general, small plantar melanoma excision sites are allowed to granulate. Once primary healing has taken place, plastic skin grafting and flaps can be used to restore weight-bearing function. Mohs microsurgery has been used to minimize tissue loss. An experienced oncology team is important to improve outcomes. The Melanoma Staging database is based on the clinical experiences in over 38,900 melanoma patients and incorporates a tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system. It relies upon assessments of the primary tumor (T), regional lymph nodes (N), and distant metastatic sites (M). The Breslow thickness primarily determines the T and is modified by the mitotic rate of the tumor. The 10-year survival rate decreases progressively, from 96 percent with primary lesions <0.5 mm thick to 54 percent with lesions 4.01 to 6 mm thick.
