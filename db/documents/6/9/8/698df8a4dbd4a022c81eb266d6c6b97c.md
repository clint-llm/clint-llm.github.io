Per the CDC, 1 in 4 people with heart disease die each year in the United States,Â making it the leading cause of death in both men and women. Heart failure is still a challenge to many health care providers and is associated with higher rates of readmissions and increased morbidity and mortality. Treatment methods will vary based on the nature and extent of the pathophysiology. The primary goals of management are to improve prognosis and reduce morbidity and mortality with appropriate therapies.
