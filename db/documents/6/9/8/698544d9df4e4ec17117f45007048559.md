Endogenous opioids are neurotransmitters or neuromodulators that act by changing the electrical properties of other target neurons, thereby making these neurons difficult to excite.

Pro-opiomelanocortin is a polypeptide cleaved by the enzyme peptidase into adrenocorticotropin-releasing hormone (ACTH) and beta-Lipotropin (beta-LPH), containing 93 amino acids. Beta-LPH is further cleaved to yield alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) and beta-endorphin (beta-endorphin), a polypeptide containing 31 amino acids.

Pro-enkephalin is a seven-peptide-containing structure, first identified in the adrenal medulla. Each molecule of pro-enkephalin contains four met-enkephalins, one leu-enkephalin, one octapeptide, and one heptapeptide. Enkephalins have a short half-life both in vivo and in vitro. They are metabolized primarily by two peptidases acting on the N-terminal morphine motif. Enkephalinase-A splits the Gly-Phe bond, and enkephalinase-B breaks the Gly-Gly bond. Aminopeptidase N (APN), which splits the Tyr-Gly bond, also contributes to its catabolism. Recent studies have developed a mixed peptidase inhibitor, kelatorphan, that completely inhibits the metabolism of exogenous met-enkephalin thereby reducing the intracerebroventricular analgesic dose in mice.
