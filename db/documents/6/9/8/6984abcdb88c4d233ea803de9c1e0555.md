Panniculectomy is an elective procedure where medical problems must be well-controlled before considering the operation. Cigarette smoking affects blood supply and wound healing, and surgery should be avoided in active smokers and any patient with uncontrolled cardiac disease, lung disease, or diabetes. Any immunocompromised state is also a relative contraindication, owing to poorer wound healing.

Patients with morbid obesity who are postbariatric have more severe deformities, excess skin, laxity, and poor tone. These patients are at greater risk of complications with medical comorbidities, surgical scars, and nutritional deficiencies.
