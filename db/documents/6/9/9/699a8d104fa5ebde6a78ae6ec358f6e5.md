Though the pattern of a generalized convulsive seizure typically is one of abrupt onset, brief tonic posturing followed by synchronized clonic extremity movements, alteration of consciousness, and a postictal confusion phase, exceptions do occur, particularly in patients with partial-onset seizures starting in frontal or temporal areas. At times there are unusual motor patterns with partial-onset seizures or persistent confusional states with minor motor automatisms. If permissible by hospital policies, capturing events with video or smartphones may be useful for later analysis.
