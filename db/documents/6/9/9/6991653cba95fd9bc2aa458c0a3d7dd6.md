Lung biopsy is not typically performed. For coal workers, dust is found throughout the lungs but tends to collect around respiratory bronchioles. In and around these spots, the airspaces become dilated.

In silicosis, the histology characteristically demonstrates lightly pigmented nodules with smooth borders and aÂ central area of whorled, acellular fibrosis. Fibrotic lesions usually appear in the upper zones of the lungs. They are known as "onion skin lesions" due to their characteristic concentrically arranged fibers of collagen. The inside of the nodules contains dust-laden macrophages and lymphoid cells that result in hyalinization.

In asbestosis, asbestosis bodies or fibers appear on histology. The term ferruginous bodies is a more generalized term associated with the inhalation of other inorganic dust. Both asbestos and ferruginous bodies definitively demonstrate macrophage ingestion of the inorganic fiber with fibrotic reaction and deposition of ferrous materials. On biopsy, subpleural honeycombing and fibrosis are visible.
