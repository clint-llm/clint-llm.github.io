Nasal foreign bodies are commonly seen in the emergency department, mostly in the pediatric population but also in those with psychiatric illness or developmental disabilities. Nasal foreign bodies are usually benign but have the potential to cause mucosal damage, bleeding, infection, and aspiration. The nasal foreign body may be obvious or may require a high index of suspicion. Nasal foreign bodies often present acutely but can be missed and remain for weeks, months, or even years after insertion. This activity reviews the evaluation of suspected nasal foreign bodies and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the most common settings in which a nasal foreign body is likely to be identified.
- Discuss the morbidity and mortality associated with a nasal foreign body.
- Outline the management of a patient with a nasal foreign body.
- Summarize the interprofessional team's responsibility in considering and evaluating for a nasal foreign body.
