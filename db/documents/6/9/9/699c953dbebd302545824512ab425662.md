**Anatomic Boundaries:**

**Superior:**by the superior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm, a continuation of the inferior fascia of the pelvic diaphragm

**Inferior:**by the inferior fascia of urogenital diaphragm widely known as the perineal membrane

**Lateral:**by the lower part of the obturator fascia and the bony outlet of the pelvis [conjoint ischiopubic ramus]

**Contents of the deep perineal pouch in both sexes:**

A part of the urethra, sphincter urethrae, branches of internal pudendal artery branches and pudendal nerve branch that supplies the external genitalia

**Contents of the deep perineal pouch in males:**

- The muscular components sphincter urethrae and deep transverse perinei with perineal membrane together are known as the urogenital diaphragm. a detailed description of these structures is given in the muscles section below

- **Membranous urethra:**the part of the urethra passing through the deep perineal pouch is called membranous urethra and this is the narrowest and least distensible part of the urethra in males. It is approximately 1.5 cm in length and traverses through the perineal membrane 2 to 3 cm behind the pubic symphysis

- **Bulbourethral glands of Cowper**are present on either side of the membranous urethra and their ducts pierce the perineal membrane posterolateral to the urethra and finally open into the urethra to empty their secretions into the membranous urethra during sexual arousal prior to ejaculation. Thick clear mucous secretions of the gland neutralize the acidic urine in the urethra and act as a lubricant for the semen passage.

**Contents of the deep perineal pouch in females:**

- **Urethra:**in females, the urethra is approximately 4 cm in length, it passes through the perineal membrane and opens as the external urethral orifice in the vestibule above the vaginal opening

- **Vagina:**is situated behind the urethra. The perineal membrane in females is divided by urethra and vagina into two halves. At the hymenal ring level, the lateral walls of the vagina attach to the perineal membrane

- The muscle external urethral sphincter is detailed below in the muscles section, and the arteries and nerves are detailed in the corresponding sections
