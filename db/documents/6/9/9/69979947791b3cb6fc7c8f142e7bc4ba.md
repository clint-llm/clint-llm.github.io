Lymphoma of the central nervous system (CNS), both primary and secondary, represents a rare but highly aggressive subset of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

CNS lymphoma consists of 2 major subtypes:

- Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), and

- Secondary CNS involvement by systemic lymphoma.

PCNSL is a rare variant of extra-nodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), which involves the neuraxis including the orbit, brain, leptomeninges, and spinal cord.
