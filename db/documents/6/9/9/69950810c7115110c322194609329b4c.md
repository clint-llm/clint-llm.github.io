Any case of PPC presenting to the outpatient department should be thoroughly evaluated. These cases should be managed by a skilled cataract surgeon who is thorough with PPC management techniques. The nursing team has a significant role to play in preoperative counseling of the patient regarding the intraoperative complications and postoperative outcome. They also play a crucial role in obtaining consent from the patient or the next of kin.

A physician or an internist should evaluate PPC patients having systemic complaints to rule out any occult systemic pathologies. The pharmacist also plays an important role in drug chart preparation and procurement of drugs for the patient. Cases with intraoperative complications can be easily managed by the cataract surgeon himself, and cases requiring vitreoretinal intervention need expert inputs by the vitreoretinal team for lensectomy and pars plana vitrectomy. The prognosis is usually good in expert hands and has excellent long-term anatomical and functional outcomes.
