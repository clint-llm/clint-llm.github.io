The prognosis for these syndromes is variable. Syndromes such as ChAc, MLS, typical PKAN, and HDL2 are known to be chronic and progressive, often resulting in complications of dysarthria such as malnutrition and aspiration pneumoniaÂ with eventual death (see Table 8). In some cases, complicating symptoms such as seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, and status dystonicus may cause premature death. On the other hand, the mortality and progression of aceruloplasminemia, ABL, and HHBL are heavily influenced by appropriate management with chelating agents and fat-soluble vitamin supplementation (respectively) with patients enjoying a typical lifespan if managed appropriately.
