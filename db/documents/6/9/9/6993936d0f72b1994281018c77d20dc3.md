**Classification**

**Spurious Polycythemia**

This occurs due to volume contraction rather than an increase in true RBC mass.

**Causes include**

- Severe dehydration due to isolated fluid loss: potentially seen in diarrhea and severe vomiting

- Gaisbock syndrome: Usually seen amongst obese, hypertensive males. Smoking, excessive alcohol, and use of diuretics are contributory.

**True Polycythemia**

Further stratified based on serum erythropoietin (EPO) levelsÂ as follows:

**Low serum EPO levels (Primary polycythemia)**

- Polycythemia vera

- Primary familial and congenital polycythemia

**High serum EPO levels (Secondary polycythemia)**

- High altitude

- Respiratory disorders: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Pickwickian syndrome, uncontrolled asthma

- Cyanotic heart diseases with right-to-left shunts

- Renal disorders: Renal cysts, kidney cancer, renal artery stenosis, Bartter syndrome, focal sclerosing glomerulonephritis

- Elevated carboxyhemoglobin: Usually seen in smokers, people working on cars in closed spaces, or people working in boiler rooms

- Hemoglobinopathies: High-affinity hemoglobins such as Hb Yakima, methemoglobinemia

- EPO-secreting tumors: sources include hepatomas, uterine leiomyomas, and cerebellar hemangiomas

- Iatrogenic causes: Including erythropoietin analog administration, anabolic steroids, and testosterone replacement therapy

**Neonatal Polycythemia**

- The increase in hematocrit is a normal compensatory mechanism in infants due to the relative tissue-level hypoxia in the intrauterine environment. It is exacerbated by the high affinity of fetal hemoglobin for oxygen.
