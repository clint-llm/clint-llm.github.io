A diaphragmatic hernia (DH) is a protrusion of abdominal contents into the thoracic cavity due to a defect within the diaphragm. It is most common as a congenital phenomenon; however, it can also be acquired. Most commonly, acquired DH occurs following blunt or penetrating trauma, which results in a rupture of the diaphragm and herniation of abdominal content. Additionally, acquired DH can also occur spontaneously or by iatrogenic causes. Acquired DH is rare but can be life-threatening, resulting in intestinal incarceration and strangulation with an increased mortality rate. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of diaphragmatic hernia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the etiology of diaphragmatic hernias.
- Review the risk factors for developing a diaphragmatic hernia.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with a diaphragmatic hernia.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients presenting with diaphragmatic hernias.
