Basilar skull fractures, usually caused by substantial blunt force trauma, involve at least one of the bones that compose the base of the skull. Basilar skull fractures most commonly involve the temporal bones but may also involve the occipital, sphenoid, ethmoid, and orbital plate of the frontal bone. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of basilar skull fractures and underscores the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the pathophysiology and use the location of the trauma in predicting the associated injuries in basilar skull fractures.
- Identify the presence of clinical signs predictive of basilar skull fractures.
- Review the common complications of basilar skull fractures.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by basilar skull fractures.
