No specific cause of non-IgM MGUS has been identified. However, the disease may be associated with some non-malignant disorders such as connective tissue disorders, peripheral neuropathies, dermatological diseases such as acquired C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency (angioedema), endocrine diseases, and liver infections such as hepatitis C virus infection and HIV liver disease.
