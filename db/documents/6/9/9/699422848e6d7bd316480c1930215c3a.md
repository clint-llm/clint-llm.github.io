The most important differential diagnosis of Charcot is osteomyelitis as both can appear clinically and radiographically similar. Cellulitis, septic arthritis, gout, pseudogout, foot/ankle sprain or fracture, and deep vein thrombosis are also important differentials. Charcot is misdiagnosed 25% of the time which can cause a 7-month delay in the true diagnosis.
