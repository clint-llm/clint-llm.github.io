Acute porphyria is an absolute contraindication to the use of chloramphenicol.

Moreover, due to the potential risk of toxicity to neonates, chloramphenicol should also not be prescribed in neonates less than one week old, especially preterm infants. Currently, it is classed as a pregnancy category C drug and should be avoided in pregnancy or breastfeeding. However, there have been studies that show no associated teratogenicity with chloramphenicol use during the first trimester of pregnancy.
