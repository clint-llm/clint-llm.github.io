Formulating a differential diagnosis must include a history of the association between both partners. The onset of the condition usually precedes the onset of the shared delusion(s). The diagnosis of shared psychotic disorder should always be made only after ruling out any organic cause or substance-induced disorder.

- Schizophrenia/Schizoaffective: This can be differentiated by the secondary reporting symptoms that are not influenced by the primary, such as hallucinations, disorganized speech, or negative symptoms. In the case of schizoaffective, an affective component should be present.

- Mood Disorder with Psychotic features: This condition has a specific delusion that is mood-congruent and not shared but expressed independently.

If the delusions do not disappear when the partners are separated, it is important to reassess and consider an alternative diagnosis.
