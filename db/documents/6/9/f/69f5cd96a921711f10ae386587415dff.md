During the first six weeks of gestation, the vertebral column consists of a light zone and a dark zone. A hypocellular light zone represents the vertebral body, and a hypercellular dark zone represents the intervertebral disk.

On the other hand, no longitudinal cell arrangement is identifiable at the location of the posterior longitudinal ligament. At ten weeks, the dark zone decrease in width, and the origin of the posterior longitudinal ligament appears. It is unclear at the level of the vertebral body and but clear at the level of the disc.
