An interprofessional approach to fibroadenoma is recommended.

The majority of breast lesions in young women are identified on an incidental breast exam either by the patient or the healthcare provider. Even though fibroadenomas are benign lesions, sometimes there may be a need to confirm the histology. Healthcare workers including nurse practitioners should never assume that all firm, rubbery lesions are benign. If ever in doubt, get a radiologist or surgeon to perform a biopsy. Missing a malignant breast lesion in a young female can lead to poor outcomes.
