The management of patients undergoing vaginal delivery after a prior cesarean section is best done with an interprofessional team that includes labor and delivery nurses. An obstetrician should always be present and an operating room with anesthesia stand by must be ready in case a cesarean section is needed. While successful vaginal deliveries have occured following prior cesarean sections, there are ample reports of uterine rupture- hence clinical acumen in decision making is necessary to avoid litigation.
