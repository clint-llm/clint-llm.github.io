An interprofessional approach to anhidrosis is recommended. Anhidrosis and the underlying etiologies can cause severe emotional distress for patients. Quality of life may be low for patients of all ages secondary to societal scrutinization of their underlying condition (i.e., lamellar ichthyosis). Therefore, it is recommended to evaluate and arrange for mental health care in addition to the necessary medical care to address the underlying cause of the anhidrosis, if there is one. The outcome of patients with anhidrosis depends on the cause. There is no cure for those with inherited disorders, and it is a lifelong issue. The outcomes may improve for those with acquired anhidrosis by improving the primary condition or removing the offending medication. Most importantly, the patient should be actively involved in their care as the patient must maintain a cool environment and recognize the signs and symptoms of heat intolerance.
