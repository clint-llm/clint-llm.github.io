# Continuing Education Activity

Intraocular foreign body (IOFB) is an accidental injury usually resulting from chisel hammering and firearm use. It is a serious ocular condition that can potentially cause permanent vision loss. To avoid the high morbidity associated with this condition, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of an IOFB and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiology and review the risk factors for IOFB.
- Summarize the typical presentation of a patient with IOFB.
- Describe the common physical findings in patients with IOFB.
- Review the management considerations for patients with IOFB.

# Introduction

Ocular injuries are a major cause of blindness.

They can lodge in any part of the eye, either in the anterior or posterior segment. Since they are sharp and are generated at high speed, they mostly get lodged in the posterior segment. According to a study, about 2/3rd of IOFBs were found in the posterior segment.

# Etiology

Hammering is the most common mode of injury.

# Epidemiology

In the USA, the incidence of ocular injuries is 2.4 million cases.

Workers and farmers are the two most common occupations because they are involved in hammering, drilling, chiseling, and shoveling. These activities generate more foreign bodies. The annual incidence rate of IOFBs is approximately 0.16 per 100,000 in the United Kingdom.

# Pathophysiology

Ocular injury caused by an IOFB depends on its velocity, size, nature, entry site, and impaction.

Metallic foreign bodies are the most common type.

Ocular damage with iron foreign body results in siderosis bulbi. It is a pigmentary, degenerative process due to chronic retention of an iron IOFB.

The pupil may become fixed and dilated. The pupil may show denervation hypersensitivity.

An inflammatory reaction to a copper foreign body results in chalcosis.

Organic foreign bodies such as animal hairs, insect parts, thorn, and vegetable matter are contaminated and cause fulminant endophthalmitis.

# Histopathology

Long-term retention of copper and iron foreign body can cause chalcosis and siderosis, respectively.

# History and Physical

A detailed history is essential to know about the mechanism of injury and the nature of the foreign body. Trivial injuries are often difficult to detect. The patient presents with conjunctival congestion and blurring of vision or may be asymptomatic.

A meticulous examination is very important. Presenting and best-corrected visual acuity should be recorded. Lids and eyebrows should be examined to look for external signs of injuries and small foreign bodies. Slit-lamp examination is a must. Careful examination should be done to look for conjunctival laceration, hemorrhage, and entry site of IOFB. Pigment under the conjunctiva may indicate uveal prolapse and possible entry site. Corneal perforation should be examined.

The extent of the defect and its location should be recorded. A Seidel test should be performed. Iris should be inspected for transillumination defects and heterochromia (usually seen in longstanding cases). The entry wound of the cornea and iris may help in localizing the foreign body. The lens should be evaluated for pigmentation, focal opacity, cataractous changes, capsule rupture, and phacodonesis.

Gonioscopy is done to look for trabecular pigmentation, scarring, and foreign body, especially in the inferior angle of the anterior chamber. Intraocular pressure should be noted. However, in an obvious open globe injury, any undue pressure on the globe should be avoided as it may lead to extrusion of intraocular contents. Most foreign bodies are located in the posterior segment.

Dilated fundus examination is essential. The retina should be inspected to locate the site of impaction of the foreign body. Often a fibrous capsule forms over it, and there may be surrounding pigmentary changes. Optic atrophy may be present in longstanding cases. In cases of media haze due to cataracts, vitreous hemorrhage, or endophthalmitis, the USG (ultrasonogram) B scan is done to locate the foreign body and measure the size.

# Evaluation

Detection and localization of the IOFBs are essential. Anterior segment photography using a slit-lamp or fundus camera helps document the disease and may be helpful in counseling the patient about their clinical condition.

X-ray of orbits (anteroposterior and lateral view) can detect metallic foreign bodies but cannot detect radiolucent objects like wood or glass. It also reveals multiple metallic foreign bodies, if present. X-ray orbit with a limbal ring-rod sutured at the limbus and a proportionate geometric drawing can be used to localize an intraocular IOFB.

The patient's X-ray is taken with his eye at primary gaze. Then he is asked to look sideways, and again an X-ray is taken. If the foreign body is intraocular, it will rotate with eye movement. If it rotates in the same direction as the eye, then the IOFB is in the anterior segment. If it rotates in the opposite direction, then it is in the posterior segment.

USG B scan is a cheap and useful investigation to detect metallic foreign bodies. The metallic body appears as a hyperechoic structure with acoustic shadowing and a high spike on A-scan. Aluminum, steel, and bottle glass usually show a flashlight artifact, a focused and narrow ring-down artifact.

Ultrasound has varied detection rates for a glass IOFB ranging from 24 to 97%.

CT (computed tomography) scan can accurately detect the number, size, shape, and location of a foreign body.

MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) can detect organic and glass objects with greater sensitivity. MRI is contraindicated in the metallic foreign body as it can dislodge it and cause further damage.

Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) can detect a foreign body at the angle of the anterior chamber, behind the iris, and ciliary body. UBM uses a 50 MHz frequency and has a penetration of 5mm, which allows for finer resolution.

Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is a non-contact imaging modality and helps visualize the anterior segment IOFBs.

Patients with long-standing iron IOFB present with siderosis. The full-field electroretinogram (ERG) is done to know the status of the photoreceptors' function. In the early stages, increased amplitude of a-wave and b-wave is present (supernormal response).

Patients with chalcosis show reduced b-wave amplitude on ERG. A hyper-normal b-wave is not observed. Then a steady decrease is seen in the b wave amplitude. An abnormal ERG  precedes the clinical findings in almost 50% of patients.

Multifocal ERG may detect subclinical siderosis bulbi even if full-field ERG is normal.

# Treatment / Management

The goal of surgery is to prevent further damage and restore the ocular anatomy as far as possible. Functional restoration or visual gain is the secondary goal. The visual prognosis is usually guarded if retinal detachment or endophthalmitis is present. The IOFB should be localized on the CT scan, whether it is intraocular or extraocular or impacting the visual pathway or not.

The injured eye should be protected with a shield. During the examination, the eye should be gently handled. External pressure should be avoided as it may expel the intraocular contents. Tetanus toxoid (intramuscular) injection should be given. The contaminated part should be cleaned with a sterile solution, and small superficial foreign bodies should be removed in the absence of an open globe. Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics may be considered as prophylaxis against endophthalmitis. Endophthalmitis is a dreaded complication and is associated with 7 to 13% of IOFB cases.

The position of the IOFB should be preoperatively localized in the anterior or posterior segment. The first step is the primary repair of the ocular coats (cornea and/or sclera) of the open globe. Meticulous closure of the perforation site is done first.

**IOFB in the anterior chamber:**The IOFB might be located in the anterior chamber. The perforation site should be inspected. Its extent should be noted. Iris or uveal tissue prolapse is ascertained. The corneal perforation should be repaired with 10-0 monofilament nylon sutures. Scleral perforation is repaired with a 6-0 or 7-0 polyglactin 910 suture. The anterior chamber should be formed with viscoelastic solutions. Any exudates or hyphema in the anterior chamber should be washed first. Small and mobile IOFB can be removed with viscoexpression or an intraocular magnet. If it is immobile due to surrounding fibrosis, then the IOFB should be removed with forceps.

The IOFB should not be removed through the entry wound.

**Intralenticular foreign body:**IOFB might be impacted in the crystalline lens. The cataractous lens should be evaluated for the position of IOFB and posterior capsule tear.

**Foreign body in the anterior chamber angle:**A foreign body must be ruled out in the angle when not observed on initial examination. Gonioscopy should be done gently.

**Posterior segment IOFB:**Accurate localization is necessary preoperatively. CT scan accurately localizes it in the ocular coat, anterior segment, posterior segment, or extraocular location.

The site of impaction should be laser barraged. The retinal periphery should be inspected for additional breaks. If retinal detachment is present, a complete vitrectomy should be done, followed by fluid air exchange, endolaser photocoagulation, and silicone oil tamponade. If the retina is attached, then the retinal break should be laser barraged. The scleral ports are closed tightly.

# Differential Diagnosis

An IOFB is a clinical diagnosis. Sometimes trivial trauma is not reported by the patient. They present after a few years with signs of siderosis. This can resemble a retinal degenerative condition such as retinitis pigmentosa with pale disc and retinal pigmentary epithelial degeneration.

In chalcosis, the copper deposition will be seen near the limbus in the Descemet membrane, the Kayser-Fleischer ring similar to Wilson disease.

Sometimes, a fibrous tissue encasing an old retinal IOFB in the periphery can resemble a Toxocariasis granuloma. Ocular Toxocariasis is seen in young children with a history of close contact with a puppy.

# Prognosis

The prognosis of an IOFB depends upon multiple factors.

- Timing of presentation: Early presentation and management have a good visual outcome. Patients presenting late develop siderosis (in case of iron foreign body/bodies) and have a poor prognosis.

- Presenting visual acuity: If the presenting vision is good, then the final prognosis is generally good.

- The extent of injury: Small perforation of the sclera has a good prognosis.

- Location of the foreign body: Foreign body in the anterior segment has good visual outcome than the posterior segment IOFB.

- Type of injury: Globe rupture and perforating injuries have a bad prognosis.

- Associated features: The presence of an afferent pupillary defect, hyphema, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, or endophthalmitis has a bad visual outcome.

The prognosis of an IOFB can also be predicted with the help of an Ocular trauma score (OTS). It was proposed by Kuhn et al. in early 2000 to predict the final vision of an injured eye.

# Complications

Anterior segment injuries can cause corneal scarring, traumatic cataract, iris defect, hypopyon, hyphema, and open-angle glaucoma. IOFB in the posterior segment can cause endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, and phthisis bulbi.

The incidence of infectious endophthalmitis has been reported in 7 to 13% of IOFB cases.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

As an IOFB can cause permanent vision loss, preventive measures must be taken by the patients.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Interprofessional communication can lead to better patient management. The patient will most often present to the primary clinician, and these professionals should be aware of the condition as it is treatable.

Prompt referral to an ophthalmologist is necessary. These patients can then be followed by their primary clinicians, and they should ensure compliance with treatment. The nursing staff will be the first in the department to come in contact with patients on follow-up. They can assess treatment progress, evaluate compliance with medication and lifestyle measures, and report any issues to the primary care clinician. This collaborative, interprofessional approach to care can ensure optimal patient outcomes.
