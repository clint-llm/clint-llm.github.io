The mainstay of cobalt toxicity treatment is supportive. Patients presenting acutely will require aggressive decontamination and treatment. There are no specific studies on gastrointestinal (GI) decontamination in cobalt toxicity. Likely, typical decontamination methods, such as whole bowel irrigation, used in other metal toxicities are applicable for cobalt, mainly if there are radioopaque bodies on radiography. Gastric lavage may be beneficial if the ingested cobalt is a liquid. It is less likely to be beneficial if the ingested material is solid. Antiemetics should be utilized for nausea and vomiting.

Chelation therapy is not well studied in humans, with the majority of data comprising animal studies and case reports. Current evidence suggests that calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (CaNa2EDTA) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) are likely reasonable choices for chelation. Although NAC is not a typical choice for chelation, the thiol group on the molecule serves as a binding site for cobalt.

Chelation likely has little role in treatment until the cobalt source is removed, including the removal of arthroplasty.

Prevention is the primary method for occupational exposure. Systems-based interventions, such as improved ventilator systems, have significantly decreased toxicity associated with exposures.
