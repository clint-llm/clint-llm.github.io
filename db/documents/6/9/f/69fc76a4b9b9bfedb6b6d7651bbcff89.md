Ibutilide is available as a solution administered intravenously (1 mg/10 mL).

- For patients weighing less than 60 kg, the dose is 0.01 mg/kg over 10 minutes; the dose may be repeated after 10 minutes if there is no response.

- For patients weighing more than 60 kg, the dose is 1 mg over 10 minutes; the dose may be repeated after 10 minutes if there is no response.

Drug administration may be diluted or undiluted. Discontinue infusion upon resolution of presenting arrhythmia or new-onset ventricular tachycardia. If the arrhythmia does not abate within 10 minutes post-infusion, another dose may be given over 10 minutes. The drug's half-life is around 6 hours, ranging between 2 and 12 hours.

**Renal or Hepatic Impairment:**Dosing for renal or hepatic impairment dosing does not need to be adjusted.

**Geriatrics:**Start at the lower end of the dosing range.

**Pediatrics:**There are no approved indications for this drug in pediatric use; safety and efficacy are not established.

**Addition of Magnesium Sulfate:**Magnesium has been shown to enhance the ability of ibutilide to convert atrial flutter or fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm. Magnesium can also help prevent prolongation of the QT interval, and it sees frequent use in the treatment of torsades de pointes in hemodynamically stable patients.

**Class 1C Antiarrhythmics:**Ibutilide can be given safely with Class 1C antiarrhythmics since class 1C antiarrhythmics do not affect the QT interval.

**Amiodarone:**The risk of arrhythmia does not increase when clinicians give patients ibutilide with amiodarone.

**Pharmacokinetics:**Conversion to sinus rhythm occurs in less than 90 minutes after the start of infusion. Ibutilide has a half-life of 2 to 12 hours, with an average half-life of 6 hours. It is metabolized extensively by the liver into eight metabolites (1 active). The volume of distribution is approximately 11 L/kg. The majority of the drug is excreted via the urine as inactive metabolites.
