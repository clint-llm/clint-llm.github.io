Prognosis and survival rates depend on the staging of cancer at diagnosis, adequate and prompt treatment, and local expertise to deliver this. 5-year survival rates drop significantly in those whose disease has locally spread and even further if there are distant metastases, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis. The American Cancer Society estimates survival rates of oral and oropharyngeal cancers together. They state that for those with local disease, 5-year survival is around 84%. This drops to 66% and 39% with regional and distant spread of disease respectively. It has been shown that HPV positive disease results in higher survival rates â€“ given many statistics are grouped with oropharyngeal cancer, with a higher incidence of HPV positive cancers, drawing conclusions on survival for oral cavity cancer alone can be difficult. Tumor recurrence is common with oral squamous cell carcinoma, either at the primary site, in the lymph nodes, or as distant metastases in the lungs, liver, or bone.
