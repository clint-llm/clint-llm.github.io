Because the etiology of unconsciousness is often initially unclear, initial treatment paradigms occur before full evaluation or diagnostics. Principles of initial management of unconscious patients:

- Ensure oxygenation

- Maintain circulation

- Control glucose

- Lower intracranial pressure

- Stop seizures

- Treat infection

- Restore acid-base balance and electrolyte balance

- Adjust body temperature

- Administer thiamine

- Consider specific antidotes (naloxone, flumazenil)

- Control agitation

If the above goals are completed, management can then be tailored based on the results of diagnostic testing. Patients who are persistently comatose despite initial interventions often require a high level of care, such as an intensive care unit.
