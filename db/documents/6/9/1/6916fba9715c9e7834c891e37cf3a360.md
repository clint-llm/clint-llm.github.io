Histologic findings are similar for all dermatophyte infections. A skin biopsy will demonstrate epidermal spongiosis, parakeratosis, and a superficial inflammatory infiltrate. Clusters of neutrophils in the stratum corneum are considered an important clue for the diagnosis. Nonpigmented, regular, septated hyphae might be seen in the stratum corneum, but this is best identified with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) or Gomori methamine silver (GMS) stains.
