Poisonings associated with PTX-contaminated soft corals are mostly through inhalation or dermal absorption. However, the ingestion of corals or surrounding seawater is a less probable, but not impossible event.

The exact in vivo mechanism of the toxicity of PTX is not clearly established. PTX is known to be a potent vasoconstrictor. It's neurotoxic, cardiotoxic, and metabolic effects are mainly due to dysregulation of Na/K ATPase, a transmembrane pump. PTX locks into the pump in α-β ATPase heterodimer leading of sequence of conformational changes and thereby allows passive transport of both ions(sodium and potassium), which in turn destroys the ion gradient which is the very essence of cellular homeostasis. Therefore, PTX can affect any cell line depending upon the mode of exposure.
