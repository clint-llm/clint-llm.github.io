Barosinusitis is an uncommon entity that is rarely described within the otolaryngology literature. It is generally affiliated with pilots and scuba divers due to large changes in ambient pressure. This disease causes significant pain and mucosal damage to the sinus cavities. This activity reviews the current literature for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of the varying types of barosinusitis. The pathophysiology of barosinusitis, its presentation, and the role of the interprofessional team in its management will also be discussed in this paper.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of barosinusitis.
- Summarize the presentation of barosinusitis.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for barosinusitis.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of barosinusitis and improve outcomes.
