Cardiac catheterization is performed for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Despite significant advancement in non-invasive cardiac imaging, it remains the standard for the measurement of cardiac hemodynamics. This activity reviews the technique of cardiac catheterization, its indications, contraindications, and complications. It also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the pre-cardiac catheterization workup.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for cardiac catheterization.
- Review the complications of cardiac catheterization.
- Summarize the contraindications for cardiac catheterization.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients undergoing cardiac catheterization.
