Healthcare practitioners should be cautious in the diagnosis and treatment of PACs. Furthermore, incidental findings should not automatically warrant extended and invasive procedures when the patient is otherwise asymptomatic. When encountered, the provider should discuss treatment options with specific emphasis on the risks versus benefits. Consultations should be considered when appropriate situations are encountered. An interprofessional approach is essential in the evaluation of prognosis and management options.
