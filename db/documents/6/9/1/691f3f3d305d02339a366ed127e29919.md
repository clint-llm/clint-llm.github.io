A melanoacanthoma is a benign skin lesion. However, its clinical morphology mimics not only other benign epithelial tumors such as a seborrheic keratosis but also malignant neoplasms such as melanoma. Therefore, it is essential that older individuals, particularly those 60 years of age and older -who either discover a new black skin lesion or witness a pigmented cutaneous lesion that may have been present for several years but have continued to enlarge to seek additional evaluation.

Non-invasive methods of examination--including clinical inspection, dermoscopy, and reflectance confocal microscopyâ€”can be performed. However, it is difficult to establish the diagnosis of melanoacanthoma using these modalities since features of melanoma can be observed with each of these methods of investigation. Therefore, when the possibility of a melanoacanthoma is considered, an appropriate biopsy of the lesion should be performed to confirm the diagnosis and to exclude other conditions.
