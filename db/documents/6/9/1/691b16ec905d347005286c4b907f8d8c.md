Historically, wide en bloc excision was performed to treat osteoid osteomas.  However, excessive removal of normal surrounding bone resulted in weak bone and prolonged periods of immobilization.  With the advent of newer technology and options for surgical excision, the postoperative course has changed significantly.  With percutaneous techniques such as radiofrequency ablation, there is minimal damage to the surrounding unaffected tissue which allows immediate weight bearing and the return to daily activities.
