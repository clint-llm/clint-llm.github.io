Frequently IgA nephropathy patients have a benign course.

About 20% of patients will progress to ESRD within ten years. Currently, the MEST-C score is often used to predict the outcome. The score includes the following features:

- M: Mesangial cellularity, defined as greater than 4 mesangial cells in any mesangial segment of the glomerulus

- E: Endocapillary proliferation is the degree of hypercellularity

- S: Segmental glomerulosclerosis is defined as sclerosis or adhesions in the glomerular tuft

- T: Tubular atrophy or interstitial fibrosis

- C: Presence or absence of crescents

In general, if any of the above features are seen, then the prognosis is poor. Other factors that determine outcomes include elevated creatinine, hypertension, need for antihypertensive treatment, proteinuria, decreased eGFR at diagnosis, significant interstitial fibrosis, and CD4 staining.
