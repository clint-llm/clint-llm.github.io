Evaluation of a discoid meniscus is prompted by pain or mechanical symptoms, although this can also be an incidental finding on X-ray or MRI in the setting of acute trauma.

Plain radiographs may be normal; however, there are well-documented radiologic features present in patients with a discoid meniscus.

Findings on MRI of discoid meniscus include the “bow-tie sign,” which is three or more 5 mm sagittal images showing meniscal continuity, an abnormally thick or flattened meniscus on the sagittal cut, and thick/flat meniscal tissue that extends over the entirety of the involved compartment on coronal views.
