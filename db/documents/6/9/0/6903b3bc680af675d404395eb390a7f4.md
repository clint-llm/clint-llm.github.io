The destruction of tissue via radiofrequency must occur after successful diagnostic anesthetic nerve blocks have located the target nerve. During the procedure, the patient should receive little to no sedation, as they must define what they are experiencing during stimulation and lesioning of the nerve.

- The patient is placed in a comfortable positionÂ with adequate exposure of the region overlying the target nerve. The skin is cleaned and prepped, and the target is found using fluoroscopy. A small amount of local anesthetic is injected subcutaneously at the point of needle insertion.

- The introducer needle is then inserted through the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle toward the target using fluoroscopy to guide the trajectory.

- Once the tip of the needle is placed satisfactorily close to the target, the active electrode is inserted through the needle.

- Sensory stimulation is used at first to recreate the painful symptoms that the patient experiences, thus locating the target.

- This is followed by motor stimulation to ensure that the active tip is not close to the motor nerves.

- Once confirmed, the generator produces a continuous output of voltage at the tip of the electrode. It will be kept at 80 degrees Celsius for approximately one minute, creating a zone of thermally induced coagulation.
