Clinical practice guidelines developed by the American College of Chest Physicians recommend educating and involving patients on INR testing, follow up, and result and dosing decisions that increase clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness. Also, intensive patient education (educating the patients beyond the usual VKAs information by distributing a pamphlet or by the primary care provider) has been proposed to reduce adverse events related to anticoagulation. However, no clinical trial has been conducted to date.
