There is a black-box warning for dementia-related psychosis because it may increase the risk of death secondary to cerebrovascular events in the elderly. Thioridazine is associated with a prolonged QT interval. Thus patients with long QT syndrome, QT intervals prolonged to more than 450, or taking concomitant medications known to prolong the QT interval should avoid thioridazine. Also, patients with known heart arrhythmias or hypotensive or hypertensive heart disease should also avoid this medication.

Because of drug-drug interactions, the clinician should be aware of the patient's medication profile. Thioridazine is metabolized by the hepatic enzyme CYP450 2D6. Medications that inhibit CYP450 2D6 should be used with caution when prescribing thioridazine. Medications that may affect thioridazine levels include but are not limited to fluoxetine, paroxetine, duloxetine, fluvoxamine, propranolol, citalopram, and pindolol.

Another rare but serious side effect of thioridazine is agranulocytosis. Each patient should be evaluated for abnormal white blood cell counts pre and post-administration of thioridazine.

Caution is advised in pregnant patients during the third trimester, although teratogenicity is not expected. For breastfeeding, it is recommended to use an alternative agent as there is no data in humans to assess the risk in breast milk.
