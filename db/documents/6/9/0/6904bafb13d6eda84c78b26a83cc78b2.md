Parinaud syndrome is also known as sylvian aqueduct syndrome, dorsal midbrain syndrome, pretectal syndrome, and Koerber-Salus-Elschnig syndrome. Parinaud syndrome is classically described by the triad of impaired upward gaze, convergence retraction nystagmus, and pupillary hyporeflexia. This condition has multiple potential etiologies. Patients may complain of difficulty looking up, blurred near vision, diplopia, oscillopsia, and associated neurological symptoms. Diplopia is present in 65 percent of patients. Treatment is primarily directed at treating the underlying cause before irreversible damage occurs. This activity describes the etiology, evaluation, and management of Parinaud syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of Parinaud syndrome.
- Describe the characteristic presentation of Parinaud syndrome.
- Describe the treatment of Parinaud syndrome.
- Parinaud syndrome is best managed by an interprofessional team including neurology and ophthalmology. The key is to make the diagnosis of the primary disorder and manage it. However, some patients with chronic symptoms may need eyelid surgery.
