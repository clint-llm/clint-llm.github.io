The underlying pathology is at the microvascular level due to the increase in pulmonary vascular pressure. In addition to this, the capillaries also become leaky, causing the formation of edema. The imbalance between the hydrostatic and oncotic forces and the enhanced permeability of the pulmonary capillaries resultsÂ in pulmonary edema.
