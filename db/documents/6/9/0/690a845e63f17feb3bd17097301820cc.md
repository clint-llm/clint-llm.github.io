Working with schools and local resources to ensure that the necessary services are available is crucial. It is also essential to explain to parents the importance of obtaining early intervention and following through with treatment. Educate parents and guardians that with early intervention, their child may close the reading gap between them and their peers.

High achieving and high IQ students may be overlooked early in their educational careers. They can still have dyslexia but compensate in other ways and miss their window for early intervention. This can have a drastic effect on their outlook towards schooling as reading becomes more complicated and have a lasting impact on their ability to learn.

If the family is not satisfied or the clinician is still worried by the outcomes of the intervention provided by the school, referrals may be necessary. Patients may benefit from seeing developmental and behavioral pediatricians, child neurologists, psychologists, and or neuropsychologists. It is important to note that the patientâ€™s insurance may not cover these specialists.
