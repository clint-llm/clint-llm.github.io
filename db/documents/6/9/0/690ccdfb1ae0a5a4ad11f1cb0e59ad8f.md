Light microscopy of Gram-negative or methylene blue-stained smears of N. gonorrhoeae urethral or cervical mucus samples will demonstrate neutrophils with intracellular diplococci. Light microscopy has high sensitivity and specificity for symptomatic males with urethral discharge; however, light microscopy has a lower sensitivity for diagnosing cervical, pharyngeal, and rectal gonorrhea.
