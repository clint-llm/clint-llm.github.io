The bedrock of healthcare simulation is immersive experiential learning for educational engagement. Translational simulation focuses specifically on delivering appropriate simulation-based interventions, regardless of location, modality, or content. The simulation training of the program director provides a framework to meet this purpose. The interventional/curricular design process begins with a needs assessment and determination of the goals and objectives of the simulated experience. The appropriate simulation method is chosen based on functional task alignment of the goals and objectives to the simulation modality, scope, and environmental options available. If multiple environmental options exist (in situ versus simulation lab), the decision is determined by the location in which team composition and the improvement target are best aligned. The simulation leader then matches improvement objectives to the physical, emotional, and conceptual fidelity needed to maximize experiential learning for the participants. By utilizing this approach in creating functional realism as the platform to optimize engagement, the simulation director can best assess and address the knowledge, skills, and attitudes targeted to promote performance improvement.
