There are not any absolute contraindications to stoma formation. However, carcinomatosis, as well as the short mesentery, are some relative contraindications to stoma creation. Inadequate length of mesentery disables the free-tension exteriorization of the intestine through the abdominal wall. Tension on the stoma, which is more common in obese patients, is an independent risk factor for developing a stoma complication.
