The ideal radiotracer for lymphoscintigraphy would be one that demonstrates rapid uptake into the lymph nodes with prolonged retention. The most commonly used radiotracer currently is technetium 99 sulfur colloid. A scintillation gamma camera is also needed to acquire the images produced by the radiation the radiotracer emits, and a dedicated computerized workstation is used to calculate and produce the images.
