Management of galactocele is usually conservative. A galactocele is a sterile collection that resolves spontaneously on cessation of lactation after the hormonal change associated with pregnancy and lactation is ceased.

**Lactating women**- Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration is both diagnostic and therapeutic in most cases.

**Post-augmentation galactocele -**In cases of post-augmentation chronic galactorrhea causing galactocele, dopamine agonists such as Bromocriptine should also be prescribed to inhibit milk secretion as diminishing dopamine output is one of the proposed mechanisms of galactorrhea.

**Prolactinoma**- Most prolactinomas are treated with medical therapy only. Surgery and radiotherapy are recommended for refractory cases. Cabergoline and Bromocriptine are commonly preferred.

**Role of surgery**- Cyst resolution following aspiration can be a pathognomonic sign of a galactocele. However, an excisional biopsy is recommended as the definitive treatment of the chronically obstructed duct, if it is rapidly enlarging, if there is discordance in the triple assessment, or if the mass reoccurs after complete aspiration. All these are hallmarks of a galactocele caused due to breast malignancy, and hence cytology or histopathology is warranted.
