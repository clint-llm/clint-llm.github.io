Foreign bodies that are visible externally on patient arrival, and suspected to be related to a penetrating cardiac injury, should be left in place temporarily to allow for set-up for operative evaluation and care.  Otherwise, retained foreign bodies should be removed operatively if there is contamination or electrical abnormalities.

Emergency department thoracotomy is controversial due to survival rates ranging from around 1-30% depending on the patient population.  Despite low survival rates, as the alternative is guaranteed death, it is still performed in select situations. Individuals with blunt trauma and loss of vital signs are less likely to survive.  An emergency thoracotomy should be considered for blunt trauma victims with the loss of pulses less than 5-10 minutes (depending on the literature followed), though there have been reports of survivors with up to 15 minutes of loss of pulses.  An emergent thoracotomy should be considered for penetrating trauma victims with the loss of pulses less than 15 minutes, though survivors have again been documented with up to 32 minutes of CPR.
