HBSE provides a framework to understand both individuals and the environment in which they live. This facilitates a more comprehensive understanding of the individual presenting for treatment. This can be particularly important in understanding barriers to adherence, personality structures, interactional styles, irregular follow-ups and no-shows, and other such clinically-pertinent behaviors. In this way, HBSE provides a method to broaden the clinician's view of the patient's life and the challenges and limitations that exist for the patient. Through this understanding, one can garner an appreciation for these barriers, which can subsequently facilitate an ability to address some of the barriers that exist. This is particularly relevant when understanding social determinants of health. Social determinants of health are considered vital contributors to adherence, response to treatment, and follow-up.

This concept called "Person-in-Environment" is closely related to the HBSE framework and is often considered a foundational aspect of the practice of social work. "Person-in-Environment" considers both the individual and the multiple environments with which and within which the individual interacts. "Person-in-Environment" also considers that both the individual and environment share a reciprocal relationship.
