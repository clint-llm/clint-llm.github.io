Horseshoe kidneys are the most common fusion defect of the kidneys occurring in approximately 1:500 individuals. They are characterized by abnormalities in the position, rotation, and vascular supply of the kidney. Although largely benign, they are associated with urological sequelae due largely to the associated ureteric obstruction and impaired urinary drainage. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and treatment of horseshoe kidney and highlights the roles of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the etiology of horseshoe kidneys.
- Describe the imaging modalities that can be used to evaluate for horseshoe kidneys. 
- Review potential sequelae of horseshoe kidneys.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration amongst healthcare professionals who care for patients with horseshoe kidneys.
