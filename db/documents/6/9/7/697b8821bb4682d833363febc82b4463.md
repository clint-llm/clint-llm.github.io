Thoracic segmental spinal anesthesia is a technique of regional anesthesia that can potentially be a suitable alternative to general anesthesia for certain cases such as laparoscopic surgeries, particularly in patients who are considered at high risk while under general anesthesia. Although not routinely used, the procedure has been shown as beneficial in maintaining hemodynamic stability for these patients and reducing side effects encountered with general anesthesia. This activity describes the procedure of thoracic segmental spinal anesthesia and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients who have undergone this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the type of patient that would be considered for undergoing thoracic segmental spinal anesthesia.
- Describe the anatomy of the thoracic spine and the physiological process occurring when thoracic segmental spinal anesthesia is performed.
- Review the most common complications associated with thoracic segmental spinal anesthesia.
- Explain the importance of monitoring patients for adverse effects intraoperatively and postoperatively by the interprofessional team.
