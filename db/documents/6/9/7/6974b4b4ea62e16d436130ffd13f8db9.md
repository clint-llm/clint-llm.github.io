The etiology of olecranon bursitis is usually secondary to trauma, underlying inflammatory conditions or infection. Trauma can lead to bleeding within the bursa and the release of inflammatory mediators that predispose it to recurrence. It can also be associated with inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and gout, or chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, alcoholism or HIV. Due to the poor vascularity, infection is thought to be via a transcutaneous route, rather than hematogenous spread. Infection is usually secondary to direct inoculation via mild trauma and therefore most commonly includes the typical skin flora.
