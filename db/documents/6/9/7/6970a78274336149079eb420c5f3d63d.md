Alkali toxicity, though rare, can lead to serious medical problems. Adult caustic ingestions are usually intentional, involving more substantial amounts, and may result in significant medical sequelae. This activity describes the evaluation and management of alkali ingestions and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patient post alkali ingestions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of alkali ingestion medical conditions and emergencies.
- Describe the history and physical findings expected during an examination for alkali toxicity secondary to ingestion.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for alkali toxicity secondary to ingestion.
- Explain some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance alkali toxicity management and improve outcomes.
