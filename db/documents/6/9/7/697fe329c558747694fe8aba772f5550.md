Although there are different ways to measure the activity of HER2 oncogene activity, the best method is still controversial.

The assays used clinically are:

- HER2 gene amplification: via in situ hybridization (ISH), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH), polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

- HER2 Overexpression: Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELIZA), immunohistochemistry (IHC).

All patients who tested positive for HER2 should receive HER2 directed therapy. The only test results predicted to benefit from anti-HER2 therapy are IHC 3+ score or FISH ratio greater than or equal to 2.

ASCO/CAP recept updates suggest repeat testing if:

- The initial test was HER2-positive in a histologic grade 1 carcinoma of infiltrating ductal or lobular carcinoma, hormone receptor-positive.

- The presence of any of the following histologies, all of which at least 90 percent pure: mucinous, cribriform, tubular, or adenoid cystic

Recent 2018 ASCO/CAP guidelines compared with the 2013 guideline when using a dual-probe ISH assay, specifically the following:

- If the HER2/CEP17 ratio is greater than or equal to 2.0 and an average HER2 copy number is less than 4.0 signals/cell.

- If the HER2/CEP17 ratio is less than 2 and an average HER2 copy number is equal to or greater than 6.0 signals/cell.

- If the HER2/CEP17 ratio is less than 2 and an average HER2 copy number between greater than or equal 4.0 and less than 6.0 signals/cell

All these situations are considered HER2-positive disease as per 2013 guidelines. Currently, further workup is necessary.
