Urinary tract infections are caused by bacterial invasion of the urothelium of the bladder, bacteria migrating from the rectum, and colonization of bacteria from the perineum and vagina. Age is an important factor as estrogen diminishes withÂ age, and pH increases, thus promoting colonization of the vagina and perineum with gram-negative enteric organisms such as E. coli.
