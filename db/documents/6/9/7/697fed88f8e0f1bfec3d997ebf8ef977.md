Commissural myelotomy is a surgical procedure in which an incision is made in the anterior white commissure to interrupt the spinothalamic tract. This procedure aims to interrupt the pain transmission from the spinothalamic tract and leads to bilateral loss of pain. In a study of 11 patients, it was documented to significantly improve pain in 8 patients with oncogenic pain in the abdominal and pelvic regions
