- Cancers in the mediastinum can develop from structures that are anatomically located inside the mediastinum or that transverse through the mediastinum during development, and also from metastases or malignancies that originate elsewhere in the body.

- Mediastinal cancers are usually rare. Typically, they are diagnosed in patients aged 30 to 50 years but can develop at any age from any tissue located or passes through the mediastinum.

- Children usually present with cancers in the posterior mediastinum, while adults usually present with cancers in the anterior mediastinum.

- There is a similar incidence in men and women, but it can vary with the type of cancer present.
