The diagnosis of herpetic gingivostomatitis is usually clinical, based on the patientâ€™s history and physical examination. The appearance of the oral vesicular and ulcerative lesions is sufficient for the diagnosis. However, if additional testing is required, herpetic gingivostomatitis can be confirmed using a direct immunofluorescent examination of ulcer scrapings or blister fluid. Another test that can be used but is not entirely reliable for diagnosis is the Tzanck smear, which shows the cytologic changes induced by the herpes virus. The Tzanck smear will confirm the presence of a virus in the active lesions but fails to distinguish between HSV-1, HSV-2, and varicella-zoster virus.
