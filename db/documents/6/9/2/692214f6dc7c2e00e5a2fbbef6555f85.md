Postnatal infection with rubella is generally mild, self-limited, and has an excellent prognosis. However, the prognosis of children with congenital rubella syndrome is less favorable and varies depending on the severity and number of organs affected. The risk of mortality risk is high in infants with thrombocytopenia, interstitial pneumonia, hepatosplenomegaly, and pulmonary hypertension.
