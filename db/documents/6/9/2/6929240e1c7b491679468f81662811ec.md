Splenic infarction is a rare cause of abdominal pain. Diagnosis is often suspected based on the presence of underlying disease states most likely to cause splenic infarction. A study published in 2010 set out to better characterize the modern experience of splenic infarction. This study performed chart reviews of 26 patients admitted to the hospital with diagnosis of splenic infarction. Their observations were as follows:

- Mean age 52 years old

- 50% complained of localized left sided abdominal pain

- 36% had left sided abdominal tenderness

- 32% splenomegaly

- 31% had no signs or symptoms localized to the spleen area

- 36% had fever temperature >38 C

- 56% had WBC >12,000

- 71% had elevated LDH level

- 32% had nausea and or vomiting

Interestingly, authors noted that in 21 of 26 patients, the diagnosis of splenic infarct led to the diagnosis of a previously unrecognized underlying illness.
