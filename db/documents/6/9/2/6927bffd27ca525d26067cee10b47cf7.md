VT can be caused by coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathy. It can also be induced by a blow to the chest (commotio cordis).

SVT is usually caused by the repetitive “re-entry“ of the electrical impulse proximally, instead of propagating distally through the cardiac conduction system, due to blockages in the heart’s electrical conduction system. It can also be seen as the result of premature atrial or ventricular beats, cardiac stimulants, thyroid conditions, valvular and coronary artery disease, and as the result of digoxin toxicity.
