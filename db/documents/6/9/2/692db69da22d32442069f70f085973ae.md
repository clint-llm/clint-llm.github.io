The severity of HAPE will depend on multiple factors including altitude, initial recognition and management, and access to medical care. At 4500 meters the incidence is 0.6% to 6%, and at 5500 meters the incidence is 2% to 15%, with faster ascent time correlating to a higher incidence. Those with a prior incidence of HAPE have a recurrence rate as high as a 60%. One’s level of fitness is not proven to be a protective factor. Mortality rate, when treated, can be as high as 11% and as high as 50% when untreated. Up to 50% of cases may have concomitant acute mountain sickness (AMS), and up to 14% will have concomitant high altitude cerebral edema (HACE).
