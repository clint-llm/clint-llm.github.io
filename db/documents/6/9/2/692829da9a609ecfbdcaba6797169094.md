Toxic exposures to carbamates can occur via dermal, inhalational, and gastrointestinal (GI) exposures. The World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Pesticides identifies five groups based on rat oral LD50 data. Symptom severity depends on the classification of the pesticide as well as the exposure dose.

Carbamate poisoning cases are most often related to intentional oral ingestion or dermal occupational exposure. In the developing world, cases of large outbreaks from contaminated food and crops have been reported. Based on the pharmacokinetics of various carbamates encountered, rapid symptom onset secondary to dermal exposure is possible. Exposure can result from combined dermal and inhalational exposures after working in areas recently sprayed or fogged with insecticides. Pediatric cases caused by playing on a sporting field after insecticide spraying have been reported.
