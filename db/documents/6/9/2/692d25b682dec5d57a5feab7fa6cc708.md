Indications for olfactory testing include:

- Olfactory assessment is indicated when the patient reports on olfactory alterations.

- When the patient reports on impairment of taste and flavor but an impairment of olfaction is suspected, olfactory testing in addition to their gustatory abilities is indicated.

- Multicomponent olfactory testing may give additional information about the etiology of the olfactory decline.

- Olfactory assessment is indicated when an olfactory decline is suspected, but the patient does not perceive deficits with olfaction.
