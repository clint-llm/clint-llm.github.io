Whenever aflatoxin toxicity is suspected, a thorough history regarding the patient's dietary habits, similar complaints in family and community, the patient's occupation, and environmental exposure should be assessed. Health implications from aflatoxin toxicity depend on several factors ranging from the dose and duration of exposure to a person's gender, age, health, immunity, environmental factors, and diet. Patients with aflatoxin toxicity can have a range of non-specific signs and symptoms; however, the most prominent features are those of hepatotoxicity. Adults generally have a good tolerance to aflatoxin, and children have higher mortality. Children tend to have severe malnutrition secondary to aflatoxin toxicity.

Acute toxicity results when someone consumes a high level of aflatoxins in a very short time. The most common signs and symptoms are:

- Nausea

- Yellowing of skin and sclera (icterus)

- Itching

- Vomiting

- Bleeding

- Abdominal pain

- Lethargy

- Edema

- Convulsions

- Coma

- Death

Chronic toxicity occurs through consuming small amounts of aflatoxins over a prolonged period. Chronic exposure to aflatoxin can result in the following:

- Impaired growth and development, especially in children

- Immunosuppression

- Hepatocellular carcinoma (weight loss, abdominal mass, anorexia, vomiting, nausea, bleeding, psychosis, etc.)

Maternal exposure to aflatoxin is associated with a higher occurrence of preterm birth and late-term miscarriage.
