The composition of environmental air is approximately 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 1% argon, and trace percentages of other gases, such as carbon dioxide, neon, methane, helium, krypton, hydrogen, xenon, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, iodine, carbon monoxide, and ammonia. Therefore, at sea level, where atmospheric pressure is 760 mmHg, the partial pressures of the various gases can be estimated to have partial pressures of approximately 593 mmHg for nitrogen, 160 mmHg for oxygen, and 7.6 mmHg for argon.

However, these partial pressures are not accurate reflections of the partial pressures available for diffusion within the alveoli of the lung. When air is inhaled through the upper airways, it is warmed and humidified by the pulmonary tract. This process introduces water vapors that adjust the partial pressures of all gases, including oxygen. Therefore, partial pressure of oxygen within the upper airway is taken as inspired PO (PiO). The pressure of water vapor is static at 47 mmHg at body temperature and significantly depends on temperature.

It is not possible to collect gases directly from the alveoli. However, the alveolar gas equation is of great help in calculating and closely estimating the partial pressure of oxygen inside the alveoli. The alveolar gas equation is used to calculate alveolar oxygen partial pressure:

- PAO2 = (Patm - PH2O) FiO2 - PACO2 / RQ

While PAO2 is the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli, Patm is the atmospheric pressure at sea level equaling 760 mm Hg. PH2O is the partial pressure of water equal to approximately 45 mmHg. FiO2 is the fraction of inspired oxygen. PCO2 is the carbon dioxide partial pressure in arteries, which in normal physiological conditions is about 40 to 45 mmHg, and the RQ (respiratory quotient). FiO2 is directly related to the percent composition of oxygen in the inspired air. Without support at sea level, this is 21% or 0.21. However, each liter of supplemental oxygen in the inspired air increases this value by approximately 4% or 0.04. Therefore 2 liters of supplemented oxygen increase the FiO2 at sea level by 8% or 0.08 to 29% or 0.29. The value of RQ can vary depending on the type of diet and metabolic state of the person. A standard value of 0.82 for the typical human diet. At sea level without supplemented inspired oxygenation, the alveolar oxygen partial pressure (PAO2) is:

- PAO2 = (760 - 47) 0.21 - 40 / 0.8 = 99.7 mm Hg

This alveolar partial pressure of oxygen is the driving force for the diffusion of oxygen across the alveolar membranes, through pulmonary capillary walls, and into the arteriolar blood flow and erythrocytes for transport throughout the body into peripheral tissues. The diffusion gradient from alveolar space into the capillary is quantified via the A-a gradient calculated as:

- A-a oxygen gradient = PAO2 - PaO2

PaO2 is measured using arterial blood gas, and PAO2 is calculated as above. A larger gradient indicates an underlying pathology hindering the transfer of oxygen into the capillary, which impacts the available partial pressure of oxygen throughout the body. The necessary partial pressure of oxygen throughout tissues is variable depending on the metabolic demands of the tissues. This diffusion gradient is known as the tissue partial pressure of oxygen (PtO) and varies with capillary density, oxygen consumption, metabolic rate, and blood flow.

Mental functions become impacted because the aerobic metabolism of glucose for energy production cannot occur efficiently. The skin typically has a partial pressure spectrum based on the depth of the skin layer from the surface. The superficial region of the skin at 5 to 10 micrometers depth is approximately 5.0 to 11 mmHg partial pressure of oxygen. Dermal papillae at 45 to 65 micrometers depth typically have an 18 to 30 mmHg partial pressure of oxygen. At the subpapillary plexus of 100 to 120 micrometers depth, the partial pressure of oxygen is approximately 27 to 43 mmHg.

The intestines also have a variable partial pressure of oxygen, with the serosal portion of the small bowel being 53.0 to 71.0 mmHg. The liver's partial pressure of oxygen has been studied with somewhat variable results such that two separate groups were found to have median values of 42.04 mmHg and 34.53 mmHg. The kidneys make up another organ system with a high oxygen requirement due to the high energy and subsequent metabolic demand involved in the active transport processes of the nephron reabsorption systems. As such, the medullary partial pressure of oxygen is 10 to 20 mmHg, and the cortex requires 52 to 92 mmHg. Muscular demand for oxygen is highly variable depending on the activity intensity and duration of the muscle. At baseline, muscular partial pressures of oxygen range between 27 mmHg and 31 mmHg.
