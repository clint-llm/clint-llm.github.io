Current interest in the imaging capabilities of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is mostly limited to academic institutions. One of the most significant advantages is the lack of renal injury associated with contrast use when compared to CT contrast or MRI-based contrast.

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound permits real-time evaluation of the enhancement characteristics allowing targeted assessment of the wash-in and washout kinetic patterns. There is ongoing research to determine the imaging characteristics of different masses; many parallel enhancement patterns are seen on CT and MRI. While initially used as a screening tool, requiring CT or MRI for complete characterization, contrast-enhanced ultrasound has the potential to diagnose more pathologies in the future definitively.
