Prevention of Bartonella infections includes several common measures that will help in curtailing the transmission of the disease. For cat scratch disease taking appropriate care of the cats, avoiding being scratched, keeping them indoors as much as possible, regular treatment to eradicate cat fleas, and washing hands after playing with them will help reduce the transmission of the disease. For trench fever avoiding exposure to human lice and prompt treatment if lice are found will prevent the occurrence of the disease. Carrionâ€™s disease caused by Bartonella bacilliformis can be prevented by wearing clothes with long sleeves and the use of repellents to avoid being bitten by sandflies.
