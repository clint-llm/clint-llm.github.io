The structures of the head and neck, including the face, neck, and pharynx, derive from the branchial arches during weeks 4-7 of gestation. Six pairs of branchial arches form in cranio-caudal succession. The arches are composed of mesoderm and neural crest cells and give rise to cartilage, muscles, and nerves of the head and neck. They are surrounded externally by branchial clefts, which are ectodermal in origin,Â and lined internally by endodermal-derived branchial pouches. This branchial apparatus is responsible for the formation of all structures bordering the RPS. The branchial arches give rise to the fascial components lining the RPS, and the branchial pouches form the primitive pharynx.
