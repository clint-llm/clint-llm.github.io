- Laxative abuse is not uncommon and is found in patients with anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa and the elderly who continue to use laxatives once started for constipation. It also includes patients with surreptitious diarrhea.

- These patients can present with dehydration and electrolyte imbalances like hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hyperuricemia, and hyperaldosteronism.

- The treatment of laxative abuse is to quit the causative agent. The main challenges are rebound symptoms like weight gain, edema, and constipation, which are very distressing for the patient. Edema is due to renal retention of water. Diuretics should be used with caution to help with constipation and edema and increase patient tolerance when stopping the use of the drug. Renal function and electrolytes require careful monitoring. Diuretics can be tapered off over three months.
