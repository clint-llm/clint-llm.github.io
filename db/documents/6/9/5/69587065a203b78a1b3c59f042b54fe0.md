Chylous ascites (CA) is defined as a milky appearing, triglyceride-rich peritoneal fluid in the abdominal cavity. It is characterized by the accumulation of true chyle from thoracic or intestinal lymph. It is an uncommon clinical condition that was first reported in 1912. This usually occurs due to trauma and rupture of the lymphatics due to obstruction, and an increase in peritoneal lymphatic pressure. CA is rich in nutrients and immunoglobulins that become biologically unavailable after accumulating in the peritoneal cavity. This can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, malnutrition, and suppression of the immune system. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of chylous ascites and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of chylous ascites.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of chylous ascites.
- Review the management options available for chylous ascites.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance chylous ascites and improve outcomes.
