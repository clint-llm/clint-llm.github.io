Phimosis is a term used to describe difficulty retracting the penile prepuce. There are both physiologic and pathologic forms of phimosis, which can complicate the use of the term. The physiologic form is common in children between 2 and 4 years of age, is a self-limiting, and resolves once the foreskin becomes more retractile. The pathologic form is usually due to balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO), a cicatrizing skin condition histologically identical to lichen sclerosis. BXO has an insidious onset and may be associated with irritation, local infection, dysuria, and bleeding, which can precede atrophy and meatal stenosis. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment and prognosis of physiologic and pathologic phimosis and highlights the role of an interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the differences in the presentation of physiologic versus pathologic phimosis. 
- Explain when an alternative process should be considered in patients who have been diagnosed with physiologic phimosis. 
- Summarize the various differential diagnoses for phimosis.
- Describe the importance of an interprofessional approach to the management and surveillance of patients with phimosis.
