The patient’s history will involve consumption of tetrodotoxin-containing organisms, such as pufferfish, newts, or sea snails. Onset and severity of the symptoms of tetrodotoxin poisoning are dependent on time after ingestion and is dose-dependent. In the majority of cases, symptoms usually occur within 30 minutes of ingestion. A few cases have had symptoms start to occur after 20 hours.

There are 4 grades of poisoning base on a scale created by Fukuda and Tani in 1941:

- Grade 1: Paresthesias and perioral numbness, with or without gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea)

- Grade 2: Facial numbness, slurred speech, early motor paralysis, and incoordination, but with normal reflexes

- Grade 3: Generalized flaccid paralysis, aphonia, respiratory failure, and fixed/dilated pupils (in a conscious patient)

- Grade 4: Severe respiratory failure with hypoxia, bradycardia, hypotension, cardiac dysrhythmias, and unconsciousness
