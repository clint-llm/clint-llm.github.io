The embryological development of the kidney is from a cranial to caudal direction and originates from intermediate mesoderm. Early development leads to the urogenital ridge, nephrogenic cord, and, finally, the urinary collection system.

The earliest kidney is pronephros, which appears by four weeks but is nonfunctional. The pronephros is followed by the mesonephros, which forms the Wolffian duct (mesonephric duct). The mesonephros functions as a temporary kidney for most of the first trimester and will eventually contribute to the male genital system.

The metanephros develops from the mesonephric outgrowth and becomes the ureteric bud at around five weeks. It is fully functional and canalized by week two of the pregnancy. This orderly progression of kidney development continues until about 34 to 36 weeks of gestation. The metanephros will give rise to the ureter, renal pelvis, calyces, and collecting ducts. Most anomalies of the kidney develop at this stage of development.

As the metanephros develops, the ureteropelvic junction fuses with the kidney and is the last to canalize. The ureteropelvic junction is the most common anatomical site of obstruction in the fetus leading to hydronephrosis.
