Non-odontogenic tumors of the jaw are rare pathologies that can often be overlooked, resulting in delayed diagnosis and treatment. They cover a vast range of pathologies categorized below; due to the breadth of this topic, only six more common conditions are described in detail; osteosarcoma, central giant cell granuloma, fibrous dysplasia, osteoma, osteochondroma, and osteoblastoma. The activity reviews the assessment and treatment of non-odontogenic tumors and discusses the role of the interprofessional team in caring for these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the classification of non-odontogenic tumors of the jaw by tissue of origin.
- Describe the etiology and histology of osteosarcoma, central giant cell granuloma, fibrous dysplasia, osteoma, osteochondroma, and osteoblastoma.
- Outline the classical presentation of osteosarcoma, central giant cell granuloma, fibrous dysplasia, osteoma, osteochondroma, and osteoblastoma.
- Review investigative work-up and treatment outcomes of osteosarcoma, central giant cell granuloma, fibrous dysplasia, osteoma, osteochondroma, and osteoblastoma.
