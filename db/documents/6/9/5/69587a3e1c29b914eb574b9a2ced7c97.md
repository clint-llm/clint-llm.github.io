Cortical blindness (CB) is defined as loss of vision without any ophthalmological causes and with normal pupillary light reflexes due to bilateral lesions of the striate cortex in the occipital lobes.

Description of CB goes back to the Roman era. Roman philosopher and politician Seneca described a case of a slave who, despite her blindness, did not accept it and kept constantly arguing about room darkness.
