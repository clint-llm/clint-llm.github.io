Surgical procedures related to the infratemporal fossa are complicated due to the intricate anatomy present in this area. Complications related to surgical intervention in the infratemporal fossa include hearing loss, facial nerve weakness, temporomandibular joint dysfunction, dental malocclusion, and cosmetic deformities. One of the most life-threatening complications of surgery in the infratemporal fossa includes accidental incision of the internal carotid artery. This can result in profuse hemorrhage and rapid death. One technique employed by surgeons to confirm whether a visible vessel is the internal or external carotid artery involves the temporary blocking of the vessel and checking the pulse of the superficial temporal artery. Pulselessness of this artery confirms that the external carotid is blocked. In this section, we will explore 2 traditional surgical approaches to pathology in the infratemporal fossa.

The classic lateral approach to the infratemporal fossa involves beginning with a posterior auricular incision. This is followed by mastoidectomy, parotidectomy with facial nerve dissection, and disarticulation of the mandible from the temporomandibular joint. Disarticulation of the mandibular joint is performed instead of mastication muscle dissection due to severe trismus that can occur from fibrosis of the muscles following incision and healing. The lateral approach provides great exposure to the entire unilateral infratemporal fossa and good control over vasculature. Disadvantages of this approach include an increased risk of hearing loss, facial nerve weakness, and temporomandibular joint dysfunction.

The anterior approach involves utilizing the airspace of the maxillary sinus and can be performed either endoscopically or the traditional open approach depending on the degree of pathology. The traditional transmaxillary approach involves a facial dissection followed by Le Fort osteotomy, maxillary sinusotomy, and maxillectomy. Advantages of this approach include safety margins provided by the natural airspace within the sinus cavities. Disadvantages include limited exposure to the infratemporal fossa and distal access point.

Another anterior approach utilizing endoscopic technology includes the endonasal endoscopic approach. This approach utilizes small intranasal incisions to reach the infratemporal fossa using endoscopic equipment. This approach is advantageous by avoiding cosmetic morbidity while still providing a detailed view of the infratemporal fossa. One major complication that can result from this approach includes difficulty controlling hemorrhage in the area if bleeding occurs.
