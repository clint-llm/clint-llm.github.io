Due to the nature of their work, dental personnel is exposed to possibly infectious agents daily that present an occupational risk. Vaccination, proper use of PPE, and disinfection and sterilization recommendations should be thoroughly followed to minimize the spread of infections.

Protocols for minimizing percutaneous injuries must be in place in the dental office, explained to new personnel, and revised and checked regularly. An exposure protocol and risk assessment should be followed in case of an accident.

The importance of infection control must always be in our minds: when working in the clinical environment, when treating each patient, when moving from clinical to non-clinical areas, when processing dental instruments, and when leaving the office to go home at the end of a working day. This will minimize the risk of pathogens transmission and ensure patient and personnel safety.
