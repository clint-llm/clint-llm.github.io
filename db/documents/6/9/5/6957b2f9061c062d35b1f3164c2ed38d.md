The U.S. Preventative Services have recommended universal screening for mothers to screen for hepatitis B infection during pregnancy at the first prenatal visit using Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and Task Force (USPSTF) and American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).

Breastfeeding is encouraged after newborns with exposure to Hepatitis B virus receive the appropriate immunoprophylaxis by the American College of Pediatrics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ACOG, and the Society for Materno-Fetal Medicine (SMFM).

There is currently no immunization for hepatitis C virus-infected mothers and infants and no contraindication for breastfeeding in hepatitis C virus-infected mothers and infants.

Pregnant women in developed countries should avoid traveling to the Hepatitis E virus endemic regions.
