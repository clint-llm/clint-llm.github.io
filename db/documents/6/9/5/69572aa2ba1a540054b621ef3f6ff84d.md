The diagnosis of adiposis dolorosa should only be made when other diagnoses have been excluded. Differential diagnoses include fibromyalgia, panniculitis, endocrine disorders, primary psychiatric disorders, multiple symmetric lipomatosis (Madelung syndrome), multiple familial lipomatosis, Proteus syndrome, and benign adipose tissue tumors.

Fibromyalgia is a common chronic syndrome of widespread musculoskeletal pain and tenderness, fatigue, and cognitive difficulties that can be easily confused with adiposis dolorosa especially in overweight or obese females. These patients also have an unremarkable physical exam and lab work. The diagnosis of fibromyalgia is based on widespread pain & tender points typically in specific locations in muscle and joints as well as fatigue and cognitive and psychiatric disturbances which is also a diagnosis of exclusion.

Panniculitis presents with painful inflammatory nodules of the subcutaneous fat. The history, location, and associated findings of erythema, ulceration, and atrophic scarring help to differentiate the type of panniculitis. A biopsy is diagnostic.

Endocrine disorders that may be confused with adiposis dolorosa include Cushing syndrome and hypothyroidism. Both of these diseases present with weight gain and generalized pain not localized to the subcutaneous tissue, which helps differentiate them from adiposis dolorosa.

Depression can present similarly to Dercum disease in that it is often associated with chronic pain conditions.

Madelung syndrome presents with large, symmetric, nonpainful fat accumulation around the neck, upper extremities, and trunk typically in non-overweight, alcoholic males which help distinguish it from adiposis dolorosa.

Familial multiple lipomatosis similarly presents with multiple lipomas, though often multiple family members are affected because it is genetic with a mutation in the 12q13–15 region which contains the HMGA2 gene.

Proteus syndrome is a genetic disease with lipomatosis from an activating mutation in the AKT1 oncogene. This syndrome also presents with overgrowth of other various tissues.

Lastly, benign adipose tissue tumors generally are not ordinarily painful but can present as multiple lesions on a single patient.
