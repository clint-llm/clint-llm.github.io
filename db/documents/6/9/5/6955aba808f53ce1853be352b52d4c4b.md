Talar neck fractures typically undergo management with dual-incision open reduction and internal fixation techniques. While the prompt reduction of fracture-dislocations is recommended, definite fixation can delay until the soft tissue envelope is amenable without an increased risk of osteonecrosis. In a series of 25 patients with 26 displaced talar neck fractures with a mean follow-up of 74 months (Level IV evidence), Lindvall et al. observed a union rate of 88% and concluded a delay in surgical fixation does not affect the outcome, such as osteonecrosis or union.

Talar neck fractures require the efforts of an interprofessional team that includes physicians, orthopedic and possibly neurological specialists, nursing with specialized orthopedic training, and, when necessary, pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient outcomes.
