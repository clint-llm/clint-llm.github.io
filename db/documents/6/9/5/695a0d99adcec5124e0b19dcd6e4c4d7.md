An inverted nipple is a condition with a prevalence of 10%-20% in the general population. Though not life-threatening, it is psychologically and physiologically damaging to an individual. It can be both congenital and acquired. Although most of the acquired cases are treatable, the congenital inversions can be of higher grade and pose a treatment dilemma to the surgeon, as there is a lack of standardization in the treatment protocol for the condition. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of an inverted nipple and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
-  Describe the pathophysiology of nipple inversion.
- Review nipple inversion as a medical condition and clinical presentation.
- Outline the management options available for nipple inversion.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of patients with nipple inversion and improve outcomes.
