Differential diagnosis includesÂ several other nutritional deficiencies, including:

- Biotin

- Vitamin B2 (riboflavin)

- Essential fatty acid deficiency

Biotin deficiency can present with similar cutaneous findings but often additionally manifests with hypotonia, ataxia, seizures, and hearing loss. This deficiency is quantified with serum biotin estimation and increased urinary excretion of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid. Riboflavin deficiency presents with ocular involvement and is confirmed with increased activity of the enzyme erythrocyte glutathione reductase. Clinically, it can appear similar to necrolytic migratory erythema, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and candidiasis.

Necrolytic migratory erythema is related to glucagon secreting tumors and this can be evaluated by serum glucagon levels above 1000 pg/ml.

Furthermore, other differentials that should be considered while making the diagnosis of zinc deficiency are:

- Hypothyroidism

- Depression

- Iron deficiency

- Vitamin B12 deficiency

- Folate deficiency

- Vitamin D deficiency

- Vitamin A deficiency
