Histologically, there is no tissue destruction observed, such as in acquired emphysema. There is no destruction of alveolar walls and alveolar septum, normal acinus structure, but no acinar maturation with age and overinflated alveoli. Congenital lobar emphysema has two forms:

- Hypo-alveolar

- Poly-alveolar

In the great number of CLE cases, there are normal numbers of radial alveoli. Nonetheless, there is no remarkable progression with age as to normal individuals inferring that acinar development in the concerned lung ends in the postpartum period. In hypo-alveolar, there are fewer than the expected number of alveoli, and in poly-alveolar, there are greater than the expected number of alveoli.
