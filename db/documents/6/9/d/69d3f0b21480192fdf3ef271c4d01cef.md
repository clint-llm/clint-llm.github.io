Heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's requirements. It results from any disorder that impairs ventricular filling or ejection of blood to the systemic circulation. Patients usually present with fatigue and dyspnea, reduced exercise tolerance, and fluid retention (pulmonary and peripheral edema). This activity reviews the evaluation and management of congestive heart failure and highlights the role of the healthcare team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure.
- Describe the diagnostic approach to patients presenting with clinical features of congestive heart failure.
- Outline the management of congestive heart failure.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to educate the patients on the importance of medication compliance to improve outcomes for those with congestive heart failure.
