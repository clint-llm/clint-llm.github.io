Regulation of osmolarity and volume play an essential role in maintaining body water balance and tonicity.

The acute adaptation to hypertonicity consists of ''regulatory volume increase'' (RVI). It requires activating the Na+, K+, 2Cl- co-transporter, and the Na+/H+ exchanger, which couples to the Cl-/H2CO3- anion exchanger. These last two bring NaCl and KCl into the cell and moves H2CO3 out of it. The H2CO3 is then converted to CO2 and returns to the pool of H+ and HCO3- inside the cells. The thermodynamically obliged movement of water also follows the return of H2CO3. Sodium-ion entering the cells is extruded through Na/K ATPase in exchange for potassium, forming potassium chloride, the final salt gained intracellularly in hypertonicity.

Meanwhile, with chronic adaptation, the general response to hypertonicity is activating the transcription factor tonicity (TonEBP), leading to increased cellular expression of organic osmolyte transporters and enzymes. Some of the transcriptions of genes that TonEBP produces are aldose reductase (AR), betaine/GABA transporter(BGT1), sodium myoinositol transporter (SMIT), and taurine transporter (TauT). The transcription of Hsp70, urea transporters (UTA1 and -2), and water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) increase cell membrane water permeability and is activated by TonEBP.
