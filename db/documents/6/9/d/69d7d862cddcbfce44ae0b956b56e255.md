Meigs syndrome cannot be diagnosed until the patient has surgery. Hence, it is essential that alternative diagnoses are considered and, to an extent, ruled out before contemplating abdominal surgery. The following are the important differential diagnoses.

- Ovarian carcinoma

- Cirrhosis of liver

- Other cancers - gastrointestinal cancers, lung cancers

- Congestive heart failure

- Nephrotic syndrome

- Tuberculosis

- Pseudo Meigs syndrome: Ascites and pleural effusion in a patient with pelvic or abdominal tumor (other than the benign tumors included in the definition of Meigs syndrome). The tumors in pseudo-Meigs syndrome could be benign or malignant.

- Pseudo-pseudo Meigs syndrome: Also called Tjalma syndrome, is a condition where there is a combination of ascites, pleural effusion, and elevated serum levels of CA 125 in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus.
