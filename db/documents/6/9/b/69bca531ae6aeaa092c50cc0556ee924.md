Patients present with a slow-growing subcutaneous tumor that is hard and freely mobile and surrounded by a fibrous capsule. Over 70% of the tumors arise from the head and neck. There are reported cases of rapidly growing tumors. Pilomatrixomas are usually solitary but can occur in multiples. There can be a blue or red color to the overlying skin, which can occasionally ulcerate. Patients are usually asymptomatic but can report some pain or itching. The tent sign, a flattening of a part of the lesion with angulation resembling a tent, may be seen when the skin is stretched. Pigmented pilomatrixoma contains melanin or melanocytes, and it is thought to be rare. Two case series reported the incidence to be around 10% or less, but a Japanese case series in 2013 reported the incidence to be 24.6% in 53 Japanese patients. There are two reported cases of pilomatrixoma associated with alopecia, with one presenting with an area of hair loss surrounding a scalp lesion. The pilomatrixoma was on the left forehead of a 5-year-old Japanese girl in the second case. She had hair loss involving her left eyebrow, and hair regrowth was observed after the tumor was removed.
