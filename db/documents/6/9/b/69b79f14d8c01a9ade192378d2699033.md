The neuronal pathogenesis of epilepsy is not fully understood despite its high prevalence. Strong evidence suggests a genetic component affecting the transcription of specific principal neurons regulated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Subtypes of principal and GABAergic interneurons are the most likely candidates for contributing to seizure triggering and propagation.

Genetic predisposition to epilepsy has also been attributed to an upregulation of the glutamate receptor genes, an excitatory neurotransmitter. As GABA becomes deregulated, the glutamate receptor initiates an uninhibited, unsynchronized neuronal activity that generates a seizure activity. Structural lesions such as tumors, sclerotic tissue, or damaged tissue will serve as epileptogenic areas due to the disruption of normal electrical propagation.
