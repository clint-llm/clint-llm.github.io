PD offers autonomy and dialysis therapy in the comfort of patients home. Outcomes of patients are equivalent to those using HD as a dialysis modality, and it is considerably cheaper to the system. Patient education and utilization of a PD-first approach in all patients initiating dialysis can not only save financial resources in an evergrowing cost of ESRD care but improve patient experience and mortality.
