No specific TNM staging criteria exist for Marjolin ulcers. After a biopsy has been performed, the histopathologic type of tumor can be used to stage the disease. For example, if the biopsy reveals squamous cell carcinoma, existing criteria established by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) can be used.
