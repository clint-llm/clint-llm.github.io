A healthcare team improves patient outcomes by creating conditions, resources, and a culture where clinicians can endeavor to make safe results. Our leaders must create an organizational climate in the healthcare field that ensures people acknowledge mistakes and inspires clinicians to innovate. Pediatric cardiac care is complex, and a tight coupling across the team in recognizing and responding quickly to appropriate errors and threats is critical in ensuring complete prevention-oriented recovery. The hallmark of providing harmonious performance and high reliability is supporting and building a culture of trust, transparency, and psychological safety.

The primary responsibility of clinicians is to respect their patients and their families, improve safety and quality, and provide pediatric cardiac care by managing processes that optimize, standardize and continuously measure and monitor outcomes. A culture of certainty and collaboration within teams and institutions is essential for warranting data collection and devising mechanisms to report hazards and unsafe conditions.

An essential tool that emerged over the past decade is a heart team; it includes a clinical cardiologist, cardiothoracic surgeon, anesthesiologist, nurse, nutritionist, pharmacist, physiotherapist, psychologist, and welfare service. The institution can modify the heart team with the incorporation of a pediatrician for pediatric cardiac care and a gynecologist/ obstetrician if a pregnant patient with congenital heart disease entails.

Improved communication between different healthcare disciplines helps reduce patients' length of stay and decreases morbidity and mortality. A systematic approach can enhance the delivery of quality evidence-based care in managing congenital heart diseases through leadership commitment from the anesthesiologist, cardiologist, and cardiac surgeon. Implementing a heart team for perioperative management of congenital heart diseases helps put numerous problems into perspective for sick patients and their families.

- A cardiologist's role in managing the patient's congenital heart disease is threefold 1) anatomical diagnosis, 2) interventional catheterization, and 3) role in decision-making for corrective surgery.

- An interventional cardiologist performs cardiac catheterization to stabilize the patient and buy ample time for neonates before cardiac surgery.

- The cardiac surgeon in the heart team decides the optimal timing of the surgery and performs the necessary surgery.

- An anesthetist plays a fundamental role in evaluating anesthetic risks in the perioperative management of patients with congenital heart disease.

- A perfusionist manages the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit intraoperatively.

- An interventional radiologist helps diagnose the anatomical cardiac defect using various imaging modalities.

- An intensivist manages post-cardiac surgery period and non-cardiac complications, mechanical ventilator support, antimicrobial regimens, hemodynamic monitoring, and renal replacement.

- A clinical pharmacist's role is to provide evidence-based medication education for patients and healthcare professionals.

- A cardiac nurse has a significant role as a first-care responder and provides immediate care under the clinician's guidance.

- A physiotherapist is a critical member in leading cardiac rehabilitation programs.

- A pediatrician also holds an essential role in managing pediatric patients.

- A gynecologist/obstetrician may be involved when a pregnant patient with congenital heart disease presents.
