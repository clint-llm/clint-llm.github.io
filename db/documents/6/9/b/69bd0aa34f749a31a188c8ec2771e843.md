Insulin glargine is contraindicated in patients with a documented hypersensitivity to the drug or one of its components. It also should not be administered during a hypoglycemic episode. However, patients can restart the medication once the episode has resolved. Caution is advisable in current infection, hypokalemia, kidney dysfunction, and liver disease.

Insulin glargine is considered safe during pregnancy, and there are no known risks of infant harm if using the medication during lactation. However, the FDA lists insulin glargine as category C in pregnancy, stating that the patient should only use it if the benefits outweigh the risk.
