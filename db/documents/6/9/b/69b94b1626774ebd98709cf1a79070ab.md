The correction of prominauris has traditionally been under the specialties of plastic surgery and otolaryngology. Although otoplasty is typically an outpatient procedure, it still requires a team approach. The child’s pediatrician most often refers these patients to the surgeon, which requires an understanding of the diagnosis and direct communication with the surgical practice, as well as knowledge of the appropriate timing of referral and repair. If a wound infection and subsequent perichondritis were to develop, consulting with an infectious disease pharmacist may also be warranted to help guide antibiotic selection. The earlier a complication is recognized, the better the prognosis and subsequent cosmetic outcome (Level V).
