Cephalosporins act similarly to beta-lactam antibiotics. They inhibit the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall, in particular of peptidoglycan. Peptidoglycans are the exoskeleton of bacteria that provides structural integrity and shape to the cells and protects them from bursting.

Most bacteria possess at least one PBP, and they are the target of different beta-lactam antibiotics like cephalosporins, penicillins, carbapenems, and monobactams. The beta-lactam ring structure of third-generation cephalosporins mimics the “D-Ala-D-Ala” moiety of the natural substrate of PBPs. Structural binding of cephalosporin antibiotics to the active site of PBPs in bacterial cell walls leads to inhibition of their enzymatic activity and leads to defective peptidoglycan synthesis; this results in an inability to construct a functional cell wall and subsequent death of the bacterial cells by osmotic lysis.
