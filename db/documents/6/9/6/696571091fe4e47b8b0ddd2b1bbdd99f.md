Today, healthcare workers encounter many cases of macrocytic anemia than in the past. Further, as the population ages, many more cases of macrocytic anemia are likely to be seen in the future. The other thing of note is that there are many causes of macrocytic anemia including medications; thus the management of these patients is an interprofessional. It is important to educate the patient that some of the more common causes of macrocytic anemia include deficiency of folate and cobalamin. In addition, several reverse transcriptase inhibitors used to treat HIV can also cause macrocytic anemia and hence the pharmacist should encourage the patient to regular blood tests. Another common cause of macrocytic anemia is alcohol abuse; however, with abstinence, this anemia is rapidly corrected. Finally, patients should be educated about foods that are rich in folate and cobalamin.

**Outcomes**

When the cause of the macrocytic anemia is dietary, the condition can be reversed with dietary changes. For those who fail to comply with diet, they are at risk for anemia related cardiac complications, neurological damage, and defects in fetal development. When the cause is a malignancy, the prognosis is guarded.
