The histologic hallmark of a keloid is increased whorls of thickened, hyalinized collagen bundles widely known as keloidal collagen. This feature is found in up to 55% of specimens. However, experts have determined the following four other diagnostic criteria when keloidal collagen is absent:

- Standard epidermis and papillary dermis

- “Tongue-like” advancing edge below the papillary dermis

- Horizontal fibrous band in the upper reticular dermis

- Prominent fascia like a band in the deep dermis

Important clinical and histopathologic differential includes hypertrophic scar. An increased number of fibroblasts and thickened collagen bundles arranged parallel to the skin surface characterizes these lesions. Another common finding includes vertically oriented blood vessels, which are rare in keloids. Hypertrophic scars do not exhibit keloidal collagen. Contrary to previous belief, smooth muscle actin expression is not a reliable way to differentiate hypertrophic scar from keloid.
