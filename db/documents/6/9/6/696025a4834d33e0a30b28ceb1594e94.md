Invariably, treatment is required of these hernias due to the likelihood of there being strangulation of the hernia. Also, these hernias often require treatment as an emergency procedure, as it is unlikely that the obturator hernia is likely to be reducible.

The treatment options for an obturator hernia are thus to be decided between an open and laparoscopic procedure. Laparoscopic hernia repairs are becoming more prevalent, with a number of reports of obturator hernia being repaired via a minimally-invasive approach

The operative steps in an open procedure remain the same for any strangulated hernia repair â€“ requiring a lower midline laparotomy, identification of the hernia, inspection of the contents, with possible bowel resection and anastomosis, followed by repair of the hernial orifice with either primary suture repair or with mesh placement

The laparoscopic approach has been described previously. For a TAPP repair, pneumoperitoneum is achieved (normally via an open Hassen technique), with ports placed 5cm either side of the midline below the umbilicus. This is especially so as it would be prudent for the clinical evaluation of the contralateral side (if initially diagnosed with a unilateral obturator hernia), as there might be missed bilateral herniae in this population.
