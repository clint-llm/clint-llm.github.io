When viewed under a light microscope, astrocytes appear as large nuclei with minimal surrounding cytoplasm, and some sharp protrusions representing primary foot processes whose radial arrangement around the large, circular nucleus gives astrocytes the star-like appearance from whence they derive their name. Holzer staining shows the foot processes better than H&E staining. The best results for light microscopy, however, come from using fluorescent immunocytochemical markers such as GFAP, GLAST/EAAT1, and GLT-1/EAAT2.

In modern practice, conventional light microscopy has fallen out of favor for viewing astrocytes because finer astrocytic foot processes are not readily distinguishable from other fine branching structures such as dendrites or extracellular matrix.
