There are an estimated 300 million people who have asthma worldwide, with a significant geographic variation of prevalence, severity, and mortality. According to the CDC, 8.4% (or over 6 million) of children in the United States have asthma. Asthma is a chronic disease that has a high morbidity rate and a comparatively low mortality rate overall. It is the leading cause of chronic disease and missed school days in children. While asthma classically begins during childhood, and the incidence and prevalence are higher during this period, it can occur at any time throughout life. Before puberty, the rate of asthma incidence, prevalence, and hospitalizations is higher in boys than girls, though this reverses during adolescence. Severe asthma affects 5% to 15% of this population in the U.S. and world, with males being more likely to have severe asthma in childhood (66%) and adolescence (57%). Studies have shown an increased in prevalence, rate of emergency department visits and hospitalizations, and mortality in African American and Hispanic populations in the United States.
