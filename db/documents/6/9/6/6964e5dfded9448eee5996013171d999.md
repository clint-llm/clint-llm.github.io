Patients may present with upper extremity swelling and pain. The presentation of these symptoms can be acute, subacute, or chronic. For the onset of symptoms in PSS, a history of an antecedent strenuous exercise can usually be elicited from the patients. On examination, the upper extremity will demonstrate edema with an enlarged girth of the extremity compared to the contralateral side. The upper extremity may be tense and cyanotic. Additionally, venous collaterals may be seen on the chest and around the shoulder (Urschelâ€™s sign).
