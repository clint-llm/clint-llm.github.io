The reduction of a mandible dislocation is a procedure that can be associated with complications and costs. A common complication is a recurrent dislocation resulting in patient discomfort, emergency department visits, and an increased cost to the healthcare system.

- An evaluation by an emergency medicine provider to assess for dislocation and associated fractures

- Imaging read by a radiologist before and after the reduction

- Review of procedural and post-reduction medications by a pharmacist for adverse interactions with the patient’s medications

- Patient instructions by a nurse concerning the elements of a soft-mechanical diet

- Evaluation by a specialist, e.g., an otolaryngologist or oral maxillofacial surgeon, for the management of recurrent, chronic, or traumatic dislocation

- Specialty-trained orthopedic nursing care at all steps of the diagnosis and management process, irrespective of what course the treatment takes, from conservative measures to surgery

An interprofessional team approach to the management of the patient during all aspects of the patient’s care helps the patient to have expert treatment resulting in the best possible outcome. [Level IV]
