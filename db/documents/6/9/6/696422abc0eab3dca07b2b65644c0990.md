The extensor hallucis longus is important in the dorsiflexion of the foot at the ankle and extension of the big toe. For this reason, it is tested during the physical exam to assess the range of motion and motor strength of the ankle and big toe. Weakened or absent motor strength can indicate muscle or nerve damage to the extensor hallucis longus and muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg or weakness from the L5 nerve root.

The extensor hallucis longus can also be involved in tendon rupture and tendonitis. The vast majority of extensor hallucis longus tendon injuries documented in the literature have been secondary to a laceration.

Another common injury to the anterior compartment of the lower leg is injury or damage to the deep peroneal nerve. In this case, the patient would present with an inability to dorsiflex the foot at the ankle and extend the toes. Injury to the deep peroneal nerve can severely impact gait resulting in a characteristic high stepping gait to compensate for the foot drop.

Lastly, the anterior compartment of the leg is the most common site for compartment syndrome. Compartment syndrome may occur acutely following blunt force injury or trauma or as a chronic, exertional syndrome commonly seen in athletes.
