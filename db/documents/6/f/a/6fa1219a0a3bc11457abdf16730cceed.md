Ebola virus remains a public health crisis. It is a complex virus causing the deadly disease that is difficult to contain. If it were not for the remote and rural locations of outbreaks, the fear of an Ebola pandemic would be more eminent. The last Ebola virus epidemic revealed the increased need to stay informed on zoonotic, rare diseases. The increasing incidence of Ebola virus outbreaks directly correlates with the risk of a pandemic, with travel being the main vector.

Supportive care remains the determining factor for a good prognosis and outcome. Creating Ebola virus disease treatment units (ETUs) in the hospitals or converting areas to create ETUs, to provide supportive care remains a public health priority. Adjunct therapy with monoclonal antibodies and anti-virals was successful in reducing mortality from the Ebola virus disease during the recent epidemic. The PALM trial effectively targeted research showing highly targeted monoclonal antibodies were superior to a lesser specific monoclonal antibody and anti-viral remdesivir.
