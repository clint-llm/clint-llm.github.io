Oxcarbazepine is a medication used in the treatment of partial seizures. It is in the anticonvulsant drug classification. Oxcarbazepine is a 10-keto derivative of carbamazepine, which came to the market in 2000. However, the minor structural differences between oxcarbazepine and carbamazepine have led to significant differences in the induction of metabolic pathways and the metabolism of the two medications. This activity reviews the indications, action, and contraindications for oxcarbazepine as a valuable agent in treating partial seizures. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, pharmacokinetics, and drug interactions pertinent for interprofessional team members in treating patients with partial seizures.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of oxcarbazepine.
- Review the therapeutic uses of oxcarbazepine.
- Explain the potential side effects of oxcarbazepine.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance patient care when dosing and monitoring oxcarbazepine therapy.
