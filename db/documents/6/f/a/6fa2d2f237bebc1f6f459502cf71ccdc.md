The etiologies of torticollis are diverse. It can be related to complex and/or serious diseases.

Torticollis classifies into several types:

- Congenital torticollis: During gestation or birth, trauma can occur that causes edema in the muscle, which can generate congenital fibrosis of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, causing a shortening of the fibers of this muscle.

- Dermatogenic pain: When there is an injury to the skin of the neck, and it shortens, this can lead to a limitation in movement, usually occurring in cases of burns or scars.

- Ocular torticollis: This refers to the paralysis of muscles involved with the inclination and rotation of the head (compensation) from the involvement of the oblique extraocular muscles.

- Rheumatological torticollis: This variant is secondary to various rheumatologic diseases.

- Torcicolo vestibular: Inner ear responsible for the balance, involving the labyrinth of the inner ear.

- Neurogenic tormentor: This results from any neurological disorder or accident, such as stroke or trauma.

- Spasmodic torticollis (dystonia): this is the most common cause of neck rigidity.  This type results from increased muscle tone. The most common triggering factors include emotional stress, physical overload, or sudden movement.

Experimental models of torticollis show that torticollis can result from both local factors and central nervous system disorders.

Cervical dystonia can subdivide into two groups:

Primary (or idiopathic) cervical dystonia and secondary cervical dystonia (or symptomatic).  Primary dystonia, also called idiopathic dystonia, is characterized by the absence of lesions of the basal ganglia. Numerous studies have identified the genetic basis, revealing 25 genetic dystonias.  Secondary cervical dystonia may follow trauma, drug use, or be the result of a pathological trigger.  Its origin is, therefore, linked to a known external factor.
