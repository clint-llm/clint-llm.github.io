Propofol is contraindicated in any patient that has any known hypersensitivity reaction to the drug. Caution is necessary for any patient with abnormally low blood pressure.

Some package inserts state that propofol should not be given to those with reported allergies to eggs, egg products, soy, or soy products. An allergic reaction occurs secondary to exposure to specific proteins from both egg and soy sources and not the fats (lecithin and oil, respectively) that make up the emulsion. The oils used to manufacture propofol are unlikely to contain quantities of proteins significant enough to produce an allergic cross-reaction.  That being said, patients with atopy have been reported to have a higher incidence of an allergic reaction to many medications, and there are case reports of cross-sensitivity to propofol in the atopic patient. Clinical judgment should be exercised on a case-to-case basis.
