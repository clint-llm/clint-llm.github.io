The mitral valve apparatus has a complex anatomy, including an annulus, two leaflets, three types of chordae tendinae, and two papillary muscles.  The MV annulus is a saddle-shaped structure in continuity with the aortic valve. The annulus is most vulnerable to dilatation at its insertion on the posterior leaflet because it is the thinnest at this junction. There are two MV leaflets; the anterior is tall and narrow, and the posterior is shorter and broader. These two leaflets meet at their respective commissures, known as the anterolateral and posteromedial commissures. Each leaflet divides into three scallops, 1 to 3, from lateral to medial, and are designated A1, A2, A3 (anterior) and P1, P2, P3 (posterior).

Fibrous structures, known as the chordae tendinae, attach the MV leaflets to the papillary muscles. There are three types of chordae based on their level of insertion: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary chordae insert on the leaflet’s free margin and aid in the prevention of leaflet prolapse.  Secondary chordae insert on the leaflet’s rugged surface, and tertiary on the basal portion of the leaflet. There are two papillary muscles known as anterolateral and posteromedial. The posteromedial muscle receives vascular supply solely by the posterior descending artery, while the supply to anterolateral is by both the left anterior descending artery and the left circumflex artery.
