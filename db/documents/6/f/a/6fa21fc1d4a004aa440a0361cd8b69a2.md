A parathyroid adenoma is primarily composed of chief cells, but it can also include oxyphil cells, oncocytes, transitional oncocytes, or a mixture of these cell types. There may also be a rim of normal parathyroid tissue surrounding the adenoma. Microadenomas tend to be unencapsulated; however, larger tumors may have a thin fibrous capsule present with cystic degeneration seen within the tumor. Characteristics such as thick fibrous capsule, adherence to surrounding tissues, vascular and capsular invasion, tumor necrosis, and increased mitotic activity should not be seen in benign adenoma and are more suggestive of carcinoma.
