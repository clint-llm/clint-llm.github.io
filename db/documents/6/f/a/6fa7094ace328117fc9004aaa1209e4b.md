Ventriculostomy or endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is a procedure that has decreased morbidity and mortality in the treatment of hydrocephalus secondary to aqueduct stenosis with success rates of greater than 80%. A small opening is incised on the floor of the third ventricle to facilitate the drainage of CSF fluid as well as monitor intracranial pressure.

Ventricular shunting is a way to remove excess CSF in patients with hydrocephalus. The role of the shunt is to drain excess CSF from the ventricles to another body cavity where it can be reabsorbed and returned to circulation. The most common shunt is the ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt which drains into the peritoneal cavity. A ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt is when the peritoneal cavity is not suitable for catheter placement. Instead, a VA shunt drains the fluid into the right atrium of the heart.

The cerebral aqueduct can be an access point for flexible endoscopy to reach the fourth ventricle which can be helpful for the removal of ventricle cysts and clots from the fourth ventricle.
