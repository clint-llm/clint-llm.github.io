Again, rapid initial diagnosis and treatment of the acute abdomen are crucial. Evaluation and treatment should be simultaneous. Diagnostic interventions include blood work and imaging. In adults older than 40, a 12 lead ECG can help exclude myocardial infarction as the cause of apparent severe abdominal pain. It is important to know if a patient with mesenteric ischemia is in atrial fibrillation. Usually, a complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic profile and lipase are obtained. For sepsis or mesenteric ischemia, a lactate should be ordered. A urine or serum pregnancy test is needed in the workup of ectopic pregnancy. Diagnostic imaging has advanced rapidly in the past three decades. A bedside ultrasound in the Emergency Department can diagnose cholecystitis, hydronephrosis, hemoperitoneum, and the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm in a less than 5 minutes. Diagnostic ultrasound is the preferred modality for cholecystitis, pediatric appendicitis, ruptured ectopic, and ovarian torsion. Multislice helical CT scanning has made the diagnosis of an acute abdomen much more straightforward. In the majority of cases, intravenous (IV) contrast is sufficient. Oral contrast is time-consuming and not usually necessary. MRI is not usually utilized simply because of the time required in a potentially unstable patient.
