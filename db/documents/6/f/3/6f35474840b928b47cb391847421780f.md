Treatment is unique from angioedema associated with histamine since antihistamines, corticosteroids, and epinephrine have little effect on the swelling. Instead, medications that either inhibitor production of bradykinin or compete with the receptor are utilized.

Two other therapies, which have recently fallen out of favor, include antifibrinolytics and androgens. Androgens induce the production of C1-inhibitor and are very effective in preventing attacks but have no benefit in treating an attack. Short-term prophylaxis is tolerated well and is effective for pre-procedure of other short-term events; however, the toxicity of androgens limits their use for long-term prophylaxis. Most experts recommend not exceeding 200 mg of danocrine a day. Adverse effects include hyperlipidemia, obesity, androgenic effects in females, and disposition problems.

Antifibrinolytics include tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid, and both have minimal effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of attacks.

Medications available for long term prophylaxis include lanadelumab (a kallakrein inhibitor), subcutaneous and inrtravenous C1-inhibitor, berotralstat (a kallakrein inhibitor), androgens (limited use due to toxicity) and tranexamic acid (limited use secondary to lack of efficacy).

**Non-medicinal Therapy Used for Treatment of HAE**

In addition to medications, management includes avoidance of triggers, estrogens, and ACE-inhibitors and a management plan. The management plan should include long-term prophylaxis if indicated, therapy to use before dental and surgical procedures, how to treat attacks and a backup plan for treatment of attacks. Most patients should be taught self-treatment to enhance freedom and quality of life. Serial assessment is essential to ensure that morbidity is minimal and therapy is effective.
