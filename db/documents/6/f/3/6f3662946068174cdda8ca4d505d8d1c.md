**Metastatic Pheochromocytomas**

Approximately 10% of pheochromocytomas are estimated to be malignant, as defined by the presence of metastasis. There are no definitively known histological or biochemical features that would enable the differentiation of a malignant pheochromocytoma from a benign pheochromocytoma.

Pheochromocytoma of the adrenal gland scaled score (PASS) score has been applied to differentiate the benign lesions from their malignant counterparts.

**Surgery**

Resection of primary and metastatic disease should be considered if technically feasible; however, it will likely not result in a cure for the disease. The utilized approach to surgery has to be individualized depending on the location of the metastases and can include open or laparoscopic modalities. Larger tumors are preferably treated with an open approach since it may be associated with a lower risk of tumor rupture and may allow for the simultaneous removal of metastases.

Debulking of the primary and metastatic lesions may result in the improvement of symptoms from the catecholamine surge.

The reported five-year survival is only 50%.
