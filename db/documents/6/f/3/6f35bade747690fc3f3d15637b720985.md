Epiphrenic diverticula are a rare type of esophageal diverticulaÂ with aÂ prevalence that varies across studies and countries, ranging from 0.015 to 2%. Males show a slightly higher incidence, with a peak age between the sixth and seventh decades of life.

Cancer, specifically squamous cell carcinoma, is associated with epiphrenic diverticula. However, it is a rare event, occurring in about 0.6% of patients. These patients are more likely to be male (83%), have larger diverticula (>5 cm), and have an older age (mean 68 years old).
