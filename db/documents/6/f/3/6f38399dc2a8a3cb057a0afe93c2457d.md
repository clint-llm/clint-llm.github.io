Huntington disease is a neurodegenerative disease with no cure. The course of the disease commonly lasts 15Â to 20 years. The CAG repeats not only provide information on the age of clinical onset but also predict the age of death. The larger the CAG repeat sizes, the greater is the rate of deterioration of motor, cognitive, and functional measures. The progression of the behavioral symptoms is not related to the size of CAG repeats. Homozygotes for fully penetrant HD have a similar age of onset to those that are heterozygotes but may show an accelerated rate of progression of the disease. The progression of the disease leads to a complete dependency in everyday life, ultimately resulting in full-time care and, finally, death. Pneumonia is the most frequent cause of death, which is followed by suicide.
