Pulmonary sleeve resection (PSR) techniques allow patients with locally advanced lung cancer to undergo surgical resection, otherwise not suitable candidates for pneumonectomy. It is now well recognized that even patients with normal preoperative lung function might benefit from PSR, as compared to pneumonectomy. It is thus an important surgical option for any well-trained thoracic surgeon.

A large meta-analysis demonstrated improved 5-year survival in patients undergoing SL of 50% compared to 30% for pneumonectomy. Improved operative mortality of 3%, compared to 6% for pneumonectomy. Also, the locoregional recurrence of tumors is improved by 17% compared to 30% for pneumonectomy.

Recent advances in thoracic surgical procedures have demonstrated that minimally invasive techniques can be applied to perform PSR at certain institutions.
