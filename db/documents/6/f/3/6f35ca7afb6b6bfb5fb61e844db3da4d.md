Raloxifene can be prescribed by primary care clinicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, OB/GYNS, and endocrinologists. The drug is useful for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and the prevention of breast cancer. However, healthcare workers, including pharmacists, must warn the patient that the drug can cause deep vein thrombosis and how they can detect the symptoms and present them immediately to the emergency department. Also, the drug can cause hot flashes, flu-like symptoms, and muscle spasms. The interprofessional team should work together to monitor the patient closely for deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or embolic cerebrovascular accident. Patient education should include immediate provider notification if shortness of breath, chest pain, arm or leg weakness, calf redness, or pain. Nursing staff must be vigilant to ask about these symptoms at every follow-up visit and alert the prescriber with any concerns. The pharmacist will also need to perform medication reconciliation to avoid drug interactions and verify all dosing is appropriate. A provider may want these medications stopped before prolonged bed rest, immobility, or surgery.

Prescribing raloxifene and follow-up monitoring requires an interprofessional team approach, including clinicians, specialists, nurses, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results and prevent complications. [Level 5]
