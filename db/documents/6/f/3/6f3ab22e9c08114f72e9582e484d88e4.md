A cervicogenic headache is a common cause of a chronic headache that is often misdiagnosed. The presenting features can be complex and similar to many primary headache syndromes encountered daily. The main symptoms of aÂ cervicogenic headache are a combination of unilateral pain, ipsilateral diffuse shoulder, and arm pain. ROM in the neck is reduced, and pain is relieved with anesthetic blockades. The differential diagnosis includes migraines, hemicrania continua, spondylosis of the cervical spine, and tension-type headaches. Treatment includes physical therapy, exercise, and interventional procedures.

Early diagnosis and treatment are important to decrease desensitization and alleviate pain in these patients. Management of this condition requires a multidisciplinary approach. Common treatments include the blockade of the greater occipital nerve, the lesser occipital nerve, and the stellate ganglion.
