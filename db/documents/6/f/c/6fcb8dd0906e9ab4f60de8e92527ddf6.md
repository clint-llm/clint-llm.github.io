Within pregnant women, there are two populations at risk for uterine rupture: those who have a myometrial scar from previous surgery and those with an unscarred uterus. The cause and risk factors for each group are different.

Great attention has been paid to the large increase in the cesarean section rate in the United States over the past five decades. The cesarean section rate increased by 25% between 1970 and 2016.

In women who attempt a TOLAC, those with a previous midline (inverted T or J shaped or classical cesarean section) incision are at two to three times higher risk for uterine rupture than those with a previous low segment transverse incision.

While the incidence of unscarred uterine rupture is low, the rate is increasing.

In the United States, most major abdominal trauma that occurs during pregnancy is due to falls and motor vehicle accidents.

The uterine wall, or myometrium, is weakened in conditions such as Ehlers-Danlos and Loeys-Dietz, which increases the risk of rupture.

Prolonged uterine exposure to oxytocin and other uterotonic medications increases uterine wall stress and can lead to rupture, especially in the setting of obstructed labor.

Conditions such as gestational diabetes with macrosomia, polyhydramnios, multiple gestation pregnancy, and uterine anomalies such as fibroids can stretch the myometrium beyond its optimal range.
