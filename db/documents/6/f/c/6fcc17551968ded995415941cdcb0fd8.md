A craniotomy is a neurosurgical technique, whereby part of the skull is opened or removed for intracranial access to treat conditions such as brain tumors, aneurysms, and arteriovenous malformations. Post-craniotomy headaches (PCH) are one of the most frequently encountered adverse events after craniotomy, presenting in over two-thirds of patients who have undergone the procedure. PCH falls under the category of secondary headaches and can present unique challenges in diagnosis and management. This activity reviews the current literature on post-craniotomy headaches and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in ensuring appropriate evaluation and management of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the most commonly occurring post-craniotomy complications.
- Review post-craniotomy headaches from potentially life-threatening complications of craniotomy.
- Outline a post-craniotomy patient complaining of a headache.
- Explain the need for optimizing care coordination, with particular emphasis on communication between interprofessional medical teams, to enhance prompt evaluation and management of post-craniotomy headaches and decrease the likelihood of missing a potentially life-threatening complication of craniotomies.
