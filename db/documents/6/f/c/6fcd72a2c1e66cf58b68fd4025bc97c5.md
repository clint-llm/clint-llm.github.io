**Advantages of AC Mode**

- Increased patient comfort through the ability to trigger breaths as needed

- Operator-managed patient CO2 levels allow easy corrections for respiratory acidosis/alkalosis.

- Low work breathing for the patient

**Disadvantages of AC Mode**

- The system is volume-cycled, and barotrauma is a concern in stiff lungs. Routinely following plateau pressures should help prevent this.

- If a patient is tachypneic or if not enough time is allowed for exhaling, the patient can develop breath stacking and auto-PEEP. In this process, not all volume is exhaled in every breath, which increases the amount of air in the patient’s lung and the plateau and intrathoracic pressure. This can lead to hypotension due to diminished venous return. Disconnecting the patient from the ventilator to allow enough time for complete exhalation and then readjusting the settings is a solution.

- Since the patient can initiate breaths, hyperventilation can lead to respiratory alkalosis. This may be solved by assuring good sedation.
