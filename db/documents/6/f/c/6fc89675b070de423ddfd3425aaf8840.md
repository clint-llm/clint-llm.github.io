Given the documented risks of aneurysm formation, restenosis, and late hypertension, clinical evaluation is recommended at approximately 4 to 6 weeks after the procedure. In this evaluation, clinical history and physical examination can elicit the recurrence of symptoms such as lower extremity claudication and potential physical exam findings of hypertension and radio femoral delay. Additionally, clinical monitoring after the procedure involvesÂ the measurement of ambulatory or exercise blood pressures. This is recommended as some patients are normotensive at rest but become hypertensive upon provocation with exercise.

Abnormalities found on these postoperative surveillance measures prompt follow up imaging such as the preferred multiple detector computed tomography (MDCT) or MRI. MDCT is given preference in instances of the indwelling stent resulting in susceptibility artifact. Repeat angiography was once the preferred method of initial follow up imaging, but its not the case anymore with the advent of advanced imaging modalities.
