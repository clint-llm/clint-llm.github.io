Cardiac and craniofacial anomalies associated with DGS may require surgical repair. As with any surgical procedure, the possibility of complications, including bleeding, infection, and prolonged hospitalization, exists. These risks are particularly dangerous for DGS patients with significant immunocompromise.

Consistent follow-up of patients with DGS is necessary to evaluate for possibleÂ complications: severe recurrent infections, autoimmune diseases, and hematologic malignancies.
