**History**

- The patient usually complains of a small rough bump arising from the skin. This may either be painless or painful.

- The patient may describe habits that increase the risk factor for transmission, such as showering in communal showers, professionally handling meat products, and farm animals bare-handed or performing unsafe sex.

- The patient may report other symptoms that are more specific with the site from where the papilloma arises.

- Intraductal papillomas arising from the breast may present with bloody nipple discharge.

- Recurrent respiratory papilloma arising from the larynx and trachea may cause stridor and voice hoarseness.

- Nasal Papillomas can cause sinusitis and the loss of smell

**Physical Findings**

Single or multiple solid papules are observed. On the skin, it may appear as a rough solid papule, often covered with hyperkeratinized skin. Those arising on mucosal surfaces appear as a soft, pedunculated mass (supported on a stem or stalk) with numerous finger-like projections. The projections may be long and pointy or short and rounded if keratin has built-up around the lesion. Less keratinized lesions are pink or red in color and resemble a raspberry, whilst heavily keratinized lesions are white and look like the head of cauliflower.
