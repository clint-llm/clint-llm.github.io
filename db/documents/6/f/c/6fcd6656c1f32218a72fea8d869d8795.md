The knee starts to develop from a mesenchymal concentration at four weeks gestational age. A knee joint is identifiable starting at six weeks, and the ACL formation as a mesenchymal condensation in the fetal blastoma is observable between 6 to 7 gestational weeks. Both the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and ACL appear as well-oriented structures by nine weeks of gestation. The ACL initially begins as a ventral ligament but migrates posteriorly in the knee joint as the intercondylar space develops. The PCL does not move from its initial position. Both cruciate ligaments are intracapsular but extra-synovial.
