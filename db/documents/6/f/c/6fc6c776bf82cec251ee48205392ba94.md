Ischemic spinal cord injury is a rare and often misdiagnosed disease. Multiple sclerosis can show similar MRI findings to spinal cord infarctions, thus risking confusion. Spinal cord neoplasms should be in the differential diagnosis though tumors typically have a slow clinical onset, unlike the acute presentation of spinal cord ischemia. Transverse myelitis is another condition with a similar clinical presentation to infarctions, yet the onset is not quite as acute. Venous congestive myelopathy should also be on the differential, yet it differs from infarcts in that it will present with prominent enlarged pial veins with the involvement of the central and peripheral white matter of the cord.
