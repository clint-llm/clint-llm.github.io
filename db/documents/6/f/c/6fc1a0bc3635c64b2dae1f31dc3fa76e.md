While a lobular capillary hemangioma is easily diagnosed based on a history and examination, it is important to consider certain red flag diagnoses that may prove harmful. These includeÂ lesions such as (this is by no means an exhaustive list):

- Amelanotic melanoma

- Squamous cell carcinoma

- Basal cell carcinoma

- Angiosarcoma

Bacillary angiomatosis or Kaposi sarcoma should also be included in the differential in immunosuppressed individuals.

Benign lesions that may need to be distinguished from lobular capillary hemangiomas include:

- Hemangiomas

- Irritated melanocytic nevi

- Spitz nevus

- Warts

- An acquired digital fibrokeratoma

- Granulation tissue from minor trauma or scratching

- Glomus tumor

- Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia

The list of differential diagnoses on histopathology includes other forms of capillary hemangiomas, including, but not limited to, acquired tufted angioma, glomeruloid hemangioma, and infectious angiomatoses such as bacillary epithelioid angiomatosis and verruga peruana.
