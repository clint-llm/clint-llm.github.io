Cobalt (Co) occurs in pure elemental, inorganic salts, and organic forms. Sources of common cobalt exposure include artist's pigmentation (cobalt blue), dyes, porcelain, cement, rubber, super alloys, drill production, cutting tools, catalysts, orthopedic implants, dental hardware, vitamin supplementation, electroplating, outdated treatments for anemia, and widia-steel production.

Pure elemental cobalt exposure is described in the occupational setting and exerts toxicity via the respiratory route.

The single toxic dose of cobalt and its salts is not known. In the cohort of patients with "beer drinker's cardiomyopathy," it was determined that patients were taking an average of 6 to 8 mg of CoSO4 per day for weeks or months.
