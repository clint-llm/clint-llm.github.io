Appropriate use of the Amsler grid requires an interprofessional team. The nurses and optometrists who are involved in patient care should be taught how to handle the instrument properly without any damage. Also, the nurses should assist the clinician with giving proper instructions to the patient so that the final result will not be ambiguous. Often patients will use the Amsler grid at home. The nurse should monitor compliance and report to the ophthalmologist or optometrist if the patient is not compliant or inappropriately using the grid. It is also important to not to apply any mydriatic in the eye prior to the test. If the nurse or clinician accidentally uses a mydriatic, the team should be informed of the application and the test rescheduled on a later date. Interprofessional application and education of patients using the Amsler grid will result in the best outcomes. [Level V]
