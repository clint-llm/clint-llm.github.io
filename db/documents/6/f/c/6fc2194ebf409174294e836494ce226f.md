The differential diagnosis of a pancreatic fistula is broad, and this depends on how a patient presents based on the location and size of the fistula. The differential diagnosis would include causes of abdominal pain, ascites, and pleural effusions. Causes of abdominal pain include trauma, retroperitoneal bleeding, intra-abdominal malignancy, pancreatitis, choledocholithiasis, mesenteric ischemia, bowel obstruction, ruptured organs, and peritonitis.
