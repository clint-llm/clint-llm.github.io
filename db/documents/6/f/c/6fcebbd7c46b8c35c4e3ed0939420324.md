These lesions haveÂ no malignant potential. However, since they do not regress spontaneously and may bleed, ulcerate, or be cosmetically disfiguring, they may necessitate treatment on these grounds.

Partial resection by shave excision or curettage may lead to recurrence in the future; hence complete primary excision is preferred. For recurrence, complete surgical excision is warranted.
