Glucagon is a medication used to manage and treat hypoglycemia as an antidote to beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker overdose, anaphylaxis refractory to epinephrine, and aid in passing food boluses. It is in the anti-hypoglycemic class of medications. This activity describes the indications, actions, and contraindications for glucagon as a valuable agent in managing acute hypoglycemia, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blocker overdose, refractory anaphylaxis, and esophageal obstruction due to food bolus. In addition, this activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for healthcare team members in managing patients with the indicated conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of glucagon.
- Describe the contraindications to glucagon therapy.
- Review the appropriate monitoring for patients receiving glucagon.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance effective treatment with glucagon and improve outcomes.
