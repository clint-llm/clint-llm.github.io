In one study of 408 patients, the following eyelid lesions in order of frequency were: chalazion (28%), squamous papilloma (11%), epidermal inclusion cyst (7%), seborrheic keratosis (5%), xanthelasma (5%), cysts of Moll and Zeiss (5%), nevus (4%), verruca vulgaris (3%), dermoid/epidermoid cyst (3%), capillary hemangioma (2%), keratoacanthoma (1%), cutaneous horn (1%), xanthogranuloma (<1%), trichoepithelioma (<1%), apocrine hidrocystoma (<1%.

In another large study of 2639 eyelid lesions, the most common benign eyelid lesions were inflammatory (chalazion), melanocytic nevus, squamous papilloma, dermoid cyst, and epidermal inclusion cyst.

**Skin**

**Epidermis**

- Seborrheic keratosis (SK) is one of the most common benign lesions of the eyelid, with increasing prevalence over the age of 50 years. Associated with a predisposing mutation in FGFR3. This mutation is more common in sun-exposed skin, and therefore sun exposure, as well as a family history of SK, are associated with the development of SK. The sudden appearance of multiple seborrheic skin lesions is called the Leser-Trélat sign and is associated with gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma.

- Dermatosis papulosa nigra (DPN).  Most common in Black race individuals s as well as Asians and correlated with the level of skin pigmentation. One study found that one-third of Blacks have DPN lesions. It is considered a variant of SK. However, unlike SK, it commonly develops in the 2nd decade. It is more likely in women, and there is a strong familial predisposition. Like SK, it is associated with a mutation in FGFR3.

- Inverted follicular keratosis is an uncommon lesion in patients over age 60 and is associated with sun exposure.

- Verruca vulgaris or common wart affects about 10 percent of the world population and is more common in the first and second decade of life, with up to 20 percent affected in this age group. They are more common in Whites, immunosuppressed patients, and meat handlers. Warts are spread through skin-to-skin contact, and behaviors and practices within certain populations (such as children) affect the prevalence.

- Molluscum contagiosum has an average worldwide prevalence of 0.8 percent. It is most common in pre-school-age children. In adults, it is most common in immunocompromised individuals. There is no racial, geographic, or sex predilection.

- Squamous papilloma (acrochordon or skin tag). Most common benign eyelid lesion of epithelial origin. More common in middle age to older patients.

- Epidermal inclusion cysts. Congenital or acquired. The acquired form is the most common benign skin lesion and occurs due to localized skin trauma from a rash, chemicals, or sun exposure.

- Cutaneous dermoid cyst. Most are congenital and found in the first two decades of life.

- Keratoacanthoma. Most common between 50 and 69 years of age with a male to female ratio of 2 to 1. More common in lightly pigmented individuals.

- A cutaneous horn is most common in individuals 60 to 80 years of age. Cutaneous horn may be pre-malignant or benign. Individuals with benign lesions are an average of 9 years younger than those with pre-malignant lesions. Pre-malignant lesions are more common in males.  Benign lesions have no sex predilection.

**Melanocytic**

- Ephelis (freckles) are most common in individuals with very light skin types and blond or red hair. They tend to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and become darker when exposed to sunlight.

- Lentigo simplex is the most common type of lentigo, present at birth and not affected by sunlight. Incidence and epidemiology are not well studied.

- Solar lentigo correlates with sun and UV light exposure. In Whites in the United States, solar lentigo is observed in 90 percent over 60 and only 20 percent under 35 years of age.

- Nevi of all types are found in Blacks, Whites, and Asians alike. Nevi become more common with age. Nevus acquisition increases most during pre-teen and teenage years and is correlated with sun exposure. In one study, nevi were found to be present in 60 percent of adults in a predominantly white population. Acral nevi (on the palms and soles) are more prevalent in Blacks and Asians.
- Congenital eyelid nevi

- Split nevus, where the nevus is present on both the upper and lower eyelid, is rare, and around 30 cases have been reported worldwide.
- Oculodermal melanocytosis (ODM, nevus of Ota): One large study determined a prevalence of 0.038% in Whites and a 0.014% prevalence in Blacks. Another study determined that the lifetime risk of uveal melanoma in patients with ODM is 0.25%.
- Giant hairy pigmented nevi are uncommon congenital nevi and are estimated to be present in less than one in 20,000 newborns. A Mongolian spot is an uncommon congenital nevus that is more common in Asians, Blacks, Native Americans, and Hispanics. Both can be present on the face.
- Blue nevi have a 2 to 1 female to male predilection. The prevalence is 3 to 5% in Asians, compared to 1 to 2% in Whites.


- Acquired nevi

- Spitz and Reed nevi are uncommon and occur in less than 0.01 percent of the population. 70 Percent develop before age 20 and are associated with lighter skin types.
- Melanocytic nevi (Junctional, Intradermal, Compound) are present in about 60% of the population. Junctional nevi tend to progress to compound and then to intradermal with age. Due to this, junctional nevi are more common in the pediatric population and intradermal more common in the aging population.
- Dysplastic nevi are present in 2 to 18% of the population.

**Adnexal Lesions:**Lesions that do not arise from the skin are called adnexal lesions and arise from hair follicles, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, and accessory lacrimal glands.

- An external hordeolum is a blocked and infected gland of Moll, Zeis, or eyelash follicle. As such, it is an adnexal eyelid lesion. External hordeola are a common eyelid lesion without a sex or race predilection. It is more common in adults but can occur in children. It is more common in patients with blepharitis, meibomian gland dysfunction, acne rosacea, and those who have had chalazia or hordeola in the past.

**Hair Follicles**

- Trichoepithelioma is a very rare lesion with three subtypes, two of which are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with increased penetrance in females (multiple familial and desmoplastic trichoepithelioma) and one (solitary trichoepithelioma) not inherited.

- Trichofolliculoma is rare, more common in adults, and possibly more common in males.

- Trichilemmoma is relatively common, with an estimated 1 in 2,500 skin biopsy samples in pathology laboratories in the United States testing positive for this lesion. It is more common in Whites and, in the case of Bowen disease, more common in females.

- Pilomatrixoma is more common in the first two decades of life and a relatively common finding among skin biopsy samples in the United States and globally.

**Sweat Glands**

- Apocrine hidrocystoma (cyst of Moll): Does not have a sex or race predilection and is one of the most common eyelid lesions encountered. It is more common in adults.

- Eccrine hydrocystoma: This is not a common eyelid lesion. It is also more common in adults.

- Trichilemmal (pilar) cysts are common and occur in about 10% of the population. They occur in younger and female individuals without a known racial predilection. In some cases, an autosomal dominant inheritance is present.

- Syringoma is an uncommon eyelid lesion that occurs in 1% of the population. They are more common in females and occur during puberty and increase in number with aging.

- Pleomorphic adenoma is more common in the lacrimal gland but can also grow in the eyelid. In the eyelid, it is rare, making up about 0.01% of all benign adnexal tumors. It is more common in middle-aged men.

- Eccrine spiradenoma is a rare eyelid lesion of persons aged 15 to 35 years. No sex or racial predilection is known.

Accessory lacrimal glands are located at the conjunctival fornix (glands of Krausse), the distal edge of the tarsal plate (glands of Wolffring), and within the caruncle (glands of Popov). In one study of 27 patients with accessory lacrimal gland tumors, the mean age was 56 years, a slight male predominance was found (1.4:1), and 89% of lesions were found to be pleomorphic adenoma, 7% adenoid cystic carcinoma, and 4% oncocytoma. Of these, pleomorphic adenoma and oncocytoma are benign lesions. Both lesions are rare.

**Sebaceous Glands**

- Chalazion and internal hordeolum are some of the most common benign eyelid lesions found. In one study, 1% of all new patients presented for a chalazion or internal hordeolum. This study found no sex predilection, and chalazia are most common in the third decade of life, and 10% of chalazia recurred.

- Cyst of Zeis is one of the most common benign lesions of the eyelid. It becomes more common with age.

- A sebaceous cyst (steatocystoma) is an uncommon eyelid lesion as it develops from ordinary sebaceous glands and not the ones associated with the eyelashes. It can be associated with steatocystoma multiplex, a rare autosomal dominant inherited disorder of the sebaceous glands.

- Sebaceous gland hyperplasia is more common in the over 60-year-old population.

- Sebaceous gland adenoma is more common in the over 60-year-old population. The practitioner should suspect Muir–Torre syndrome in younger patients, especially when multiple adenomas are present.

**Stromal Lesions**

Xanthelasma: More common in middle age and older. One-third of patients have hyperlipidemia.

**Vascular Lesions**

- Pyogenic granuloma is associated with tissue disruption from surgery or injury to the tarsal plate from a chalazion. In one study of conjunctival biopsies, pyogenic granuloma was reported to be the most common lesion. In this study, the average age was 27 years. Pyogenic granulomas can be found in all mucous membranes and the skin. Pyogenic granulomas, in general, are most common in the 2nd and 3rd decades of life.

- Capillary hemangioma is one of the most common benign childhood orbital lesions and affects 1 to 5% of infants under the age of 1 year. There is a 3 to 1 female to male predilection.

- Cutaneous angiofibroma is associated with tuberous sclerosis and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 and Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome and is strictly found in this population. In the case of tuberous sclerosis, angiofibromas will start to develop in the first decade of life and continue developing into the second decade.

- Nevus flammeus (port-wine stain) is a common congenital eyelid lesion that affects 0.3 to 0.5% of newborns. No gender predilection has been noted. It is strongly associated with Sturge Weber Syndrome; however, only 6% of babies born with a nevus flammeus develop Sturge Weber syndrome.

**Neurogenic**

- Plexiform neurofibroma is associated with neurofibromatosis type I (NF1), which has an incidence of 1 in 30,000. NF1 is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion; however, about half of all cases are from de novo mutations and are not inherited. Plexiform neurofibromas occur in about 10% of patients with NF1 and can involve the eyelid, orbit, periorbital and facial structures.

- Solitary neurofibroma is the most common tumor of the peripheral nerve sheath. It has no racial or sex predilection and, while occurring in all ages, is more common in the 20 to 40 age group.

- Schwannomas are most common in the 50 to 60-year-old age group. There is no sex or racial predilection. The incidence is about 5 cases per 100,000 adults/year adults and about 0.4 cases per 100,000/year in children. Vestibular schwannomas are most common, followed by the upper limbs and the head. Schwannoma of the eyelid is rare.

**Lipomatous**

- Lipomas occur in 1% of the population with a slightly higher preponderance in males and are more common in the 40 to 60-year-old age group. Eyelid lipomas are uncommon.
