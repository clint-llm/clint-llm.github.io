Lambert-EatonÂ myasthenic syndrome associated with SCLC involves treatment of the underlying malignancy.

The initial treatment for the symptomatic management of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome with or without malignancy is geared towards increasing the levels of acetylcholine. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as pyridostigmine (30 to 120 mg every 3 to 6 hours) are used for the treatment of weakness. However, the effects are not as marked as with patients with myasthenia gravis. Another therapeutic option is 3,4 -diaminopyridine (3,4- DAP). 3,4-DAP binds to VGCCs that lead to prolongation of depolarization of the action potential increase the open time of the VGCCs which leads to an increased presynaptic influx of calcium and increased ACh release.

For patients with refractory weakness, immunosuppression with IVIG as the first-line agent is recommended. Other suggested alternatives include prednisone, rituximab, azathioprine, or plasma exchange.
