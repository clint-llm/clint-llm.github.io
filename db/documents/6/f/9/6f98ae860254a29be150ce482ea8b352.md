In the developing human, all digits are initially fused by a layer of loose mesenchymal tissue - syndactyly occurs as a failure of separation of this fusion. Limb development begins in the 5th week of gestation, deep to a region of ectoderm known as the apical ectodermal ridge (AER). The AER is responsible for longitudinal growth of the limb. Development begins with the activation of mesenchymal cells in the somatic lateral mesoderm. The hands start their development during the 6th week, where mesenchymal tissue of the hand plates begins to form the phalanges. The feet undergo a very similar process in the 7th week of development. Digits form due to signaling from the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) through sonic hedgehog protein (SHH). Higher concentrations of SHH lead to the formation of the ulnar aspect of the limb, and lower concentrations are seen away from the ZPA, leading to radial sided limb development. Finally, the dorsal and volar ectoderm is responsible for the development of the dorsal and volar structures of the extremity. As development continues, “notches” form between the digits at the AER. These notches progress proximally as the previously fused mesenchymal tissue undergoes apoptosis, separating the digits via BMP-4 signaling pathways. By the end of the 8th week of development, the digits have formed.

The failure of apoptosis separating the mesenchymal tissue or the failure of notch formation in the AER leads to syndactyly.
