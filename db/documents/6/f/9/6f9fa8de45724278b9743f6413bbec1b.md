The management and mitigation of aflatoxin toxicityÂ encompass a wide range of professionals, such as farmers, agriculture engineers, food technicians, veterinary physicians, and other health professionals. Protecting food from aflatoxin is a significant step in limiting the health impacts of aflatoxin. Health professionals should be aware of the prevalence of aflatoxin toxicity and food practices in the region in which they live. Exposure in a patient warrants a food checkup of the patient and the family and community. This process helps trace the source of exposure and limits its effect.

The majority of presenting cases of aflatoxin toxicity are late presentations after chronic exposures. Aflatoxin toxicity is one of the major causes of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in developing countries. Acute high-dose exposures are rare, and most severe cases occur in children. Recognition of this condition throughout multiple contact points in the healthcare system is imperative. An interprofessional healthcare team is critical to successfully identifying and managing these toxicities. High-dose acute intoxication may require admission and close monitoring as life-threatening fulminant hepatitis will need intensive care support.
