Hair follicles and hair, with arrector pili muscle contraction, play an important role in body temperature regulation. Hair protects the skin from foreign objects and confers protection from UV radiation. Hair follicles provide a source of new epithelial stem cells to aid in skin wound repair. However, many patients will seek medical care for hair loss or excessive hair growth. Hair responds to sex hormones and serves as a marker for social and sexual communication (e.g., age and gender) and may clue clinicians into an underlying disease process in certain patients (e.g., polycystic ovarian syndrome or steroid-producing tumors). Autoimmune (e.g., alopecia areata), inflammatory (e.g., hidradenitis suppurativa), and infectious (e.g., folliculitis or tinea capitis) diseases involve hair structures causing significant patient morbidity. The various forms of alopecia, including scarring and non-scarring forms, are of great concern to the general population.
