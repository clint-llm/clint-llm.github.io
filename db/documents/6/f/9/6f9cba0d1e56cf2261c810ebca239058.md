**Seizure Semiology**

The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) has recently brought out an updated multilevel classification system for epilepsies to highlight the etiologic basis of the patient’s condition.

When there is preserved awareness, the patient can describe the occurrence of unusual sensations known as auras. Auras could be visceral, autonomic, gustatory, or affective symptoms. Patients commonly experience a rising epigastric sensation, nausea, and olfactory and/or gustatory hallucination. Psychic sensations can occur, such as depersonalization (out-of-body feeling), déjà vu (a feeling of familiarity), jamais vu (feeling of unfamiliarity), déjà entendu (hearing familiar sounds), or panoramic visions (a rapid recollection of episodes from the past). Dysphoric or euphoric feelings, fear, terror, anger, and other sensations can also occur. Often, the patients find the aura hard to describe. Autonomic features include piloerection, pallor/flushing, tachycardia, or pupillary dilatation.
