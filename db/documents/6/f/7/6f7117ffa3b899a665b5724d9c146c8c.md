Some patients experience palpitations, dizziness, or near syncope prior to sudden cardiac arrest. Almost half of the patients who have sudden cardiac arrests report no symptoms prior to collapse.

The American Heart Association recommends cardiovascular screening for high school and collegiate athletes. This includes an evaluation of the athlete's personal and family history and a physical exam.

**Personal History**

- Chest pain/discomfort/tightness/pressure related to exertion

- Unexplained syncope or near syncope

- Excessive exertional and unexplained dyspnea/fatigue or palpitations, associated with exercise

- Prior recognition of a heart murmur

- Elevated systemic blood pressure

- Prior restriction from participation in sports

- Prior testing for the heart, ordered by a physician

**Family History**

- Premature death (sudden and unexpected) before age 50 attributed to heart disease in > 1 relative

- Disability from heart disease in close relative less than age 50

- Hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy, long-QT syndrome, or other ion channelopathies, Marfan syndrome, or clinically significant arrhythmia specific knowledge of certain cardiac conditions in family members

**Physical Examination**

- Heart murmur should be evaluated with the patient both supine and standing or with Valsalva

- Femoral pulses to exclude aortic coarctation

- Physical stigmata of Marfan syndrome

- Brachial artery blood pressure (sitting position), prefer both arms

Routine ECG testing is not recommended for student-athletes. Students found to have an abnormal exam or those with a positive personal or family history may be referred for cardiac testing including ECG and echocardiogram.

Sudden cardiac arrest patients may demonstrate brief myoclonic or seizure-like activity.
