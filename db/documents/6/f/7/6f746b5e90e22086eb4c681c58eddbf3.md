In an individual with lipoprotein lipase deficiency, recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis lead to chronic pancreatitis. The secondary complications of chronic pancreatitis are as follows:

- Diabetes mellitus

- Steatorrhea, that is, stools containing excess fat due to fat malabsorption

- Pancreatic calcifications

However, these complications are rare in an individual with lipoprotein lipase deficiency. Even if these complications occur, they are rare before mid-age. Pancreatitis might be rarely associated withÂ serious complications like total pancreatic necrosis and death.
