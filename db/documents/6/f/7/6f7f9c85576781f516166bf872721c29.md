**Tension-type Headache**

Tension-type headache is usually bilateral, compared to migraine headaches, which are unilateral in about 60% to 70% of adults. Tension headache feels like pressure or tightness around the head, which waxes and wanes. It is not commonly accompanied by photophobia, photophobia, nausea, or vomiting.

**Cluster Headache**

Cluster headache is usually unilateral, and the pain begins around the eye. The pain is severe and reaches a crescendo within minutes, unlike a migraine headache, where the pain is gradual in onset. Associated symptoms in cluster headaches include ipsilateral redness and lacrimation of the eye, rhinorrhea, stuffy nose, and sweating, and responding well to oxygen therapy.

**Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)**

The differential diagnosis for migraine with aura includes TIA. The symptoms are sudden in onset in a TIA, whereas in a migraine, the symptoms are relatively gradual in onset. Also, positive aura symptoms like visual scintillations or paresthesias and associated symptoms of photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and vomiting are less likely in a TIA.
