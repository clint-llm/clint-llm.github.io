The human parainfluenza virus is a community-acquired respiratory pathogen, that has some predisposing factors including:

- Malnutrition

- Overcrowding

- Vitamin A deficiency

- Environmental smoke or toxins

HPIVs are one of the main causes of hospitalization in children less than 5 years of age due to acute respiratory tract infection, with a rate accounting for up to 17% of hospitalizations.

The seasonality of HPIV is specific to each of the four. HPIV-1 follows a biennial pattern, marked by a dramatic increase in cases in the months of September to December of odd-numbered years.

The parainfluenza virus spreads through direct person-to-person contact or from large droplets. Outbreaks can occur, for example, in nursing homes and daycare facilities.
