Proper management of airway, breathing, and circulation is critical in cases of TCA poisoning. Gastrointestinal decontamination by activated charcoal should be done only if conditions are appropriate and the airway is protected. Charcoal decontamination may be effective up to 2 hoursâ€™ post-ingestion, especially if the bowel sounds are diminished. Every effort should be made to minimize the formation of acidosis, as acidosis may increase cardiac and neurologic toxicity. Seizures usually respond to benzodiazepines, but in cases of refractory seizures, prompt administration of anticonvulsants, such as phenobarbital or propofol, or even general anesthesia, should be considered. Sodium bicarbonate should be given to hemodynamically unstable patients, patients with seizures, and patients with QRS prolongation of more than 100 msec. Sodium bicarbonate is given as a bolus of 1 meq/kg, followed by an intravenous infusion containing sodium bicarbonate. The aim of this therapy is to narrow the QRS and to keep the serum pH between 7.5 and 7.55. Hypotensive patients should be treated with IV fluids and sodium bicarbonate, and if their hypotension does not respond to this, alpha-adrenergic agents, such as norepinephrine, should be used. Sodium bicarbonate should be used to treat dysrhythmias associated with QRS widening. Temporary pacemakers have been used to treat refractory symptomatic bradycardias not responsive to sodium bicarbonate. Physostigmine, Type 1A, Type 1C, and Type 3 Anti-dysrhythmic agents should be strictly avoided, as should Flumazenil. Intralipid emulsion treatment should be considered in hemodynamically unstable patients with overdoses of lipophilic TCAs. Since TCA are highly protein bound with an extensive volume of distribution, enhanced elimination with dialysis and hemoperfusion is not effective.
