Up to 85% of all injuries respond to conservative treatment; however, up to 20% will continue to be unstable, prompting the necessity of surgical intervention. The Brostrom with Gould modification surgical procedure has had up to 95% documented success rate. This procedure has demonstrated the ability to improve the stability of the subtalar and ankle joint without compromising other healthy tendons of the ankle joint, such as the peroneus brevis in the Chrisman-Snook and Watson-Jones procedures.
