The most commonly implicated arterial blood supply in anterior epistaxis is the Kiesselbach plexus in Little’s area (Image 1).

Over 90% of epistaxis originates on the anterior nasal septum; dangerous bleeding may occur posteriorly.

In many cases, epistaxis is not simply the result of trauma but a manifestation of an underlying medical problem such as coagulopathy or platelet dysfunction. Identifying and correcting any underlying hematologic pathology will improve the success of any hemostatic intervention. Patients may bleed for various atraumatic reasons, including hypertension, thrombocytopenia, hemophilia, and the use of aspirin, chemotherapy, or herbal supplements, especially turmeric. Control of blood pressure and administration of fresh frozen plasma or platelets may mean the difference between success and failure of nasal packing. Other specific interventions may be required in some cases, such as administering vitamin K to correct a warfarin overdose or desmopressin in von Willebrand disease.
