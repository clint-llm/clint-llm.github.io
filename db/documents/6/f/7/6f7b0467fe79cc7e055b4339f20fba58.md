The diagnosis and management of cat scratch disease are best done with an interprofessional team that includes an infectious disease consultant, emergency department physician, primary care provider, nurse practitioner, and internist.

Management of cat scratch disease depends on the clinical presentation of the disease. Patients who present with milder presentations such as lymphadenopathy, and fever were usually not placed on an antimicrobial regimen because of the self-limiting nature of the disease.

However, studies have shown that the use of a single antimicrobial regimen will reduce the duration of the symptoms significantly. The antimicrobial agents commonly used are azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and rifampin.
