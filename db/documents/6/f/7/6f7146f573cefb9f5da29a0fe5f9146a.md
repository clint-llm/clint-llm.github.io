Linking clinical symptoms or diseases to eosinophils can, at times, be especially challenging, because eosinophils may not always be present on histopathological or microscopic examination of specimens. This situation can occur due to the degranulation of eosinophil contents at target sites without direct infiltration of eosinophils. As a result, testing for MBP and granular proteins has increased.

**Skin:**Atopic dermatitis is associated with elevations of serum IgE and eosinophilia in blood. However, biopsies of patients with atopic dermatitis are absent of eosinophils. An analysis of skin tissue via immunofluorescence from affected patients revealed the presence of MBP, suggesting degranulation of MBP from eosinophils in the dermis of patients with atopic dermatitis.

MBP has also been found in skin biopsies of patients with chronic urticaria.

**Gastrointestinal:**Eosinophilia and MBP have correlated with various gastrointestinal conditions, such as eosinophilic esophagitis, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and eosinophilic gastroenteritis.

**Upper and lower airways:**MBP has implications in bronchial hyperreactivity (reviewed in “mechanisms”). The measurement of this granule in the sputum of patients with asthma has been shown in some studies to be better at identifying asthma than measurement of eosinophilia alone.

**Cardiovascular:**MBP is deposited in the cardiac tissue of patients with the eosinophilic endomyocardial disease.
