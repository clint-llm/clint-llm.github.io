The dorsal interosseous muscles are a group of paired intrinsic muscles of the hand located between the metacarpals. They consist of four dorsal muscles that abduct the fingers. The dorsal interossei additionally assist in flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joints and extension of the interphalangeal joints. All interossei muscles receive innervation by the deep ulnar branch of the ulnar nerve. As such, any injury to the ulnar nerve may have debilitating implications on specific intrinsic hand muscle functions, including finger abduction and adduction, which are primarily controlled by the interossei muscles.

These small muscles, despite their limited range of motion and together with the interosseous palmar muscles, play key roles in the function of the hand: grip and pinch.
