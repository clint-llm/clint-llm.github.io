NETs are typically distinguished into well-differentiated NETs and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs), depending on morphology and clinical prognosis. Both groups share common neuroendocrine histologic features. Well-differentiated NETs are composed of small cells organized in islets, gyriform, and trabeculae, with finely granular cytoplasm, commonly referred to as "salt and pepper" chromatin pattern. On the other hand, poorly differentiatedÂ NECs usually appear as sheets of pleomorphic cells with irregular nuclei and less granular cytoplasm. Furthermore, neuroendocrine cells typically have neurosecretory granules. Measurement of these granules in the blood is used to determine the degree of differentiation of NETs, such as only chromogranins and synaptophysin are present in the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas, while chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD56 (neural cell adhesion molecule) are present in the lung NETs.

Tumor grade corresponds to the proliferative activity of tumors, which is measured by the Ki-67 index, a protein found in the nucleus during cell replication, and/or mitotic activity. Low grade (G1) tumors have a mitotic rate from 0 to 1 per 10 high power fields (HPF) or a Ki-67 index of less than 3%. Intermediate grade (G2) tumors have a mitotic rate from 2 to 20 per 10 HPF or a Ki-67 index from 3% -20%, and high grade (G3) tumors have a mitotic rate more than 20 per 10 HPF or a Ki-67 index higher than 20%.
