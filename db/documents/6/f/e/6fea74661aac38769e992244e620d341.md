Unrecognized and untreated patients will be subjected to multiple thoracenteses and paracenteses. And this could lead to complications related to these repetitive procedures, including infection, bleeding, dehydration, and hypoalbuminemia.

Patients may develop complicationsÂ from ovarian tumors, including ongoing cachexia, severe pedal edema, deep venous thrombosis, severe fatigue, uterine prolapse, urinary frequency, and incontinence. In addition, hormone-producing ovarian tumors may cause severe anemia due to abnormal uterine bleeding and, on rare occasions, could cause the development of endometrial cancer.
