Much of the research regarding blood supply to the arm nerves was the result of the introduction of the free vascularized nerve graft in 1976, which required a deep understanding of the blood supply to peripheral nerves.  To date, one of the prevailing theories is that of the angiosome – a three-dimensional block of tissue supplied by a particular source artery.  Under this theory, nerves traversing a particular angiosome would get supplied by branches of the adjacent source artery. This theory is supported by evidence that transplanted nerves will induce angiogenesis of nearby arteries, thus receiving reliable blood supply.

One study identified two unique methods of blood supply to peripheral nerves. The first was an epineurial longitudinal arterial system that accompanied each nerve.  Among nerves without such an epineurial vessel, small branches from adjacent muscles provided blood. When investigating the nerves separately, the axillary nerve received supply from the brachial and posterior circumflex humeral angiosomes. The musculocutaneous nerve was provided entirely by the brachial angiosome. The radial nerve got its supply from the brachial, profunda brachii, and radial angiosomes.  The brachial and ulnar angiosomes supplied the ulnar nerve. The median nerve's vascular supply was via the brachial, ulnar, and radial angiosomes.

Lymphatic supply to the nerves has not been well described.
