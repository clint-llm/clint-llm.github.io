As humans ingest the eggs of the tapeworm, an oncosphere larva releases from the egg, which can penetrate the lamina propria of the intestine. Once it penetrates, it gets passively transported via blood or lymphatics to the liver, lungs, or other internal organs where they develop into hydatid cysts (metacestode larvae). These cysts have an inner germinal layer and an outer laminated layer surrounded by a fibrous capsule derived from the host. Smaller "daughter" cysts bud from the inner cellular layer. In humans, cysts grow slowly and can be up to multiple liters in volume and contain thousands of protoscolices. Over time, septations and daughter cysts disrupt the typical unilocular pattern of echinococcal cysts.
