Epidural steroid injections have been utilized for pain relief since 1952. When indicated, they are an invaluable non-surgical treatment for low-back pain radiating to the lower extremities and less commonly, for neck pain radiating to the arms. Performing an 
effective epidural steroid injection requires the steroids to reach the epidural space. Successful epidural steroid injections provide pain relief, allowing restoration of function and return to a physical therapy regimen, when indicated. This activity reviews the indications and technique involved in performing an effective epidural steroid injection and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with low back pain.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for epidural steroid injections.
- Describe the preparation required for epidural steroid injections.
- Explain the potential complications of epidural steroid injections.
- Explain how interprofessional team strategies can optimize care coordination and communication to advance the appropriate and safe use of epidural steroids for low back pain and improve outcomes.
