All staff members who will encounter lasers must be well-versed in laser safety protocol. Clear communication is essential when verifying that the following measures are in place before firing the laser.

**Laser Safety**– As lasers are necessarily heat generators, great care must be taken in their use. Collateral damage to not only laser patients’ eyes and skin have been reported, but also damage to the eyes and skin of personnel who are in the room during laser operation. Besides, lasers can start airway and fabric fires. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) have come up with accessible guidelines to protect both patients and personnel involved in medical laser use.

**Fire Safety**– Since flammability is a potential laser hazard, safeguards must be in place in case of an open flame. An open basin of water should be available in case of laser fire. A fire extinguisher should be present in the room. Patient skin near the laser treatment area should be washed free of cosmetic products that might contain alcohol.

**Laser Sign**– The ANSI recommends placement of a laser sign on the outside of each door in which a laser is being used, warning those outside that goggles must be worn, and precautions are being taken.

**Window Covers**– These should be implemented to reduce the accidental escape of a laser beam outside of the laser treatment room.
