- Stress injuries are common injuries related to overtraining with inadequate recovery time.

- Most stress injuries will improve with rest, analgesia, activity modification, cross-training, and a gradual return to sport.

- Many low-risk stress injuries can be managed non-operatively with a gradual return to play.

- Certain high risk stress injuries require surgical intervention. Some stress injuries may require surgical intervention if conservative measures fail.

- Refractory or recurrent stress injuries may require endocrinology, metabolic, nutrition or psychiatric workup when appropriate.
