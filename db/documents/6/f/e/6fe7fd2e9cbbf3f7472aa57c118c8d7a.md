The differential diagnosis for many of the vague symptoms accompanying multiple myeloma is broad.

**Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS)**

- Serum monoclonal protein less than 3 g/dl

- Clonal bone marrow plasma cells less than 10%

- No end-organ damage

**Smoldering Multiple Myeloma**

- Monoclonal protein is greater than or equal to 3 g/dl

- Clonal bone marrow plasma cells between 10% to 59%

- No end-organ damage

**Solitary Plasmacytoma**

- Solitary lesion made up of clonal plasma cells

- Normal bone marrow

- Negative imaging outside of the single lesion

- No end-organ damage

**Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia**

- Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma noted in the bone marrow

- The type of M protein is IgM which is very unusual in MM.

- Presence of MYD88 L265P

- Symptoms include hyperviscosity, peripheral neuropathy, anemia, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly

**AL Amyloidosis**

- Caused by deposition of amyloid fibrils or non-fibrillar material resulting in heart failure, hepatomegaly, and/or nephrotic syndrome

- Less than 20% plasma cells in the bone marrow and lack of lytic lesions

- Congo-red staining on bone marrow or affected tissue
