Humans are warm-blooded animals which means we can alter our metabolism to maintain equal heat production and heat loss; this is clinically significant because all organ systems depend on a stable core body temperature to operate well on a cellular level. At extremes of temperature, enzyme efficiency and diffusion capacity decrease which reduces cellular energy availability and membrane ion fluxes that drive cellular activity. Clinically this manifests as a reduced level of consciousness and behavioral disorganization.

Environmental and hormonal influences exist that cause less extreme temperature variation such as circadian rhythm causing diurnal variation with the lowest temperature being between 3:00 and 6:00 AM and peak temperature 12 hours later. Children have a greater diurnal variation than adults.
