Hypotonia is an easily recognizable entity but determining the etiology is a challenging task for a clinician given its vast differential. Systematically approaching the case can help determine the underlying etiology, which is crucial for further management and prognosis of the disease. Having a multidisciplinary approach in the management of these patients has been found to have overall better outcomes. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of hypotonia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of hypotonia.
- Describe the differential diagnosis of hypotonia. 
- Explain the common physical exam findings associated with hypotonia. 
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the care of patients with hypotonia.
