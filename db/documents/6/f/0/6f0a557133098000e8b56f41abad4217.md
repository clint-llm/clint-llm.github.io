Since DM is a complex disease, it requires an interprofessional approach to management. Nurses can be critical to ensuring proper patient follow-ups and monitoring the efficacy of treatments.

Many diabetic educators are nurses who have extensive additional training in DM education and have more time for individualized education. Patient education of the disease and appropriate treatment is key to adequate management.

Nurses also play a critical role in the acute care of DM, especially aiding the hospital team in the identification and treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome in home and hospital settings, which are life-threatening complications of DM.
