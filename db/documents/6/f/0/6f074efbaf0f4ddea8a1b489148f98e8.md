Several theories have been proposed to account for CCF formation.

- Direct CCFs are believed to occur secondary to a traumatic tear in the artery from a skull base fracture (see illustration), from the acceleration-deceleration force of a traumatic injury, or from an iatrogenic injury following an endovascular intervention or a trans-sphenoidal procedure. They can also occur spontaneously following an ICA aneurysm rupture or weakening of the arteries from a genetic condition.

- Indirect CCFs result from rupture of the dural branches of the carotid artery weakened by a defect such as a genetic condition or comorbiditiesÂ including hypertension. An alternative theory suggests that an increase in cavernous sinus pressure such as that which follows thrombosis increases the risk of the tear of the dural arteries.
