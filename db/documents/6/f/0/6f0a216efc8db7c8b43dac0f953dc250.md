Treatment of steatorrhea depends on the underlying conditions which cause steatorrhea.

- In patients with EPI, pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) is the cornerstone of treatment.

- Along with PERT, patients with EPI should receive normal to a high-fat diet and fat-soluble vitamin supplementation.

- In patients with SIBO, an empiric trial of antibiotics is recommended. In many institutions, rifaximin is preferable to other antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, norfloxacin, doxycycline, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.

- In patients with celiac disease, diet-centered recommendations include a strict life-long gluten-free diet, education about the disease, management of nutritional deficiencies, access to an advocacy group, and consultation with a skilled dietitian.

- Ursodeoxycholic acid is the first-line treatment of choice for PBC.

- Even though ursodeoxycholic acid is often used in PSC, medical therapy is not effective in curtailing the disease progression. ERCP with stent dilatation is useful for symptomatic improvement in biliary ductal strictures in large intrahepatic or extrahepatic ducts.
