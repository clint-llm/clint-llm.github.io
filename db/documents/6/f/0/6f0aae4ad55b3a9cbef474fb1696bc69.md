The exact incidence of paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) is unknown. It is much less common than pemphigus vulgaris or pemphigus foliaceus, comprising only 3 to 5% of all pemphigus cases.

Paraneoplastic pemphigus typically develops in adults 45 to 70 years old.

In a study of 496 patients with internal malignancy, 25 of these patients developed pemphigus (5%). The mean age of PNP patients was 64.7 years and PNP development correlated with increasing age.
