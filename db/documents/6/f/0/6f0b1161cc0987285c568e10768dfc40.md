The interprofessional healthcare team, including clinicians, mid-level practitioners, nurses, mental health specialists, and pharmacists, should keep major depressive disorder in their differential when dealing with patients who may present with depressed mood, anhedonia, feelings of guilt, worthlessness, insomnia, and suicidality. Endocrine abnormalities, along with substance abuse, may also cause these symptoms. After ruling out substance misuse and other factors, only then should a psychiatric diagnosis of MDD should be made. It is now common to treat this disease with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Providers need to assess all the medications being taken by the patient to prevent drug interactions with desvenlafaxine, especially those with decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or hepatic impairment.

With interprofessional care coordination and open information sharing, treating MDD with an SNRI like desvenlafaxine (or other agents in the antidepressant class) can be accomplished with greater therapeutic effectiveness and fewer adverse events and drug interactions. [Level 5]
