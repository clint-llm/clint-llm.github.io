Diagnosis usually confirmed by radiological imaging showing free intraperitoneal air. Another reported suggestive sign is the lack of an air-fluid level in the stomach in a horizontal beam view and a relative paucity of gas in the distal bowel.

**Imaging**

The diagnostic approach in patients with abdominal pain starts with plain films. The sensitivity of plain films for detecting extraluminal free air ranges from 50% to 70%. Ultrasound (US) has also been studied and showsÂ excellent potential for identifying pneumoperitoneum. The most useful imaging modality is a CT scan that is highly sensitive and specific for free air.

**CT Findings for Perforation**

Pneumoperitoneum

- Mesenteric air

- Discontinuity of the hollow viscus wall

- Extraluminal enteric contrast

- Free intraabdominal fluid

- Extravasated intravenous contrast

- Bowel wall thickening or edema

- Mesenteric hematoma.

In complex cases, one may need to perform a diagnostic laparoscopy to determine the cause and obtain and fluid for culture and biochemistry.
