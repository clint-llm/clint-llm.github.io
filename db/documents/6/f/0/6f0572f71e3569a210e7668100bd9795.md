Interprofessional teams play a vital role in providing exceptional breast care and communicating mammographic results. At the center of the group are the radiology technologists. These professionals play a crucial role by serving as problem-solvers in obtaining not only technically adequate but optimal mammographic images. Useful diagnostic information can be obtained from the patient during mammographic image acquisition and correlated to image findings. Close-knit communication between radiology technologists and diagnostic radiologists is essential for quality assurance and contextual understanding.
