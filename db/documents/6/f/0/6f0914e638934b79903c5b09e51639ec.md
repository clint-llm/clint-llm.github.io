During the fourth and fifth weeks of embryological development, the aortic arches begin to form in parallel with the branchial arches and then ultimately develop into the arteries of the face, neck, and chest. The third aortic arch develops into the common carotid artery, which will branch into the external and internal carotid arteries.
