The complications associated with the management of esotropia are related to loss of binocularity, chances of amblyopia, issues with compliance with treatment, and long-term follow-ups. Apart from these, these children are highly likely to lose confidence because of cosmetic concerns, developing antisocial behaviors, and underperforming in schools.

Complications associated with surgical intervention include residual esotropia, consecutive exotropia, infection, suture-related granuloma, anterior segment ischemia, slipped or lost muscle, or an oculocardiac reflex. Apart from these, the risk of general anesthesia-related complications needs to be borne in mind before planning any surgical intervention in these cases.
