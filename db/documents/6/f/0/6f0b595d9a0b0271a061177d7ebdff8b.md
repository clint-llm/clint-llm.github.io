Other injuries and disease processes that cause hip pain must be considered as a differential diagnosis. Pain caused by a chronically arthritic hip can be exacerbated by trauma in the absence of an acute fracture. Acute hip dislocation may also present with similar symptoms of pain, deformity, and reduced mobility. Pelvic fractures must be considered, and an x-ray of the pelvis, as well as the hip, is recommended. Injuries to the spine, femoral shaft, and knee can all present with hip pain, and a thorough examination is required to identify the site of injury. In the absence of trauma or fracture, then other causes for hip pain must be considered, including malignancy and infection.
