Surfactant, especiallyÂ as a drug administered to neonates, must be carefully monitored when given. Whether the drug administration is a bolus or in aliquots, monitoring the endotracheal tubing for obstruction is as essential as administering the drug itself. Because of the risks accompanying such procedures, it is vital to determine the definite necessity of this drug. Lung ultrasonography (LUS) scoring is a bedside technique useful for diagnosing respiratory problems in neonates and has become a tool to monitor lung function and guide surfactant therapy.

The LUS score is an excellent indicator of oxygenation status. It thus can predict the need to administer surfactant in both term and pre-term babies (those with gestational ages of less than 34 weeks) on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). This approach is particularly useful in severe surfactant deficiency; continuous positive airway pressure can fail, and such failure may pose a risk of lung injury.
