What does it take to prove defamation in court?

While many people say or write things about others, in most cases, these comments are opinions and not defamatory statements. Three key features that must be proven in court to win a case of defamation includeÂ the following:

- What does the communication itself convey to the public? Does it tarnish or damage the reputation of the individual concerned? A verbal or written statement can sometimes be deemed to be defamatory even if the author has no intention of defaming another person.

- Does the communication lack any justification? If the communication is outright false, then it can be considered defamatory.

- Where is the communication published? In most cases of defamation, the communication must be published in a public forum or conveyed as a message to a third party. Today the most common method of defamation is via social media.
