FHH patients are usually asymptomatic or have few symptoms associated with hypercalcemia, proba­bly due to its very mild nature. The usual symptoms are fatigue, weakness, constipation, polyuria, polydipsia, renal insufficiency, or a headache. Other symptoms include chondrocalcinosis or mental problems. Occasionally, patients have pancreatitis. An abnormally functioning CaSR might cause intra­ductal calcification and increased risk of pancreatitis. There is no increased incidence of fractures in FHH. FHH does not protect against age-related bone loss.
