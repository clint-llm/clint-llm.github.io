Evaluation of bone conduction is useful as a component of audiometry in a variety of patient populations and clinical settings. Screening for hearing loss using audiometry in preschool and school-age children is an accurate and beneficial tool for guiding early diagnosis and intervention.

Age-related hearing loss is significantly associated with cognitive impairment and dementia in adults.

More broadly, due to the association of hearing loss with increased levels of disease burden and hospitalization in older adults, PTA with AC and BC evaluation can provide clinically relevant information for improving patient outcomes.
