With advancing medical technology, babies are more viable at fewer weeks of gestation than ever before — immature hearts transitioning to newborn circulation has-life long effects. Adults born preterm were studied and found to have increased cardiac muscle mass, reduced chamber length, and impaired function. These impairments are more profound in those born profoundly premature; they were found to have 50% more ventricular cardiac muscle mass than those born at term. These patients are at increased risk of ischemic heart disease and heart failure.
