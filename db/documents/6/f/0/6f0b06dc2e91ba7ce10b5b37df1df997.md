The appendicular skeleton is clinically relevant in many areas of medicine. External forces applied to the appendicular skeleton from traumas can lead to fractured bones. In the upper limb, the most common fracture is a distal radius and ulna fracture. The second most common fracture site is the phalanges and metacarpals of the hand.

Bones of the appendicular skeleton can also be a primary site for malignancy, such as multiple myeloma or osteosarcoma.
