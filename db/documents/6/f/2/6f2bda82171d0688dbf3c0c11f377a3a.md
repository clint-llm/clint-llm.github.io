**Clinical Presentation**

The clinical presentation of a patient presenting with posterior shoulder instability can be variable and difficult to recognize as symptoms and exam findings are often nonspecific and subtle. Adding to the complexity is that most of these patients are young and involved with athletics. There may be concomitant shoulder pathology such as impingement syndrome.

**Physical Exam**

A thorough physical exam is necessary as the clinical entity may not be apparent in history alone. Findings canÂ be subtle, and both shoulders should be fully examined to detect any side-to-side differences. An examination should include inspection, palpation, range-of-motion (ROM), strength testing, neurovascular tests, as well as provocative maneuvers. Typically, ROM, strength testing and neurovascular examination will be normal in patients with posterior shoulder instability.

Examination maneuvers specific to posterior shoulder instability include the jerk test, Kim test, posterior drawer, and the load-and-shift test.

The Kim test was first reported in the literature by Kim et al. as a means to detect posteroinferior lesions of the labrum.
