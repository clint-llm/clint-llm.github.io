Necrotizing fasciitis is a subset of aggressive skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) that cause necrosis of the muscle fascia and subcutaneous tissues. This infection typically travels along the fascial plane, which has a poor blood supply, leaving the overlying tissues initially unaffected, potentially delaying diagnosis and surgical intervention. The infectious process can rapidly spread, causing infection of the fascia, peri-fascial planes and causing a secondary infection of the overlying and underlying skin, soft tissue, and muscle.

Necrotizing fasciitis can occur post-surgery, any invasive procedure, or even a minor procedure like phlebotomy. The causative bacteria are usually mixed but do produce gas.
