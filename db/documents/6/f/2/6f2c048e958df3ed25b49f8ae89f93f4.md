Clobazam administration is oral, and there are three available formulations: oral tablets (10 mg, 20 mg), oral suspension (2.5 mg/ml), and newly developed oral films (5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg).

The FDA recommended initial dosing for adults (greater than 30 kg bodyweight) is 10 mg/day divided into twice daily, which is titrated after one week to 20 mg/day and maintained at 40 mg/day by the second week. For children (under 30 kg body weight), the dosing initiation, titration, and maintenance is half of the adult dosing schedule. The dose escalation should proceed more slowly in the geriatric population, known CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, and in those with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, in which the dose-escalation reduces by half of the recommended titration dosing schedule.

Clobazam undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver to N-desmethylclobazam (N-CLB), which is the active and significant circulating metabolite. N-CLB plasma concentration is 3.5 times higher than clobazam. It is rapidly absorbed with a bioavailability of 87% and has T-max (time to reach maximum concentration) in 0.5 to 4 hours. It exhibits 80 to 90% protein binding, and the elimination half-life is 36 to 42 hours, while the active metabolite N-CLB has a prolonged half-life of 71 to 82 hours. It gets excreted in urine (approximately 82%) and feces (approximately 11%), with 3% excreted unchanged.
