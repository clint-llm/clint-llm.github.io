The chemoreceptor trigger zone in the AP plays a crucial role in emesis and is one of four principal areas that can induce emesis. The other sites besides the CTZ that relay information to the vomiting center to induce emesis include the GI tract, the vestibular system, and the higher centers in the cortex and thalamus.

Vomiting triggered by the CTZ begins when its receptors detect emetogenic toxins in the blood and CSF and relay this information to the neighboring nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). Abdominal vagal afferents that identify potentially emetogenic substances in the lumen also terminate here.
