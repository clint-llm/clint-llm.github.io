However, along with treatment of the underlying disorder, apraxia can be managed with targeted rehabilitation with occupational therapy, speech therapy, and physical therapy.

Rehabilitation using multiple strategies as enumerated by Buxbaum et al. after a review of the literature (Table 2).

Newer technologies like transcranial magnetic stimulation can be beneficial in patients with apraxia.
