Plasma cell neoplasms (PCN) is a group of mature B-cell disorders that result from an abnormal generation of cloned plasma cells that produce monoclonal, heavy-chain, class-switched immunoglobulin referred to as paraprotein or M-protein. According to the WHO classification in 2017, this class of neoplasms includesÂ non-IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), plasmacytoma, monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition diseases and plasma cell myeloma (PCM) and plasma cell neoplasms with the associated paraneoplastic syndrome (table 1)
