Giant cell arteritis, formerly known as temporal arteritis, is an inflammatory vasculopathy that affects medium- and large-sized arteries, with a predilection for branches of the carotid artery. The disease process is not limited to the temporal artery. Symptoms of giant cell arteritis include temporal headaches and tenderness, scalp pain, jaw claudication, and visual changes that may ultimately result in permanent blindness. Prompt diagnosis and management are essential in preventing significant morbidity. Biopsy of the superficial temporal artery is currently the gold standard for diagnosing giant cell arteritis. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and techniques for performing a temporal artery biopsy. It highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Delineate the signs and symptoms of giant cell arteritis that may warrant a temporal artery biopsy.
- Implement best practices when performing a temporal artery biopsy.
- Identify the potential complications of a temporal artery biopsy.
- Apply efficient and effective interprofessional team strategies that enhance communication and coordination of care to improve outcomes and reduce morbidity for patients undergoing a temporal artery biopsy.
