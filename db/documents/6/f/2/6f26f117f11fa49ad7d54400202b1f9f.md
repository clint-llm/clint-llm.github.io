Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a complex use of controlled magnetic field interactions on imaging subjects that is more sensitive than any other imaging modality at delineating soft tissue structures and properties. MRI characterizes normal from abnormal soft tissues based on the expected signal intensity of the particular anatomic structure after interactions with the magnetic field. The contrast between ligaments, tendons, fat, and muscle on MRI is much better appreciated than on CT imaging and nearly imperceptible on plain film imaging.

Additionally, there is no ionizing radiation used to acquire MRI images, avoiding a potential increase in lifetime risk for cancer. Finally, some angiographic information is available with MRI imaging using intravascular contrast agents or time of flight techniques.

Despite the obvious superiority of soft tissue characterization over other imaging modalities, there are also disadvantages to MRI, and it should not be used as a primary diagnostic tool. Again, physical exams and plain film evaluation are useful in developing the next best step in the diagnostic pursuit and provide complementary information.

One disadvantage is the expense of the imaging equipment and the associated increased expense to the patient.

Another reason MRI may not be best for every situation may be patient-induced limitations, such as claustrophobia. MRI imaging takes longer than other modalities, and the small bore of the magnet can be an unpleasant, if not impossible, task for some patients. Another unfortunate limiting factor includes a patient's physical ability, or lack thereof, to properly position and maintains the wrist within the scanning field. Those with limited shoulder movement, obesity, and spinal problems will likely have more difficulty lying down and extending their wrist over their heads into the bore of the magnet.

Since the core of MRI is the use of magnets, retained or surgically implanted ferromagnetic objects are likely an absolute contraindication or may be conditional with strict imaging parameters established by the manufacturer. The magnetic field can also have an adverse effect on certain older cardiac pacemakers and programmable ventriculoperitoneal shunts. These devices may require placement in a disabled or MRI-compatible mode by a trained person such as a manufacturer representative. Metallic artifacts from retain or implanted metal can interfere with the diagnostic quality of the imaging.

Examples of appropriate uses of MRI for wrist pathology may include:

- Occult fracture

- Stress fracture

- Edema in bone and soft tissues

- Inflammatory arthropathy

- Assessment of cartilage

- Carpal tunnel syndrome

- Bone lesion characterization (osseous and soft tissue neoplasms)

- Tendon pathology (tendinosis, tear, subluxation, tenosynovitis)

- Bursitis

- Intersection syndrome

- Muscle tear

- TFCC injury (sensitivity increased when paired with arthrogram injection technique)

- Non-osseous coalition

- Avascular necrosis, Kienb√∂ck disease

- Osteomyelitis and infection
