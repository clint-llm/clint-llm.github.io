**Pharmacokinetics**

Onset

- Fourteen days (based on first improvements of Sandoz Clinical Assessment Geriatric [SCAG] scores compared to placebo)

Time to peak concentrations

- Three to 7 hours for oral immediate-release

- Nine to 12 hours for oral extended-release

Absorption

- 100% (oral administration) with 100% bioavailability

- Effects of food: immediate-release: no effect; extended-release: shown to decrease Tmax by 7 hours with no effect on AUC or Cmax

Distribution

- Volume of Distribution: 9 to 11 L/kg

- Sites:

- Protein-bound: 45%

- Brain: High concentration

- Kidney: High concentration

- Liver: Low concentration

- Lung: High concentration

Metabolism

- Sites: Liver (partial): Hepatic CYP450 enzyme system does not play a significant role

- Metabolites: All have minimal NMDA-receptor antagonist activity- N-glucuronide conjugate, 6-hydroxy memantine, and 1-nitroso-deaminated memantine

Excretion

- Site: Renal 48% to 50% unchanged parent drug in urine involving active tubular secretion moderated by pH-dependent tubular reabsorption (reduced excretion by alkaline urine pH)

Time to Peak Concentrations

- Three to seven hours for immediate-release

- Nine to twelve hours for extended-release

Terminal Elimination Half-Life

- Sixty to 80 hours
