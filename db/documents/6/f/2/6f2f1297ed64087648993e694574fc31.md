Groove pancreatitis is a unique clinical condition. It is defined as chronic segmental pancreatitis involving the duodenum and pancreas.

The term cystic dystrophy of the heterotopic pancreas or duodenal dystrophy was first reported by French authors, Potet and Duclert in 1970.

Pathogenesis involves fibrosis in the anatomical region in the para-duodenal tunnel, leading to altered pancreatic secretions and pancreatitis.
