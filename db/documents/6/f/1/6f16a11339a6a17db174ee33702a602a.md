Often, patient selection is the most challenging aspect of the decision to offer neurostimulation. Numerous patient factors are, at first, seemingly unrelated to patient response to treatment but play a significant role in the likelihood of a positive response to therapy. Many of these are social factors. Any implantable device will require adequate follow-up, re-programming, wound management, and sometimes wireless recharging of the device. Ultimately, SCS requires the patient's active participation in their care and ownership of the responsibilities involved in the continuous management of their pain syndrome.

Apart from social factors, one of the strongest correlations to success is complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Additionally, a response to sympathetic nerve block may correlate positively with stimulation therapy.

Factors that do not seem to positively or negatively correlate with SCS therapy include patient age, duration, intensity, and laterality of pain.
