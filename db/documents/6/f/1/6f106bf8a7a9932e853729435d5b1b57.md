Hearing loss is the impairment of auditory function, which can have significant long-term consequences on social and language development. It can develop prelingually (before the acquisition of speech/language) or post-lingually (after the acquisition of speech/language). Genetic hearing loss can have significant impacts on social development. They present prelingually or postlingually and can be inherited via many mechanisms. To avoid the long-term consequences of this condition, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of genetic hearing loss and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the typical presentation and physical examination of patients with genetic hearing loss.
- Summarize the different inheritance patterns of genetic hearing loss.
- Outline the diagnostic testing to assess for genetic hearing loss.
- DIscuss the treatment pathway for children found to have hearing loss.
