Ludwig angina is an uncommon life-threatening diffuse cellulitis of the soft tissue of the floor of the mouth and neck. The condition is named after a German physician, Wilhelm Friedrich von Ludwig, who described it in 1836. Angina comes from the Latin "angere," meaning to choke.

Ludwig angina involves 3 compartments of the floor of the mouth: sublingual, submental, and submandibular. Infection of the lower molars is the hallmark cause of true Ludwig angina; however, this term is frequently applied to any floor-of-the-mouth infection with sublingual or submandibular space involvement.
