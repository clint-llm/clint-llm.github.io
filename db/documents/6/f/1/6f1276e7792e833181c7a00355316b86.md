The duochrome or bichrome test is a refractive method used in refining the spherical endpoint. In routine clinical practice, it is usually performed at the end of the initial maximum-plus-to-maximum-visual acuity (MPMVA). It is also performed after the initialÂ objective and subjective refraction have been achieved. The duochrome test can help achieve the best refractive visual acuity during subjective refraction.

In emmetropia, the optical apparatus of the visual system refracts light rays so that an object's clear, comfortable image at infinity is obtained with active accommodation. In certain instances, however, these optical apparatuses fail to accurately bend light rays incident via the entrance pupil correctly, leading to refractive errors.

During refractive procedures, the duochrome test is indicated for several reasons, which include:

- Balancing accommodation: The equalization of an accommodative response is an essential aspect of the final refractive procedure, which is usually done by equalizing the visual acuity in both eyes.

- Obtaining the best spherical equivalent: The duochrome test can determine the best spherical equivalent for a given ametropia.

- Screening to determine the type of refractive error: The duochrome test can be used as a general subjective screening tool to assess if the is myopic, hypermetropic, or emmetropic.
