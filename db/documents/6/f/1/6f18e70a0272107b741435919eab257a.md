Synovial chondromatosis can be a self-limiting disease. So,Â conservative management can work for some patients. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), modification of activities, and cryotherapy might be considered.

**Surgical Management**

**The Necessity of Synovectomy is Controversial**

Synovectomy for a synovium-based pathology sounds to be the primary indicated management. However, there is no strong evidence in favor of this option, along with surgical removal of the loose bodies.

In other studies, synovectomy was supported as a means of preventing recurrence.

Additionally, whether to perform the synovectomy arthroscopically or through an open approach is controversial. Open synovectomy offers better visualization of the joint surfaces. Whereas arthroscopic management has lower morbidity, quicker return to function, short hospital stay, reduced postoperative pain, and quicker rehabilitation.

Secondary synovial chondromatosis is managed by anti-inflammatory medication with the additional management of the inflammatory joint symptoms until or unless mechanical symptoms prohibit adequate function. At this point, surgical management is indicated. Surgical management should address improving long-term function and prognoses. As such, joint reconstruction or arthroplasty, in addition to removing loose bodies, is indicated.
