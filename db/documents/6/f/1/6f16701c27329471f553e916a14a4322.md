Important historical elements to note are a family history of hearing loss, ocular abnormalities, and congenital heart disease. Other important information to obtain includes a prenatal history including TORCH infections, gestational diabetes, hypothyroidism as well as maternal drug, alcohol, and tobacco use during pregnancy.

A full head and neck exam should be performed, taking note of any of the following abnormalities: microtia, aural atresia, periauricular skin tags, anterior cervical pits, ocular abnormalities (visual acuity, color of eyes and intercanthal distance), cleft lip or palate, abnormal skull size or asymmetry, excessive or missing digits, and areas of hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation including cafe au lait spots. Otoscopy may be normal, but the presence of middle ear fluid should be noted.
