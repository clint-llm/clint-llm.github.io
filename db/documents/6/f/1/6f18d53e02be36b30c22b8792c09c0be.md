When a patient presents with bupropion toxicity, it requires the prompt evaluation and management of the healthcare team. This team includes nursing, the emergency physician, Â toxicology/ poison center, and critical care. The collaborative effort from these teams can properly triage patients and appropriately manage patients. Patients in the emergency department should have the following:

- Vital signs recorded

- Electrocardiogram

- For guidance and epidemiology, consult with a regional poison center

- Consult Toxicology for help with clinical management

Patients with bupropion toxicity will require observation. Intentional overdoses will require psychiatric evaluation after medical clearance. Risk reduction strategies should be employed to manage unintentional overdoses, including patient education, keeping medications in a safe location, and ensuring patients can manage their medications.
