Histologic, genetic, and pathologic features of tumors guide them to metastasize to specific sites.

Tumors spread to the lungs either by hematogenous or lymphatic route or by direct invasion.

- Hematogenous spread: seen in tumors with venous drainage into lungs, e.g., head and neck, thyroid, adrenals, kidneys, testes, melanoma, and osteosarcoma.

- Lymphatic spread: occurred in two ways: either antegrade lymphatic invasion through the diaphragm and/or pleural surfaces or by retrograde lymphatic spread from hilar nodal metastases. Examples include lung, stomach, breast, pancreas, uterus, rectum, and prostate cancer.

- Direct spread to pleura: occurs due to hematogenous dissemination with extension to the pleura, with lymphatic spread, or from established hepatic metastases. Examples include cancers of the lung, breast, pancreas, and stomach.

Multiple lung nodules in the setting of the primary tumor are highly suspicious of metastatic lung ca, however solitary nodules in the presence of primary tumors can be metastatic (melanoma, sarcoma), or it can primary lung tumor.
