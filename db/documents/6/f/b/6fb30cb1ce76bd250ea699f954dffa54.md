Optic nerve drusen are refractive, calcified nodules located within the optic nerve head. Optic nerve drusen can be mistaken for unilateral or bilateral disc edema and are often a source of diagnostic confusion. Although typically benign entities, optic nerve drusen can cause visual field defects and are associated with conditions that cause vision loss, such as central retinal artery occlusion and ischemic optic neuropathy. It is crucial to appropriately work up and follow this condition to establish a clear diagnosis of optic nerve drusen. This activity reviews the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of optic nerve drusen and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in following patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of optic nerve drusen.
- Summarize the epidemiology of optic nerve drusen.
- Outline the typical exam findings of a patient with optic nerve drusen.
- Identify the diagnostic modalities necessary to diagnose optic nerve drusen.
