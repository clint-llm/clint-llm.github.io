Follow-up is vital to ensure that the therapy has been successful. Patients at risk for recurrence should be prescribed one or more of the oral agents that have been identified as helpful in controlling recurrences. The most commonly used include bicalutamide, finasteride, sildenafil, baclofen, gabapentin, hydroxyurea (sickle cell only patients), phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine, and IM leuprolide either alone or in some combination.
