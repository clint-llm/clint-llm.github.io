A patient with pleural effusion can be asymptomatic or can present with exertional breathlessness depending on the impairment of thoracic excursion. Patient with active pleural inflammation called pleurisy complains of sharp, severe, localized crescendo/ decrescendo pain with breathing or a cough. When the effusion develops, pain can subside, falsely implying an improvement in condition. Constant pain is also a hallmark of malignant diseases like mesothelioma. Depending on the cause of effusion, the patient can also complain of a cough, fever, and systemic symptoms.

The physical examination can be subtle. In large effusion, there will be the fullness of intercostal spaces and dullness on percussion on that side. Auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds and decreased tactile and vocal fremitus. Egophony is most pronounced at the superior aspect of the effusion.

Pleural rubs, often mistaken for coarse crackles, can be heard during active pleurisy without any effusion.

As pleural effusion is the result of varied diseases, history and physical examination should also be focused on the underlying pulmonary or systemic cause of the effusion. For example, in congestive heart failure (CHF), examine for jugular venous distension, S3, and pedal edema; in cirrhosis leading to hepatic hydrothorax, look for ascites and other stigmata of liver disease.
