There are other diseases that need exclusion when diagnosing HIV. These include malnutrition, lymphadenopathy, pediatric chronic anemia, malabsorption syndrome, constitutional growth delay, autoimmune and chronic benign neutropenia, and other immunodeficiencies. Furthermore, the clinician should also look for other congenital co-infections, including syphilis, TORCH infections (Toxoplasmosis, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus), hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or tuberculosis infection.
