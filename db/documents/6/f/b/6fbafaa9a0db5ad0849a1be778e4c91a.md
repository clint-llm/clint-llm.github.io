Obesity hypoventilation syndrome often remains undiagnosed until late in the disease. Early recognition is essential, as these patients have significant morbidity and mortality. Acute hypercapnic respiratory failure due to obesity hypoventilation syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion; once there is clinical suspicion, other differentials must be excluded to ensure a correct diagnosis, which will dictate the management. The discussion of differential diagnoses is in subsequent sections.

- Hypercapnia: A sensitive screening test for chronic hypercapnia is an elevated serum bicarbonate level (greater than 27 mEq/L), and almost all patients with OHS have elevated bicarbonate. However, this is not a specific test, and elevation can occur in several other diagnoses, including vomiting, dehydration, medications, etc. Arterial blood gas (ABG) is a more definitive test for alveolar hypoventilation and defines hypercapnia as the partial pressure of arterial CO2 (PaCO2) greater than 45 mmHg.

- Hypoxemia: Hypoxemia during wakefulness is not common in OSA alone and requires confirmation by an ABG showing PaO<70 mmHg.Hypoxia can be measured noninvasively through pulse oximetry. Another tool used in evaluating OSA and OHS is the polysomnogram.

- Complete blood count: Polycythemia due to chronic hypoventilation and hypoxia may be present. Blood tests can rule out secondary causes of erythrocytosis and other mimicking diagnoses like hypothyroidism.

- Pulmonary function testing (PFT) and imaging: If hypercapnia is confirmed, other causes should be ruled out with PFTs and chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan as clinically indicated. The PFT results in OHS can reveal a moderate restrictive defect without evidence of airway obstruction, but it may also be normal.

- Sleep study: Polysomnography with continuous nocturnal CO2 monitoring is the gold standard for evaluating OHS. In addition, the oxygen nadir and percent time spent below O2 saturation (SpO2) of 90% (T90) help suspect OHS.

- Cardiac studies: Electrocardiogram (EKG) and echocardiogram help assess right heart enlargement and failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension that develops late in OHS.
