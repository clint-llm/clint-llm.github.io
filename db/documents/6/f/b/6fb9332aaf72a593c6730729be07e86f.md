The maintenance of iron homeostasis occurs via a balance of absorption and iron losses. Absorption in the small intestine is the primary regulating factor of iron content in the body. Iron is absorbed in divalent form by enterocytes via the divalent metal transporter (DMT1). Once absorbed, it is sequestered in ferritin if body stores are adequate. If iron levels are low, iron is bound to transferrin by ferroportin. Once loaded on to transferrin, iron is transported to cells for metabolism. Hepcidin is a peptide that inhibits ferroportin and decreases the absorption of iron into circulation.

Iron enters cells after transferrin binds to the transferrin receptor (TfR). Iron levels are further controlled by iron-regulatory proteins 1 and 2(IRP1 and IRP2), which optimize cellular iron availability by upregulating the expression of multiple genes.

Iron deficiency occurs in three stages. In the pre-latent stage, iron stores are low or absent, but serum iron concentration is normal. In the latent stage, transferrin saturation and serum iron become reduced in addition to low ferritin. The last stage is marked by a drop in hemoglobin along with depletion of iron stores and a reduction in serum iron and transferrin saturation.
