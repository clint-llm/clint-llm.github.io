Tuberculosis prognosis is variable as it could be a multi-system disease and is affectedÂ by many factors. Patient characteristics such as age, immune status, comorbidities, time of treatment initiation, and compliance have a significant impact on the outcome. In general, treatment is successful in about 85% of cases. The World Health Organization estimates the mortality rate to be at 15 percent.
