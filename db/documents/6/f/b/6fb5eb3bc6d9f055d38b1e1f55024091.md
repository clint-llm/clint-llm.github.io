According to ACOG, at least 40% of women do not seek postpartum care. Several factors contribute towards this trend, such as cultural differences, lack of insurance, lack of adequate family support, low socioeconomic status, poor anticipatory guidance, race, lack of good transitional care management, and poor access to home visits. According to the Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System (PMSS), Nonhispanic blacks have the highest maternal mortality.

During the first week of the postnatal period, severe hypertension, severe bleeding, and infection are the most common contributors to maternal deaths, while the cardiovascular cause is the leading cause of late deaths.
