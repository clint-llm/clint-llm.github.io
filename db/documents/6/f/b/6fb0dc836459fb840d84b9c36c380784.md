The MCL works with the medial flexor musculature to resist valgus stress. Medial flexor musculature includes the flexor carpi ulnaris, flexor carpi radialis, flexor digitorum superficialis, and pronator teres. The LCL works with the extensor forearm musculature to resist varus forces. The extensor muscles include the extensor carpi ulnaris, extensor digitorum communis, extensor carpi radialis brevis and longus, and the anconeus. The anconeus is of significant importance because it provides major dynamic constraint to posterolateral rotatory instability and varus stresses, two functions that are also provided by the LCL.
