The main cornerstone of management of Cheyne-Stokes respiration is optimizing the treatment for the trigger factor, congestive heart failure (CHF), or stroke. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends that positive airway pressure should be considered for all patients with central sleep apnea. The two main modalities of noninvasive treatment for Cheyne-Stokes respiration are continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV).

CPAP delivers continuous positive pressure and has several mechanisms of action. The positive pressure keeps the upper airway splinted during the central apnea, leading to the stabilization of respiratory drives and improvement in oxygenation and ejection fraction. The positive pressure will also reduce the preload by reducing the venous blood flow to the right atrium and afterload by increasing the intrathoracic pressure, thereby improving the ejection fraction. In a clinical trial, CPAP therapy in patients with Cheyne-Stokes respiration showed improvement in nocturnal desaturation, Left ventricular function, and six-minute walk distance, but there was no improvement in survival.

Adaptive servo-ventilation is the newer modality of non-invasive treatment, which is effective and well-tolerated by patients. This mode of noninvasive ventilation can counteract hyperventilation during the hyperpnea phase and prevent hypoventilation during the apnea phase. It delivers constant continuous pressure and can recognize apnea or hypopnea and adjust pressure support with backup ventilation if needed to deliver preset tidal volume. During the hyperventilation phase, the pressure support is reduced, depending on the patient to prevent large tidal volume. Adaptive servo-ventilation is more effective than conventional noninvasive ventilation therapies like continuous positive airway pressure and bilevel positive airway pressure therapy and has been shown to improve the functional class, cardiac functions, exercise capacity, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. However, in a recent large clinical trial involving patients with systolic heart failure and Cheyne-Stokes respiration breathing, the addition of adaptive servo-ventilation to guideline-based medical therapy did not improve outcomes and increased the risk of cardiovascular death.

There are a few case reports of Theophylline being administered in fatal Cheyne-Stokes respiration with some favorable response. But this drug has to be considered with extreme precautions and is not a permanent solution.
