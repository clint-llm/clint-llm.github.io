Tunneled CVCs with a subcutaneous port require cannulation of the IJ or SC veins. Because the catheter and port are entirely under the skin, they can be left in place for months with proper handling and care. They allow patients to live normal lives, including swimming and bathing, without concern for damage to the catheter or infection. It is most commonly used for infusion of medication, transfusion of fluids and parental nutrition, and long-term venous access in those with poor peripheral access.

Tunneled CVCs without a subcutaneous port are externalized through a separate skin incision a distance from the venous cannulation site. They are used most frequently for hemodialysis (HD) with higher prevalence in those of advanced age at initiation of HD, those with comorbid vascular disease, those awaiting arteriovenous fistula (AVF) maturation, those scheduled for living donor renal transplant, and those that have not decided between HD and peritoneal dialysis.
