The evaluation of patients with essential thrombocytosis includes getting a complete blood count, a bone marrow biopsy and genetic testing to evaluate for gene mutations. Platelet count should be more than 450000. The bone marrow biopsy should show evidence of increased proliferation of the megakaryocytic cell lines with increased numbers of enlarged, matured megakaryocytes. Because the symptoms of myeloproliferative neoplasms overlap, it is important to also rule out other causes of thrombocytosis, including clonal and reactive causes, before reaching a definite diagnosis of essential thrombocytosis.

It is helpful to recognize which genetic mutation a patient has whether it is JAK2, CALR or MPL because each of these mutations determines the clinical features, complications, and survival of myeloproliferative neoplasm.
