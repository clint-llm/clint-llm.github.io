Patients and parents should be educated about the importance of follow-up to monitor for disease progression. They should also be strongly encouraged to be compliant with medication, both for UTI prophylaxis and the management of HTN. Patients with a history of VUR should be made aware of the possibility of their offspring having it as well.
