**CS (o-chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile)**

CS has been an object of study in multiple animal studies. Systemic absorption of CS is primarily through the respiratory tract. After exposure to radiolabeled CS in rats, the tracer was seen mainly in the gastrointestinal tract, urinary bladder, mouth, and esophagus at one-hour post-exposure. By 24 hours, most of the residual radioactivity presented at the mouth, salivary glands, gastrointestinal tract, and urinary bladder.

**CN (chloroacetophenone)**

There is very little data on the kinetics of CN. The metabolism of CN has not received thorough study. Though it is known that CN is eventually converted to an electrophilic metabolite. It can act as an SN2 alkylating agent and will react with the SH groups and nucleophilic sites of macromolecules, which can result in the disruption of cellular processes.

**OC (Oleoresin Capsicum)**

The gastrointestinal tract readily absorbs capsaicin. Intravenous infusion of capsaicin in animals resulted in rapid central nervous system uptake. Subcutaneous administration resulted in a slow diffusion from the site of administration. Metabolism of capsaicin occurs mostly within the liver, with a small contribution by the kidney, lungs, and small intestine.
