The treatment protocols vary from the time of conception until birth.

**Preconception Management and Counseling**

Counseling should be tailored according to the needs and HIV status of partners wishing to conceive. According to the CDC guidelines, in serodiscordant couples, where the partner with HIV is on ART and has an undetectable viral load, unprotected sexual intercourse is associated with no risk of sexual transmission of HIV.

In serodiscordant couples wishing to conceive where viral suppression status is unknown, or it has not been successfully attained, the partner without HIV can be given pre-exposure prophylaxis, and unprotected sexual intercourse can be limited to peak fertility period in each cycle. This is done to limit the sexual transmission of HIV.

Starting ART before conception not only prevents sexual transmission between partners, it also reduces perinatal transmission of HIV.

To further eliminate the chances of sexual transmission of HIV, HIV positive women with HIV negative partners and wishing to conceive, may receive assisted insemination. If an HIV positive man and an HIV negative woman wish to conceive, sperm preparation techniques combined with intrauterine insemination or in vitro fertilization may be considered. A sperm donor may also be used in such cases.

Genital tract inflammation, as seen in genital tract infections, increases HIV viral shedding.

Both HIV and ART are associated with increased infertility. So infertility works up in such couples should be started early, ideally, after failure to conceive after six months of unprotected sex.

In couples where both partners are HIV positive, it is recommended to start ART and attain sustained viral suppression before trying to conceive.

Pregnant HIV negative women with HIV positive partners should be screened for HIV on initial visits unless they decide to opt-out of it. They should receive counseling about regular condom use and ART adherence in their partner. Such women (living with HIV positive partners) should ideally be tested for HIV every trimester.

Counseling for HIV negative men trying to conceive with HIV positive partners should include the importance of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence in their partner. Such men should be tested for HIV at least every three months during the period when they are having unprotected sex with their partners in order to try to conceive.

**Antepartum Management**

In addition to the routine assessment for all pregnant women, HIV positive pregnant women should be assessed as described above under ‘evaluation.’

ART not only prevents the perinatal transmission of HIV but also inhibits the sexual (secondary) transmission of the virus. The level of viral RNA in the blood and genital tract secretions of the mother is diminished by strict adherence to the ART regimen.

ART should be started as soon as a diagnosis of HIV is made in a pregnant patient or as soon as pregnancy is diagnosed in an HIV positive woman who is still untreated. This should be done regardless of the patient’s CD4 count or HIV RNA levels. A combined antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum (neonatal prophylaxis) approach should be adopted when administering ART to minimize the perinatal spread of HIV.

Before initiating ART, the patient must be informed about its possible side effects on the mother or fetus and interactions of ART drugs with other medications.

While choosing an ART regimen for pregnant women, a combination regimen is usually preferred over a single agent.

For treatment-naïve patients, two NRTIs with a third integrase inhibitor or protease inhibitor is the preferred regimen, keeping in view the results of the patient’s drug resistance testing. Patient’s tolerability, adherence, and comorbid conditions are also important factors affecting regimen selection. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-emtricitabine (TDF-FTC) or abacavir-lamivudine are generally used NRTI combinations. Tenofovir is avoided in patients with significant renal failure. Zidovudine-lamivudine, despite extensive use and demonstrated safety in pregnancy, is still only an alternative drug in the US. This is because it requires twice-daily dosing and causes headaches and anemia in the mother, along with congenital heart defects in the fetus.

Didanosine, stavudine, and full-dose ritonavir regimens must be discontinued during pregnancy even if the patient has successfully attained sustained viral suppression.

For women who become pregnant while on ART with sustained viral suppression, continuing the same regimen during pregnancy is strongly encouraged. This is true even when the agents in their present regimen are not preferred during pregnancy. Patient’s tolerability and adherence and dose adjustments (especially for protease inhibitors) to account for pharmacokinetic changes in pregnancy are still of utmost importance. Women on cobicistat-containing regimens at the time of pregnancy are encouraged to switch to an alternative drug because cobicistat’s levels decrease during pregnancy, and there is a risk of loss of the previously sustained suppression of the virus.

For women who become pregnant while on ART but without sustained suppression of the virus should be evaluated about drug adherence, and resistance testing should be done. Agents not usually recommended for use during pregnancy may be prescribed in this case. Once-daily dosing is preferred, and if there is still no viral suppression, repeat drug resistance testing should be done.

Women who were previously on ART but not currently taking it should be evaluated thoroughly about past drug regimens, virologic efficacy, past drug tolerability, and past resistance testing. Again, agents not usually preferred in pregnancy may be used in such cases. Patient adherence should be stressed, and viral response closely monitored.

For women with high viral load (treatment naïve or experienced) presenting late in pregnancy, the use of integrase inhibitors e.g., dolutegravir, has been found to result in a rapid decrease in HIV RNA load.

If an ART regimen has to be stopped during pregnancy e.g., due to drug toxicity, hyperemesis gravidarum, acute illness or lack of availability of drugs, all component drugs of the regimen must be discontinued together

**Intrapartum Management**

Women with HIV RNA viral load >1000 copies/mL or unknown levels near delivery are delivered via scheduled cesarean section at 38 weeks.

If a woman with HIV RNA >1000 copies/mL presents before 37 weeks with ruptured membranes or spontaneous labor, her individualized management plan should be decided after consulting with a perinatal HIV expert if a woman presenting with ruptured membranes has HIV RNA <1000 copies/mL, there is no increased risk of perinatal HIV transmission, and there is no indication for cesarean delivery.

Artificial rupture of membrane for obstetrical indications can only be done if the patient is on ART with sustained viral suppression, though it should be used as a last alternative due to the risk of transmission of the virus due to injury to the fetus during the procedure. It must be avoided in women with detectable viral loads. Fetal scalp electrodes, forceps, or vacuum-assisted delivery should be avoided in all HIV positive women.

In the case of uterine atony and postpartum hemorrhage, methergine should be avoided if the patient’s ART regimen has a cytochrome CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitor e.g., cobicistat.

Routine ART regimen should be continued during the intrapartum management phase. If HIV RNA > 1000 copies/mL at the time of delivery, then IV zidovudine (ZDV) infusion should be started 3 hours prior to the scheduled cesarean section in addition to oral administration of routine ART regimen.

If a woman presents in labor with unknown HIV status, offer her an opt-out screening option for HIV. The initial test is a combination immunoassay for HIV-1 and HIV-2 and an HIV RNA assay. If this initial test is positive, immediately start IV ZDV infusion. Women with positive initial tests are tested with antibody immunoassay, which differentiates HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies.

**Postpartum Management**

Comprehensive care plans involving OB/GYN, primary care, HIV specialists, pediatric care, mental health, and supportive care must be provided to HIV positive women in the postpartum period. ART for the mother and the newborn must be provided before hospital discharge, and the first follow-up visit to the HIV-care provider must happen within 2-4 weeks of discharge. These measures are of particular importance to women who have HIV diagnosed during delivery/labor and maximize the chances of successful viral suppression.

Postpartum depression is particularly important in HIV positive women, and all HIV positive women in postpartum must be screened for it.

In the US official guidelines by the Panel on Treatment of Pregnant Women with HIV Infection and Prevention of Perinatal Infection state that breastfeeding must be avoided by HIV positive women because viral transmission through breast milk is possible despite ART suppression and also because of the risk of ART drug toxicity to the infant via breast milk. Women must be counseled about the various pharmacological and non-pharmacological options available to deal with painful breast engorgement when not breastfeeding.

**Newborn Management**

Infants born to HIV positive mothers should be given ART post-exposure prophylaxis within 6 to 12 hours of delivery. Infants born to mothers with viral suppression should receive ZDV for four weeks unless the mother had genital ulcers or excessive bleeding or other STIs at the time of delivery, in which case the infant should receive the same care as that given to an infant born to a mother without viral suppression. Infants born to mothers with no viral suppression (HIV RNA>50copies/mL) should receive a two-drug (ZDV and nevirapine) or three-drug (ZDV, lamivudine, and either nevirapine or raltegravir) for six weeks.

A CBC with differential is performed before starting ART in infants. If abnormalities are detected on it, then ART may need to be stopped, a decision that should be made after consultation with pediatric HIV experts. As a general rule, hemoglobin and neutrophil counts should be measured every four weeks if an infant is receiving ZDV and lamivudine regimen.

TMP-SMX prophylaxis against PCP is started after 4 or 6 weeks ART prophylaxis has finished in an infant born to a mother who is HIV positive unless definite test results are available to rule out HIV infection in the newborn. In infants <18 months, viral assays (HIV RNA or HIV DNA nucleic acid tests or NATs) are used to diagnose HIV. No antigen-antibody assays should be used. All infants born to HIV positive mothers are tested with NATs at 14 to 21 days, 1 to 2 months, and 4 to 6 months. If an infant is at high risk of HIV transmission (e.g., no viral suppression in the mother), additional NATs should be performed at birth and at 2 to 3 months.

In utero or neonatal exposure to HIV or ART drugs must be documented in a child’s long-term medical records even if the child is HIV negative. This is important because many such children have mitochondrial abnormalities leading to the development of disorders of the heart and nervous system in later life.
