Entomophthoromycosis is a slowly progressive disease and is rarely life-threatening. Basidiobolomycosis and conidiobolomycosis cause more of a cosmetic issue which leads to patients seeking medical care. Conidiobolus infection in immunocompromised hosts can lead to profoundly invasive and atypical infection (for example, periorbital disease). There are reported cases of fatal cardiopulmonary, disseminated, endocardial, and pulmonary-mediastinal infections. Atypical and disseminated infection, absence of Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon (reflecting impaired immune response), and elephantiasis were related to worse outcomes and mortality.
