The fibula is the narrow bone on the lateral aspect of the tibia in the leg.  It runs from the knee joint to the ankle joint and is involved in the biomechanics of both joints. The fibula is broken down into four parts: the head, neck, shaft, and distal end. The fibula is a non-weight-bearing bone, and its function is to provide stability to the ankle joint.

The proximal tibiofibular joint is surrounded by a fibrous joint capsule with distinct anterior and posterior tibiofibular ligaments.

The primary function of the proximal tibiofibular joint is to disperse torsional loads applied to the ankle, reduce lateral tibial bending, and share axial loads from weight-bearing.  In knee flexion, the proximal fibula moves anteriorly due to the laxity of the lateral collateral ligament and biceps femoris tendons, whereas in knee extension, the lateral collateral ligament and biceps femoris tighten, which pulls the proximal fibula posteriorly.

The proximal tibiofibular joint has less support because the lateral collateral ligament and biceps tendon are both relaxed during knee flexion. It is more prone to injury with a flexed knee. Distally, the fibula and tibia are connected by the interosseous syndesmotic membrane.  During ankle dorsiflexion, the fibula must externally rotate to accommodate a wider anterior talus. The interosseous syndesmotic membrane also affects how the fibula moves with tibial rotation.  With internal tibial rotation, the fibular head translates posteriorly, and with external tibial rotation, the fibula translates anteriorly.

The common peroneal nerve wraps around the head of the fibula as it travels distally down the leg.
