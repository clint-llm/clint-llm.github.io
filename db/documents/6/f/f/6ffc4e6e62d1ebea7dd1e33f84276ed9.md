Respiratory alkalosis is easy to diagnose but its management can be difficult; the key is to find the cause. Because there are many causes of respiratory alkalosis, the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an internist, primary care provider, nurse practitioner, pulmonologist, mental health nurse and a pain specialist.

Treatment of metabolic alkalosis is targeted at treating the underlying pathology. If hyperventilation is intentional, monitor the arterial or venous blood gas values closely. In severe cases, pH may be directly reduced using acidic agents. However, this is not routinely done. Hyperventilation typically occurs in response to an insult such as hypoxia, metabolic acidosis, pain, anxiety, or increased metabolic demand.

Respiratory alkalosis in itself is not life-threatening; however, the underlying etiology may be. Always look for and treat the source of the illness. Interventions to reduce pH directly are typically not necessary as there is no mortality benefit to this therapy.
