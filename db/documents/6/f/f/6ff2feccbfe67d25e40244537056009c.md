While the neurosurgeon is almost always involved in the care of patients with intraventricular meningiomas, it is important to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that include a neurologist and ophthalmologist. The radiation oncologist evaluation is essential for those tumors that are treated with radiosurgery as a primary treatment or as an adjunct treatment. The nurses are also vital members of the team. They will evaluate the patient's vital signs and help with the education of the patient and family. In the postoperative period, physical therapy and rehabilitation may be needed for those with complications. It is essential to do preoperative visual field evaluation.

Many patients can present with deficits due to the tumor location. Postoperative reevaluation is needed as the surgical approach can cause new deficits. The neuroradiologist also plays a vital role in the differential diagnosis of the intraventricular mass. Interventional neuroradiologist may intervene with preoperative embolization of the tumor. Shared decision making and communication are essential elements for a good outcome.

The recurrence and mortality are lower for intraventricular meningiomas than in other localizations. A higher complete surgical resection rate is achieved than in other localizations. Gross total resection is the gold standard for the treatment of intraventricular meningiomas.
