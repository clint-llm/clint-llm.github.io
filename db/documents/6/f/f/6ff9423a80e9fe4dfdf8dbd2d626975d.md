There is no specific antidote for MAOI toxicity, and dialysis is unhelpful in removing the drug. An overdose of MAOIs, or use in combination with other serotonergic agents, may lead to serotonin toxicity. Likewise, the use of MAOIs with sympathomimetic agents may lead to the development of a hypertensive crisis.

When managing serotonin syndrome, early transfer to a medical ICU and consultation with a toxicologist is strongly advised. Diagnosis of serotonin toxicity is possible using the “Hunter criteria” or the “Sternbach criteria” based on physical manifestations.

In cases of hypertensive crisis, immediate admission to the ICU for prompt blood pressure control with a parenteral, titratable antihypertensive agent while the patient remains on a vitals monitor is necessary. Urine output measurements and a neurologic examination should also take place. BP correction should be slowly achieved over several minutes to an hour, and not immediately. The goal is to lower the BP to no less than 20% to 25% during the first hour.
