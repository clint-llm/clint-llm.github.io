Most cases of malaria in the U.S. are imported and could, therefore, be avoided with appropriate personal protective measures and compliance with prescribed chemoprophylaxis. Health care providers on all levels must be educated not only on the diagnosis and treatment of malaria but especially on the importance of prevention. They should be able to provide enough information to travelers at risk. Travelers to the endemic areas should obtain appropriate clothing, insecticides, and other protective gear based on the information offered by health care providers and CDC. Collaboratively, a physician and a pharmacist, should decide on, recommend and prescribe appropriate chemoprophylaxis, considering traveler's personal preferences, time of travel, current health status, risk factors, drug-drug interactions, and possible contraindications, while emphasizing the importance of compliance with the drug-taking regimen.

The crucial issue in the diagnosis and treatment of malaria is the consideration of the possibility of diagnosis. Expert advice from an infectious disease or travel medicine specialist should be sought once malaria is a suspected diagnosis, especially in the setting of severe disease.****Healthcare providers that are a part of the interprofessional team (nurses, respiratory therapists, physicians, etc.) managing patients with severe malaria in critical or intensive care units, should be educated on early recognition of complications.
