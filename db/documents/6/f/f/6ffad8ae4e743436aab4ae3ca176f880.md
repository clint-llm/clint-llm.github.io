The cardinal feature of MC is delayed relaxation of contracted skeletal muscle. It is acknowledged that there is significant variability in the phenotype of both autosomal and recessively inherited MC; this can hinder prompt diagnosis and management. Identical mutations can result in significantly different clinical presentations, and the relationship between genotype and phenotype in these channelopathies is considered to be extremely complex.

In early childhood, symptoms may include feeding difficulties, including dysphagia, reflux, gagging, and choking. Children may appear clumsy and fall frequently, even after walking is established. Patients may also exhibit difficulty in opening eyes during prolonged contraction, such as crying. These signs may be subtle; therefore, careful history from patients and their caregivers, as well as clinical examination, is essential. Symptoms often progress initially after they first appear and then plateau.

Muscle stiffness observed in MC is often ameliorated by exercise or repetitive movement. This effect is called the “warm-up” phenomenon (though it is quickly lost on cessation of activity). Men appear to be more severely affected by MC than women. In addition, symptoms often worsen during pregnancy and menstruation; these observations imply that sex hormones affect CIC-1 channel function.

MC is classically defined into distinct clinical diseases based on the mode of inheritance. There are subtle differences between the two diseases. Given the phenotypic variability discussed above, the ultimate diagnosis is achieved with genetic testing.

Becker disease (BD): This is autosomally recessive inherited MC. It is associated with moderate to severe myotonia and transient weakness, though in some cases, this may become progressive. BD generally presents later in childhood than Thomsen disease (TD).

Thomsen disease (TD): Dominantly inherited MC is associated with an earlier onset of symptoms though these are milder than BD. The mild, progressive, permanent weakness described in BD is not associated with TD.
