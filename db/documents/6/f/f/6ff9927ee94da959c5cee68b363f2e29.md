Fetal circulation is unlike adult circulation as it uses physiological shunts to carry oxygenated blood to tissues and bypass developing organs. The viability of the fetus heavily relies on these shunts to adequately perfuse developing tissues and organs, especially the brain and heart. The ductus venosus is a shunt that allows oxygenated blood in the umbilical vein to bypass the liver and is essential for normal fetal circulation.
