Hydralazine is primarily used to treat hypertension and hypertensive urgency/emergency.

In current practice, oral hydralazine is used in essential hypertension refractory to other therapeutic agents.

IV hydralazine has had increased off-label use in the setting of hypertensive emergencies. It is often given to hospitalized patients but has little evidence of improved outcomes. Reasons for this include highly variable blood pressure changes and adverse hypotensive episodes.

IV hydralazine along with IV labetalol are considered first-line therapy for the treatment of acute-onset, severe hypertension in pregnancy and during the postpartum period. Either of these medications should be administered during the intrapartum or postpartum period if severe blood pressure persists for greater than 15 minutes.

For African-American patients with severe heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III and IV) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), the American Heart Association recommends ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers as first-line therapy.
