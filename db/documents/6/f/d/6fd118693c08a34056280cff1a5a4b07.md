The use of a sphygmomanometer is the standard way to measure both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Once these values are known, a MAP value can easily be determined. An oscillometric blood pressure device can also be used to measure MAP. Echocardiography can be useful in evaluating the function of the myocardium further, determine the left ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac output. Central venous catheters, placed in the right atrium, can measure central venous pressure when necessary.
