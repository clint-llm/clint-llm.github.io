Diagnosis is first suspected based on either patient's subjective history or incidental finding on physical exam. Once there is suspicion of valvular disease, a 2D echocardiogram with Doppler study would be the gold standard test. There are three major parameters measured to evaluate the competency of the aortic valve during an echocardiogram; the aortic jet velocity, mean aortic valve pressure gradient, and the aortic valve area. These values are used in conjunction with the presence or absence of symptoms to determine the severity of the aortic disease. Other existing comorbidities and/or sequela can be investigated using imaging such as cardiac contrast tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI), stress testing, blood cultures for suspected endocarditis or rheumatic disease.
