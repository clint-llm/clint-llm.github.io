Bronchial atresia has become a recent topic of interest with an increase in published case reports. Despite the years of research, the exact cause of bronchial atresia is unknown. The hypotheses of interruption from the developing pulmonary bud or repeated vascular injury are still widely accepted. Most cases are found incidentally on radiography with high-resolution computed tomography being the modality of choice for diagnosis. Treatment and management are controversial with asymptomatic patients being managed conservatively or undergoing surgery to prevent long-term outcomes.
