Patients should receive education regarding the potential for chronic, recurrent instability following traumatic shoulder dislocations with associated glenoid bone loss.  In general, younger patients involved in high-level competitive sports (e.g., football) are at the highest risk of recurrent shoulder dislocations.  Furthermore, glenoid bone loss in the setting of shoulder instability reduces the chance of a good outcome and return to sport, even following the appropriate surgical management and postoperative rehabilitation.  Managing patient and family expectations is paramount in all of these clinical scenarios.
