In the fourth week of development, the upper limb musculature arises from myoblasts from the dorsolateral somite cells surrounding developing bones. These cells develop into a mass of tissue that gives rise to the extensor (dorsal) and flexor (ventral) compartments of the limb. The determination of the compartments derives from the connective tissue of the lateral plate mesoderm. Once formed, the primary ventral rami enter the mesenchyme, giving rise to the anterior and posterior divisions. The posterior division innervates the extensor compartment, including nerves such as the radial nerve. A branch of the radial nerve, the deep branch of the radial nerve (C7, C8), eventually arises to supply extensor carpi radialis brevis.
