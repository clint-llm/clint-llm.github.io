Evaluation should start by establishing the diagnosis. The first investigation is urine analysis to look for microscopic hematuria. The presence of red cells and red cell casts indicate a glomerular injury. Protein to creatinine ratio in urine or 24-hour urinary protein excretion is done to look for proteinuria. Serum creatinine and eGFR are done to quantify renal function. Confirmation of the diagnosis relies on renal biopsy. Light microscopy, electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence are used to study renal histology. Immunofluorescence demonstrating the deposit of IgA in the glomerular basement membrane is the gold standard for diagnosis. IgA nephropathy should be classified using the Oxford classification, which can predict prognosis. The Oxford classification has its basis in a combination of histological, clinical, and biomarker criteria.

The Oxford classification relies on the following criteria:

- Mesangial cellularity

- Endocapillary proliferation

- Segmental glomerulosclerosis

- Tubular atrophy

- Crescents assessed by a renal biopsy
