The management of chancroid is interprofessional. A primary care provider initially evaluates the patient. The diagnosis can be difficult and does require a consult with infectious disease. Nurses participate in the evaluation, treatment, and education of patients. Pharmacists review medications, check for interactions, and provide patient education. The condition requires treatment with an antibiotic, but all patients need a workup for other sexually transmitted infections. Safe sex education is recommended for all patients. Once chancroid is treated, the outcomes are good.
