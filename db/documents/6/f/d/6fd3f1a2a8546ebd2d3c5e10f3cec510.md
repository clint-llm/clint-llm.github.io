There are multiple causes of priapism. It is estimated that in up to about two-thirds of patients, the cause is using intracavernosal drugs to treat erectile dysfunction.

Sickle cell disease also accounts for a large number of cases of adult priapism, with rates reported between 40% and 80%. The majority of sickle cell cases of priapism occur in African Americans. The disorder has a bimodal presentation with peaks at ages 7 to 10 and 20 to 50 years.

The overall incidence of priapism is estimated at 0.73 to 5.4 cases per 100,000 men per year.

- Priapism occurs 30% more frequently in the summer.

- Thirteen percent of patients who present to emergency departments with priapism are admitted.

- Priapism, by definition, is exclusively a disease of males, but rare cases of clitoral priapism have also been reported.
