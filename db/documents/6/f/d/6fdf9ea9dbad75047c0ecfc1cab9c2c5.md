Maintaining a safe home environment, such as through the use of non-slip floor material and having adequate illumination, especially at night. To minimize the risk of traumatic damage to a friable vulval epithelium in postmenopausal women, estrogen gels and other methods of therapy for vulvar and vaginal atrophy may be prescribed.
