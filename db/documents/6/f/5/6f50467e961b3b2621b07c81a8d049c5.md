Carbon monoxide is a tasteless, odorless, colorless, and non-irritating gas formed with the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons (fossil fuels). It is the leading cause of lethal poisonings worldwide. Disabling the ability of oxygen to bind to hemoglobin causes multiple deleterious effects on cellular metabolism, oxygen utilization, the cardiovascular system, and neurocognitive processes. This activity reviews the diagnosis, evaluation, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of carbon monoxide toxicity.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of carboxyhemoglobin and downstream effects on cellular metabolism.
- Review the evaluation of suspected carboxyhemoglobin toxicity.
- Identify the complications related to toxic carbon monoxide exposure.
- Summarize the conditions and special situations in which to consider treatment with hyperbaric oxygen for carbon monoxide exposure.
