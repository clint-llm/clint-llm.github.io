Portal vein obstruction most commonly results from thrombosis or, to a lesser extent, from malignancy. It also occurs as a complication of several metabolic and autoimmune diseases. Anticoagulation and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) are the mainstays of treatment. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of portal vein obstruction and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of portal vein obstruction.
- Identify the most common adverse events associated with anticoagulation therapy for the treatment of portal vein obstruction.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with portal vein obstruction.
- Explain strategies to optimize care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by portal vein obstruction.
