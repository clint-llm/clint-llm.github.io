Many physiologic changes take place during pregnancy that can affect the bronchial asthma course including:

- A metabolic rate increase of the pregnant women by about 15%, with a resultant 20% increase in oxygen consumption with a subsequent increase in minute ventilation (mainly by tidal volume increase) by 30% to 40%.This hyperventilation is mediated by respiratory center stimulation by progesterone hormone. The hyperventilation leads to respiratory alkalosis during pregnancy, in which there is decreased arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, decreased bicarbonate, and increased pH.

- Uterine size increases with its upward push on the diaphragm and a subsequent decrease in functional residual capacity.

- The changes of maternal immunity as pregnancy are proposed to be associated with a shift from T-helper 1-type cytokine production and towards Th2-type immune responses, which is mandatory for the fetus to survive. The Th2 up-regulation and other immunity changes may lead to bronchial asthma exacerbation during pregnancy.

- Mucosal and laryngeal edema may be mediated by the estrogen hormones leading to rhinosinusitis in about 20% of pregnant women.
