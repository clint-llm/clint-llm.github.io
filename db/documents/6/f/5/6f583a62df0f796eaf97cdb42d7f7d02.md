Managing type 2 diabetes mellitus involves an interprofessional healthcare team approach involving various healthcare team members, including but not limited to the endocrinologist, family/primary care clinician (MDs, DOs, PAs, NPs), diabetes specialist nurse, podiatrist, and pharmacist. Its management involves the utilization of drugs that control blood glucose, which include glimepiride. Glimepiride is a second-line, FDA-approved drug to be used either in combination with metformin or as a monotherapy. Sulfonylureas augment and increase insulin release from the pancreas and, although effective, poses a threat to patient safety if used inappropriately. Sufficient communication is essential in delivering optimal care to patients, including providing information in aspects such as time and frequency of administration and associated sick day rules. Through a coordinated interprofessional team effort, diabetes management, including the use of glimepiride, can achieve better patient outcomes and limit the potential for therapeutic failure or adverse events.
