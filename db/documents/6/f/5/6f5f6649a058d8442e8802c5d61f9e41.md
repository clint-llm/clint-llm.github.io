**Similar as for GCTs**

**Tumor**

The extent of the primary tumor (pT) is classified after radical orchiectomy:

- pTX – Primary tumor cannot be assessed (if radical orchiectomy has not been done, Tx used)

- pT0 – No evidence of primary tumor (e.g., a histological scar in testis)

- pTis – Intratubular germ cell neoplasia (carcinoma in situ)

- pT1 – Tumor limited to the testis & epididymis without vascular/lymphatic invasion or tumor invasion into the tunica albuginea but not the tunica vaginalis

- pT2 – Tumor limited to the testis & epididymis with vascular/lymphatic invasion, or tumor extending through the tunica albuginea with the involvement of the tunica vaginalis

- pT3 – Tumor invades the spermatic cord with or without vascular/lymphatic invasion

- pT4 – Tumor invades the scrotum with or without vascular/lymphatic invasion

**Node**

Regional lymph node involvement is used for clinical (N) or pathologic (pN) staging, as follows:

- NX or pNX – Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed

- N0 or pN0 – No regional lymph node metastasis

- N1 or pN1 – Metastases with a lymph node mass ≤ 2 cm in greatest dimension; or multiple lymph nodes, none more than 2 cm in greatest dimension

- N2 or pN2 – Metastases with a lymph node mass greater than 2 cm but not greater than 5 cm in greatest dimension; or multiple lymph nodes, anyone mass more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm in greatest dimension.

- N3 or pN3 – Metastases with a lymph node mass more than 5 cm in greatest dimension

**Metastasis**

Distant metastasis (M) is classified as follows:

- MX – Distant metastasis cannot be assessed

- M0 – No distant metastasis

- M1 – Distant metastasis

- M1a – Nonregional nodal or pulmonary metastasis

- M1b – Distant metastasis other than to nonregional lymph nodes and lungs
