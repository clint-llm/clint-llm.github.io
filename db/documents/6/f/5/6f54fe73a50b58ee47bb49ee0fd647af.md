The World Drug Report in 2015 categorized ketamine as a worldwide recreational drug, with 58 countries reporting illicit use. However, ketamine misuse occurs on a relatively small scale, and PCP derivatives constituted only 1% of “new psychoactive substances” reported to the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime in 2014 (fact file on ketamine). Ketamine misuse often occurs in combination with other substances, including alcohol, amphetamines, MDMA, cocaine, and caffeine.

In the United States, where ketamine classifies as a C-III controlled substance since 1999, ketamine misuse has increased since the 1980s.

Ketamine use is becoming increasingly popular as a recreational drug in Southeast Asian countries such as Taiwan, Malaysia, and China.
