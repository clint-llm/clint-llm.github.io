Patients need to be notified of the abnormal thyroid test findings and advised to follow up with their primary care physician to retest their thyroid levels later when they have completely recovered from the acute illness. The recommended timing is usually at least six weeks after hospitalization. If the patients present with persistently abnormal thyroid hormone levels after the initial medical disease has been resolved, further workup of the thyroid function is warranted to clarify and recognize any purely thyroid-related problems that need special evaluation and appropriate treatment.
