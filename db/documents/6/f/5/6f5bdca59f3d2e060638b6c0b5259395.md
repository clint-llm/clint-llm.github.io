The treatment of endometriosis is broadly categorized into two main categories, pharmacological and surgical. Currently, there is not a specific drug that could inhibit the progress of the disease, rather than hormonal and non-hormonal agents used to alleviate the symptoms and increase the fertility rates.

The first-line pharmacological therapy proposed for the management of endometriosis consists of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, progestins, or combined hormonal contraceptives.

As a second-line medical empiric treatment is used a three-month trial of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs for the suppression of the endometriosis relating symptoms.
