As with other interventional spinal procedures, only physicians specifically trained in fluoroscopically guidance procedures should perform radiofrequency ablation. Qualified physicians typically undergo residency training in anesthesiology, physiatry, neurology, psychiatry, or neurosurgery. This is followed by an interventional pain or spine fellowship that allows adequate training under an experienced interventionalist before performing the procedure independently. Support staff for the procedure can include an assistant to draw up medications and operate the radiofrequency generator and a radiology technician to operate the C-arm under the guidance of the practicing physician.
