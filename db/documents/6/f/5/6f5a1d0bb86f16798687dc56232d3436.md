The successful administration of tenecteplase and maximization of health outcomes relies on the effective coordination of the interprofessional healthcare team. Tenecteplase must be administered within a strict time frame, with a thorough review of contraindications to therapy and vigilant clinical monitoring after administration.

The single bolus administration of tenecteplase makes the drug an ideal candidate in the prehospital setting. Prehospital professionals such as emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and first responders are trained and qualified to administer tenecteplase in specific settings. Their ability to evaluate electrocardiogram (ECG) and identify STEMIs is crucial in providing advanced notification to hospital teams.

Open communication among all team members is crucial to therapeutic success when using tenecteplase. Pharmacists conduct thorough medication reconciliation before tenecteplase administration to identify any contraindications to therapy or drug-drug interactions and must immediately alert the clinical team. Additionally, pharmacists will collaborate with nurses for proper drug preparation, dosing, and administration. Nurses are essential in monitoring for potential adverse events during and after the administration of tenecteplase and promptly reporting any concerns to the attending so corrective action can be initiated.

The close communication and collaborative approach among the interprofessional healthcare team members are crucial for achieving maximal therapeutic benefit with the fewest adverse events.
