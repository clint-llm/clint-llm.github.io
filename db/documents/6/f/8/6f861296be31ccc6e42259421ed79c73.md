The prognosis in individuals with 5alpha-RD2 deficiency is relatively good. There have been no reports on prostate malignancy and benign prostatic enlargement in these patients. There is reduced facial and body hair in these individuals, but with normal sebum production. Most males with a deficiency of 5 alpha-RD2 are infertile. The reason for infertility could be undescended testes, decreased sperm count, urethral strictures, and urethroscrotal fistulas. The good news is some of the individuals with 5 alpha-RD2 deficiency can produce children, thanks to procedures including intrauterine insemination and in vitro fertilization.
