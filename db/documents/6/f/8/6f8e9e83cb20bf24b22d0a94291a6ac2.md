Serial block face-scanning electron microscopy (SBF SEM) with super voxel-based segmentation is a method electron microscopy that generates high-resolution 3D images. This approach was used from the beginning to obtain information about the ultrastructure and the connectivity of the nervous tissue. Indeed, it offers detailed pieces of information on axonal diameter, fiber diameter, myelin thickness, and organelles.in
vivo imaging data from light microscopy immunohistochemical and traces approaches, especially in cells cultured but also in tissue sections. For the preparation of tissue section useful for electron microscopy after a light microscopy investigation, Hua's approach is the most used method.

Moreover, electron microscopy offers significant information about the axonal structure and its alterations in the course of pathological processes. In the case of axonal degenerative alterations, for example, subversions of the layered structure of the myelin, alterations of the compactness, and lipid aggregates that are the expression of the myelin in decay can be found. Again, electron microscopy offers important experimental data in the evaluation of regenerative processes; therefore, in experimental models, it is useful to verify the effective efficacy of potential neuroprotective and neuroregenerative treatments.
