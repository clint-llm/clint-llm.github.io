FTT to thrive is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes nurses. There are many causes of FTT and thus clinicians need to obtain a thorough history. Often an exhaustive workup is required. Simply admitting the patient and administering parenteral nutrition is not recommended; enteral nutrition is always preferred. Until the cause of FTT is discovered, no treatment will work. A dietitian, mental health counselor, and a social worker should be involved in chronic cases of FTT; sometimes the cause is not organic but can even be a mental health problem or even child abuse.

The outlook of patients depends on the cause. In most cases, the recovery is slow and gradual and may be associated with mild to moderate neuropsychiatric deficits.
