In the Western population, there is evidence of a declining incidence of infectious gastritis caused by H. pylori with an increasing prevalence of autoimmune gastritis.

Chronic gastritis remains a relatively common disease in developing countries. The prevalence of H. pylori infection in children in the Western population is approximately 10%, but about 50% in developing countries.

Socioeconomic and environmental hygiene are the essential factors in transmitting H. pylori infection worldwide. These factors include family-bound hygiene, household density, and cooking habits. The pediatric origin of H. pylori infection is currently considered the primary determinant of H. pylori-associated gastritis in a community.
