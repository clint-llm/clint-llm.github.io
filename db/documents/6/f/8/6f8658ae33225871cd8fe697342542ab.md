Using the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) enzyme, the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine biosynthesis, as a marker for dopaminergic neurons, embryonic studies suggest that the dopaminergic substantia nigra neurons first form in the ventricular zone of the ventral mesencephalon during week 6.5 with migration occurring at week six.
