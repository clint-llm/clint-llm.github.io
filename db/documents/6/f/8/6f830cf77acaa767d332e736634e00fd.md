Outerbridge classification of chondromalacia patellae (5 grades from 0 to IV):

**Grade 0:**Normal cartilage

**Grade I:**Intact articular surface but soft, swollen, and oedematous

Some fibrillation and heterogeneity of the cartilage may be noted, which is translated on the MRI as high signal intensity

**Grade II:**Fissures and fragmentation of the articular surface ( an area half an inch or less in diameter)

**Grade III:**Focal, partial thickness cartilaginous defect. (an area more than half an inch in diameter)

**Grade IV:**Full thickness defect down to the subchondral bone

Commonly, these grades are assessed with an arthroscopic evaluation of the knee. MRI radiography can also classify the degree of articular cartilage wear, but it is not as accurate as the visual assessment done at arthroscopy

In the Asian population, Ye et al. considered further classified CMP into an early stage (grade 1–2 Outerbridge) and an advanced stage (grade 3–4), and they assumed that with the early stage, patella cartilage can self-repair in comparison to an advanced stage when it progresses to patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis
