May-Thurner syndrome develops through three stages, starting with (1) asymptomatic left CIV compression, leading to (2) the formation of a venous spur, and finally resulting in (3) left lower extremity DVT.

MTS is known to occur more commonly in the second and third decades of life. Young women are more commonly affected compared to men. Due to the proximity with the lower lumbar vertebrae, MTS should be suspected in patients with left lower extremity DVT.
