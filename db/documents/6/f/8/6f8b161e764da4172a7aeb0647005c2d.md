CRRT requires an interprofessional healthcare team approach to be provided safely and efficiently. It requires the collaboration of specialties, including critical care, nephrology, and neurology, on essential elements such as when to initiate a mode of clearance, solute and fluid removal targets, and anticoagulation strategies. All clinicians involved in the case, including nurse practitioners and physician assistants, must be contributors to care. Nursing is vital during CRRT as they have the most exposure to the vascular access site, the CRRT circuit itself, and the patient.

Nursing staff and patient care technicians should be aware of complications so that intervention can be initiated early, and the clinician team should be alerted promptly. In addition, pharmacists and nutritionists are vital to ensure proper medication doses and nutrition while on CRRT. Pharmacists will provide input on how CRRT may affect the patient's drug regimen and possible therapeutic outcome and needs to share their expertise with the rest of the team so any necessary adjustment to drug therapy can be put in place.

With this team approach and good education for each member, CRRT may be delivered as safely and effectively as possible.
