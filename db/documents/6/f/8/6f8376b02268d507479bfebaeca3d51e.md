All healthcare workers, whether physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses, social workers/counselors, chaplains, or others, should regularly discuss advance directives with patients. These disciplines bring a variety of skill sets that can work together toward better outcomes. The discussion should be undertaken before an acute illness strikes and revisited or updated periodically. Many medical and surgical specialty societies recommend discussions of advance directives and goals of care in clinical practice guidelines. It is considered good practice to ask about advance directives upon hospital admission as well as during annual wellness visits, particularly among the geriatric population or those with life or capacity-limiting diagnosis.
