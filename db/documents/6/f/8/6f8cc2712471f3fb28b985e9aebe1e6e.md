The main chemicals used as nerve agents are:

- **Tabun**Ethyl dimethylamidocyanophosphate, also know as GA

- **Sarin**(RS)-propan-2-yl methyphosphonofluoridate, also known as GB

- **Soman**(O-Pinacolyl methylphosphonofluoridate), also known as GD

- **VX**(ethyl ({2-[bis(propan-2yl)amino]ethyl}sulfanyl)(methyl)phosphinate)

- **VE**O-Ethyl-S-[2-(diethylamino)ethyl] ethylphosphonothioate

-  **VG**O,O-Diethyl-S-[2-(diethylamino)ethyl] phosphorothioate

-  **VM**O-Ethyl-S-[2-(diethylamino)ethyl] methylphosphonothioate

Structurally similar to organophosphate insecticides, the G group compounds were first made in Germany around the 1930s for use as chemical weapons. The V group were made after World War II by England and the United States. All of these compounds cause the same signs and symptoms as organophosphate toxicity but are more potent, longer-lasting, sometimes irreversible in the case of Soman, and potentially more lethal.
