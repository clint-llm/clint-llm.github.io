Light traveling through any media other than vacuum undergoes aberrations due to changes in the refractive index and interface of the medium.

The monochromatic aberrations are further classified as lower order (contribute to about 90% of total aberrations) and higher order aberrations (10% of total aberrations). Spherical and cylindrical lenses correct the lower-order aberrations. The higher-order aberrations responsible for limiting the lateral resolution of devices are unique to each patient's eye and were deemed un-rectifiable until recently.

In 1953, Horace Babcock from the Carnegie laboratories proposed Adaptive optics (AO) for the clear visualization of astronomical bodies, the images distorted by the aberrations in the incident rays due to the turbulence in the earth's atmosphere.

Though AO technology has evolved in the last two decades, no Food and Drug Administration, USA (FDA) approved devices for clinical use exist. Recently, anÂ AO flood illumination device has been approved for marketing in the European Union, China, and Japan.
