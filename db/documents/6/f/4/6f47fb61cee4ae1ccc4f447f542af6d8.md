Generally speaking, most neck masses in children are of infectious etiology. In adults, however, neck masses in patients who are greater than or equal to 18 years old should always be considered to be malignant until proven otherwise. Thus, the clinical approach to neck masses for adults vs. children vary greatly. It is crucial to keep in mind that cancers of the head and neck, such as squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), lymphoma, thyroid, or salivary gland, can present initially as asymptomatic masses.

The differential diagnosis for lymphadenopathy is extensive. It generally categorizes as neoplastic, infectious, inflammatory, reactive, and nondiagnostic. Researchers performed a retrospective 5-year study in a large hospital on 309 supraclavicular masses diagnosed with fine needle aspiration. Results showed that the majority of masses (55%) were malignant, with secondary (metastatic spread) being far more frequent than primary lymphomas (47% vs. 8%, respectively). The most common metastatic malignancies were of lung, breast, uterine, and esophageal origin.

Enlargement of VN, a significant clinical finding termed Troisier sign, can indicate advanced stage 4 gastrointestinal metastasis, which is associated with a 5-year survival of 4%.
