The medial part of the femoral sheath, termed the femoral canal, is the site through which abdominal viscera can protrude, resulting in a femoral hernia. Femoral hernia repair can be performed with mesh (hernioplasty) or primary suture closure (herniorrhaphy). Modern practice internationally has favored mesh repair, either via an open approach or laparoscopically, in the elective setting for both male and female groin hernia repair.

The three classic open approaches to repair of femoral hernia are the infra-inguinal (Lockwood) approach, the trans-inguinal (Lotheissen) approach, and the high (McEvedy) approach, with each offering advantages in certain situations. The Lockwood approach, for example, involves a parallel incision approximately 1cm below the inguinal ligament and is suitable for elective repair as there is little opportunity to allow for bowel resection if required in emergency surgery

The two laparoscopic surgical techniques for groin hernias are the transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) and the totally intraperitoneal (TEP) approach.
