The diagnosis of the disease is usually delayed an average of 4 to 11 years from the onset of symptoms. This phenomenon occurs not only in low and middle-income countries but also in wealthy societies with universal health care access.

Nevertheless, the absence of physical findings cannot exclude the diagnosis of endometriosis. The gold standard diagnostic tool remains laparoscopy, combined with an exploration of the abdominal cavity and a histological biopsy.

Several other low invasive diagnostic methods have been evaluated regarding their diagnostic value, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS). Transvaginal ultrasound is a diagnostic tool with high sensitivity and specificity for ovarian endometriomas and permits a wide exploration of the pelvic cavity. Endometriomas appear as homogenous formations with a classic ground-glass appearance and low-level internal echoes.

In an effort to assess whether specific serum, tissue, and urine biomarkers could assist diagnostically for endometriosis, CA125 is elevated in patients with endometriosis, but this test could not stand as a single diagnostic test. The reason behind this is that CA125 can be increased in several pathological conditions except for endometriosis and is not also able to define the location of endometriotic lesions.
