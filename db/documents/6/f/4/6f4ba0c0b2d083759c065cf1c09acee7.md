A proper preoperative diagnosis and management of cervical proliferative disorders presenting with multiple cysts, such as nabothian cysts, have not yet been thoroughly set. A study conducted in Japan proposed a management protocol that includes an interprofessional team diagnostic approach with cytology, MRI, gastric-type mucin, subsequent treatment, and follow-up. The usefulness of this protocol had an evaluation with 94 patients with multicystic cervical lesions between 1995 and 2014. Using the protocol mentioned above, the diagnosis was correct in 90% of the cases, and the study concluded that the proposed protocol was accurate and useful in diagnosing and treating cervical multicystic lesions.
