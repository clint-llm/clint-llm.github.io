The IIC is not in and of itself a disease but rather a set of EEG features concerning an ictal process while not meeting formal criteria for electrographic or electroclinical seizures. The appearance of IIC patterns varies considerably depending upon the etiology of the pattern, but the application of the ACNS criteria should preclude such patterns from being mistaken for other entities. While one study showed GRDA to be associated with seizures in 10% of patients.

GRDA is not considered an ictogenic pattern nor included in patterns that lie on anÂ IIC. Brief potentially ictal rhythmic discharges (BIRDs), defined as focal or generalized rhythmic activity >4 Hz that is sharply contoured, evolving, or similar in location and morphology as definite seizures in the same record, constitute a distinct and separate electrographic pattern with similar clinical implications as IIC patterns but in contrast, lasts less than 10 seconds.
