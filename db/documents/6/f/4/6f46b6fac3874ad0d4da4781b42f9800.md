A vasovagal episode or vasovagal syncope is the most common form of reflex syncope. Reflex syncope describes any form of syncopal episode caused by a failure in the autoregulation of blood pressure, and ultimately, a drop in cerebral perfusion pressure resulting in a transient loss of consciousness. The mechanisms responsible for this are complex and can both depression of cardiac output as well as decreased vascular tone. Other types of reflex syncope include carotid sinus syncope and situational syncope, the latter of which may occur, for instance, in conjunction with a cough or micturition. Vasovagal syncope may be triggered by pain or emotional upset, although frequently a specific trigger cannot be identified. This activity describes the risk factors, evaluation, and management of vasovagal episodes and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in enhancing care delivery for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of vasovagal episodes.
- Describe the signs and symptoms of a vasovagal episode.
- Explain what evaluation should be done for patients that experience vasovagal episodes.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination, with particular emphasis on communication between interprofessional medical teams, to enhance prompt and thorough delivery of care to patients with vasovagal episodes.
