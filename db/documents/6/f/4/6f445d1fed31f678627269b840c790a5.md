There are surgical and non-surgical indications for lung isolation, which can be absolute or relative. OLV can facilitate a variety of surgical procedures involving thoracic approaches to anatomical structures. The management of severe unilateral lung disease with either differential ventilation or OLV can also necessitate lung isolation. Some of these disease states, such as severe unilateral infection, require a definitive anatomical separation of the lungs to prevent contamination of the non-diseased lung. Other disease states only need physiologic separation to enable different ventilatory parameters to be used on each side.

**Surgical Indications for Lung Isolation and OLV**

**Thoracic**

- Lung resection

- Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery

- Lung transplantation

- Thoracic diaphragmatic hernia repair

- Pleurodesis or pleurectomy

**Cardiac**

- Minimally invasive cardiac surgery

- Pericardiectomy

- Surgeries involving the thoracic aorta

**Neurological**

- Thoracic sympathectomy

- Anterior approach to the thoracic spine

**Pathological Indications for Lung Isolation**

Unilateral disease states requiring anatomical lung isolation

- Pathology requiring whole lung lavage, e.g., pulmonary alveolar proteinosis

- Excessive infectious or non-infectious secretions

- Pulmonary hemorrhage

Unilateral disease states requiring physiologic lung isolation and differential ventilation

- Parenchymal disease or injury

- Bronchopleural fistula

- Complications following thoracic surgery

- Unilateral bronchospasm
