The dorsal penile nerve block is an effective technique for gaining regional anesthesia of the penis with small volumes of a local anesthetic. The technique is essential for all practicing urologists and desirable for those who work in emergency departments who see acute presentations such as paraphimosis. This activity describes the indications, contraindications, and potential complications of a dorsal penile nerve block.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for performing a dorsal penile nerve block.
- Outline anesthetic agents that should be avoided in performing a dorsal penile nerve block.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of a dorsal penile block.
- Review how an interprofessional team approach can provide care for patients requiring a dorsal penile block and improve outcomes.
