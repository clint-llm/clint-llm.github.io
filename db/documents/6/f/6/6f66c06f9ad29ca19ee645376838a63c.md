Small and medium CMNs pose lesser risks in terms of malignant transformation and neurocutaneous melanosis complications. These lesions generally have a good prognosis for patient survival. When melanomas arise in large or giant CMN, the prognosis is poor. Reported 5-year survival in 35 giant CMN patients with diagnosed melanomas was 34.3%.

For patients with symptomatic neurocutaneous melanosis, the prognosis is also unfavorable. One study reported 50% of patients dying within 3 years of symptomatic onset, with no curative treatments yet identified.
