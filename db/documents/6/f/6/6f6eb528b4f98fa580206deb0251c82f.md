There are several theories for migraine generation. Previously, vasodilation of the cerebral vasculature was proposed as the mechanism, but it has been refuted by several experiments that showed an absence of migraine with the vasoactive intestinal peptide that increases the blood flow.

Migraine surgery focuses on the neurolysis of sensory branches of trigeminal and occipital nerves supplying the face and back of the head. These nerves include supraorbital, supratrochlear, zygomaticotemporal, auriculotemporal, and greater and lesser occipital nerves. Sometimes, the pain is also due to hypertrophic nasal turbinates or deviated nasal septum irritating branches of trigeminal nerves.
