Libman-Sacks endocarditis, also known as murantic or verrucous endocarditis, is a form of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) which involves the presence of sterile vegetations on the cardiac valves. These sterile vegetations may be associated with malignancy, systemic lupus erythematosus, or antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and are most commonly found on mitral and aortic valves, though other valves may be involved. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of Libman-Sacks endocarditis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Libman-Sacks endocarditis.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with Libman-Sacks endocarditis.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for Libman-Sacks endocarditis.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of Libman-Sacks endocarditis and improve outcomes.
