Tricyclic antidepressants are contraindicated in several populations and with the concomitant use of various medications. TCAs should not be prescribed if there is a family history of QTc interval prolongation or sudden cardiac death. Hypersensitivity reactions to a TCA drug are considered an absolute contraindication. However, patients with a hypersensitivity reaction to a particular TCA drug may be prescribed a different member of the class with caution. TCAs should not be used concomitantly with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), e.g., phenelzine, due to the risk of developing serotonin syndrome.

TCA use requires caution in individuals with angle-closure glaucoma as its anticholinergic effects may increaseÂ the risk of an acute ocular crisis.
