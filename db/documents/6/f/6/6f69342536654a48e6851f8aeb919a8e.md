Patient education on velopharyngeal dysfunction can be challenging due to the heterogeneous causes and need for multidisciplinary management. An early introduction to a speech-language pathologist is key for the diagnosis and alleviation of any inappropriate compensatory behaviors. Patients and their families should be counseled on the different methods of evaluation such as perceptual speech analysis, video nasal endoscopy, videofluoroscopy, and nasometry. Findings on testing and imaging should be shared and a discussion held regarding the best approach for treatment. Prior to any surgical intervention, patients and parents should be educated on the risks of surgery such as airway obstruction, sleep apnea, and need for additional surgical revisions.
