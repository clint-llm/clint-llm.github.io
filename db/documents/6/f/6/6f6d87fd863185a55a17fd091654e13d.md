The two primary treatment options in the United States for infantile spasms are corticotropin (ACTH) and vigabatrin. Other steroid regimens sometimes are administered, and additional steroid regimens are being studied. Other antiepileptic medications are utilized at times; however, these medications are not considered standard first-line treatment. Developmental delay and regression is a significant comorbidity of infantile spasms, and appropriate therapies to maximize development should be utilized.

Infantile spasms often are difficult to treat with some patients needing a repeat course of therapy or a second therapy. Response to therapy is followed by evaluating for ongoing clinical spasm events and periodically re-evaluating EEG findings. If an underlying etiology for the spasms is identified, treatment of this etiology is important as well. This may include surgical intervention for a focal abnormality identified on imaging or, if available, targeted therapy for an underlying genetic or metabolic disease. The timing of surgical intervention should be discussed among the medical team as such surgeries may delay the use of ACTH and/or other steroid therapies.
