Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 (APS-1), also known as autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED), is characterized by the triad of hypoparathyroidism, Addison disease, and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. APS-1 is due to mutations in the autoimmune regulatory gene (AIRE); so far about 60 different mutations have been described. This is a potentially underdiagnosed condition due to the rarity and enormous variability in its presentation. Besides the above triad, a host of other autoimmune diseases may present with APS-1. This activity describes the pathophysiology, presentation, and diagnosis of autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type I.
- Describe the presentation of polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type I.
- Outline the treatment and management options for polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type I.
- Explain the importance of improving coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type I.
