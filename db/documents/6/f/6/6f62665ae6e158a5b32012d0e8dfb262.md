Shellfish allergies can occur due to immunologic or non-immunological processes, and individuals may react to crustaceans, such as crab or shrimp, or mollusks, such as clams or scallops, or both. About 14% of individuals are allergic to both crustaceans and mollusks. Therapy is directed by the patient's presentation and underlying etiology. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of shellfish allergies and emphasizes the role of the interprofessional team approach in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of shellfish allergies.
- Summarize the exam findings typically seen in patients with shellfish allergies.
- Review the management strategies for shellfish allergies.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients with shellfish allergies.
