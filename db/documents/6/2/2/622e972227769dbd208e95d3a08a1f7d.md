Most meningiomas are sporadic in origin, but some have been associated with certain conditions and risk factors. Environmental factors such as obesity, alcoholism, exposure to ionizing radiation, radiotherapy, hormonal factors such as exposure to exogenous hormones, hormonal replacement therapy, use of oral contraceptive pills, and breast cancer can increase the risk of incidence of meningiomas.

Meningiomas express progesterone, estrogen, and androgen receptors on their membranes.
