For treatment of open-angle glaucoma, bimatoprost ophthalmic solution should be initially monitored with regular clinic visits every 2 to 4 weeks until the patient's individualized target IOP is achieved. After the IOP goal is reached, the patient can be reassessed every six months or at the clinician's discretion. Additional parameters to monitor include ocular peri-ocular pigmentation changes.

When using bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0.03% dermally for hypotrichosis, monitoring for potential side effects is advised.  When bimatoprost is discontinued, eyelashes may return to their original pre-treatment length and thickness.
