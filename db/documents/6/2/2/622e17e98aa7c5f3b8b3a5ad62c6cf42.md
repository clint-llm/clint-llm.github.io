The prognosis for ethanol toxicity depends on multiple factors, including chronicity of use, degree of intoxication, associated traumatic injuries, and end-organ damage. Patients who have uncomplicated ethanol toxicity have a good prognosis and need to be counseled on abstinence. Most of the chronic complications that can develop from ethanol toxicity can be helped and sometimes reversed with alcohol abstinence.
