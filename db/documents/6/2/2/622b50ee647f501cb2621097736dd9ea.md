Weight loss should be encouraged in patients with OSA. They should be counseled to avoid alcohol, benzodiazepines, opiates, and some antidepressants, which may worsen their condition. Additionally, they should be made aware of the importance of proper sleep hygiene, getting enough sleep every night, and the risks of driving while sleepy. Adherence to CPAP use should be encouraged as well as how to clean and maintain the machine properly.
