Most patients with lumbosacral disc injury will present to the emergency department, primary care provider, or nurse practitioner. While most patients can be managed with conservative care, it is important to refer patients with neurological deficits to the orthopedic surgeon. The primary care providersÂ should educate these patients on preventing lumbosacral pain by lowering body weight, exercising regularly, and avoiding tobacco. Unfortunately, patient compliance is poor, and relapse of low back pain is very common. Surgery only helps a select few but is also associated with serious complications that can result in permanent disability.
