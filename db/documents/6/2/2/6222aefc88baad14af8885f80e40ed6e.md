There is no difference in the treatment of cancers in LFS and other cancers that occur sporadically. Advancement in the treatment of childhood cancers has increased the long-term survival for most children. Usual complications in survivors include second primary malignancies, which mostly occur within 6 to 12 years after the first cancer.

A second cancer may occur due to genetic predispositions such as constitutional TP53 mutations. The risk for a second cancer increases with younger age at diagnosis of first cancer. Second cancer risk increases with radiation exposure, so these individuals should avoid or minimize exposure to diagnostic and therapeutic radiation when possible. They have a predilection for developing subsequent primary tumors (especially sarcomas) in prior radiation fields.

The cumulative probability of a person affected by LFS developing a second cancer is close to 60% at 30 years after developing the first cancer.
