Calcium gluconate is the calcium salt of gluconic acid. Gluconic acid is an oxidation product of glucose. There is 93 mg of elemental calcium in a 10 ml ampoule of 10% calcium gluconate. In comparison, there is 272 mg of elemental calcium in a 10 mL of 10% solution of calcium chloride, another calcium salt. Calcium gluconate is typically preferred over calcium chloride due to the lower risk of tissue necrosis if the fluid is extravasated.

- Calcium gluconate is typically administered intravenously (IV) or orally in treating hypocalcemia, cardiac arrest, or cardiotoxicity due to hyperkalemia or hypermagnesemia.

- Calcium gluconate has also been used off-label in the management of Î²-blocker toxicity, calcium-channel blocker (CCB) toxicity, magnesium toxicity, and hydrofluoric acid burns.
