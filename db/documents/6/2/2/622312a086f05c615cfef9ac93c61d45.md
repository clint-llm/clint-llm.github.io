Surgical resection is the primary therapy for BSNS. However, the operative surgeon may need to leave positive margins of the tumor to limit the violation of critical structures like the orbit or skull base.

Both endoscopic and open-surgical approaches have been described, and the most appropriate approach depends on the location and extent of the tumor and the surgeon's preference. Open approaches include bifrontal craniotomy and lateral rhinotomy.

If present, resulting skull base defects may be repaired with autologous tissue, such as a pedicled pericranial flap or synthetic dural repair grafts.
