NK cells are considered the equivalent of CD8 positive T lymphocytes in the innate immune system and multiple cell markers are used for their characterization in immunocytochemistry staining. Natural killer cells are usually classified as CD3 negative and CD56 positive cells and subdivided into CD56dim and CD56bright groups. CD56dim and CD56bright subsets are defined based on the density of CD56 and have distinct functional attributes.

About 90% of circulating and spleen natural killer cells are CD56dim, CD16 positive, and express perforin. CD56dim cells mainly perform a cytotoxic action and CD16 mediates ADCC. In comparison, NK cells in lymph nodes (LNs) and peripheral lymphoid organs (e.g., tonsils) are CD56bright and CD16 negative. CD56 bright cells are mainly cytokine secreting cells and have the capacity to produce several cytokines, including IFN-Î³ (gamma-interferon) upon stimulation.
