Longarm splints are used in a variety of settings for immobilization of both bony and soft tissue injuries to the upper extremities. This type of splint provides immobilization to the elbow and the wrist. As a result, elbow flexion and extension and wrist flexion, extension, forearm supination/pronation can be restricted. Long arm splints are often the initial form of immobilization placed on an injured limb to accommodate soft tissue swelling before more definitive treatment with a cast or surgical fixation.
