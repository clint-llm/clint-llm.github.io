Venous stenting is recognized as a possible treatment to help assist patients with symptomatic iliocaval venous obstruction as an alternative to traditional surgery. Iliocaval venous obstruction contributes to the morbidity of chronic venous insufficiency and chronic venous hypertension. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of patients with obstructive iliocaval venous obstruction. It highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients who undergo iliac vein stenting.

**Objectives:**
- Review the risk factors in identifying patients with iliocaval vein obstruction that benefit from iliiocaval venous stent placement.
- Summarize the current trials relating to iliocaval venous stent placement.
- Explain the common complications associated with iliocaval venous stents.
- Outline the importance of monitoring for post iliocaval venous stenting patients to minimize complications from anticoagulation or early stent failure.
