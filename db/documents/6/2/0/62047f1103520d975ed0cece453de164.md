The dural venous sinuses develop accordingly with the meningeal layers of the brain, specifically the dura mater. The superior petrosal sinus develops last in the major sinuses and is derived from the mesencephalic vein, a pro-otic vein, during the development of the cerebellum.

The superior petrosal sinus attains its position in the adult brain by the physical expansion of the growing temporal lobe during development. Early in development, the superior petrosal sinus, oculomotor nerve, and trochlear nerve are close to the anterior dural fold and well in front of the otic capsule. As the temporal lobe grows, it presses the anterior tentorial layer backward, pushing the superior petrosal sinus towards the otic capsule. Thus, the cranial nerves and the superior petrosal sinus attain their adult positions along the border of the otic capsule.
