The prognosis of periodontal disease depends on the stage and grade of the disease, the presence of contributory factors, and the treatment and management of the disease. The higher the stage and the more rapidly progressive the grade, the worse the prognosis of the disease.

The guide used to determine the prognosis of the disease was developed by McGuire and is used to predict the survival of individual teeth. Based on a combination of factors, each tooth is given a score of good, fair, poor, questionable, or hopeless.

The guide makes use of factors such as patient age, medical status, oral hygiene status, socioeconomic status, type and distribution of bone loss, and current periodontal condition
