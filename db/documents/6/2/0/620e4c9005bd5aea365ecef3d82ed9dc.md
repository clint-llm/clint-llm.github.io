The ice-pack sign is considered pathognomonic for brachioradial pruritus. The test is simple and involves placing an ice-pack to the affected area. The patient should report immediate improvement of pruritus that returns shortly after the removal of the ice-pack.

Evaluations beyond a thorough history and physical and the ice-pack test are typically unnecessary. Imaging, blood tests, and referrals to appropriate specialists may be required in recalcitrant cases. Imaging modalities such as x-ray, CT, and MRI usually are not required. If imaging of the cervical spine is desired, MRI is the preferred modality. Screening blood work for causes of chronic pruritus can be performed. Referral to neurology for further examinations may be appropriate if a neurological cause is suspected. Neurological examinations include cervical spine imaging and electromyography (EMG).
