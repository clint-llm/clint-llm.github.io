Fungal infections have become a much more significant issue globally, and research is accordingly directing its efforts to answer this problem, especially as antimicrobial resistance increases.

Overseeing and managing antifungal therapy with conazole drugs requires an interprofessional team approach. Clinicians (physicians, PAs, NPs) will prescribe or order the medication as appropriate for various infections, including cutaneous fungal infections such as athlete’s foot, dandruff, and tinea versicolor. It is also useful for more invasive fungal infections such as blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, and coccidioidomycosis.

Due to interactions with many other drugs metabolized by CYP enzymes, physicians and pharmacists need to communicate about the patient’s medications to be certain that there will be little or no adverse events due to drug-drug interactions. Nursing will coordinate with the clinician and pharmacy staff and provide patient counsel and answer questions, referring the patient to the pharmacist if necessary. Using an interprofessional team approach is vital to ensuring the safety of the patient. Therefore all healthcare workers need to coordinate their activities and share information to monitor the patient to get the most beneficial health outcomes.
