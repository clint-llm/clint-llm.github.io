Multiple etiological factors are involved with such bony dyscrasias. Bone remodeling occurs locally within the otic capsule with bone resorption followed by bone deposition in the focus lesions.

Osteolytic osteocytes appear on the leading edge of the lesion, and connective tissue sheets can be seen replacing the bone. Dense sclerotic bone formation in areas of the previous resorption signifies the late phase of otosclerosis. The result is disorganized bone, the increased number of osteocytes, and widened marrow spaces consisting of vessels and other connective tissue.

Marrow spaces are later replaced by dense sclerotic bone with narrow vasculature and few recognizable Haversian systems. Pleomorphism is due to the normal coexistence of both stages of otosclerosis in any single temporal bone. The initiating lesion often neighbors the fissula ante fenestram and expand via vascular channels.
