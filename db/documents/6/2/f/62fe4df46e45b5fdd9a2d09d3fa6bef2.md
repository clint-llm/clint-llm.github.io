The etiology of seizures can sometimes be difficult to find. Some known causes of seizures includeÂ the following:

- Developmental abnormalities

- Vascular lesions/AV malformations

- Brain tumors

- Meningitis/focal encephalitis

- Head Trauma

- Hypoxic brain injury

- Postsurgical changes

- Electrolyte imbalance

- Endocrine disorders

- Medications and toxins

- Genetic

Seizures can be brought on by certain situations or triggers. Some common triggers include tiredness and lack of sleep, stress, alcohol, fever, acute medical illness, substance abuse, and medication noncompliance.

A common cause of seizures in childhood is a perinatal hypoxic brain injury. In adolescents, seizures are most commonly caused by head trauma and encephalitis. Brain tumors are the most common etiology of seizures in middle-aged adults, and vascular dementia and encephalopathies are the most common etiology in older adults.
