Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive (AR) disorder that commonly affects the White population with an annual incidence of approximately 1 in 3,500 live births. This multisystem disorder is characterized by genetic mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene on chromosome 7, which encrypts a protein essential for the regulation of transmembrane chloride reabsorption. This activity focuses mainly on the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of patients with cystic fibrosis and liver disease. It highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis and liver disease. 
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with cystic fibrosis and liver disease.
- Explain the management of the patient with cystic fibrosis and liver disease and its complications. 
- Describe the importance of interprofessional team approach and closed loop communication by primary care providers, hepatologists, pulmonologists, nutritionists, radiologists and surgeons to achieve optimal patient results.
