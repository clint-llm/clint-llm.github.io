Precocious puberty requires differentiation from the benign forms of puberty.

- Premature Thelarche: It is the premature unilateral or bilateral development of the breast tissue in girls between the age of 12 to 24 months. There are no other associated pubertal changes. Bone age, growth velocity, and biochemical testing are normal. It is usually a diagnosis of exclusion. Frequent clinical follow up to monitor growth, and pubertal progression is required.

- Premature Adrenarche: The early production of adrenal androgens characterizes this benign condition. It presents with pubic or axillary hair, body odor, or acne before the age of 8 years.Â  There is no breast development in females and no testicular enlargement in males. Bone age is usually not advanced. It is essential to rule out exposure to androgen sources such as creams or gels, adrenal tumors, and late-onset CAH.

- Premature Menarche: Isolated premature menarche is the onset of vaginal bleeding in girls less than 7 years of age. They may present with either a single episode or few cycles (less than 3) of bleeding and have normal progression to puberty. Recent studies have suggested no effect on adult height. Sexual abuse, vaginal foreign body, and infections of the vulva and vagina need to be ruled out.
