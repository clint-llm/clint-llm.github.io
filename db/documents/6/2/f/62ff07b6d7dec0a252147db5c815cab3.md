Statins are now well-established drugs with proven effectiveness in reducing adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. There is no antidote to reverse the myopathy or rhabdomyolysis caused by statins. The general treatment is supportive and comprises immediate discontinuation of the offending drug. Aggressive fluid management is the cornerstone of therapy.

All patients need continual follow-ups to monitor for hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury. The patient may receive a discharge once electrolytes return to normal and there is no renal dysfunction. The decision to restart a statin requires good clinical judgment. Only the lowest dose of another statin should be used, and one should avoid the concomitant use of fibrates. The patient should be monitored for muscle pain and routine urine and blood tests to ensure muscle breakdown is not recurring. The statin-associated autoimmune myopathy will require aggressive immunosuppression with steroids, methotrexate, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or rituximab.
