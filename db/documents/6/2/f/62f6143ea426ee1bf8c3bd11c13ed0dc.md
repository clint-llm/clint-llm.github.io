Outside of anemia, MCV along with red blood cell distribution is thought to help determine the risk of cardiovascular events after surgery and/or blood transfusions. Findings are that after surgery and/or blood transfusion, patients with macrocytic anemia or microcytic anemia have a higher risk than patients with normocytic anemia. These values together may help prevent cardiovascular events due to closer monitoring after these procedures.
