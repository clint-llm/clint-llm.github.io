Patients diagnosed with hearing loss should be managed by a multidisciplinary team of otolaryngologists, audiologists, speech-language pathologists, pediatricians, and primary care physicians. Children with suspected hearing loss should be immediately referred for proper hearing screening, genetic testing, and hearing augmentation with hearing assistive devices and/or speech rehabilitation to promote long-term speech and language outcomes.

Long-term monitoring of childhood development should be undertaken by the pediatrician by regular follow-up with audiology for routine hearing aid and audiogram assessments. Formal peer support groups with hearing loss can aid children and parents in addressing their concerns. The school system should alsoÂ provide an optimal learning environment in the classroom for children with hearing impairments.
