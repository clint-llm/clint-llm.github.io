A proper history and physical examination should be followed by:

- Detailed neuroophthalmological evaluation including testing for visual acuity and the field of vision

- Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain

- Echocardiogram and carotid doppler to rule out the cardiovascular cause of stroke

- Visual evoked potential in confusing cases and pediatric patients
