Laboratory tube collection is a process applied when withdrawing blood samples from patients before they get tested in the laboratory. It follows the principle, which is most commonly known as the "order of draw." Different tests and biochemical assays require varying types of sample collection tubes. The reason why tubes are color-coded is for practical and easy identification.

In-vitro analysis of blood samples can be performed in clinical laboratories. However, these blood samples come in different forms. Testing procedures can require any of the following blood sample types: serum or plasma. In performing multiple collections of venous and/or arterial blood samples in a single patient, a color sequence of withdrawing and its indications based on the Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) is the recommended procedure.

**Yellow, Pink, and Blue**

These colors indicate the color of the culture bottles necessary for blood culture. These tubes (bottles) contain sodium polyanethole sulfonate (SPS), which serves as an anticoagulant. The primary function of this anticoagulant is to inhibit the activation of complement function.

**Light Blue**

The "citrate tube" is for collecting blood for performing coagulation studies. It contains 3.2% sodium citrate as its anticoagulant.

**Red**

There is no anticoagulant or additive inside the tube. Because of the contact of blood with the surface of the tube, the coagulation cascade becomes activated. Blood is allowed to clot for 10 to 15 minutes before subjecting to centrifugation to separate the clot from the serum further. Clotting time differs between specimens and may range from 10 minutes to almost an hour (60 minutes).

**Green**

The green tubes contain heparin (can either be in the form of sodium heparin, lithium heparin, or ammonium heparin), which acts as an anticoagulant by inhibiting thrombin formation. Unlike red tubes, the type of blood produced in a green tube needed for testing is not serum but plasma. Green tubes are frequently used in requesting "stat" or immediate blood chemistry results for emergency cases.

**Lavender**

The lavender tube is also referred to as EDTA tubes because it uses ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetic acid. The primary role of EDTA in anticoagulation is by chelating calcium ions in the blood to prevent it from coagulation. Since the blood did not clot, the liquid portion (without the red cell) is a plasma. Lavender tubes are commonly used in collecting blood samples for hematologic assays.

**Grey**

The grey tubes contain potassium oxalate that binds to calcium, thus, inhibiting coagulation. Another substance, sodium fluoride, is also contained in the tubes, which serve as an antiglycolytic agent.

Apart from these more commonly used collection tubes, other colored tubes (gold, tiger, pink, gold, etc.) are also used in actual hospital and clinical practice. The use of these tubes and the order of draw vary among medical institutions.
