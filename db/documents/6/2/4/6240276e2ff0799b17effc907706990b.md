B2 agonist toxicity can be accidental or intentional. The most dangerous complication caused by its toxicity is hypokalemia caused by the intracellular shift of potassium. The toxicity can also present as exaggerations of documented side effects, such as significant hypotension and presence of bounding pulse due to greater affection of the diastolic portion, supraventricular tachycardia or ventricular extrasystoles, tremors which can rarely but possibly reach the level of seizures, hyperglycemia, and lactic acidosis, tachypnea, and pupillary dilation. Very high doses can lead to psychosis and hallucinations.

Beta-blockers such as propranolol and esmolol are considered antidotes for B2 agonist overdose as they antagonize the B2 receptor activation caused by them.

There are some causes related to B2 receptors for beta-blocker contraindication; the most important one is in patients with asthma as it would cause increased bronchial resistance, thus increasing symptoms of asthma and other bronchospastic diseases.
