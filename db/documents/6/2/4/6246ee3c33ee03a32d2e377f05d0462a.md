Nonbullous impetigo is most commonly caused by S aureus which is responsible for 80% of cases. Group A beta-hemolytic Strep (GABHS) accounts for 10% of cases and the causative agent is a combination of S. aureus and GABHS 10% of the time. Methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) has become more prevalent, especially in hospitalized patients. Today, community-acquired MRSA is rapidly increasing. The condition is more common in populations living in close quarters, daycare centers and prisons.

Bullous impetigo is caused almost exclusively by S aureus. Sometimes a deep ulcerated infection may occur known as ecthyma, which is a complication of bullous impetigo.
