The diagnosis of concussion remains a clinic one as it is based on a constellation of symptoms. Because of this, it would be recommended the team physician have experience in evaluating and managing concussions. An interprofessional team with clear communication between the athlete, parents, coaches, athletic training staff (if available), and the physician or nurse practitioner would be essential. It appears at this time a second impact syndrome is a preventable injury. It is thought if an athlete is allowed to fully recover from an initial concussion and not be allowed to return too quickly, the second impact event will be unlikely to occur. School nurses should participate in the education of patients and their families.

If a player goes down on the field from a suspected head injury, the on-field medical staff, emergency personnel, and the emergency room should communicate clearly in order to optimize the care of the injured athlete. Utilizing a standard communication tool like SBAR will allow for efficient and clear communication amongst the health care team. [Level 5]
