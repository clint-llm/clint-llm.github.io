Bivalirudin is a direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI) with specific actions indicated for intravenous (IV) anticoagulation in patients with acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and thrombosis in patients with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).****More recently, bivalirudin has been explored and utilized off-label in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis (ECMO).
