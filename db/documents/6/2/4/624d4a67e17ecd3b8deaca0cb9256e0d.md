Occupational health personnel or industrial hygienists should assess the workplace environment. Workers and artisans should maintain their head and face away from the fumes and avoid breathing them. Also, it is often necessary to increase ventilation in the work zone and provide sufficient exhaust in the area where people are working. Workers should wear appropriate protective masks and work clothing. Safety education must be in place wherever welding is ongoing. In the United States, one may request a Health Hazard Evaluation involving the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), including a workplace visit. N95 masks have become standard protection for welders, but are not as effective as elastomeric half-face masks, full-face respirators, and powered air-purifying respirators.

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has recommended 5 mg per cubic meter averaged over a 10-hour shift and 40-hour work week. According to NIOSH, the maximum for short-term 15-minute exposure is 10 mg per cubic meter.
