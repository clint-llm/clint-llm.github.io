Pneumocystis first appeared in Europe following World War II as a cause of pneumonia in premature and malnourished infants in orphanages. Not much was known about the organism then; after the HIV epidemic during the 1980s, studies into this illness increased significantly. PCP is now known to affect patients worldwide and is spread from person to person via the airborne route. Although typically seen in immunocompromised individuals, PCP is rarely seen in those with functional and competent immune systems. Many risk factors for acquiring and developing PCP exist. Groups at a significantly higher risk of developing PCP are patients with cancer (most specificallyÂ hematologic malignancies), transplant patients who have undergone hematopoietic cell or solid organ transplants, patients undergoing treatment for certain inflammatory or rheumatologic conditions, or patients with any condition that results in defects in cell-mediated immunity.

The most significant risk factor for contracting PCP in HIV-uninfected patients is using glucocorticoids combined with immunosuppressive therapy. One study showed that of patients with a first-time PCP, 91% had used glucocorticoids within one month of infection.

PCP is most commonly described in HIV-infected individuals as an AIDS-defining illness. At the beginning of the HIV epidemic, rates of infections were documented as high as 20 per 100 persons in patients with CD4+ counts of less than 200 cells/microL. The decline in PCP rates began after 1989 with the introduction of primary prophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy at a rate of 3.4% per year between the1992 and 1995 and most dramatically between 1996 and 1998 at a rate of 21.5% per year. A 2016 published prospective cohort study of HIV-infected individuals calculated incidence rates of PCP per 1000 person-years of 29.9 from 1994 through 1997, 7.7 from 1998 through 2002, and 3.9 from 2003 through 2007. Although the infection rate has declined significantly in the United States and other industrialized countries, this opportunistic infection is a leading cause of significant infection in immunocompromised individuals.
