The majority of emergency medical service (EMS) providers in the United States have protocols for rapid assessment and treatment of pneumothorax. There are multiple treatment modalities available for use by prehospital providers with varying use by both levels of training and geographic location. No single accepted method is being performed on a national level. This activity reviews the treatment of pneumothorax and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of pneumothorax.
- Summarize the indications for a chest tube.
- Review the presentation of a patient with pneumothorax.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with pneumothorax.
