Treatment for Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome is supportive and eventually palliative. Clinicians should weigh the benefits of seizure management against the risk of side effects.  If prescribing anticonvulsants, the newer generation (lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, primidone) is the recommendation due to a lower hepatic processing burden. Valproic acid and sodium divalproate should be avoided to prevent accelerated hepatic damage. Impaired gluconeogenesis may lead to nutritional deficiencies.  Small, frequent, low-protein meals are recommended. Eventually, as the patient's disease progresses, a gastrostomy feeding tube can be offered to supplement nutritional status. Long-term respiratory support is often needed, with the use of tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation. Pain medications and muscle relaxants should be available to keep the patient comfortable.
