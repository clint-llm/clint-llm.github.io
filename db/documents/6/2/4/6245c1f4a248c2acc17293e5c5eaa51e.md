The act of swallowing can be impaired anywhere from the mouth to the opening of the stomach at the LES. Any pathological process that disrupts the structures involved in swallowing can pose significant clinical dysphagia. If prolonged and not managed early, dysphagia can lead to the consequences of malnutrition. Any lesion that presents near the esophagus and causes esophageal compression can mimic the usual symptoms of dysphagia. Some considerations include an enlarged thyroid gland, a cancer of the mediastinum, an enlarged left atrium, and previous surgery or radiation to that area.
