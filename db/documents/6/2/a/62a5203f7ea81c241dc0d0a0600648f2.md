Assessment of airway, breathing, and circulation are the initial priorities for all overdose patients. Intravenous access should be rapidly obtained as well as continuous cardiac monitoring and frequent vital signs. A 12-lead ECG should be obtained to assess for conduction abnormalities. Serum acetaminophen and salicylate concentrations should be obtained as these are common co-ingestants. Point-of-care blood glucose should be checked in any patients seizing or with altered mental status. Serum bupropion and hydroxybupropion concentrations are not routinely available or recommended.
