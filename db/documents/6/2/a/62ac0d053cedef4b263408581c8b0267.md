Present-day survival of patients after undergoing treatment is about 80% to 90%. The addition of radiation has made a significant difference in survival compared to the use of surgery alone. The primary research issue today in Wilms is to develop ways to prevent the drug toxicity associated with combination chemotherapy. Most children can live a normal life with one kidney.

Of note, recent studies indicate that in females who survive, there is an increased risk of developing invasive breast cancer at an early age (younger than 40). This risk was highest in females who had been previously treated with chest radiation.

Patients with anaplastic histology face a recurrent risk of about 50%. Even patients with low-risk histological features can expect a 15% recurrence rate. There is some controversy about the potential for a renal biopsy to spread the disease or increase the risk of local recurrence, but this has not yet been conclusively determined. When a recurrence is found, it most often affects the lungs and is usually early, most often within two years of the initial tumor discovery.

There is also a risk of delayed development of Wilms in the contralateral kidney, which is found in about 1% of patients, usually within two years of the initial discovery of the Wilms tumor in the original kidney. This is thought to be due to persistent focal nephrogenic rests in the contralateral kidney.

About 15% of patients with Wilms are at risk for a recurrence.  The majority of these will be found within the first 2 years after surgery.

Circulating tumor DNA may prove to be a useful diagnostic tool in diagnosing pediatric tumors like Wilms but is still investigational.

New chemotherapy drugs appear promising, such as topotecan and irinotecan, while stem cell transplants and targeted therapies represent promising new approaches to Wilms tumor treatment.
