Dermatophytes are a common cause of infection in humans. Once acquired, the fungus grows downwards in the stratum corneum and invades the keratin. The infected hair eventually becomes brittle and then break.

Immunosuppression may lead to impaired hair shaft growth and strength leading to easier colonization. Other associated diseases include:

- Diabetes mellitus

- Prolonged steroid use

- Cancer

- Immunosuppressant medications

- Anemia

It is worth mentioning that in HIV, the risk is not increasing due to competitive colonization with Malassezia.

Hair will typically get infected in one of three principal ways:

1) Endothrix: where the fungi affect the hair shaft - an example of this type: Trichophyton tonsurans

2) Ectothrix: where the fungi affect the outer sheath root - an example of this type: Microsporum canis

3) Favus: where there is an inflammatory reaction, crusting or scutula, and hair loss - an example of this type: Trichophyton schoenleinii
