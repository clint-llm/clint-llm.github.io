Minor pectus excavatum defects are usually asymptomatic, thus without complications.  More severe defects can, however, negatively impact cardiopulmonary function, presenting with variety of symptoms:

- chest pain

- fatigue

- exertional dyspnea

- recurrent respiratory tract infections

- asthma

- palpitations

- heart murmur (mitral regurgitation)

- arrythmia

- syncope

Complications are more commonly appreciated in patients who undergo surgical correction of the defect:

- migration of the sternal bar

- infection

- pneumothorax

- bleeding

- cardiac laceration

- chronic pain

- recurrence

Overall morbidity and length of stay are comparable for Ravitch and Nuss procedures, according to a recent meta-analysis.et al included the Ravitch, Nuss, and Leonard procedures.  The analysis clearly demontrated increased LOS, costs, narcotic use, and complications with the Nuss cohort.
