Roth spots are most often asymptomatic and detected during a routine dilated eye examination. Visual disturbance due to Roth spots is rare but can occur with macular involvement. The majority of white centered retinal hemorrhages will resolve without intervention. Treatment is aimed at the underlying cause and is often supportive. The most important management consideration in patients with Roth spots is the identification of the causative etiology to prevent possible ocular and systemic complications that may occur due to the underlying disease. Follow-up with an ophthalmologist is an important consideration in patients in whom Roth spots are discovered during acute illness.
