Balanitis is a descriptive diagnostic term for a heterogeneous class of inflammatory or infectious dermatoses which require differentiation from potentially malignant conditions. Causes of balanitis include Candida spp. and bacterial infections, including anaerobic bacteria, viral infections, parasites and other sexually transmitted infections (STI) also must be considered.

**Skin conditions**may also trigger the condition.

Examples can include:

- Lichen planus, a skin pathology with small, itchy, pink, or purple spots on the arms or legs

- Psoriasis, a dry, scaly skin disorder

- Eczema, a chronic or long-term dermal condition that can result in itchy, reddened, cracked, and dry skin

- Dermatitis, an inflammatory skin condition, due to direct contact with an irritant or allergen

In very rare cases, balanitis has been linked to skin cancer.

There are three types of balanitis:

**Zoon's balanitis:**inflammation of the glans penis and the foreskin. Usually affects middle-aged to older uncircumcised men.

**Circinate balanitis:**associated with reactive arthritis, characterized by****small, shallow, painless ulcerative lesions on the glans penis.****A biopsy can show pustules in the upper epidermis, similar in appearance to pustular psoriasis.  There may also be a serpiginous annular dermatitis that often has a grayish white granular appearance with a "geographical" white margin.

**Pseudoepitheliomatous keratotic and micaceous balanitis**: A condition characterized by scaly, wart-like skin lesions on the head of the penis.
