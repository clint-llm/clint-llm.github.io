Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract and is divided into Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. It occurs in genetically susceptible individuals after an exaggerated immune response to a normal stimulus such as food and intestinal flora. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of inflammatory bowel disease and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the epidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease.
- Describe the role of the intestinal immune system in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.
- Identify bloody diarrhea, tenesmus, and abdominal pain in the history of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by inflammatory bowel disease.
