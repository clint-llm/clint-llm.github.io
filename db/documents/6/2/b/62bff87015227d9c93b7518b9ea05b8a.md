Lung volume reduction surgery is performed for patients with end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to try and improve the quantity and quality of life. The population is growing and there have been several trials to improve patient selection for which subgroup can potentially benefit the most from lung volume reduction surgery. This activity reviews lung volume reduction surgery and highlights the role of an interprofessional healthcare team in evaluating and treating patients who undergo lung volume reduction surgery.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications of lung volume reduction surgery.
- Describe the equipment, preparation, and surgical technique in regards to lung volume reduction surgery.
- Review potential post-operative care for lung volume reduction surgery.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among an interprofessional healthcare team to ensure the appropriate selection of candidates for lung volume reduction surgery and to improve postoperative care and outcomes.
