Treatment failure is common, and isolating the cause can help prevent further infection and limit outbreaks in communities.

Regardless of symptoms, all close contacts must receive treatment to prevent reinfection. Many states have legalized Expedited Partner Therapy, which allows physicians to write prescriptions for close contacts of a patient with scabies. This law applies if scabies is considered a sexually transmitted infection in that state. Patients and close contacts should also decontaminate beddings, towels, and clothing at the time that treatment is received

Nonadherence to the treatment regimen is another cause of persistent infection. If topical permethrin cream is the chosen treatment option, it is to be applied to the entire body from the neck down in children and adults. In infants, the whole body, including the head, is treated with permethrin cream. The cream should be left on the body for 8 hours, rinsed off, and reapplied one week later. Permethrin is scabicidal, and the second treatment assures that any missed spots from the first treatment are covered in the second

A common sequela that patients complain of is persistent itching after treatment, which may be attributable to treatment failure, misdiagnosis, or often cutaneous irritation. Other post-scabietic complaints include Id reaction also called auto-eczematization, and epidermal changes from topical treatments. Permethrin cream contains several potential allergens including formaldehyde, permethrin itself, and components of the cream base. Transient pruritis after treatment with oral ivermectin may occur and is due to the mass release of antigens following the destruction of the mites
