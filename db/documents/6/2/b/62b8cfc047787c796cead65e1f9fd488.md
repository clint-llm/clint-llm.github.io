Tocolysis is an obstetrical procedure to prolong gestation in patients, some of which are experiencing preterm labor. This is achieved through various medications that work to inhibit contractions of uterine smooth muscle. The main medications used are beta-adrenergic agonist receptors, calcium channel blockers, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, and magnesium sulfate. This activity reviews and evaluates tocolysis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing tocolysis.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for tocolysis.
- Summarize the different medications used for tocolysis.
- Review the risk factors for specific tocolysis medications.
