Topical oxygen therapy can be used as an adjunctive advanced modality to help to treat chronic wounds failing to respond to a trial of conservative management. Typical wound types that topically applied oxygen is indicated for and/or has demonstrated successful outcomes encompasses a wide range of wound types, including skin ulcerations due to:

- Diabetes

- Vascular ulcers

- Post-surgical infections

- Pressure injury

- Amputations and infected stumps

- Skin grafts

- Cellular tissue-based products

- Prevention of wound dehiscence

- Ischemic tissues

- Burns

- Frostbite

A critical component of wound care is assessment for associated arterial insufficiency. Arterial insufficiency can be the etiology of wound formation or be a limiting factor for the healing. Assessment for arterial insufficiency includes a complete history and physical exam. A screening ankle-brachial index is recommended for chronic lower extremity wounds. If arterial insufficiency is present, the patient should be referred for further workup by a vascular surgeon or specialist. Wounds with associated arterial insufficiency should be considered for revascularization before committing to treatment with hyperbaric or topical oxygen therapy. Following revascularization, topical oxygen therapy may still be indicated if the wound fails to respond to basic wound care.
