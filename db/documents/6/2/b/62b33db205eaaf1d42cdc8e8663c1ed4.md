Prominent compact hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, and acanthosis are the constant features found on histopathological examination of arsenical keratosis. Papillomatosis and vacuolated keratinocytes may be present. Keratinocyte atypia may or may not be seen, and its severity can vary from mild atypia to features of squamous cell carcinoma in situ, which is indistinguishable from Bowen's disease.

A similar histopathological picture can be seen in actinic keratosis, Bowen's disease, and verruca vulgaris.
