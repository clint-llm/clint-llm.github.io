The procedure is performed in a standard cardiac catheterization laboratory. An anesthesiologist, an imager, and the implanter are the main participants in the procedure. The patient is given general sedation to protect the airway during extended TEE imaging and prevent potential sudden movements by the patient, which may cause cardiac perforation while manipulating LAA. The C-arm fluoroscopy is positioned just to the left of the operator, allowing more freedom of movement for the echocardiographer, who sits at the head of the table. Echocardiographers and anesthesiologists are provided with appropriate radiation shielding. The operator can see TEE images in real-time with the ultrasound machine slaved to the boom.
