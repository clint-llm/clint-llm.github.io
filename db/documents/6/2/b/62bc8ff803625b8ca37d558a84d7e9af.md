Patients who undergo local excision using rectal microsurgery generally have better functional outcomes than transabdominal procedures. Nonetheless, fecal incontinence remains a possible complication often attributed to using a large-diameter proctoscope. Other potential sequelae include post-operative rectal bleeding, proctalgia,Â rectal stenosis, and pelvic inflammation or abscess.

In certain cases, free perforation into the abdominal cavity may occur, leading to peritonitis and the need for major transabdominal surgery. Generally, rectal microsurgery is considered very safe and far superior in terms of hospital stay and recovery compared to traditional mesorectal excision.
