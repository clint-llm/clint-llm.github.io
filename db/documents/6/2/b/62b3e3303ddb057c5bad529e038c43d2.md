Beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonists are a class of medications used in the frontline management and treatment of bronchial asthma and COPD. This activity outlines the significance, action, and current issues of concern for the beta-2 agonist as a valuable agent in managing bronchial asthma and COPD. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse effects, current topics of debate, and other key factors (e.g., tolerance, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics) relevant for interprofessional team members in the care of patients with asthma, COPD, and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the function and key concepts of beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonists.
- Describe the issues of concern in regards to beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonists.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of the clinical significance of beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonists.
- Identify interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance beta-2 adrenergic agonists and improve outcomes.
