SPs have become an integral aspect of healthcare education, and in fact, are aÂ required part of licensure in the United States. Step 2 CS, half of the second licensing exam, is a summative assessment, with medical students performing histories and physicals on multiple SPs. These SPs grade the learners on their interpersonal skills and appropriate questioning and physical examination.

Studies have demonstrated that OSCEs are more reliable in regards to assessing learners than traditional multiple-choice question tests.
