Operative vaginal delivery is used to expedite vaginal delivery for either maternal or fetal indication. Options for operative delivery include both vacuum-assisted and forceps deliveries, and options may be chosen based on physician comfort, and personalized base on the patient. Indications for operative delivery include maternal exhaustion, non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracing, a prolonged second stage of labor, or to shorten the second stage of labor in certain maternal conditions such as cardiovascular or neurological disease. Vacuum delivery is discouraged when delivering a fetus that is less than 34 weeks.
