The personnel required includes the usual operating room team of a nurse/circulator, a scrub tech responsible for preparing the surgical instruments, an anesthesiologist, a surgeon, and at least 1 or 2 surgical assistants such as residents, PAs, or students. Generally, one person controls the camera while the surgeon and an assistant perform the surgery.

Nursing is also required for both pre-operative care in the holding area and postoperative in the recovery area. These patients are generally admitted to the hospital following surgery for 1 to 2 days depending on the procedure they have and their post-operative condition.
