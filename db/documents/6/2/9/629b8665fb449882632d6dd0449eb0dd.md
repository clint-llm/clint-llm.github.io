Nephrolithiasis and ureterolithiasis do not always have a benign course. Infected kidney stones, sepsis, ureteral scarring, perforation, renal abscess formation, bleeding, impaired renal function, and obstruction are just some of its complications. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) can result from a urologic procedure or due to obstruction or due to the inherent cause of the stone formation. However, generally, the risk from ESRD is low from nephrolithiasis even in recurrent cases. Nephrolithiasis in pregnancy presents with additional complications and are associated with abortions, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes.
