Pegfilgrastim is the long-acting form of filgrastim, both of which are granulocyte colony-stimulating factors. Pegfilgrastim has a polyethylene glycol molecule covalently bound to it, which results in its prolonged duration of action. It helps prevent febrile neutropenia by increasingÂ the body's neutrophil level by inducing neutrophil proliferation, differentiation, and maturation. It also enhances the survival of mature neutrophils.
