As noted, the causes of venous and arterial thrombosis are multifactorial and context matters. Many acquired or modifiable risk factors can increase the likelihood of developing thrombosis. Patients should receive counseling regarding these risk factors and what they can do to ameliorate their risk. Patients who are known to have an underlying hypercoagulable state (e.g., those taking estrogen, pregnant women, or morbidly obese patients) should be informed of their risk of thrombosis. Patients should be counseled to avoid long periods of immobility (long trips) and to stretch often. The use of elastic compression stockings may be helpful. Smoking cessation should be reinforced.

For patients on anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy, it is prudent to conduct a review of the risks of major bleeding.  Patients should be counseled on fall precautions while on these agents.
