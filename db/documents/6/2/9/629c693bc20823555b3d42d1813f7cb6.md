Myoglobinuria is the presence of an excess amount of myoglobin in the urine. It is mostly caused by muscle breakdown, releasing a high amount of myoglobin in the blood. Myoglobinuria can lead to acute kidney injury. To avoid the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of myoglobinuria and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of myoglobinuria. 
- Explain the common physical exam findings associated with myoglobinuria.
- Summarize the common complications of myoglobinuria.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve patient outcomes affected by myoglobinuria.
