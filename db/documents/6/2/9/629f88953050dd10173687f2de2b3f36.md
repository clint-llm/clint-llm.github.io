Facet joint disease is often a clinical diagnosis, and therefore the history and physical exam are extremely important. Patients who present with chronic back pain have symptoms that often overlap with other diagnoses. Facet-mediated pain is typically non-radicular. The pain is often described by patients as worse in the mornings, upon awakening, or during periods of inactivity. It may also worsen with spine extension, facet joint palpation, and rotary trunk motion. Pain can be elicited by facet joint palpation and axial loading. Reproduction of the patient’s pain with Kemp’s maneuver, lateral rotation, lateral bending, and back extension, is suggestive of facet joint disease and arthropathy. In the lumbar area, this pain can be unilateral but is typically axial with occasional radiation into the buttock, groin, and thighs and down to the knee.
