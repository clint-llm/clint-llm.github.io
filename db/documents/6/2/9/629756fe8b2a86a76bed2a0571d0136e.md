The fovea centralis is located in the center of the macula lutea, a small, flat spot located exactly in the center of the posterior portion of the retina. As the fovea is responsible for high-acuity vision it is densely saturated with cone photoreceptors.

Rods are completely absent from the fovea centralis and are more abundant on the periphery of the retina. Rod vision is more sensitive than cone vision, and for this reason, one can see a faint object better if they look slightly to one side rather than looking directly at it. One real-world example of this strategy is demonstrated by how pilots see other aircraft while flying at night. Pilots are taught to routinely survey their surroundings and be aware of other aircraft in the sky. At night, they are taught to look slightly to the side of the area they are examining to better detect the lights of other faraway aircraft.
