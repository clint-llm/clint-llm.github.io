Healthy patients without structural heart disease who experience infrequent PVCs have the same prognosis as the general population. However, those with frequent PVCs (> 1000/day) are at risk of developing dilated cardiomyopathy.

For those with heart disease, PVCs are an indicator of increased mortality risk.

PVCs occurring during a period of exercise have a varying prognosis, depending on when they occur. If the PVCs occur during exercise, the prognosis is very good. If they occur during the recovery phase of exercise, the long-term risk of mortality is higher than the general population.

In general, PVCs that occur in patients with left ventricular dysfunction are associated with high mortality. In addition, PVCs that are not inducible during an EP study is of low risk for sudden death.

There are major limitations in the literature for studying the prognosis of PVCs. Many patients have subclinical heart disease or long-term risk factors that alter prognosis.
