Several conditions may predispose to an increased risk of UTIs in both men and women.

- Anatomical defects that lead to stasis, obstruction, urinary reflux all result in an increased predisposition to recurrent urinary tract infections.

- Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is identified in up to 40% of children being investigated for a first UTI.

- Cystoceles and pelvic organ prolapse are important risk factors for recurrent UTIs in women.

- Functional defects, like overactive bladder and urinary incontinence, tend to lead to recurrent infections.

- Recurrent urinary tract infections may be commonly seen in sexually active women without any identifiable structural abnormality or another predisposing condition.

- Older men can often develop urinary tract infections due to outflow obstruction or neurogenic bladder resulting in urinary stasis and an increased risk of recurrent infection.

- Several other lesions may predispose to recurrent UTIs, including intraluminal (bladder stones, neoplasms, indwelling catheters, stents, foreign bodies), intramural (ureteral stenosis/strictures), and extramural lesions (inflammatory mass, fibrosis, extrinsic mass effect, or neoplasm).

Immunodeficiency typically does not lead to isolated recurrent UTIs.
