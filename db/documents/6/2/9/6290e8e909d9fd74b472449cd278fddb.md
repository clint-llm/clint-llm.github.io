In general, SD is a benign condition, although it can cause worsening and recurrent chronic skin lesions, resistant to treatment.

There are infrequent reports of patients with SD that developed mycosis fungoides presented as SD. Clinical and histopathological properties shared some similarities. Although it is rare to develop mycosis fungoides after an initial diagnosis of SD this could be suspected when has a long-lasting course (>1 year), and follow-up could be made every year.

Emotional stress and psychological trauma can come due to the longstanding pigmentation in the skin leading to depression and anxiety in some patients.
