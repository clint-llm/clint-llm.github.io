The diagnosis and management of MIS-C require an interprofessional team approach. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and is often a diagnosis of exclusion in patients with known COVID-19 exposure. Neonatal intensivists need to consider the possibility of MIS-C in neonates with in-utero exposure to COVID-19.

The initial evaluation is often by a neonatologist or pediatric intensivist. Once the diagnosis is made, a multidisciplinary approach involving pediatric or neonatal intensivist, pediatric cardiology, pediatric infectious disease, pediatric rheumatology, and pediatric hematology is essential for the management of the presentation as well as the potential complications. The interprofessional team approach is vital to improve the outcomes for patients.

Current evidence on the pathophysiology of neonatal MIS-C is scarce and contradicting. Therefore, well-structured diagnostic criteria and management approaches are needed. A deeper understanding of pathophysiology may lead to better treatment strategies. Data sharing is crucial to formulate optimal treatment approaches.
