The differential diagnosis of rectal bleeding should include consideration for more proximal sources of bleeding, especially the colon. Consideration should be given to colon cancer, angiodysplasia, adenomas, inflammatory bowel disease, infectious, and ischemic colitis. Once the colonic causes have been ruled out, other important etiologies to consider include hemorrhoids, anal fissures, rectal carcinoma, and radiation-induced proctitis.
