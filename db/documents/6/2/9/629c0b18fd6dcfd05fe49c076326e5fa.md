The elbow joint, although non-weight bearing, may be the most complex joint in the human body. The elbow is a synovial hinge joint made up of articulations of mainly the distal humerus and the proximal ulna. However, articulations exist between the proximal radius and the humerus as well as the proximal radius and ulna.Â  The three articulations are referred to as the ulnohumeral, radiohumeral, and proximal radioulnar joints respectively. Many of the muscles of both the upper and lower arm either cross or attach to at least one component of the elbow joint making it no surprise that after the shoulder, the elbow joint is the second most commonly injured joint in sports-related injuries.
