The embryologic development of the lymphatic system begins with the embryonic veins. Lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) progenitors develop throughout the venous system and bud from the veins to form the early lymphatic system. The LEC progenitors are produced in the superficial venous plexuses, inter-somatic veins, and cardinal veins. The buds off of the veins create sacs as they enlarge, and eventually evolve to form the lymphatic vasculature. This process starts during week nine and is complete by week 16 of embryonic development.

Throughout disease processes, the lymphatic vessels undergo remodeling to promote the optimal functioning of the body. When lymphangiogenesis occurs, the diameter of the new vessels have larger diameters and have less permeability. This decreased permeability is the result of a change in the cell to cell junctions forming more of a “zipper” and less of a “button” shape.
