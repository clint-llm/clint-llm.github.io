Tooth fractures occur predominantly in children and young people, accounting for 5% of all traumatic dental injuries. Management of tooth fracture requires an accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and regular follow-ups.

Tooth fractures mostly involve front teeth in the upper jaw because of their position in the oral cavity. The most common causes are sports activities, traffic accidents, and physical violence.
