The diagnosis of coral toxicity has no confirmatory study or imaging. It is a clinical diagnosis based mostly on a clear history of preceding exposure to PTX containing coral species and the symptomatology that follows. There is a wide variety of possible presentations; therefore, a strong history and clinical suspicion make the foundation for an accurate diagnosis.

PTX has been successfully isolated by the use of high-performance liquid chromatography in some public health cases. However, there is no qualitative or quantitative test used to access human toxicity, and  PTX is not isolated for diagnosis in patients. Recent reports indicate a negative culture for an infectious cause and a temporal relationship to palytoxin exposure. The evaluation of the patient depends upon the mode of exposure and the clinical presentations. This assessment may include an electrocardiogram and respiratory monitoring.
