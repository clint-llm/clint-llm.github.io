Cystic kidney diseases (CKD) have several etiologies: developmental, inherited, acquired, and systemic disease-related. Inherited CKDs involve autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), which is one of the most common cystic kidney diseases caused by PKD1 and PKD2 mutations and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) caused by PKHD1 mutations.

Developmental cystic kidney disease is caused due to abnormal development of the metanephrosÂ leading to a multicystic dysplastic kidney, with reduced nephron induction.

Another cause of renal cysts is related to systemic diseases such as tuberous sclerosis (TS) and von Hippel Lindau (VHL) syndrome, which are autosomal dominant conditions with variable penetrance. Acquired cystic kidney disease develops secondary to obstruction of the tubules by fibrosis or oxalate crystals.

Unilateral cystic kidney disease is a rare disease characterized by multiple cysts and is similar to ADPKD in both imaging and pathological examinations.
