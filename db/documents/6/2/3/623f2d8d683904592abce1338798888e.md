As mentioned above, women should undergo routine screening to identify NTD early and help with therapeutic intervention and counseling. Initial screening is done with serum AFP, but in cases of high suspicion amniocentesis can be pursued for confirmation. However, given the risk of amniocentesis and accuracy of ultrasound, the latter has become the gold standard for diagnosis in-utero. Several ultrasound signs have been identified as reliably diagnostic. The small biparietal diameter has been associated with NTD. However, the most cited signs include the lemon sign and banana sign. The lemon sign describes the overlapping of the frontal bones due to a posterior shift of intracranial contents. The banana sign is that of a curved cerebellum due to its downward displacement often leading to Arnold-Chiari II malformation at birth.
