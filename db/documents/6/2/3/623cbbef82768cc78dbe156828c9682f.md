Pulmonary hypoplasia is a relatively uncommon medical condition characterized by incomplete development of the lungs that can affect the overall development of the child. It can be either primary (idiopathic) or secondary to other congenital anomalies and usually leads to severe respiratory insufficiency in the fetus. This activity describes the pathogenesis, clinical, radiological features and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of hypoplastic lung disease.
- Outline the typical presentation of patients with hypoplastic lung disease.
- Summarize the typical imaging findings associated with pulmonary hypoplasia.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by hypoplastic lung disease.
