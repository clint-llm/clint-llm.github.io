Laboratory testing is rarely useful in patients with suspected esophageal webs or rings. It might be reasonable to obtain a complete blood count and iron studies to look for iron deficiency. However, patients with dysphagia need to be evaluated with barium swallow and/or upper endoscopy. Both procedures can help differentiate between the different etiologies of dysphagia.

A barium swallow is particularly useful in delineating the cause of the esophageal lumen obstruction. It can identify esophageal webs, rings, strictures, tumors, and extraesophageal compression. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is usually necessary for the confirmation of the diagnosis. On EGD, esophageal webs appear as thin membranes that do not span the entire circumference of the esophagus.
