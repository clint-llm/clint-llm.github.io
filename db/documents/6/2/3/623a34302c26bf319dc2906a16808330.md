Nitric oxide is a medication used to manage and treat hypoxic respiratory failure or persistent pulmonary hypertension in newborns. It is in the miscellaneous respiratory agent class of drugs. Its administration in the clinical scenario as an inhalant (iNO) for adjunctive rescue therapy and improved oxygenation of persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborns (PPHN) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Off labeled, it is used to treat acute bronchiolitis and as rescue therapy in patients with COVID-19 and severe ARDS after other alternatives have failed. This activity describes the indications, mechanism of action, and contraindications for nitric oxide as a valuable agent in treating PPHN. In addition, this activity will highlight the adverse effects, administration, and other key factors pertinent to interprofessional team members in treating neonatal patients with PPHN.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the importance of monitoring patients receiving inhaled nitric oxide therapy, including daily methemoglobin levels.
- Summarize the risks associated with initiating inhaled nitric oxide therapy.
- Identify and describe the appropriate measures needed to prevent adverse drug reactions with nitric oxide.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance patient care when dosing and monitoring nitric oxide to improve patient outcomes for patients receiving inhaled nitric oxide for persistent respiratory distress.
