Since its discovery, the HBR is considered major regulatory feedback for stimulating and maintaining rhythmic respiratory activity. As such, the HBR is an important respiratory control mechanism, particularly in newborns.

Despite this physiologic change and reduced need for the HBR to establish a respiratory rhythm, the HBR does still maintain important functionality among juvenile and adult animals. Primarily, sensory feedback regarding the tidal volume and lung expansion appear to be responsible for altering breathing patterns secondary to behavioral and emotional stressors (such as prolonged vocalization or abrupt physical exercise).
