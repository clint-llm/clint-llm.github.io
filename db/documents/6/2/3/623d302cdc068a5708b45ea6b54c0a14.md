Hypothalamic hamartomas may lead to systemic complications:

- Multiple disabling seizure types (tonic-clonic seizures, complex partial seizures, drop attacks)

- Cognitive decline

- Psychiatric symptoms (oppositional defiant disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and mood disorder)

- Developmental delay

- Short term memory

- Reduced processing speed

- Diminished intellectual disability

- Short stature

- Acne

The treatment modalities can lead to complications:

- Surgical - diabetes insipidus, meningitis, ischemic stroke, infection, hemorrhage, short-term memory deficit

- SRS - provides a slow treatment response; therefore, the patient remains exposed to the risks of persistent seizures for up to 3 years

- Thermoablation - injury to neurovascular structures, temperature control problems, hyperphagia, hyponatremia, Horner syndrome, amnesia
