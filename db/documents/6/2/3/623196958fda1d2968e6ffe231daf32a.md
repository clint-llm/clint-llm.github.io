The “sports physical,” otherwise referred to as “preparticipation physical evaluation,” is the result of a collaborative effort between organizations such as the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS), American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine (AOSSM), American Family Physician (AFP), and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) whose goal is to identify conditions that predispose athletes to a higher risk of injury, illness, and even death. Today, children often fail to meet the recommended 60 minutes of daily moderate to vigorous physical activity. Organized sports is a proven strategy that increases the likelihood that a child or young adult will meet a recommenced number of hours each week engaged in beneficial physical exercise.

The duties of the team physician, as defined by the American Orthopaedic Academy of Sports Medicine, are as follows: “The team physician should possess special proficiency in the care of musculoskeletal injuries and medical conditions encountered in sports. The team physician also must actively integrate medical expertise with other healthcare providers, including medical specialists, athletic trainers, and allied health professionals. The team physician must ultimately assume responsibility within the team structure for making medical decisions that affect the athlete’s safe participation.
