A greenstick fracture is a partial thickness fracture where only the cortex and periosteum are interrupted on one side of the bone but remain uninterrupted on the other.

Greenstick fractures can also occur in the face, chest, scapula, and virtually every bone in the body, but with much less frequency than long bones.
