Imatinib is a 2-phenylamino-pyrimidine derivative protein that is a medication used to manage and treat chronic myelogenous leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and other malignancies. It is in the tyrosine-kinase inhibitors class of drugs. This activity reviews the indications, action, and contraindications for imatinib as a valuable agent in the treatment of several oncologic indications. In addition, this activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., dosing, administration, monitoring, relevant interactions, and toxicity) pertinent for members of the healthcare team for treating patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and other related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of imatinib.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of imatinib.
- Review the appropriate monitoring/toxicity of imatinib, including significant drug interactions.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes for patients receiving imatinib.
