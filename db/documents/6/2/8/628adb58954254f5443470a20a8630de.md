When abuse or neglect is suspected in a patient of any age, the provider should order testing as indicated by the history and physical examination. These may include:

**ImagingÂ Studies**

- Computed tomography of the brain to rule out any intracranial hemorrhages

- Chest radiographs to rule out thoracic injuries or the presence of any acute fractures or fractures in various different stages of healing

- Global skeletal surveys in children that images subtle metaphyseal, rib, and other injuries specific for abuse

- Computed tomography of the abdomen to rule out the presence of any intraabdominal injuries particularly duodenal or pancreatic injuries, but also liver, spleen, kidney, adrenal gland, mesentery, or intestinal injuries

- Ophthalmologic evaluation to rule out the presence of retinal hemorrhages

**Laboratory Testing**

- Basic metabolic panel to evaluate for any electrolyte or nutritional abnormalities

- Toxicology testing to rule out the presence of malicious administration of substances

- Coagulation profile to rule out the presence of bleeding disorders

- Serum lipase to rule out pancreatic injury

- Hepatic function panel to rule out the presence of intraabdominal injury

- 25-hydroxy vitamin D level, intact parathyroid hormone level, calcium level

- Creatinine kinase level to rule out the presence of rhabdomyolysis

- Urinalysis to rule out the presence of myoglobinuria

- Urine organic acids to rule out the presence of metabolic conditions such as glutaric acid type I
