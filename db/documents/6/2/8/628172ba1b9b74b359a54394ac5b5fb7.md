Since the nerve innervation of the long flexors of the hand splits between the ulnar nerve and the median nerve. If one of the nerves were to be compromised, it would manifest as radial or ulnar flexion when the individual attempts palmar flexion. If radial flexion predominates, this means there is damage to the ulnar nerve. If ulnar flexion predominates, this means the median nerve is damaged, since palmar flexion is a result of radial and ulnar flexion counteracting each other.
