The most severe complication of untreated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia is progression to invasive carcinoma.  Malignant disease of the vulva necessitates more involved radical resection that is commonly associated with perioperative morbidity such as pain, infection, or wound dehiscence as well as altered appearance.  Complications of surgical resection are dependent on location, distribution, and size of treatable lesions.  Topical therapies may result in topical irritation, burning, or ulceration.
