Management of a suspected CO2 embolism begins with desufflation of the abdomen.

Ventilation with 100% oxygen could be used to wash out CO2, reduce ventilation-perfusion mismatch, and improve hypoxemia.

Also, hyperbaric oxygen may be used to reduce bubble size in patients experiencing neurologic deficits. Supportive treatment with fluid, vasopressors and cardiopulmonary bypass may be necessary for patients with severe cardiovascular collapse.
