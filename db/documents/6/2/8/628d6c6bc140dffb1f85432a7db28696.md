A biopsy is rarely necessary, as a diagnosis can usually be made on history and physical exam findings alone. If a biopsy is requested or necessary for diagnosis, it can help exclude telogen effluvium. In anagen effluvium, histopathologic evaluation of a punch biopsy of the scalp will exhibit a normal anagen-to-telogen ratio, which is less than 15% telogen hair follicles. If greater than 15% of the hair follicles are in the telogen phase, this more supports a diagnosis of telogen effluvium.
