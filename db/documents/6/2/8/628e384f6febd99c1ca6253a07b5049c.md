In isolation, AEN has a poor prognosis. When AEN is observed as one of the multiple symptoms (it should be view as a poor prognostic factor), initial efforts should be made to treat the underlying cause. Treatment for AEN typically involves fluid resuscitation with accompanying blood transfusion if there is significant anemia.

Sucralfate has also been used to further reduce local insult to the esophagus. Due to an often lengthy period of NPO, there has been some evidence for total-parenteral nutrition improving outcomes.

Acute complications include upper GI bleeding and esophageal perforation, which may be present at the time of presentation to healthcare or during the first few days in the hospital. Localized bleeding is controllable with an adrenaline injection during a gastroscopy or by metallic stent insertion.

If there is evidence of perforation, surgery is the primary treatment. Surgery occurred in approximately 4% of cases in one analysis.
