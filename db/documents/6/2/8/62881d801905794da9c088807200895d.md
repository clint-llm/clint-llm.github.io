Laboratory evaluation with complete blood count and culture should be obtained for all patients with suspected omphalitis. In addition, cultures of any purulent material from the umbilical stump should be sent prior to the initiation of antibiotics if possible. If the patient has systemic symptoms, a full neonatal septic workup including chest radiograph, urinalysis, urine culture, and cerebrospinal fluid culture should be obtained. As omphalitis is closely linked to leucocyte adhesion disorders, a detailed workup is necessary in suspected cases. Leucocytosis, due to defective margination of leucocytes, is almost always present in LAD. Leukocyte adhesion molecules or integrins including LFA-1/Mac-1, p150, and p95 are absent in children with LAD. Therefore, an assay of these receptors is essential in children presenting with recurrent infections and having a history of omphalitis in the neonatal age.
