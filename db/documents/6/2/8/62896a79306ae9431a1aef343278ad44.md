# Continuing Education Activity

Corticosteroid-induced myopathy is an iatrogenic myopathy caused by chronic high to moderate systemic corticosteroid use. This is a common condition that must be differentiated from other iatrogenic and organic causes of myopathy. Diagnosis is based on a high degree of clinical suspicion in patients on chronic steroids; prompt initiation of treatment in the form of corticosteroid withdrawal, if possible, should be initiated to avoid the morbidity associated with the condition. This activity reviews the characteristics, evaluation, and management of corticosteroid-induced myopathy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the epidemiology of corticosteroid-induced myopathy.
- Explain the pathophysiology of corticosteroid-induced myopathy.
- Describe the evaluation of corticosteroid-induced myopathy.
- Identify opportunities for improving care coordination within the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by corticosteroid-induced myopathy.

# Introduction

Corticosteroid-induced myopathy is a highly prevalent toxic noninflammatory myopathy, which occurs as an adverse effect of prolonged oral or intravenous glucocorticoid use. It was first described in 1932 by Harvey Cushing, as part of a constellation of symptoms seen in Cushing syndrome. With the broader use of corticosteroids as therapeutic tools in the 1950s, corticosteroid-induced myopathy became a more well-known entity.

# Etiology

Corticosteroid-induced myopathy is a toxic noninflammatory myopathy caused by exogenous corticosteroid administration. The condition typically develops with doses higher than 10 mg prednisone equivalents/day used for four weeks or longer. However, 2 to 3 weeks of higher doses (such as 40 to 60 mg prednisone/day) have been associated with more acute presentations. Oral and intravenous formulations are most associated with corticosteroid myopathy, although case reports exist regarding steroid myopathy following inhaled corticosteroids and epidural, intramuscular, or intra-articular injection.

# Epidemiology

Corticosteroid-induced myopathy is the most common drug-induced myopathy, with an incidence of 50% to 60% among those using corticosteroids for a prolonged period.

# Pathophysiology

Corticosteroid-induced myopathy is believed to occur through both catabolic and anti-anabolic mechanisms. In terms of catabolic mechanisms, corticosteroids upregulate proteolytic systems such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system, cathepsins (lysosomes), and calpains (calcium-dependent systems). This increases the proteolysis of myofibrillar proteins by dissociating actin from myosin.

# Histopathology

Muscle biopsy, if performed, reveals atrophy of type 2b or fast-twitch muscle fibers, with less impact on type 1 or slow-twitch muscle fibers, with variability in fiber size and centralization of nuclei, without evidence of inflammation or necrosis.**.**

# History and Physical

Symptoms of corticosteroid-induced myopathy consist of muscle weakness, typically in a symmetric distribution involving the proximal extremity muscles, with the hip girdle affected more and earlier than the shoulders. It is associated with long-term muscle atrophy, notably with very minimal or no associated pain.

# Evaluation

Corticosteroid-induced myopathy is a clinical diagnosis that requires a high index of suspicion. Labwork including creatine kinase (CK), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and aldolase are typically normal, although these may be elevated very early in the disease process or acute steroid myopathy of critically ill patients.

# Treatment / Management

Corticosteroid-induced myopathy is an often overlooked diagnosis, as symptoms are occasionally attributed to the primary illness that the corticosteroid is treating. This prolongs time to diagnosis and increases morbidity. Thus, a high index of suspicion must be maintained when patients present with muscle weakness in any muscle group (with particular emphasis on pelvic girdle) with any dose, route, or duration of steroids.

# Differential Diagnosis

Other medications known to cause drug-induced myopathy include colchicine, antimalarials, and antiretrovirals. Drug-induced myopathy should be considered mainly for patients taking two myopathic agents such as hydroxychloroquine and glucocorticoids for inflammatory disorders.

In contrast to corticosteroid-induced myopathy, these present with elevated muscle enzymes, worsening muscle weakness with discontinuation of steroids, systemic signs of muscle breakdown and inflammation, and characteristic "early recruitment" findings on EMG.

Additionally, myositis may present as a manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren syndrome, scleroderma, and rheumatoid arthritis; these organic causes of myopathy should be considered when diagnosing corticosteroid-induced myopathy.

# Prognosis

Corticosteroid-induced myopathy is reversible, with improvement in myopathy within 3 to 4 weeks of tapering corticosteroids, although recovery can take months to a year.

# Complications

Complications of corticosteroid-induced myopathy include the morbidity and subsequent mortality associated with chronic muscle weakness. Patients experience decreased quality of life through the inability to perform activities of daily living and are at increased risk for falls and injury.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Patients should routinely be educated on the risk versus benefit profile of corticosteroids, including the risk of corticosteroid-induced myopathy. Patients should be advised to contact their provider if they notice weakness developing. Patients should be informed that physical activity can help prevent and mitigate the effects of corticosteroid-induced myopathy, and should be prescribed physical therapy as part of a preventive and treatment regimen.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Given the high incidence of corticosteroid-induced myopathy in patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy for a wide range of clinical indications, an interprofessional team should implement systematic clinical screening for corticosteroid-induced myopathy in the appropriate patient populations. Since primary care clinicians are the most frequently and consistently involved specialty in taking care of such patients, they should maintain a high degree of suspicion for this diagnosis. Additionally, providers and team members should systematically recommend and prescribe physical therapy to prevent and treat corticosteroid-induced myopathy.
