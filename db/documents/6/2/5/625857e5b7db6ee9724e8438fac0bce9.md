How can an atrioventricular septal defect be diagnosed?

It is usually diagnosed by a cardiologist (who is a specialist in congenital cardiac diseases). He makes the diagnosis based on symptoms of heart failure and examination findings, including a murmur. Then he may advise a few tests to confirm the diagnosis. These tests may include:

- Chest radiograph: It is used to take a picture of the lungs and heart.

- Electrocardiogram (ECG): It detects any abnormality in the electrical activity of the heart.

- Echocardiogram: It uses sound waves and creates a picture of the internal structure and parts of the heart.

- Cardiac catheterization**:**It measures blood pressure and concentration of oxygen inside the heart chambers and helps the doctor detect Intracardiac shunting of blood.

How can an atrioventricular septal defect be treated?

It is treated by surgically repairing the defect in the first year of life. Sometimes medications are given by the doctor to reduce the symptoms of heart failure.

These medications may include pills to excrete extra water from the body via urine (diuretics) and pills, which dilate the blood vessels and decrease the peripheral vascular resistance.
