Several studies have shown that invasive lobular carcinoma has the same, better, or worse prognosis than invasive ductal carcinoma. Part of this may depend on the time of follow-up and sample size because lobular carcinoma is associated with lower early local recurrence rates and a lower rate of axillary lymph node involvement at the time of diagnosis.

Lobular carcinoma often metastasizes to the ovary, gastrointestinal tract, uterus, serosal cavities, meninges, or bone than to the regional lymph nodes or lungs.

Older age (aged > 60 years) of the patients, larger tumor size, and metastatic axillary lymph node involvement have been suggested as poor prognostic factors.

Limited series reported that pleomorphic is an aggressive tumor with a frequent recurrence rate and death of patients from disease.
