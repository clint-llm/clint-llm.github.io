The diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis are complex and best done by an interprofessional team that includes a gastroenterologist, pharmacist, internist, and hepatologist. Specialized gastrointestinal nurses assist in the care, education of the patient and family, and coordination of the treatment and follow-up. It is now well established that the use of corticosteroids leads to complete remission and in most cases improves mortality. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommends monotherapy with prednisone or combination therapy with prednisone and azathioprine. The pharmacist should educate the patients on all the potential complications of steroids and when to seek medical help. At the same time, the primary care provider and nurse practitioner should thoroughly examine the patient for worsening of the liver condition.

The prognosis for most patients with autoimmune hepatitis is guarded. While survival has improved over the past 2 decades, it still is low. Relapse of the condition is common and some patients may benefit from a liver transplant.
