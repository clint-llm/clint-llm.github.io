The exact risk of ozone toxicity is difficult to determine due to many factors. One large study suggested that a 10 ppb increase in ozone was associated with a 0.52% risk of non-injury-related daily mortality in that community the following week. Additionally, the same increase in environmental ozone may cause a 0.64% increase in mortality due to cardiovascular or respiratory causes.

Aside from the general ozone toxicity, it has the potential to be iatrogenic and work-related. Despite that potential, little research and no case reports were found.
