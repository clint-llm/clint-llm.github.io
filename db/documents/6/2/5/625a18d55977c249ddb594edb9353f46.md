Regulation of the smooth muscles of the penis is essential for tumescence. Cytosolic free calcium regulates the relaxation and contraction of the penile smooth muscles. Signaling from sympathetic nerves and endothelium activates the smooth muscle cells of the penis. Norepinephrine mediates sympathetic nerve signaling. Norepinephrine is released from the terminal ends of the sympathetic cavernous nerves and binds to receptors on the membrane of the smooth muscle cells. Endothelium signaling is mediated by endothelin and prostaglandin, which also activate the smooth muscle cells by binding to specific receptors located on their membranes. This activation results in the opening of calcium channels and the release of intracellular calcium stores, which leads to an increase in cytosolic free calcium ions that bind intracellular calmodulin. This calcium-calmodulin complex binds to myosin light chain kinase and triggers the phosphorylation of ATP on myosin light chains. This process creates energy for cycling of myosin cross-bridges along actin filaments resulting in smooth muscle contraction. The smooth muscles of the penis in the flaccid state contract tonically.

Inversely, a decrease in intracellular calcium ions leads to smooth muscle relaxation. Signaling from parasympathetic nerves and endothelium activates intracellular second messengers, cAMP, and cGMP. These secondary messengers activate their specific protein kinases, which leads to phosphorylation of ion channels and sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins. The result of this phosphorylation is the closing of calcium channels, sequestration of calcium ions within the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and efflux of potassium ions, all of which hyperpolarize the cell. These effects reduce intracellular calcium concentrations and lead to smooth muscle relaxation.

Acetylcholine mediates the parasympathetic nerve signaling responsible for smooth muscle relaxation. Acetylcholine release is from the terminal ends of the parasympathetic cavernous nerves and binds to muscarinic receptors of the endothelium. This binding increases endothelium nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, which cleaves 1-arginine into nitric oxide. Nitric oxide activates a smooth muscle cell membrane-bound enzyme called guanylyl cyclase. Guanylyl cyclase converts GTP to cGMP, the secondary messenger responsible for the activation of protein kinases. This activation results in the closing of calcium channels and sequestration of the calcium ions. Nitric oxide is also produced in the terminal ends of non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic cavernous nerves by neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). It acts similarly to the nitric oxide produced by eNOS. Thus the nitric oxide/cGMP pathway is an essential neurochemical cascade responsible for smooth muscle relaxation. Comprehension of these pathways and associated physiology helps the clinician gain further insight into the therapy for erectile dysfunction.
