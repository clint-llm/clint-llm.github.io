Plain radiographs with multiple views are requisite for the initial evaluation of all traumatic injuries of the shoulder. The anteroposterior view will demonstrate cranial-caudal displacement. An orthogonal view is required to assess anteroposterior displacement. The axillary view places the patient's arm in abduction with the beam-directed cranial-caudal. This view is often difficult to obtain due to pain or due to the dislocation itself, limiting abduction. Modifications such as the Velpeau view are helpful in these situations. The Velpeau view does not require abduction, and the patient's arm can remain in a sling. The patient leans back obliquely 30 to 40 degrees over a cassette, and the beam is directed cranial-caudal. The scapular Y viewÂ is used to assess the humeral head position and directionality relative to the glenoid if other views are difficult to interpret.

Advanced imaging is not commonly indicated in the acute setting if diagnostic radiographs are complete. Further outpatient radiographic evaluation includes Stryker notch views to assess Hill Sachs lesion on the humeral head or Westpoint views to assess bony involvement on the glenoid.
