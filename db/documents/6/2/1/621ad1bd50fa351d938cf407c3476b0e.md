A standard vascular operative tray is essential to the surgeon’s success in performing this procedure. Surgical instruments required include scalpels, needle holders, tissue forceps, scissors, self-retaining retractors, vessel loops, bulldog clamps, and vascular clamps of the surgeon’s preference. A vascular anastomosis is typically performed using monofilament nonabsorbable sutures. Suction and electrocautery are also essential. A Doppler ultrasound should be available throughout the procedure to assess patency and flow.
