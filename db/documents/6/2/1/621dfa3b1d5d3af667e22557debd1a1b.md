Differential diagnosis of hypoglycemia includes but is not limited to the following:

- Alcohol intake

- Hormonal deficiency, e.g., cortisol

- Non-islet cell tumors

- Insulinoma

- Insulin autoimmune hypoglycemia

- Accidental or factitious hypoglycemia

Other acute, secondary causes of hypoglycemia should also be considered, especially in people with known diabetes mellitus, such as infection, sepsis, and transient ischemic attacks. These disorders require exclusion before starting the extensive hypoglycemia work up.
