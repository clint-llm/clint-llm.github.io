Heatstroke is a severe heat-related illness that involves an elevation in body temperature which typically, but not always, is greater than 40 C. The patient has clinical signs of central nervous system dysfunction that may include confusion, ataxia, delirium, or seizures that are brought on after strenuous physical exertion or exposure to hot weather. This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment of heat stroke and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in this condition.
