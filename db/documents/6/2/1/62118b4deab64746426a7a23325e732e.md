Management depends on the underlying cause. The goal of the therapy is to mitigate end-organ damage from eosinophilia.

For some conditions like drug and food allergies or infections, treatment can be simple, like withdrawing the offending agent or treating it with antibiotics. But in some conditions, due to the varying clinical manifestations and multi-systemic involvement, an interprofessional approach involving hematologists, pulmonologists, and infectious disease specialists, might be necessary. In steroid-resistant cases of hypereosinophilic syndrome and chronic eosinophilic leukemia, hydroxyurea and interferon-alpha have demonstrated efficacy.

In aggressive forms of the disease, second-line cytotoxic agents and stem cell transplants have proven some benefits. Antibody use against interleukin-5 (IL-5) (mepolizumab), the IL-5 receptor (benralizumab), and CD52 (alemtuzumab), as well as other targets on eosinophils, continues to be an active area of investigation.
