Patients with IHE must stay compliant with dietary restrictions and serial imaging follow-up to avoid complications. The patient must be educated on symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, blood in vomiting, dark stool, or melena for prompt diagnosis of complication. Efforts should be directed to avoid any such act which can increase intraesophageal pressure or trauma such as heavy weightlifting, Valsalva maneuvers, abrupt and fast swallowing of large food bolus which otherwise can result in exacerbation of symptoms and complication. Patients on antiplatelet or anticoagulants for other reasons should closely follow up with their physician regarding the resumption of these medications safely.
