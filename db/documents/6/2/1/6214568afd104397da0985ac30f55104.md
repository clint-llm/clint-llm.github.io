The histopathology of acne keloidalis nuchae depends on the timing of the biopsy. In general, there is an influx of neutrophils and lymphocytes distributed around the isthmus of the hair follicle and naked hair shafts in the dermis may also be visualized. As the condition progresses, one will see the destruction of the sebaceous glands. A chronic granulomatous inflammation reaction is common with evidence of collagen deposition and fibrosis. Sinus tracts may also be apparent when the fluid is discharged to the external skin. Ingrown hairs may be seen around the periphery of the papules.
