Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency

Alpha-1 Antitrypsin deficiency is an autosomal recessive genetic condition that primarily affects the lungs and the liver. Decreased serum alpha-1 antitrypsin protein levels characterize the disease. The liver produces this enzyme, and it is responsible for the deactivation of proteolytic enzymes released during immune responses in lung tissue, particularly neutrophilic elastase. Because lung tissue has continuous exposure to airborne pathogens, the ability to downregulate the immune response is crucial for the maintenance of healthy lung parenchyma. Insufficient serum alpha-1 antitrypsin levels lead to unchecked inflammatory responses in the lungs and the eventual degradation of lung tissue, leading to progressive COPD and panacinar emphysema. Â Symptoms of a homozygous recessive carrier of the disease generally manifest early in adulthood. Additional risk factors, such as smoking, can accelerate the disease process and further decrease life expectancy.
