The long-term prognosis depends on the age at onset, clinical course, and the initial response to treatment. About 90% of the patients with CIDP improve with immunosuppressive treatment with a 50% relapse rate. Overall long-term prognosis is good for patients with CIDP diagnosed at a younger age and with a monophasic or a relapsing course.

In a study reported in South England, 54% of patients were severely disabled by CIDP at some stage of their disease. Usually, these patients are followed up for years; the longer they are followed up, the more the chances of relapses. Based on clinical examination and nerve conduction study, if no worsening is seen, then the immunosuppressive therapy can eventually be tapered off.
