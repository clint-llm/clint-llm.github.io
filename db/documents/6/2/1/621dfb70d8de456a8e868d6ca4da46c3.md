Spinal cord compression can result from a myriad of both atraumatic and traumatic causes. The spinal column is vulnerable to a variety of compressive phenomena, such as the expansion of blood products, neoplastic disease, infectious collections, or protrusion of bone or intervertebral disc within the limited area of the fat-filled spinal epidural space and meninges. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of atraumatic spinal cord compression and highlights the roles of the emergency physician, neurosurgeon, and interprofessional team in treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of spinal cord compression.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of spinal cord compression.
- Review the management options available for spinal cord compression.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance spinal cord compression and improve outcomes.
