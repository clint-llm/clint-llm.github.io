The etiology of diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis stems from the type and location of deposits seen on renal biopsy; the most commonly associated disease is systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Class IV of lupus nephritis shows a diffuse pattern on microscopic examination. In addition, the renal involvement seen in IgA nephropathy, anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibody disease, pauci immune vasculitis like granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis, and Henoch-Schonlein purpura all show a histological pattern indicative of DPGN. Some forms of post-infectious glomerulonephritis, especially those associated with chronic infections like endocarditis, hepatitis B, and C, show a diffuse involvement of glomeruli with increased cellular proliferation.
