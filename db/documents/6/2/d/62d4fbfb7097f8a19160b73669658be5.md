The suboccipital nerve forms from the interactions between the paraxial mesoderm and the visceral mesoderm at a zone called the head-neck interface (HNI), which is responsible for the development of cranial nerves X, XI, XII, and the cervical nerves C1 to C6. According to embryological studies, C1 develops primarily from somitomeres that undergo segmentation and resegmentation during embryologic development. Derangements during embryologic development likely contribute to the anatomical variations seen in the suboccipital nerve.
