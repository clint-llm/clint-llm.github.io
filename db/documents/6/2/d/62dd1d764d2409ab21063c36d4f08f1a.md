Constipation can occur in any age group starting from newborn to older people; overall, it is seen more commonly in females than males. Also, the non-white population has been reported to have a 30% higher prevalence than the white population.

The pattern and frequency of defecation depend on a childâ€™s age. During neonatal period and early infancy, bowel movements can present more than 4 times per day, eventually trending down to 1 to 2 per day by toddler age. At this point, children usually have achieved voluntary control of their sphincter. Hence, there is a correlation between bowel movements and age.
