The long head of the biceps brachii tendon (LHBT) is a common source of pain in the shoulder. Biceps tendon pathology is often associated with rotator cuff (RC) pathology. The spectrum of LHBT injuries includes primary and secondary tendinitis, chronic tendinopathy, superior labrum anterior and posterior (SLAP) lesions, instability, and partial or complete ruptures. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of biceps tendon ruptures and dislocations and reviews the interprofessional team's role in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the diagnostic approach for evaluating injuries to the long head of the biceps tendon.
- Review some of the key differentials for that can be mistaken for long head of the biceps tendon injury.
- Outline treatment and management options for patients with LHBT injuries, depending on the specific injury.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by injuries to the bicipital tendon.
