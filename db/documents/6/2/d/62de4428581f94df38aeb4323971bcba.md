There have been increasing efforts in organized team sports to decrease the number of concussions by creating stricter penalties for intentional blows to the head in addition to “return to play” guidelines. Unfortunately, there is limited evidence-based data as to the best method of monitoring an athlete’s neurological dysfunction following a concussion, and there is not a consensus on when return to play is appropriate. Most recommendations focus solely on the resolution of symptoms before allowing for a return to play and various neuropsychological tests have shown abnormalities in concussed athletes up to 5 weeks following injury. Therefore, it is possible that at least a month may be required before return to play as re-injury is much more likely to occur in the period immediately following a TBI.
