Acanthosis nigricans is a cutaneous manifestation of an underlying condition. It usually develops in in skin folds, such as the back of the neck, axilla, and groin, where it presents as velvety hyper-pigmented patches with poorly defined borders. Acanthosis nigricans is most commonly associated with diabetes and insulin resistance, but rarely it can be a sign of internal malignancy. It can also occur with hormone disorders or with the use of certain medications like systemic glucocorticoids and oral contraceptives. This activity reviews the workup and treatment of acanthosis nigricans and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with acanthosis nigricans.

**Objectives:**
- Identify some of the more common and some of the less common etiologies of acanthosis nigricans.
- Describe the management of acanthosis nigricans, and list any further evaluation that should be considered. 
- Explain the pathophysiologic basis for acanthosis nigricans. 
- Articulate the role of interprofessional team members in evaluating and treating patients with acanthosis nigricans.
