Fluoroscopic PICC placement involves coordinated care with several healthcare professionals. The medical team responsible for looking after the patient must consider the indications, weigh the risks and benefits and make an informed decision regarding PICC line placement and whether the patient would benefit from fluoroscopic guidance for the procedure. Radiologists perform the fluoroscopic PICC placement or supervise as a trained physician assistant performs the procedure. Following the line placement, the aftercare is provided primarily by the nursing staff.

As previously described, careful monitoring and maintenance of these lines are paramount in preventing procedural complications. If one should arise, effective communication of the entire multidisciplinary team will aid in treating the complication and preventing occurrences in the future. In addition, many health care facilities also have teams of infectious disease staff to monitor the number and root cause of catheter-associated bloodstream infections. This data aids in the institutional protocol changes to provide a safer service for patients in need of care.
