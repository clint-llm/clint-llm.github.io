Mediastinitis is a rare but life-threatening disease that requires emergent intervention. When it is suspected, the prompt inclusion of necessary consults is crucial, particularly for a cardiothoracic surgeon. Other consultants, as mentioned earlier in the review, are also important in providing thorough care. Early broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated with prompt imaging, typically a CT scan.

The most important aspect of improved outcomes is prevention. For surgeries, evaluation for risk factors and attempts to modify for a more favorable outcome is helpful. Most crucial are sterile techniques and the prevention of contamination during surgery. Prophylactic antibiotics have also been shown to be helpful.
