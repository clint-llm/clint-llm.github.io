Scalp vein catheterization should be performed by someone authorized to perform intravenous catheterization and with the appropriate experience at accessing scalp veins.Â  Scalp veins are not usually the primary site of attempting access, and when scalp veins are being explored for peripheral IV access, access often is becoming a more urgent need; therefore, it is ideal for maximizing success by using personnel who have more experience. Generally, a tech, medic, nurse, or clinician can perform the procedure as appropriate.

In children, additional trained personnel may be needed for stabilizing the child, and child life specialists can aid in distraction and/or developmentally appropriate support. In peripheral scalp vein catheterization, the ideal positioning of the child includes decreasing mobility at the neck, minimizing body movements that would lead to movement during IV catheter placement, and holding the head at the proper position and angle to maximize a straight path to the scalp vein.
