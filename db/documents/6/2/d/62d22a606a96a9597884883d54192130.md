A hazardous material (HAZMAT) is a chemical or radioactive substance that can harm an individual and the environment upon exposure. Exposure can happen after inadvertent industrial, residential, or transportation incidents, as well as natural disasters. Intentional exposure would be the release of substances to cause harm, such as terrorist attacks. Hazmat incidents are challenging scenarios for emergency medical system (EMS) response and emergency department (ED) care.
