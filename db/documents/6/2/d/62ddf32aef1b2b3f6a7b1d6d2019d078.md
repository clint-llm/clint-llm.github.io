In the liver, retinol is esterified to retinyl esters and stored in the stellate cells. Both retinol and beta-carotene are oxidized to retinal and retinoic acid in the tissues, which are essential for vision and gene regulation, respectively. These active metabolites bind nuclear receptors of the RAR family to control gene expression.
