Worldwide, medical education went through significant changes due to concerns for the safety of patients. Medical errors result in as many as 98000 deaths per year in the United States of America. Changes in instructional methods have resulted in ingenious medical curricula, and one of the changes was the universally accepted proficiency in clinical skills, which constitute an essential learning outcome. The challenge for medical undergraduates is the application of theoretical knowledge to the management of patients. Simulation-based learning becomes a necessary tool as a new teaching method for undergraduate and postgraduate education.
