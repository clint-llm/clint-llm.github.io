Prevalence of Gorlin syndrome is estimated at 1 per 40,000-60,000. The disease affectsÂ men and women in rather equal distribution (1:1.3). Although the disease affects all races, African American and Asians represent only 5% of cases and more often are incidentally diagnosed with extracutaneous findings, such as odontogenic keratocysts, as compared to BCCs.
