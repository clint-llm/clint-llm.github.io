The diagnosis of NAION is a clinical one: all patients must have optic nerve edema at the time of presentation and over 97% of patients would have a disc-at-risk in the fellow eye with the cup to disc ratio of 0.2 or less.

- Patients with NAION might have a variety of visual field defects although many will have an altitudinal defect supporting the notion that there are two separate semicircles of short posterior ciliary arteries supplying the superior and inferior portions of the optic nerve.

- Visual acuity can vary from 20/20 to no light perception although very poor visual acuity is uncommon and should raise the suspicion for giant cell arteritis.

- While most patients with NAION are over 50 years of age, many are younger and young age at presentation does not exclude the diagnosis although demyelinating optic neuritis should be thought of and excluded in younger individuals.

- Typically in demyelinating optic neuritis optic nerve head edema if present is mild and the presence of peripapillary hemorrhages is rare (less than 5% in optic neuritis treatment trial).

- Pain with eye movements is distinctly uncommon in NAION (although pain in and around the eye can be present in up to 10-15% of patients) whether it is present in up to 94% of patients with demyelinating optic neuritis.

- If the differentiation between NAION and other optic neuropathies is difficult, MRI of the orbits with gadolinium can be useful as it should be normal in all patients with NAION and almost always demonstrates enhancement of the optic nerve in post-contrast imaging in patients with inflammatory optic neuropathies.
