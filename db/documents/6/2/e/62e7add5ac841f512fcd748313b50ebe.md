The ulnar nerve is one of the 5 terminal branches of the brachial plexus, arising from the medial cord. It supplies motor and sensory innervation to the upper extremity.Â The ulnar nerve originates from contributions of the ventral rami of C8 and T1 nerve roots. The nerve courses along the medial arm and forearm, and then it passes into the wrist, hand, and fingers.
