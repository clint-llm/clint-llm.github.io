Mpox (Monkeypox) is a zoonotic orthopoxvirus that incidentally causes disease in humans similar to smallpox, although with notably lower mortality. This virus is clinically relevant because it is endemic to western and central Africa, with outbreaks in the Western Hemisphere related to the exotic pet trade and international travel. Coincident immunity to the mpox virus was previously achieved with vaccinia vaccination; however, eradicating smallpox and subsequent lack of vaccination efforts paved the way for monkeypox to gain clinical relevance. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of monkeypox infections in humans and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition and minimizing disease outbreaks.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of mpox.
- Review the presentation of a patient infected with mpox.
- Identify common complications of mpox.
- Summarize the role of the interprofessional healthcare team in mpox disease prevention and mitigation measures.
