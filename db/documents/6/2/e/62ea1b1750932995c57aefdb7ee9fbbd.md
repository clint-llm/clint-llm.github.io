# Continuing Education Activity

The olecranon is the proximal articular portion of the ulna. Along with the coronoid process, it forms the greater sigmoid notch which articulates with the humerus to provide flexion and extension of the elbow. Fractures of the olecranon are a relatively common injury in adults; its subcutaneous location leaves it vulnerable to injury from a direct blow. Fractures sustained range from simple undisplaced fractures to complex open fracture dislocations. Olecranon fractures frequently require surgical management to restore articular congruity and elbow stability. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of fractures of the olecranon and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the most common mechanisms of injury that can result in olecranon fractures.
- Summarize the diagnostic approach for an evaluation and assessment of a patient presenting with a potential olecranon fracture, including any indicated imaging studies.
- Outline the treatment options for olecranon fractures, depending on patient population and fracture severity grading.
- Review the role of improving coordination amongst the interprofessional team to streamline diagnosis, reduction, and/or surgery for patients with olecranon fracture.

# Introduction

The olecranon is the proximal articular portion of the ulna.  Along with the coronoid process, it forms the greater sigmoid (semilunar) notch which articulates with the humerus to provide flexion and extension of the elbow. Fractures of the olecranon are a relatively common injury in adults; its subcutaneous location leaves it vulnerable to injury from a direct blow. Fractures sustained range from simple nondisplaced fractures to complex open fracture dislocations. Olecranon fractures frequently require surgical management to restore articular congruity and elbow stability.  Although outcomes after surgery are relatively good, it is not uncommon for patients to have a range of motion (ROM) deficit or require a repeat procedure to remove hardware.

# Etiology

Most olecranon fractures occur in individuals aged 50 years or greater after a fall from standing height

# Epidemiology

Olecranon fractures account for approximately 10% of upper extremity fractures

# Pathophysiology

Olecranon fractures typically involve the articular surface of the elbow.  Posttraumatic arthritis occurs in approximately 20% of cases and persistent malreduction >2mm of the articular surface is associated with this outcome

The triceps muscle (innervated by the radial n) inserts onto the olecranon, blending with the periosteum. A displaced fracture interrupts the extensor mechanism resulting in loss of active elbow extension. The pull from the triceps is the key deforming force, pulling the separated fragment superiorly. Greater displacement suggests tearing of the fibrous sheath over the olecranon.

The olecranon confers stability to the elbow joint, acting as a block to the anterior translation of the ulna in relation to the distal humerus.  Olecranon fractures can have associated with ligamentous injury (the medial and lateral collateral ligaments stabilize against valgus and varus stress respectively), coronoid process, and radial head fractures.  Unstable injuries require reduction and stable fixation of the olecranon to restore elbow stability.

The ulnar nerve lies on the medial aspect, posterior to the medial collateral ligament before crossing anteriorly to run alongside the ulnar artery. Awareness of these structures is key when operating in this region.

# History and Physical

Patients typically present with elbow pain and swelling following a fall. If the fracture is displaced there may be marked deformity at the elbow with a palpable gap. The hallmark of an olecranon fracture is the inability to extend the elbow against gravity.  The examiner must ensure that the patient is not using gravity to mimic active elbow extension. This is typically done by abducting the shoulder to 90 degrees, supporting the upper arm, and asking the patient to straighten their elbow from this position.

It is important to examine the entire involved extremity for associated injuries or lacerations suggestive of an open fracture.

Associated injuries of the coronoid process, radial head, or proximal radioulnar joint (Monteggia fracture) may be present and evaluated for on radiographs.

The examiner should palpate the elbow as well as the adjacent joints. A complete upper extremity neurovascular examination of the involved extremity should be conducted. The ulnar nerve is most at risk due to its superficial position on the medial aspect of the elbow.  When the injury occurred secondary to a high-energy mechanism, the practitioner should be vigilant to avoid missing injuries that may be unrecognized by the patient due to the distracting nature of the olecranon fracture.  It is prudent to question the patient about other sources of pain and examine all four extremities for crepitus, deformity, or pain with range of motion.

# Evaluation

Initial evaluation with anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs of the elbow are sufficient for most fractures to determine fracture pattern.  A dedicated radiocapitellar view may also be performed to evaluate for radial head and capitellum fractures.  Images should be examined for associated coronoid, radial head fracture or dislocation, and ulno-humeral congruity

There are several classification systems of olecranon fractures.  The most commonly used is the Mayo classification first described by Morrey in 1993.  The goal of this system was to simplify the classification of olecranon fractures based on fracture comminution, displacement, and stability of the ulno-humeral joint. There are three types, each one further subdivided into type A and B, indicating non-comminuted and comminuted respectively

# Treatment / Management

Suspected olecranon fractures require orthopedic consultation.  After a thorough history, physical exam, and imaging, the fracture should be immobilized in a posterior splint with slight extension. The reduction is indicated in type 3 injuries with the aim of reducing the remaining articular surface with the trochlea.

Nondisplaced olecranon fractures can be treated with an initial period of immobilization in a posterior slab long arm splint with the elbow in 45-90 degrees of flexion followed by early progressive active range of motion exercises with avoidance of active extension

Type II and III injuries generally require surgical intervention.  Non-operative management of type II injuries may be an option as there is

Displaced, stable, non-comminuted fractures (Mayo type 2A) may be amenable to tension band wiring (TBW).  This construct converts the tension force from the pull of the triceps into a compressive force at the articular surface.  It requires an intact dorsal cortex. Fractures treated with TBW should not have significant comminution, or they will cause collapse and narrowing of the distance between the coronoid and olecranon

Plate and screw fixation is recommended for unstable fracture patterns with significant comminution or a fracture line exiting distal to the semilunar notch (Mayo Type 2B) and fracture-dislocations (Mayo Type 3)

Intramedullary nails are now available and may be suitable for some fracture types.  Intramedullary devices may avoid the wound complications related to the superficial location of traditional hardware used to treat olecranon fractures

Excision and triceps advancement is an option in elderly, low-demand individuals where the fragment is too small for fixation or where less than 50% of the joint surface is involved.  Cadaveric studies have shown that excising over 50% of the olecranon results in elbow instability, therefore this is the maximum recommended resection

# Differential Diagnosis

It is important to rule out other injuries about the elbow which may affect the treatment plan.  The skin should be evaluated for open fractures.  Other frequent associated injuries include coronoid fractures, radial head, and neck fractures, radial head dislocation, and collateral ligament injuries

# Prognosis

Patients usually have a good functional outcome after treatment of an olecranon fracture.  Approximately 10-15 degrees loss of terminal extension may occur, although this is usually not clinically significant

# Complications

**Hardware Irritation**-****Irritation leading to hardware removal is the most common complication due to the subcutaneous nature of the proximal olecranon.   There is a variable rate of hardware removal for TBW and plate fixation in the literature.  A recent prospective randomized control study reported a hardware removal rate of 50% with TBW and 22% with plate fixation

**Wound Complications/Infection**- The subcutaneous nature of the olecranon provides little soft tissue coverage over hardware used for fixation.  Placing plates on the side of the olecranon where there is a more robust soft tissue envelope may reduce the risk.  Kirshner wires (k-wires) may back out and create wound problems or soft tissue irritation.  Engaging the distal tip of the wire in the anterior cortex of the ulna

**Loss of Motion**-  Patients commonly have a loss of terminal elbow extension of 10-15 degrees.  This is usually not clinically significant as the functional elbow range of motion is a 30-130 degree arc of motion.  One study reported a 39% incidence of a flexion contracture >10 degrees after plate fixation which did not significantly impact functional outcome scores

**Arthrosis**- Degenerative changes can be seen on radiographs up to 50% percent of patients at long-term follow-up.  This is not necessarily clinically significant as 96% of this cohort reported good or excellent outcomes.  Narrowing of the distance between the tip of the olecranon and the coronoid may lead to malreduction and subsequent arthrosis

**Heterotopic ossification**- This can occur in approximately 13% of patients

**Ulnar Nerve Neuritis**- This is an infrequent complication that occurs in approximately 2-12% of cases

**Nonunion**-****The risk of nonunion is approximately 1%

**Malunion**-****This may be intra-articular or extra-articular.  Interarticular malunion may occur from an inadequate reduction of a comminuted fracture, leading to narrowing of the sigmoid notch.  Early arthritis will likely occur and may require an arthroplasty procedure.  Extra-articular malunion presents with radial head subluxation and can be treated with an osteotomy

# Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care

Postoperative protocols vary by institution.  Most physicians consider fracture stability, wound healing, and patient compliance when determining the duration of immobilization

# Deterrence and Patient Education

It is critical to properly educate the patient regarding possible complications and treatment expectations of operative and non-operative management.  Operative interventions carry general and specific risks with a high chance of needing a secondary procedure for hardware removal due to irritation.  There is frequently a loss of terminal elbow extension of 10-15 degrees.  Although this rarely results in a functional deficit, it may be of cosmetic concern and should be discussed with the patient prior to the procedure. Patient compliance with weight-bearing restrictions, a range of motion exercises, and strengthening is imperative for a good outcome.

# Pearls and Other Issues

- Obtain adequate preoperative radiographs, especially a lateral view, to determine fracture morphology, comminution, and displacement.

- Fractures of the olecranon are intra-articular injuries and require anatomic reduction.  Be careful to reduce the bare area of the articular surface.

- Do not malreduce the fracture and narrow the distance between the coronoid process and the tip of the olecranon.

- Nondisplaced fractures may be treated with a short period of immobilization followed by a range of motion.  Close radiographic follow-up is necessary to monitor for displacement.

- The most common complication of TBW or plate fixation is hardware irritation.  Inform the patient that they may need a second general anesthetic to remove the hardware.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Post-operative rehabilitation depends on regaining a functional range of motion and strength.  Communication between the patient, physician, and therapist can improve patient adherence, satisfaction, and functional outcomes
