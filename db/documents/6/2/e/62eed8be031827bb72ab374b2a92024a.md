Radiologists, nuclear medicine physicians and technicians, cyclotron engineers, surgeons, and scheduling departments are required personnel to set up and perform lymphoscintigraphy.

There is no specific preparation for a patient receiving lymphoscintigraphy imaging. A nuclear medicine technologist should be present to assist, explain, and execute the examination. Additionally, a physical examination should be performed before injection to further confirm that no recent surgical intervention has been performed. All prior imaging and medical records should be reviewed by the radiologist or nuclear medicine physician. Certain questions should be asked prior to image acquisition, including if the patient is able to maintain a position of lying on a hard surface for an extended period of time as well as inquiring about pregnancy status or current breastfeeding. The patient should remove all clothing and jewelry and wear a hospital gown if available.

Quality control on the equipment should be routinely performed including the imaging system, display, and gamma probes. The Society of Nuclear Medicine has provided general guidelines for quality control, which should be referred to often to ensure proper adherence.
