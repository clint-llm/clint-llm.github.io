There are many clinical implications of alterations to the plasma osmolar state and the oncotic pressure.

Clinicians can monitor the following:

- Change in intracranial pressure

- Look for edema

- Seizures

Pathologies include (but are not limited to):

- Diabetes insipidus: A disease characterized by excretion of a large volume of urine, resulting in concentrated, hyperosmolar plasma (over 300 mOsm/liter) and dilute, hypoosmolar urine (less than 300mOsm/liter).

- Liver Cirrhosis: This is the final result of various hepatic insults which render the liver damaged, fibrosed, and ineffective at completing its functions. A few of its functions include synthesizing proteins, clearing bilirubin, and metabolizing drugs for excretion.

- Congestive Heart Failure: This is a pathology characterized by the dilatation and hypertrophy of the left ventricle of the heart, which prevents forward blood flow, which results in decreased end-organ perfusion and increases hydrostatic oncotic pressure, which leads to hepatic congestion and pulmonary edema. Decreased renal perfusion will activate the RAAS system (see above) and alter the composition of solutes in the blood and urine.

- Dehydration: Acutely, this will cause a hypertonic state as discussed above in the "Mechanism" section.

- Kwashiorkor: This disease presents with the lack of amino acids in an individual's diet, due to severe malnutrition. The liver is unable to synthesize proteins because of the lack of amino acids, and this results in decreased plasma oncotic pressure.

- Nephrotic Syndrome: An insult to the renal system results in the spilling of proteins into the urine resulting in hypo-osmolar blood plasma.

- Psychogenic Polydipsia: See above in the "Pathophysiology" section.

It is essential to consider all differential diagnoses; ultimately, further lab testing will be necessary to reach a diagnosis.
