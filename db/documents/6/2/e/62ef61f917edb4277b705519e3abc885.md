The prognosis of steatorrhea depends on the underlying etiology. Steatorrhea due to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and disorders of the small intestine like celiac disease, tropical sprue, or giardiasis has a good prognosis. But steatorrhea due toÂ  CF and bile salt deficiencies like in PSC and PBC has a poor prognosis because of the progressive nature of underlying etiologies.
