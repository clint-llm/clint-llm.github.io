Due to schwannoma's benign nature, prompt diagnosis and treatment are necessary in suspected cases. An interprofessional team approach will improve patient outcomes. The interprofessional group should include a neurosurgeon, a peripheral nerve surgeon, a radiation oncologist, nursing staff, and in some cases, a physical therapist. Collaboration, shared decision-making, accurate patient record keeping, and open communication among care team memebrs are crucial elements for a good outcome.

Due to the implication of a nerve with the possibility of injury, some patients require physical therapy to rehabilitate their face or the extremity affected. Nurses can prove especially valuable in coordinating activities between the primary clinician, specialists, and therapists while also counseling patients and assisting in other clinical duties, from assessment to surgery. The interprofessional care model will provide the patient with maximum benefit. [Level 5]
