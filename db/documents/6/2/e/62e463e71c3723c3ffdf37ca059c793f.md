Imaging modalities for PSAs include a duplex ultrasound (DUS) which is usually the first test one should obtain if PSA is suspected. DUS carries a sensitivity of 92% to 96%. Findings on DUS which indicate PSA would consist of a flow called a “to-and-fro flow” between the arterial lumen and femoral artery. Ideally, the DUS will include the dimensions, size of the sac and the neck as treatment will be based on those dimensions. Proximal and distal arteries should also be evaluated for thrombus extruding from the aneurysmal sac. Whenever a surgical intervention is planned, CT angiography can be used for pre-operative planning.
