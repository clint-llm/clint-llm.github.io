As with any medical condition, prevention is preferable to reactive interventions. Some conditions leading to provoked seizures may permit interventions before the development of a seizure. Clearly, with provoked seizures related to alcohol withdrawal or drug abuse, efforts should be made for appropriate actionsÂ pertaining to those disorders.

One study of patients presenting to emergency departments with seizure-related complaints found that roughly two-thirds of those with antiepileptic drug levels obtains had sub-therapeutic levels.

Patents with spells or seizures of unknown etiology should be counseled not to drive or operate dangerous machinery. Reporting requirements vary state-to-state.
