Transthoracic echocardiography is a non-invasive test, low-cost, widely available, a first-line diagnostic test to evaluate cardiac disease and function. It not only helps to diagnose cardiac disease but also provides useful information to guide therapy.

Transesophageal Echocardiography: It is an invasive test done in the condition in which transthoracic echo is inconclusive or need further information on disease such as infective endocarditis. The esophagus's proximity to the heart and absence of intervening structures such as the lung make the Transesophageal echo ideal for examining various important structures.

Stress Echocardiography: The inclusion of imaging in routine stress testing increase both sensitivity and specificity of the test to diagnose coronary artery disease. Stress echocardiography post-myocardial infarction help in risk stratification, location, and extent of coronary artery disease. Stress echocardiography can also be used to risk-stratify patients before non-cardiac surgery as resting echo does not provide essential prognostic information.
