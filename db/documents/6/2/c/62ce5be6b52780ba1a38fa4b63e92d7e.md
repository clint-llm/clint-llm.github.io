Lymph node dissection, also known as lymphadenectomy, is a surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are dissected, and a sample of tissue is checked for the presence of malignancy under the microscope. It is an operation usually performed as part of the surgical management of malignant tumors. Lymph node dissection can be further divided into regional lymphadenectomy, where there is a removal of some of the lymph nodes in the tumor area (inguinal, femoral, iliac, epitrochlear, cervical, popliteal, retroperitoneal, or axillary lymph node groups) and radical lymphadenectomy where there is a dissection of most or all of the lymph nodes in the tumor area. Finding cancer cells in the lymph nodes is associated with a higher risk of metastasis to other parts of the body and portends a poorer prognosis.

The region of lymph node dissection depends on the site of involvement. The four most common dissection sites are axillary lymph nodes (for breast cancer), inguinal lymph nodes (for penile, anal, and vulvar cancers), cervical lymph nodes (for head/neck cancers and thyroid cancers), and retroperitoneal lymph nodes (for testicular and ovarian cancers).
