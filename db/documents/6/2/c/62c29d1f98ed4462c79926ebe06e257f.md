The management of an HIV-positive patient is complex. It should be carried out by an interprofessional health care team that includes nurses, a social worker, a family doctor, an internal medicine specialist, a pharmacist, and an infectious disease specialist. If an opportunistic infection or a mass develops, the patient should be evaluated by an oncologist and/or surgeon. Psychological support must be provided once the diagnosis of HIV is made.
