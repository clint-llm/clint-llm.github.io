The upper limb usually begins to develop around weeks four and five. Specifically, during week four, the limb bud first appears, and during week five, migration occurs, forming the anterior and posterior condensations. The latter gives rise to shoulder muscles, including both teres minor and teres major. The upper extremity muscle groups are all established by eight weeks.

TheÂ teres major is part of the upper limb and arises from the paraxial mesoderm. This gives rise to the myotome. The myotome can be further divided into subpopulations, of which the primaxial myotome later develops into the teres major.
