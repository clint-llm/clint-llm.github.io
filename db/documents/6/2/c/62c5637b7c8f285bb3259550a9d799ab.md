The trigeminal nerve is the 5 and largest cranial nerve. There are three branches of the trigeminal nerve including: ophthalmic (V1), maxillary (V2), and mandibular (V3).

The trigeminal nerve's maxillary division exits the skull base via the foramen rotundum, traverses the pterygopalatine fossa, enters the inferior orbital fissure, and ultimately gives rise to the inferior orbital nerve. This nerve is the origin of the anterior branch of the superior alveolar nerve providing sensation to the anterior hard palate, incisors, and canines. For the molars and posterior two-thirds of the palate, sensation comes from the greater palatine nerves arising from the maxillary nerve.

The mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve exits the skull base via the foramen ovale. The anterior branch provides motor innervation to the muscles of mastication. The posterior branch provides sensory innervation via the long buccal nerve, inferior alveolar nerve (IAN), and the lingual nerve. The IAN provides sensory innervation for mandibular molars and premolars. A small branch of the IAN, the incisive nerve, branches just before the IAN exits the mental foramen becoming the mental nerve. The incisive nerve provides sensation to the mandibular canines and incisors.
