Patients with odontogenic infections classically present with one to two weeks of worsening dental pain preceding facial or neck swelling.

A review of systems commonly reveals odynophagia, neck pain, facial pain, trismus, fever, and malaise. Depending on the tooth of origin and direction of spread, these patients can report paresthesias, ocular pain, diplopia, dyspnea, and sialorrhea.

Patients who have had a rupture of the abscess intraorally may complain of foul tasting and smelling secretions as a result of pus in the oral cavity. As with any infection in the head and neck, a thorough neck and cranial nerve exam should be performed to assess for other possible sources and causes of infection.
