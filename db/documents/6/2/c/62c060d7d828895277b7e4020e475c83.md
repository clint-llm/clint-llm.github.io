Simple myopia can be satisfactorily corrected using various refractive lenses (contact lenses, spectacles) or refractive surgery. Incentives to encourage outdoor play among children may help prevent myopia progression. Other methods include specialized contact lenses and low-dose topical atropine.

The mainstay treatment of myopic CNV is anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (anti-VEGF) intravitreal injections. Large, randomized control trials have demonstrated superior visual and anatomical outcomes with anti-VEGF therapy compared to photodynamic therapy or control.

The management for myopic tractional maculopathy remains debatable and depends on specific OCT findings.
