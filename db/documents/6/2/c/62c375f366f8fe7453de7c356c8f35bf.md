The disease is characterized by primary, secondary, and tertiary stages.

The initial lesion typifying primary yaws infection areÂ solitary nodules

Dissemination of the organism through lymphatic or hematogenous spread is responsible for the progression of the disease.

In between primary and secondary or secondary and tertiary stages, a latent period occurs. The latent period is defined as a positive serology with no clinical signs. This is due to the host immune response against the organism. During this relapse of clinical disease can occur and characteristically manifests around axillae, anus, and mouth.

Tertiary disease historically occurred in 10% of untreated patients; however, due to surveillance and available antibiotics, it is now rarely seen. Late lesions may occur 5 to 10 years after inoculation. Cutaneous manifestations are the most common and are typically near joints with ulcerative necrotic nodules. Facial destruction historically has been a marked manifestation
