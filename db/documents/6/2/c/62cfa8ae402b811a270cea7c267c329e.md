Vibrio cholerae is a facultative, gram-negative, comma-shaped, oxidase-positive rod that isÂ prevalent in developing countries. Two serotypes have been identified to cause outbreaks. O1 is responsible for all recent outbreaks, whereas O139 causes sporadic outbreaks, specifically in Asia. There is no etiologic difference between the two. V. cholerae is found in food (classically shellfish) and poorly sanitized water. The bacteria is known to spread via the fecal-oral route and is thus endemic to areas associated with inadequate food and water hygiene.

The organism is acquired via the fecal-oral route and a large dose is required to develop infectivity. Factors that increase susceptibility include:

- Use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) and antihistamines

- Having type 0 blood

- Poor sanitation

- Overcrowding

- Prior vagotomy

- Helicobacter pylori infection
