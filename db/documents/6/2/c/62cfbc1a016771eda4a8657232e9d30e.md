Mutation in the 3â€² untranslated, noncoding region of DMPK gene, located on chromosome 19q13.3, results in the expansion of DNA (CTG) repeats. Transcription of DNA results in a mutant RNA that disrupts the splicing of CUG binding protein (CUG-BP) and Musclebind-like protein (MBNL). This leads to the sequestration of splicing factors forming ribonuclear inclusions. In turn, this disturbs cellular signaling and causes toxic effects on muscle metabolism and RNA processing. This process is known as spliceopathy.

MBNL 1 protein is abundant skeletal muscle, whilst MBNL 2 in brain tissue. These proteins exhibit loss of function, as they are aggregated in the nucleus and unable to be utilized by the cell. Conversely, CUG-BP binds to cardiac troponin and exhibits gain of function via increased activation and phosphorylation. Elevated levels result in cardiac abnormalities, and abnormal insulin receptor function, elucidating the risk of diabetes. It also inhibits myoblast differentiation, resulting in loss of CIC-1 chloride channels through disruption of splicing. Defect in the splicing results in sustained muscle contraction with an inability to relax (myotonia).
