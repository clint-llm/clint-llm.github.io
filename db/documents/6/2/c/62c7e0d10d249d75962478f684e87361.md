The exact etiology of poroma is unknown. Unlike other adnexal follicular lineage neoplasms, family predilection has not been identified for the development of poromas. Long-term radiation exposure has been suggested to trigger the development of poroma and porocarcinomas.

Porocarcinoma is known to result from a possible malignant progression of a benign poroma. Its pathogenesis is still not clear, and there is not a definite timeline in which a poroma advances and becomes a porocarcinoma.

Occasionally, poroma has been reported with other conditions, including Bowen’s disease and hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia.
