A thorough medical history should be taken in all patients, as well as a social history screening for alcohol and tobacco use.

- Smoking cessation should be instituted for all patients at least four weeks prior to the procedure to maximize healing and reduce the risk of complications.

- The most disastrous complication of liposuction is a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) that could potentially lead to a pulmonary embolism (PE). Therefore, attempts to deduce the patient's risk for a DVT/PE should be done using the Caprini score.

- Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that up to 15% of patients seeking aesthetic surgery suffer from body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), which occurs whenÂ patients have a distorted view of their appearance despite their not being any overt abnormality.
