Bone marrow edema syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion that is characterized by pain and increased interstitial fluid within bone marrow without an obvious cause. It is frequently misdiagnosed as its clinical presentation is highly variable and nonspecific. This activity reviews the presentation, pathogenesis, and management of patients presenting with bone marrow edema syndrome. We examine the complications and briefly explore the impact of the disorder on patients and highlight the importance of an interprofessional team approach to treat these individuals appropriately.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the presentation of bone marrow edema syndrome.
- Summarize the clinical course of bone marrow edema syndrome and the best management.
- Identify the challenges associated with the management of bone marrow edema syndrome.
- Outline the role of an interprofessional health team in optimizing patient management of bone marrow edema syndrome.
