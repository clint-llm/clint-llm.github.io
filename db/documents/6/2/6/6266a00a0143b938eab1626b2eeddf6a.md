Chronic arsenic exposure through contaminated drinking supply is a global health concern. However, geographic distribution has a significant impact on contamination rates. India and Bangladesh have high rates of exposure with an estimated 27 million individuals in Bangladesh alone drinking water with contaminate levels greater than 50 ppb. The World Health Organization labels safe arsenic drinking levels at less than 10ppb. Contaminated drinking water has been found in private wells throughout the world, including the United States.

Occupational exposure occurs in the production of pesticides, herbicides, smelting, mining, glass manufacturing, semiconductor manufacturing, and occupations such as carpentry that involve the burning, removal or exposure to structures and or materials treated with arsenate wood preservatives.

Although regional distribution appears to be the dominant epidemiologic factor affecting arsenic toxicity, there is evidence to believe that the manifestation of arsenic toxicity differs between men and women. Some studies indicate that men are more affected than women by arsenic-related skin conditions.
