All patient findings that are part of DiGeorge syndrome can also be present as isolated anomalies in an otherwise normal individual.

The following conditions present with overlapping features:

- Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome - (polydactyly and cleft palate are common findings).

- Oculo-auriculo vertebral (Goldenhar) syndrome (OAVS) - (ear anomalies, heart disease, vertebral defects, and renal anomalies are present). OAVS often demonstrates a sporadic presentation.

- Alagille syndrome - (butterfly vertebrae, congenital heart disease, and posterior embryotoxon are common to both conditions).

- VATER association (heart disease, vertebral, renal, and limb anomalies present in both conditions). VATER association is a diagnosis of exclusion for which an established etiology to date remains unknown.

- CHARGE syndrome - (any combination of congenital heart disease, palatal differences, atresia choanae, coloboma, renal, growth deficiency, ear anomalies/hearing loss, facial palsy, developmental differences, genitourinary anomalies, and immunodeficiency are present in both syndromes).

Genetic consult is essential along with the complete clinical picture to make an accurate diagnosis of DiGeorge syndrome.
