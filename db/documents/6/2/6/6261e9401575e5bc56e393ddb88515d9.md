A major complication of acute hepatic porphyrias is an acute attack, which can be life-threatening if not treated urgently.

Furthermore, patients are at risk for developing hypertension, chronic renal failure, hepatocellular carcinoma, and iron deficiency anemia from menstrual blood loss (just as in women without porphyrias) or iron overload from frequent hemin therapy. Therefore, hypertension should be controlled, nephrotoxic medications should be avoided, patients over 50 years of age should have imaging of the liver performed for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma, and serum ferritin levels should be monitored.
