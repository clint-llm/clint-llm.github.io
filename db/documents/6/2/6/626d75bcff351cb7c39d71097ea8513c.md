Trench fever is an infection caused by the fastidious aerobic gram-negative rod bacterium, Bartonella quintana, formerly known as Rickettsia quintana. It can vary in symptoms and presentation, from non-specific symptoms such as fever, headache, rash, malaise, joint pain, and back pain to bacteremia, endocarditis, and bacillary angiomatosis. The disease likely has a zoonotic origin, with humans being the main host as it is now mainly transmitted by the three lice species, Pediculus humanus corporis (body louse), Pediculus humans capitis (head louse), and Pediculus humans pubis (pubic louse), with the body louse being the most common vector. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of trench fever and highlights the role of the interprofessional health team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of trench fever.
- Explain the common physical exam findings associated with trench fever.
- Review the complications of trench fever in chronic or untreated patients. 
- Summarize the importance of collaboration among the interprofessional team to enhance care coordination for patients with trench fever.
