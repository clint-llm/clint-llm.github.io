Most intraventricular meningiomas are benign, slow-growing lesions. They are typically found incidentally or become clinically evident when they obstruct the cerebrospinal fluid pathways and cause hydrocephalus. Three main clinical findings (headache, hydrocephalus, or visual field deficits) may be present.

Headache: The patient may present with a constant ipsilateral headache that does not resolve with oral medications. This is typically caused by adjacent parenchymal edema. If edema is present on imaging studies, surgical intervention is considered due to the risk of malignant presentation or a malignant lesion mimicking a meningioma.

Hydrocephalus: The patient complains of headache, nausea, blurry vision, sleepiness, lethargy, or coma. The patient can present with Cushing's triad with hypertension, bradycardia, and irregular respirations. Funduscopic examination typically shows bilateral optic nerve swelling. Unilateral or bilateral sixth nerve palsy can be present.

Visual field deficit: Contralateral homonymous quadrantanopia due to damage to adjacent optic radiations is found. Often, the patient is unaware of the quadrantanopia and is detected upon visual field evaluation in the ophthalmology clinic. Sometimes, the patient complains of difficulty visualizing objects in the upper corner of the visual field contralateral to the lesion's location.
