Differential diagnoses also depend on the type of exposure. Less significant ingestions may present with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting and appear similar to gastroenteritis, pancreatitis, other toxic ingestions, or other more common causes of gastric upset.

Inhalation injuries may present with mild to severe respiratory distress or dyspnea. They may present similarly to asthma exacerbations, other types of inhalation injuries, respiratory infections, or anaphylactic or other allergic reactions.

More significant ingestions or exposure directly into the bloodstream from injection or aggressive wound irrigation may present with altered mental status, coma, hypoxia, and hypotension. The differential diagnosis in these cases may be broad if no other history is available.Â Fortunately, the evaluation for patients presenting with these severe symptoms will likely include imaging or lab work that would lead to the diagnosis of hydrogen peroxide toxicity, presuming the treating provider is aware of the risks and presentation of such exposures.
