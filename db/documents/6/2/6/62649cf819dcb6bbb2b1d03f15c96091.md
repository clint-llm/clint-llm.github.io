Leukocoria is a pediatric manifestation. So parents of the child should be properly educated about investigating the child fully to know the cause of the leukocoria. It could be as benign as an altered Bruckner reflex to the most sinister retinoblastoma, which could be sight or life-threatening. The family doctor or the pediatrician, or the primary care physician is the first to diagnose leukocoria, and thus they play an essential role in the outcome of the eye condition. Any complaint of altered pupil reflex should be taken seriously and thoroughly investigated.

Parents should be reassured and counseled appropriately about the cumbersome process of the full investigation, including neuroimaging and also screening siblings for a hereditary disorder. Genetic counseling for retinoblastoma is complex and very much essential. Only 5 percent of retinoblastoma patients have a family history of RB. A bilateral retinoblastoma survivor parent has a 45 percent chance of having an affected child. A unilateral retinoblastoma survivor parent has a 7 percent chance of having an affected child. Normal parents of a child with bilateral RB have less than a 5 percent risk of having another child with RB. If two or more siblings are affected, the chance of another child having RB is 45 percent.
