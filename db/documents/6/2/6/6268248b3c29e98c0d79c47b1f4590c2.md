Traumatic fibromas arise from local irritation or injury, causing the tissue to progressively become more fibrotic.

Traumatic ulcerative granulomas with stromal eosinophilia arise from severe chronic irritation or trauma. These ulcerations are typically deep and tend to illicit a robust eosinophilic response. The cytotoxic nature of the by-products of these cells causes mucosal degeneration resulting in the formation of the lesion.

Inflammatory papillary hyperplasia has an unclear pathogenic pathway but likely arises from poor oral hygiene resulting in a Candida infiltrate, triggering an inflammatory response beneath a denture.

Thermal injury is caused by extreme temperatures resulting in injury to the tissue. As a result, there is sloughing of the epithelium and exposure of the highly vascularized connective tissue, which accounts for the erythematous appearance.

Chemical burns are caused by the alkaline or acidic environment from chemical products or by-products that are cytotoxic to tissue. As tissue necrosis, it sloughs, revealing connective tissue which is highly vascularized due to an increased inflammatory response to the area.
