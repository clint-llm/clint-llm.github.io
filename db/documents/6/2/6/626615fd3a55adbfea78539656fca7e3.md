**Contraindications**

- Conditions that exhibit resistance: Cerebral palsy, burn injuries, hemiplegia (on the affected side), peripheral nerve injury, severe chronic infections of botulism or tetani

- Conditions that exhibit hypersensitivity: ALS, autoimmune disorders (SLE, polymyositis, dermatomyositis), Guillain-Barre, Duchenne type muscular dystrophy, myasthenia gravis

**Cautions**

- Hypothermia: Prolongs blockade by decreasing metabolism and elimination

- Respiratory acidosis: Potentiates neuromuscular blockade and antagonizes reversal.

- Electrolyte abnormalities: Hypokalemia and hypocalcemia potentiate blockade; in preeclamptic patients who are taking magnesium sulfate can present with hypermagnesemia, which also potentiates blockades

- Hepatic disease/failure: Decreases clearance and increase volume of distribution

- Renal failure: Decreases clearance, though prolongation of blockade varies
