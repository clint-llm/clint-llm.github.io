The GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors (tirofiban and eptifibatide) are only available as intravenous agents. However, tirofiban and eptifibatide require a reduction in dosing for renal impaired patients.

Integrillin in acute coronary syndromes: 180 mcg/kg IV bolus over 1 to 2 min, and then 2 mcg/kg/min IV for up to 72 hours. In patients undergoing PCI - 180 mcg/kg IV, and then continuous infusion 2 mcg/kg/min with another 180 mcg/kg IV bolus 10 minutes after 1st one, Continue infusion at least 12 hours. The dosage of eptifibatide requires adjustment in patients with CrCl <50 mL/min; ACS: 180 mcg/kg IV, and then continuous infusion 1 mcg/kg/min; PCI: 180 mcg/kg IV, and then continuous infusion 1 mcg/kg/min with another 180 mcg/kg IV bolus 10 minutes after the first one. The safety and use during hemodialysis remain unestablished.

Tirofiban is available as a premixed IV infusion solution and IV solution vials. Premixed IV infusion solution: 5mg/100 mL (50 mcg/mL) and 12.5mg/250 mL (50mcg/mL). IV solution vials 5mg/100 mL vial (50mcg/mL), and 3.75mg/15mL bolus vial (250mcg/mL). In NSTEMI - loading dose: 25 mcg/kg IV infused within 5 min, and then post-loading dose infusion: 0.15 mcg/kg/min IV for up to 18 hr. In patients with CrCl ≤60 mL/min: Decrease post-loading dose infusion by 50% to 0.075 mcg/kg/min IV.
