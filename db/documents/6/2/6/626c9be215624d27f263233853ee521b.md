In SCID, microscopic examination of the thymic stroma reveals an absence of lymphoid cells, as well as the absence of Hassall's corpuscles.  In essence, the thymus gland has a fetal appearance.

Additionally, numerable Giardia lamblia can present in the gastrointestinal tract, specifically over the mucosa of the jejunum. The lack of protective immunity results in an inability to fight against these intestinal parasites.

Biopsy of lymph nodes (if detectable) shows severe depletion, without cortico-medullary differentiation or follicle formation. Biopsy of the intestinal tract may demonstrate a complete absence of plasma cells.
