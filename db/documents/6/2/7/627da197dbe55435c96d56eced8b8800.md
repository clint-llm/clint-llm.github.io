Indications for the use of ARBs are similar to those for ACEIs. However, in patients who cannot tolerate ACEI therapy due to an ACEI-induced cough or angioneurotic edema, ARB therapy is appropriate and suggested as an alternative. Currently available angiotensin receptor blockers, their FDA approved indications, and dosing for these indications are as follows:

**Azilsartan**

- Available as 40 and 80 mg tablet

Dosing:

- Hypertension: Initial dose: 20 mg by mouth once daily, maximum daily dose: 80 mg

**Candesartan**

- Available as 4 mg, 8 mg, 16 mg, 32 mg tablet

Dosing:

- Hypertension: Initial dose: 16 mg by mouth once daily, maximum daily dose: 32 mg

- Heart failure: Initial dose: 4 to 8 mg by mouth once daily, maximum daily dose: 32 mg

**Eprosartan**

- Available as 400 mg, 600 mg tablet

Dosing:

- Hypertension: Initial dose: 600 mg by mouth once daily, maximum daily dose: 900 mg

**Irbesartan**

- Available as 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg tablet

Dosing:

- Hypertension: Initial dose: 150 mg by mouth once daily, maximum daily dose: 300 mg

- Diabetic nephropathy: Initial dose: 75 mg by mouth once daily, maximum daily dose: 300 mg

**Losartan**

- Available as 25 mg, 50 mg, and 10 mg tablet

Dosing:

- Hypertension: Initial dose: 50 mg by mouth once daily, maximum daily dose: 100 mg

- For stroke prevention in hypertensive patients with a history of left ventricular hypertrophy (this does not apply to African-American patients): Initial dose: 50 mg by mouth once daily, maximum daily dose: 100 mg

- For the treatment of proteinuria or diabetic nephropathy: Initial dose: 50 mg by mouth once daily, maximum daily dose: 100 mg

**Olmesartan**

- Available as 5 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg tablet

Dosing:

- Hypertension: Initial dose: 20 mg by mouth once daily. Maximum daily dose: 40 mg

**Telmisartan**

- Available as 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg tablet

Dosing:

- Hypertension: Initial dose: 40 mg by mouth once daily, maximum daily dose: 80 mg

- To reduce cardiovascular-related mortality in adults age 55 years and older who have risk factors for serious cardiovascular events and cannot tolerate ACEI, stroke prophylaxis, and myocardial infarction prophylaxis.

- Initial dose: 80 mg by mouth once daily, maximum daily dose: 80 mg

**Valsartan**

- Available as 40mg, 80 mg, 160 mg and 320 mg tablet

Dosing:

- Hypertension: Initial dose 80-160mg by mouth once daily, a maximum daily dose of 320 mg

- For reducing cardiovascular mortality in otherwise stable patients with a history of left ventricular failure and or left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) following acute myocardial infarction.

- Heart failure: Initial dose: 20 mg by mouth twice a day, maximum daily dose: 160 mg bid

- Heart failure: Initial dose: 20 to 40 mg by mouth twice a day, maximum dose of 160 mg bid

ARBs are available combined with other medications. A few examples are listed below.

- Valsartan and amlodipine

- Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide

- Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide

- Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide

- Valsartan and nebivolol

The combination of valsartan and sacubitril (neprilysin inhibitor) is available and approved for reducing the risk of cardiovascular death, decreasing hospitalization for heart failure in patients with chronic heart failure (NYHA Class II through IV) and patients with reduced ejection fraction.

A few caveats to remember about the use of ARBs:

In patients with volume depletion or in those who are on diuretics, correct volume depletion before starting these agents or start with a lower dose.

Consider using a lower dose in geriatric patients.

Consider every 12-hour dosing in patients who experience diminished blood pressure response towards the end of a 24-hour dosing interval.
