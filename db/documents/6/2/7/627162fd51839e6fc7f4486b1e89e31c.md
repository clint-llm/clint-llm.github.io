The preoperative orientation of the patient about to undergo oral cavity surgery and reconstruction is of paramount importance. The patient and family members should understand that surgery will be the first step in a long rehabilitation and follow up process. Tobacco and/or alcohol cessation counseling should be offered to all patients, as patients who continue to smoke or drink during treatment have a very high likelihood of recurrence. Medical therapy for cessation should be offered. If not available, the clinician should refer the patient to a medical colleague that can provide such treatment.
