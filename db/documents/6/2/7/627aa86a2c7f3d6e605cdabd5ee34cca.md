Factors related to the formation of uric acid stones include a persistent decrease in urine pH, hypovolemia, and hyperuricosuria (defined as 24-hour urinary excretion of uric acid more than 750 mg/day in females and 800 mg/day in males).

**Decreased Urinary pH**

Uric acid urinary stones are frequently seen in conditions where there is a consistently low urinary pH. Almost all individuals with uric acid nephrolithiasis present with aciduria.

Decreased urinary pH (aciduria) is associated with lower urinary ammonia excretion due to metabolic syndrome. In the proximal convoluted tubule, insulin increases glutamine metabolism resulting in the production of ammonia (NH3) which then forms ammonium ions (NH4+) in the presence of free hydrogen. Ammonium is the primary urinary acid buffer; so when this is deficient, due to proximal renal tubular steatosis and lipotoxity or from lower insulin levels in patients with metabolic syndrome or diabetes, the patient will develop aciduria.

**Decreased Urine Output**

A decrease in urine output increases highly concentrated urinary solutes and supersaturation that increase susceptibility to crystal and stone formation. This leads to the precipitation of uric acid crystals, which lead to stones. This explains why uric acid stones are more common in tropical and humid climates.

**Hyperuricosuria**

Uric acid is almost completely filtered by the renal glomerulus, then mostly reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubule. About 10% of the filtered uric acid is ultimately excreted in the urine. In the presence of normal or low normal urinary pH, hyperuricosuria can form pure uric acid stones or mixed urinary stones composed of urate and calcium oxalate (Calcium phosphate generally requires a more alkaline environment to form stones). An increase in the concentration of monosodium urate induces the formation of calcium oxalate crystals. Hyperuricosuria often results from a disturbance in dietary factors (so-called purine gluttony). Congenital renal hypouricemic hyperuricosuria is seen due to mutations in the URAT1 channel.

**Crystallization Inhibitors**

Many components in urine suppress the crystallization of urate and thus inhibit urinary stone formation. The most significant of these is citrate, which lowers urinary pH, but there are also several glycoproteins and glycosaminoglycans present in urine, which specifically suppress precipitation of urate crystals.
