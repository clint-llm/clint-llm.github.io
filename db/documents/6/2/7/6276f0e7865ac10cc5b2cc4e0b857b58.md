Noninvasive infarct-avid myocardial perfusion imaging can be particularly useful in the evaluation of acute myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease when diagnosis by conventional methods is limited. A late presentation of suspected acute myocardial infarction after approximately 7 days in the context of equivocal clinical history, absent or uninterpretable diagnostic EKG findings, and negative cardiac biomarkers can be challenging to diagnose. Tissue characterization, including new areas with reversible ischemia, old infarcts, or viable myocardium, can be identified using myocardial perfusion imaging.

Exercise stress testing is the most commonly utilized means of risk stratification in patients with low to intermediate pretest probability of coronary artery disease. However, in the presence of baseline EKG abnormalities such as a left bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, preexcitation, paced rhythm, or baseline ST-segment depression, results of exercise stress testing may be uninterpretable. An allergic reaction to iodine/ iodinated contrast is a contraindication for CCTA, while a morbidly obese patient may have poor windows for visualization with echocardiography. In such scenarios, including pregnancy, CMR can be a useful diagnostic modality in the evaluation of coronary artery disease. In patients who are suspected to have new ischemia after recently having undergone coronary artery bypass grafting or other major surgical procedures, SPECT and PET can also help identify areas of new periprocedural infarcts.

Coronary CTA can be utilized in the ischemic evaluation of a patient with an intermediate pretest probability of having coronary artery disease and evaluating coronary artery defects such as anomalous coronaries. Coronary angiography and catheterization offer both diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Techniques such as fractional flow reserve (FFR) utilized during coronary catheterization evaluate blood flow under conditions of maximal hyperemia help to identify clinically significant stenosis and potentially offer appropriate revascularization strategy, including percutaneous coronary intervention, bypass grafting, or medical management.
