Von Economo encephalitis is a disorder of possible autoimmune origin that affects the midbrain, pons, basal ganglia, and substantial nigra. It is believed that this autoimmune reaction follows an initial viral (influenza) or bacterial (streptococcal) infection.

Postencephalitic parkinsonism is based on the hypothesis that dopamine depletion and hypersensitive dopamine receptors result in dopamine neurotransmission imbalance.

Von Economo described three clinical forms of encephalitis lethargica:

- Somnolent-ophthalmologic form characterized by excessive sleepiness followed by progressive confusion, stupor, and coma. It was associated with internal ophthalmoplegia, oculogyric crisis, nystagmus, dyskinesia, pyramidal, and cerebellar signs.

- Amyostatic-akinetic form characterized by acute parkinsonism, catatonia, or mutism.

- The hyperkinetic form presented restlessness, mania, visual hallucination, chorea, hemichorea, myoclonic twitches, troublesome sleeplessness, and dyskinesia.
