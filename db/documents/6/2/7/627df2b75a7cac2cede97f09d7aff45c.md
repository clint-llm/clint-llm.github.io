Hematuria is the presence of blood in the urine. Hematuria can be gross or microscopic; gross hematuria is visible blood in urine whereas microscopic hematuria refers to the detection of blood on urinalysis or urine microscopy. This activity illustrates the evaluation, diagnosis, treatment, and management of hematuria and the importance of a team approach to its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the differences between gross hematuria and microscopic hematuria. 
- Review the sequential evaluation that should be done for gross hematuria versus microscopic hematuria. 
- Explain management options for the various etiologies of gross and microscopic hematuria. 
- Describe the role of interprofessional team members in optimizing collaboration and communication to ensure patients with hematuria are recognized early and every effort is made to deliver optimal care, which will lead to enhanced outcomes.
