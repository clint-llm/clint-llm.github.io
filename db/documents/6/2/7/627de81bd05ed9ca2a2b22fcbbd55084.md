The closest and most important differential to be considered are inferior oblique overaction (IOOA) and acquired skew deviations. It is important to differentiate as the surgical approach differs for these conditions.

The important differentiating points between IOOA and DVD include:

- Hyperdeviation maximum in adduction in IOOA, while it is almost of similar degrees in primary, adducted, and abducted positions in DVD

- V pattern is associated with IOOA, while absent in DVD

- Superior oblique under action is usually associated with IOOA

- An extorted macula can be seen in IOOA, while it is absent in patients with DVD

- Bielschowsky phenomenon is present in DVD, while it is absent in DVD.

The important differentiating points between acquired skew deviation and DVD include:

- Skew deviations can present at any age, while the most common age of presentations is around 2-4 years among DVD patients

- In skew deviations, there is intortion of the higher eye and extortion of the lower eye, while it is vice versa in DVD

- Brainstem or cerebellar region lesion can be associated with skew deviation

- Vertical diplopia is associated with skew deviation, while DVD is not associated with similar complaints

- Seesaw or Hemi-seesaw nystagmus is associated with skew deviation, while DVD is associated with latent nystagmus
