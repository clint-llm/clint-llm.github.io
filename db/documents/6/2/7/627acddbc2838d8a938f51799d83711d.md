Phthiriasis palpebrarum patients should be educated in detail regarding the importance of daily hygienic practices and measures to be followed. The patient should be explained to wash the eyelashes with baby shampoo or regular soap while bathing. The infection spreads by contact; hence all the family members, sexual partners, and close contacts must be thoroughly evaluated and treated. All the clothes, bedsheets, linen, and towel should be machine washed for 30 minutes at 55 degrees and dried in hot steam for 5 to 10 minutes. The patient should receive counsel that the clothes that cannot be washed should be dry cleaned or kept sealed in a plastic bag for at least two weeks.
