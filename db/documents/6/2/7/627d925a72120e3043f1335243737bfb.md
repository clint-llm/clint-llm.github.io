The main serious complication associated with EPP is protoporphyrin-related hepatopathy, which may be fatal. In the later stages of hepatopathy, the patient may develop peripheral neuropathy, which mimics the peripheral neuropathy of acute porphyria and may lead to respiratory failure. On repeated exposure to sunlight, the skin over the face, dorsum of hands (knuckles), can become thickened or lichenified along with loss of lunulae of fingernails. Due to regular sunlight avoidance, patients with EPP are more prone to develop a vitamin-D deficiency, which can lead to osteoporosis.
