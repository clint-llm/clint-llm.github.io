The diagnosis of blue nevus is generally clinical, made grossly, or with the use of a dermatoscope, though biopsy and pathologic evaluation is the gold standard for definitive diagnosis.

Because melanoma can present clinically over a broad spectrum of morphologies, it is crucial to distinguish it from blue nevus as the former may also commonly present as a nodule with a blue to black hue.**A**symmetry, irregular**B**orders,**C**olor variation,**D**iameter greater than 6 mm,**E**volving). Another more modern clinical tool is the “Ugly Duckling” sign based on the premise that concerning lesions typically don’t mirror surrounding ones. More recently, there have been suggestions that the two be used in conjunction with one another to improve sensitivity.

When high suspicion for melanoma exists, an incisional biopsy is not a recommendation. As opposed to punch or shave, an excisional biopsy should be performed, with only a few exceptions to include larger lesions and cosmetically sensitive areas. An excisional biopsy allows more accurate and timely tumor staging and prompt referral for appropriate management in the case of malignant lesions.
