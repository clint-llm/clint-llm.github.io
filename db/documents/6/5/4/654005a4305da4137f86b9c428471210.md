- Osteoporosis in men is a growing problem worldwide and in the USA. The incidence of osteoporosis in males is growing due to multiple factors, including aging of the population, more sedentary lifestyle. It is usually overlooked due to culturally be considered a postmenopausal female medical problem. However, men experience higher mortality and morbidity following fractures.

- About 50% of men tend to have an identifiable and potentially secondary cause of osteoporosis. Therefore it is mandatory to perform a careful evaluation for all the possible causes and provide adequate treatment if available.

- Treatment involves lifestyle changes, supplementation of calcium and vitamin D, treatment of secondary causes, and anti-osteoporosis therapy.

- New drugs have been developed and new studies have been including males more frequently.

- Anti-osteoporotic drugs that have shown efficacy in males are bisphosphonates (only alendronate, risedronate, and zoledronic acid), denosumab, and teriparatide.
