The function of the alveolar gas equation is in calculating alveolar-arterial O2 gradient (A-a gradient).

**Estimating A-a gradient:**

- Normal A-a gradient = (Age + 10) / 4

A-a gradient increases 5 to 7 for every 10% increase in FiO2.

The arterial PO2 can be determined by obtaining an arterial blood gas. With the help of the alveolar gas equation, the partial pressure inside the alveoli can be calculated.

Carbon dioxide is a very important variable in the equation. The PO2 in alveoli can change significantly with variations in blood and alveolar carbon dioxide levels. If the rise in CO2 is significant, it can displace oxygen molecules which will cause hypoxemia.

As atmospheric pressure reduces with increased altitude, the alveolar gas equation helps to calculate the PAO2 within the alveoli. This is significant to appropriately identify the developed hypoxemia from decreased atmospheric pressure and subsequently treat with appropriate supplemental oxygen levels.
