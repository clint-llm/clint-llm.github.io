Shoulder dystocia is a complication of vaginal delivery in which the baby's shoulder gets caught above the mother's pubic bone. It is characterized by failure to deliver the fetal shoulders using solely gentle downward traction, the need for additional delivery maneuvers to deliver the baby successfully, and/or a documented head-to-body interval of greater than 1 minute. This is an obstetrical emergency requiring first-line and second-line maneuvers to deliver the baby with minimal complications. This activity reports the assessment and management of shoulder dystocia and goes over the role of the labor and delivery interprofessional team members to improve care for those with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the pathophysiology of shoulder dystocia.
- Describe the diagnostic approach for evaluating shoulder dystocia injuries.
- Review treatment and management options for patients with shoulder dystocia injuries.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members to perform maneuvers, which will improve outcomes for those with shoulder dystocia.
