SCID should be managed by an interprofessional team that likely includes a pediatrician, geneticist, clinical immunologist, pediatrician, nurse practitioner, and an infectious disease specialist. The treatment team may also provide counseling to the parents, given the poor prognosis associated with the disease. Because of the high morbidity of the disorder, a palliative team consisting of a nurse, a social worker, and a pain specialist should also have involvement in the care. Pediatric hematology nurses assist in the care of these patients and report changes to the team. Pharmacists review medications, check for interactions and educate patient's families about side effects and compliance. [Level 5]
