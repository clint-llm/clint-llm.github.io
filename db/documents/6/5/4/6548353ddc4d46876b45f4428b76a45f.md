**Syphilis**

Although there may be no specific microscopic feature for the diagnosis of syphilis, it should be considered where there is unusual dense lymphoplasmacytic inflammation with inflammatory exocytosis, epithelial hyperplasia, granulomatous or ulceration at the surface, and perivascular inflammation.

**Gonorrhea**

Methylene blue-stained smears of N.gonorrhoeae or light microscopy of gram-negative will reveal neutrophils with intracellular diplococci. High sensitivity and specificity are reported with light microscopy for symptomatic males with urethral discharge; however, light microscopy has a lower sensitivity for diagnosing pharyngeal gonorrhea.

**Tuberculosis**

Biopsy commonly shows caseating granulomas typically with central necrosis surrounded by epithelioid histiocytic cells, Langerhans giant cells, and lymphocytic infiltration, characteristic of TB.

**Scarlet fever**

There are no specific histological changes in scarlet fever; however,Â neutrophilic infiltrate with spongiosis, and parakeratosis in the epidermis may be seen.
