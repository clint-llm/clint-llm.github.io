Though only a vitamin, cyanocobalamin can cause several adverse drug reactions, including allergic reactions like itching, erythema, and wheals.****Cyanocobalamin therapy's cutaneous adverse drug reactions include acne, rosacea, and anaphylaxis with cyanocobalamin injections. Cobalt is a component of cobalamin; consequently, patients with cobalt sensitivity have been reported to have allergic manifestations when receiving cobalamin replacement therapy.

Other common adverse effects include:

- Shortness of breath (even with mild exertion), swelling, rapid weight gain

- Pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure; peripheral vascular thrombosis

- Hypokalemia--leg cramps, irregular heartbeats, tingling/numbness, muscle weakness, or limp feeling

- Numbness or tingling and joint pain

- Fever

- Swollen tongue

- Itching or rash

- Polycythemia; cyanocobalamin can unmask the underlying polycythemia. Patients with myeloproliferative disorders like polycythemia vera have an increased prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency, despite high serum vitamin B12 levels.
