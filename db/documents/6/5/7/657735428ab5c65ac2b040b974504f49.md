Lactulose is used in preventing and treating clinical portal-systemic encephalopathy. Its chief mechanism of action is by decreasing the intestinal production and absorption of ammonia. It has also gained popularity as a potential therapeutic agent for the management of subacute clinical encephalopathy. It is also a laxative for the treatment of chronic constipation. Its osmotic effect and its effect on intestinal motility receive credit for its therapeutic efficacy. This activity covers lactulose, including mechanism of action, pharmacology, adverse event profiles, eligible patient populations, contraindications, monitoring, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of lactulose therapy.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of lactulose.
- Identify the various indications for using lactulose.
- Review the potential adverse events and contraindications to lactulose use.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance lactulose and improve outcomes.
