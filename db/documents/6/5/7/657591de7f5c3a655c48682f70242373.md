Orchitis is defined as the inflammation of the testicle unilaterally or bilaterally usually caused by viruses and bacteria. Testes are two oval male reproductive organs situated in the scrotum. They are responsible for the production of male sex hormones and sperm. The testis is innervated by the testicular plexus, which contains nerves originating from the renal and aortic plexus. The main arterial supply is by paired testicular artery, arising from the abdominal aorta, which passes via the inguinal canal inside the spermatic cord. Venous drainage is through the pampiniform plexus. As testis are originally retroperitoneal organs, lymphatic drainage is through para-aortic lymph nodes, while superficial inguinal lymph nodes drain the scrotum.

Orchitis can be acute and symptomatic on the presentation or asymptomatic and chronic.
