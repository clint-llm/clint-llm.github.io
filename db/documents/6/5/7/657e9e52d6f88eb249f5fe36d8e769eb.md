The clinical manifestations of the immune-complex mediated disease depend on the type of antigen and route of exposure. For example, intravenous entry of antigen can lead to vasculitis, arthritis, and glomerulonephritis. Inhalational entry can manifest with a pulmonary syndrome termed hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Local injection of the antigen can cause necrotizing skin lesions called Arthus reaction. Immune-complex-associated inflammation of the vessels of the dermis and subcutaneous fat can have manifestations such as purpuric rash, erythema nodosum (tender red nodules on the anterior surface of lower extremities), or erythema multiforme (target lesions with minimal mucosal involvement, often present in lower extremities).

The history and physical examination findings of common immune complex-mediated diseases are described below.

**Serum Sickness:**Before the advent of antibiotics, horse serum was used to treat patients with scarlet fever and pneumonia. The host antibodies bind with the non-self antigens in horse sera to form immune complexes that deposit in the joints, subendothelial layer, and mesangium of the glomeruli. The classic symptoms of serum sickness are rash, arthritis, and fever. Proteinuria can be seen with renal involvement. Symptoms appear one to two weeks after exposure to the antigen. As the phagocytic system removes the immune complexes, in a few weeks, the symptom resolution ensues with an overall excellent prognosis. In modern times, serum sickness is associated with exposure to heterologous (nonhuman) protein (e.g., equine antisnake venom) or chimeric antibodies (rituximab/murine-rabbit chimeric anti-CD-20).

**Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (HP):**HP,****also known as extrinsic allergic alveolitis, is a respiratory syndrome that involves the deposition of immune complexes in the alveoli, interstitium, terminal bronchioli, and lung parenchyma**.**The inhalation of antigen triggers an allergic immune response that is IgE-mediated.Micropolyspora faeni and Thermoactinomyces Vulgaris) that grow on crops. Another example of HP is the bird fancier's disease, in which the etiologic bird-related antigens include immunoglobulins, intestinal mucin present in bird droppings, or waxy coating of the feathers.

A high index of suspicion is needed for the diagnosis of HP. A thorough history should be conducted to elicit the environmental and occupational exposure information of the patient.

**Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE):**SLE is an autoimmune disease with multisystem involvement. The condition is characterized by the presence of circulating IgG and IgM autoantibodies to host tissue components. In most cases, the antibodies are directed against the parts of the nucleus, such as double-stranded DNA, histone, and ribonuclear proteins. In some patients, autoantibodies against the cells, including platelets, erythrocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes, can be present. The autoantibodies against the phospholipid moiety of the prothrombin activator complex or cardiolipin can lead to a hypercoagulable state. Major clinical signs and symptoms spanning multiple organ systems are listed below:

- General: Fever, weight loss, and fatigue

- Musculoskeletal: Arthralgias, arthritis, and myalgias

- Mucocutaneous: Malar (butterfly) rash with photosensitivity, oral ulcers, alopecia

- Cardiac: Pericarditis, endocarditis, myocarditis

- Vascular: Raynauds phenomenon, predominantly small vessel vasculitis manifesting as petechiae, purpura, and superficial ulcers

- Pulmonary: Pleural effusion, cough, and dyspnea

- Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain

- Renal: Glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, asymptomatic hematuria or proteinuria, diminished renal function

- Hematological: Anemia, leukopenia, hemolysis, thrombosis, fetal loss in pregnancy

- Central Nervous System: Headaches, seizures, stroke

- The musculoskeletal, mucocutaneous, and pulmonary systems are most commonly involved in SLE.

**Post Streptococcal Glomerulonephritis (PSGN):**The glomerular deposition of immune complexes triggered by nephritogenic strains of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci causes PSGN. Symptoms are usually apparent between 1 and 3 weeks after a streptococcal throat infection or 3-6 weeks in cases of skin infection. The presenting features could include microscopic or gross hematuria, proteinuria, hypertension, edema, and elevation in serum creatinine.
