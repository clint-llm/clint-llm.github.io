Although hydroceles in infants tend to resolve spontaneously, they need to be monitored closely. In this regard, parents play a vital role. If such hydroceles persist beyond two years of age, a surgeon should be approached for its management. Parental anxiety is common, so they need to be counseled properly. In adults, hydroceles without underlying pathology can be self-monitored regarding its size or any component of infection. However, in cases of hydroceles resulting from an underlying condition, medical attention should be sought to avoid any morbidity or mortality.

Patients should be made aware of the complications of hydrocele. Also, all the treatment options should be discussed thoroughly with the patient. The patient should be educated that, despite proper medical or surgical management, the hydrocele may recur.
