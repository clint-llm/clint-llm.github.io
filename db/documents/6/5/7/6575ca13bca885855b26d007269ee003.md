Contaminated water sources or fecal-oral transfer frequently spread Cryptosporidium. A recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report shows that the incidence of Cryptosporidium outbreaks has increased significantly in the United States. Many outbreaks in the United States have been associated with the contamination of recreational and municipal water supplies. Outbreaks in daycare centers have also been reported, likely due to fecal-oral transmission. Transmission during anal intercourse has also been reported due to fecal-oral transmission. Cryptosporidium is also associated with seasonal changes and malnutrition. Studies have shown that higher temperature and more rainfall are associated with an increased risk of cryptosporidiosis. The number of reported cases has increased in recent years with increasing clinical recognition and testing. It is more common in low resource settings, with 5% to 10% of immunocompetent hosts shedding the organism in low resource countries as opposed to approximately 1% in high resource settings. Animal exposure, particularly in cats and cattle, is also associated with increased risk of infection. Children and the elderly are most commonly diagnosed with cryptosporidiosis. Patients with acquired (human immunodeficiency virus, chemotherapy, immunosuppressant medications,) or congenital (hypogammaglobulinemia; IgA deficiency) immunodeficiency are at highest risk of infection and for prolonged or severe illness.
