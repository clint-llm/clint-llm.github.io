Orlistat acts by reversibly inhibiting gastric and pancreatic lipases. These lipases have an important role in the digestion of dietary fat. They work by breaking down the triglycerides into absorbable free fatty acids and monoglycerides. Orlistat covalently binds to the serine residues of active sites of lipases and inactivates them. The inactivation of lipases prevents the hydrolysis of triglycerides, and thus free fatty acids are not absorbed.

Research also suggested that orlistat has a beneficial consequence on carbohydrate metabolism.

**Pharmacokinetics**

- Absorption: Orlistat acts mainly via its local effect in the gut, and systemic exposure to the medication is minimal.

- Distribution: Most (more than 99%) of the drug is bound to the plasma proteins (lipoproteins and albumin are the major binding proteins).

- Metabolism: Orlistat metabolism is primarily within the intestinal wall.

- Elimination: 95 to 97% of the medication is unabsorbed and excreted in feces.
