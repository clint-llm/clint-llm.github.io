Initial efforts in the workup should focus on excluding major systemic causes, including heart failure, liver failure, and kidney failure. Therefore, a thorough history and physical examination are vital to minimize unnecessary testing. If systemic causes are suspected, for example, in CHF, chest radiography, EKG, serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) should be checked. Depending on these tests, echocardiography can be obtained for further evaluation.

In liver disease, start with liver function tests and albumin, followed by a liver ultrasound if suspicion is high or abnormal labs.
