Unilateral vocal cord paralysis (UVCP) presents with dysphonia, shortness of breath and swallowing difficulty. It occurs secondary to damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which usually occurs as a result of cancers, trauma, or surgery. Making the definitive diagnosis of unilateral vocal cord paralysis requires taking an extensive clinical history, performing a thorough examination, and carrying out an investigation to identify the underlying cause. This should be done by Otolaryngology, as this team is usually best equipped to restore a patient's voice with a variety of surgical and non-surgical interventions when vocal restoration is possible. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of unilateral vocal cord paralysis and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the common causes of unilateral vocal cord paralysis. 
- Review the presentation of a patient with unilateral vocal cord paralysis. 
- Outline the management options for unilateral vocal cord paralysis.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with unilateral vocal cord paralysis.
