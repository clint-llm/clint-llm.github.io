Discitis is a serious but uncommon medical diagnosis. It is an infection of the intervertebral disc space. The role of the intervertebral discs is to separate and cushion the spinal segments from each other. An infection, and thus inflammation of these discs can cause much pain and discomfort. What makes the condition uncommon is also what makes it difficult to treat: the relatively scarce blood supply to these segments. Treatment consists of a prolonged antibiotic course, but will usually result in uncomplicated resolution of symptoms; however, delay in treatment or misdiagnosis can lead to significant morbidity and mortality.
