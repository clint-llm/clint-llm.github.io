In majority of the patients with prediabets do not experience any symptoms and hence appropriate screening and monitoring especially in individuals with family history is needed. In the minority of patients who do experience symptoms, they can be as follows:

- Increased appetite

- Unexplained weight loss/weight gain

- High BMI

- Weakness

- Fatigue

- Sweating

- Blurred vision

- Slow healing cuts or bruises

- Recurrent skin infections/gum bleeding

The single sign of prediabetes is elevated blood glucose on a blood test that is not high enough to be classified as type 2 diabetes mellitus.
