E. coli is part of commensal intestinal flora and is also found on the floors of hospitals and long-term care facilities. E. coli is the most common gram-negative bacteria in the human gastrointestinal tract and lacks virulence in this setting. However, when found outside of the intestinal tract, E. coli can cause urinary tract infections (UTI), pneumonia, bacteremia, and peritonitis, among others.

E. coli is a major cause of nosocomial infections, including catheter-associated UTIs and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).E. coli can also be found in soil, on vegetables, and in water, as well asÂ in undercooked meats. Pathogenic strains cause intestinal illness in humans when ingested.
