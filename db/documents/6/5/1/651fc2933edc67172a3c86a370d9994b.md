**History**

The classic symptom is perineal pain which is exacerbated on sitting and relieved on standing or sitting on a toilet.

- It causes pain, numbness, and dysfunction in the distribution of the pudendal nerve. (This includes the genitalia, perineum, rectum, and lower urinary tract.)

- Urinary issues such as urgency, frequency, and painful ejaculations in men.

- Sexual dysfunction, including persistent arousal dysfunction, dyspareunia, vulvodynia, and male erectile disorders.

- Sphincteric dysfunction presents as constipation, dysuria, fecal incontinence, and urinary hesitancy.

- There may be a foreign body sensation in the anus, rectum, urethra, or vagina.

**Physical Examination**

The physical examination in patients with pudendal nerve entrapment is relatively normal, except for pain reproduction.

Rectal and vaginal examinations are suggested to exclude other diagnoses such as prostatitis and to identify any intrapelvic entrapment.
