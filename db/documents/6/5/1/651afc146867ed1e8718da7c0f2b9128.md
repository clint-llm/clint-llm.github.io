The osteocutaneous radial forearm flap is a variant of the fasciocutaneous radial forearm free flap wherein partial thickness of the radius is harvested and perfused by preserving the lateral intermuscular septum and the perforating vessels to the bone. This activity reviews osteocutaneous radial forearm free flaps and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for osteocutaneous radial forearm free flap transfer.
- Describe the technique of osteocutaneous radial forearm free flap transfer.
- Review the potential complications of radial forearm free flap transfer.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the utilization of osteocutaneous radial forearm free flaps and to improve outcomes.
