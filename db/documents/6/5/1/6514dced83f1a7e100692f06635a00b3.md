- Most reported adverse effects caused by pregabalin were mild to moderate intensity, dose-dependent, and occurred within the first two weeks of initiating treatment.

- The most common adverse events were those affecting the central nervous system (CNS). Somnolence and dizziness occurred most frequently and were the most common adverse reactions that led to the discontinuation of pregabalin.

- The most common adverse reactions reported across all patient populations in premarketing controlled trials, which occurred in greater than or equal to 5% of patients taking pregabalin and twice the rate reported by patients receiving placebo, were: somnolence, dizziness, blurred vision, difficulty with concentration/attention, dry mouth, edema, and weight gain.

- Weight gain associated with pregabalin is dose-dependent and occurred in up to 14% of patients receiving 600 mg per day.

- Following rapid or abrupt discontinuation of pregabalin, some patients reported symptoms including insomnia, nausea, headache, anxiety, nervousness, irritability,Â hyperhidrosis, and diarrhea.

- Chronic use of pregabalin can result in physical dependence, and there is a risk of abuse associated with its use, especially in patients on opioid medicines or who have a history of substance abuse.
