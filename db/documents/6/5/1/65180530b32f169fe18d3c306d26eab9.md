Cerebrovascular accidents, commonly known as strokes, are prevalent across patient populations and can be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Strokes can be categorized as ischemic, hemorrhagic, or subarachnoid. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of ischemic cerebrovascular accidents and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the recognition and management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of ischemic cerebrovascular accidents.
- Describe the typical presentation of a patient with an ischemic cerebrovascular accident.
- Describe the recommended management of ischemic cerebrovascular accidents, including immediate interventions, mitigation of sequelae, and subacute management.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding the management of patients affected by acute and subacute cerebrovascular accidents.
