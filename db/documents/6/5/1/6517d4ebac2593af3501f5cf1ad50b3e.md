**Screening for Keratoconus:**Keratoconus is a progressive noninflammatory ectatic disorder. It is the most commonly encountered corneal ectasia in clinical practice. Clinical diagnosis may be made by frequent changes of glasses, shadowing around letters, and poor vision, even with spectacle correction. It is objectively characterized by scissoring during retinoscopy and in later stages by apical scarring, stromal striae (Vogt striae), and bulging of the lower lid on down gaze (Munson sign). In later stages, the Descemet membrane may split, leading to corneal edema (hydrops).

Rabinowitz established specific criteria to diagnose keratoconus, which were modified to include the following criteria: dioptric power > 47 D, irregular corneal curvature (asymmetric bowtie), and inferior-superior index >1.4 D.

Amsler-Krumeich classification system grades keratoconus from 1 to 4 based on spectacle refraction, central corneal thickness, presence or absence of scarring, and central keratometry.

Videokeratographic indices to detect keratoconus even before clinical signs were incorporated into software systems by Rabinowitz and Klyce-Maeda.

Forme fruste was identified as the apparently normal "other" (fellow) eye of a patient with one eye diagnosed as keratoconus.

Using the Pentacam system, the Belin Ambrosio enhanced ectasia display (BAD-D), diagnosis, and progression of keratoconus are made more accurate.

Other indices which are recommended are the following:

- Ambrósio Relational Thickness (ART) values,

- the index of vertical asymmetry (IVA),

- pachymetric progression indices (PPI).

- Keratoconus index (KI) is the ratio between the mean radius of curvature values between upper and lower segments.KI can distinguish normal from clinical keratoconus.

- The index of height decentration (IHD) is the degree of centration in the vertical direction.

- The index of vertical asymmetry (IVA), the level of curvature symmetry with respect to the horizontal meridian, is given by this data.

- The index of height asymmetry (IHA) is another important parameter.

- The index of surface variance (ISV) is the deviation of the corneal radius as compared to the mean value. ISV may be useful for tracking progression.

- Index of vertical asymmetry (IVA), the level of curvature symmetry with respect to the horizontal meridian, is given by this data.

- Minimal sagittal curvature (R min) is the minimum radius of curvature that corresponds to the maximum anterior curvature. It has high correction with the best spectacle-corrected visual acuity.

- Posterior elevation maps are considered superior to anterior elevation maps in detecting subclinical keratoconus.

Minimal sagittal curvature (R min) is the minimum radius of curvature that corresponds to the maximum anterior curvature. The enhanced best fit sphere is a concept introduced by Belin wherein a 3.5 mm diameter zone centered around the thinnest area is excluded.

**Progression of Keratoconus:**Several indices measure the progression of keratoconus. An increase in values of anterior and posterior K1 and K2, progressive thinning, and an increase in anterior and posterior elevation are all signs of progression. However, certain indices have been proposed to be more reliable such as the pachymetry progression index (PPI).

**Screening for refractive surgery:**The main aim of screening candidates for refractive surgery is to identify those at risk for post-surgery ectasia. To identify pre-keratoconus, subclinical keratoconus, or forme fruste keratoconus, several classification systems, indices, and criteria have been formulated, such as the collaborative and longitudinal evaluation of keratoconus (CLEK) criteria, keratoconus index (KCI) and keratoconus prediction index (KPI) by Klyce-Maeda, and the Ectasia Risk Score system (ERSS) by Randleman et al.

Corneal topographic patterns and pachymetry are still considered the cornerstone in screening candidates for laser refractive procedures. Corneal mechanical strength and collagen mapping are recent additions to the armamentarium.

The following indices have been recommended by Motlagh et al. as the most effective for the detection of pre-keratoconus: Belin-Ambrósio Enhanced Ectasia Display Total Deviation Value (BAD_D), pachymetry progression index (PPI), Ambrósio relational thickness (ART) values, and the index of vertical asymmetry (IVA).

**Contact lens fitting and contact lens warpage:**Contact lens fitting software was incorporated even in Placido-based topographers such as Eye-Sys. Topographic maps can show the central and peripheral radius of curvature, unlike the keratometers, which show only central curvatures.

Short-term discontinuation of soft contact lenses did not interfere much with corneal topography measurement.

**Placing intracorneal ring segments:**Topographic maps, along with pachymetric maps, assist in calculating the placement and depth of intracorneal ring segments. Postoperatively, the flattening of the cornea is also measured by the topographic maps.

**Placement of arcuate incisions:**The steeper axis is identified by topographic maps after penetrating or lamellar keratoplasty or even for placing arcuate incisions in Femto laser cataract surgery and limbal relaxing incisions in cataract surgery (LRI). The topographic maps also dictate the extent of the arc of incision and depth.

**Predictors of post-refractive surgery ectasia:**Ectasia risk score system devised by Randleman et al.

The risk factors in order of importance are preoperative topographic pattern, RSB (residual stromal bed), age, preoperative pachymetry, and myopia. Topographic pattern preoperatively is the most important factor. The other risk factors are asymmetric bow tie, abnormal and inferior steep, skewed axis, and severe asymmetry between eyes. This scoring system was based on Placido-based topography.

**Differentiating post-refractive surgery regression from ectasia:**Several parameters, such as corneal thinning, increase in dioptric power of the cornea, change in refraction, and change in the best corrected visual acuity, are all important in distinguishing regression from ectasia. Corneal topography is an important part of this process.

**Terrien marginal degeneration:**Usually, Terrien marginal degeneration starts in the superior cornea. There is peripheral thinning, vascularization, and lipid deposition. Recurrent episodes of inflammation may occur, and the thinning may lead to perforation. The topographic pattern is an inverted crab claw configuration.

**Pellucid marginal corneal degeneration (PMCD):**It is a noninflammatory corneal ectatic disorder that presents later in life than keratoconus and progresses more slowly. "Butterfly pattern" or crab claw pattern in Placido-based topography may not be the main diagnostic feature. Schiempflug-based tomography gives more importance to the pachymetric map to distinguish PMCD from Keratoconus.
