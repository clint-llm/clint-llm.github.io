The most common adverse effect is pain related to the procedural injection of chloroprocaine. The next most common adverse effects are related to spinal, epidural, and caudal anesthesia: hypotension, bradycardia, nausea, and headache.

Similar to other local anesthetics, if too much chloroprocaine is administered into the epidural or intrathecal space, a high block may occur. The most common scenario is an accidental intrathecal injection during epidural placement.  If the block is higher than the T1 dermatome, the cardiac accelerator fibers will be blocked, and bradycardia will ensue. This will usually be accompanied by hypotension, nausea, significant patient anxiety, and akathisia. If the block continues to rise, brainstem dysfunction may occur with associated loss of consciousness and apnea—this constellation of symptoms is commonly referred to as a “total spinal.”

One case of cauda equina syndrome has been described after an appropriate dose of preservative-free intrathecal chloroprocaine. The patient developed urinary retention, severe lower extremity burning pain, leg weakness, and loss of sensation in the buttock and bilateral thighs. The patient’s symptoms resolved over 5 to 6 weeks.

Anaphylaxis to local anesthetics is very rare. Ester local anesthetics, such as chloroprocaine, may have a higher incidence of allergic reactions due to one of their metabolites, para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), which is structurally similar to methylparaben.
