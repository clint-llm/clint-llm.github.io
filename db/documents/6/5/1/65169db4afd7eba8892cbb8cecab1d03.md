If practitioners are evaluating the patient for appendicitis, they should also obtain an early surgical consultation.

Do not give anything by mouth (NPO).

Intravenously administer isotonic crystalloid fluid.

Antibiotic prophylaxis, which is coverage for gram-negative and gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and anaerobes (Bacteroides fragilis and Escherichia coli), is recommended. However, its administration should be timed in consultation with the surgical service to ensure that high antibiotic levels coincide with the operative procedure.

Treat nonperforated appendicitis with cefoxitin or cefotetan.

In a perforated appendicitis consider the following choices:

- Carbapenem

- Ticarcillin-clavulanate

- Piperacillin-tazobactam

- Ampicillin-sulbactam

- Provide adequate analgesia

The primary treatment for appendicitis is surgery. Doctors should make operative decisions in consultation with the surgical service, and they should discuss the risks and benefits with patients or their families.

Increasingly laparoscopic surgery has replaced open surgery for appendicitis. The principal factor that determines whether an open or laparoscopic surgery should be performed is the preference or the expertise of the treating surgeon. Generally, the laparoscopic approach is preferred if the surgical expertise and equipment are available.  This technique has the following advantages.

- Less

- Quick recovery and shorter hospitalization

- Lower infection rate

In children, minimally invasive technique for Transumbilical Laparoscopic Assisted Appendicectomy has also been described. Laparoscopic-assisted single-port appendectomy (SPA), although has not yet evolved as the gold standard but has also been performed in children and found to be safe.
