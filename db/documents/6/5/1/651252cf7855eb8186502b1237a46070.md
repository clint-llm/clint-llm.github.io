The optic nerves, one from each eye, are the sole nervous tissue transporting visual information from the retinal ganglion cells in the retina to the optic chiasm and ultimately to higher visual processing centers in the brain. Roughly 2.4 million optic nerve fibers pass through the optic chiasm. In general, temporal retinal fibers occupy the lateral portions of the optic chiasm, around 35% to 45% of the total area, and project to the LGN uncrossed. Although the exact topographical mapping of these fibers remains a topic of debate, the widely accepted view is that the remaining area is composed of decussating nasal optic nerve fibers.
