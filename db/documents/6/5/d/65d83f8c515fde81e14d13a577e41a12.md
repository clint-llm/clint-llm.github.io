Hemorrhoids are cushions of submucosal tissue that are located within the anal canal. These structures cushion the anal canal and also support the anal canal lining. They are thought to aid in the complete closure of the anal canal at rest and to function as part of the body’s innate continence mechanism.

External hemorrhoids are covered by squamous epithelium and innervated by cutaneous nerves which are branches of the pudendal nerve. External hemorrhoids can occur circumferentially under the anoderm and can occur in any location. Finally, external hemorrhoids are drained via the inferior rectal vein into the inferior vena cava.

Increased intra-abdominal pressure, such as that associated with straining, passing hard stools, or childbirth yields venous engorgement of the hemorrhoid plexus. Bleeding, thrombosis and prolapse can follow.

External hemorrhoids cause symptoms in the following ways:

- Acute thrombosis which may be linked to a change in diet, straining with severe constipation and physical activity.

- Pain can also result from sudden distension of the overlying skin by the blood clot. This pain may last 5-12 days and with a resolution of the swelling, a skin tag is visible.
