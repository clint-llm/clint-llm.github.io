All prostanoids share a common biosynthetic pathway. Phospholipase A releases arachidonic acid from the phospholipid membrane, after which cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes and their bound synthase enzymes process the substrate into the various prostanoids. The prostanoid produced depends on metabolism by COX-1 or COX-2, which differentially express in tissues, and the respective synthase enzymes they bind.

Specifically, prostaglandin H2 is a substrate produced by both COX-1 and COX-2, but different attached synthase enzymes subsequently process it into the various prostanoids. COX-2 preferentially binds prostaglandin I synthase (PGIS) and some prostaglandin E synthase, while COX-1 binds thromboxane synthase, prostaglandin F synthase, and also prostaglandin E synthase. COX-2 is also controlled by inducible expression, while COX-1 is constitutive.

Prostaglandin I2 is synthesized via COX-2 and PGIS from membrane phospholipids upon pro-inflammatory stimulation via cytokines, growth factors, or other physical and chemical exogenous stimuli.
