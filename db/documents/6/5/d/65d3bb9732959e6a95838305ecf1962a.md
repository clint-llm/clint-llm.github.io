- As is standard with aesthetic procedures, preoperative photographs are imperative for surgical planning as well as to relieve any patient-perceived dissatisfaction with their results.

- The patient should be marked in the preoperative area to identify areas of excess adipose tissue that will be targeted during the procedure.

- Most essentially, all equipment should be confirmed to be in the room and to be functioning properly before the procedure begins.

- All concerns should be addressed during a standard surgical time out prior to the beginning of the procedure regardless of whether general anesthesia or local anesthesia only will be used.

- Wetting solution is then administered, allowing 15 to 30 minutes to pass for maximal vasoconstriction and anesthesia.

- The patient is prepared and draped in the usual sterile fashion.

- Furthermore, in large volume liposuction cases, it should be communicated how the patient will need to be positioned throughout the various stages of the surgery (e.g., supine, prone, lateral decubitus).

- Many surgeons place the patient in a subtle jack-knife position when performing liposuction of the trunk area to avoid traumatic perforations.
