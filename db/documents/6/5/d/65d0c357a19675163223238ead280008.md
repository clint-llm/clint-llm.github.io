There are many upper motor neuron (UMN) lesions that mimic the entity, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy, cervical spondylotic myelopathy, ossified posterior longitudinal ligament, and toxic neuropathy.

- **Myotonic dystrophy**:****An autosomal dominant genetic disorder, commonly seen in middle-aged men and traditionally identified with a tonic contraction of muscles in the upper limbs. It is associated with systemic changes, including cataracts, pulmonary dysfunction, endocrine pathology, infertility, and cardiac conduction changes. It is distinguished from Hirayama by systemic involvement and muscle biopsy characteristics.

- **Tephromalacie Anterieure**:****Anterior horn infarction demonstrated with muscle wasting of the distal upper limbs, caused by an occlusion of spinal arteries, commonly seen in middle-aged adults, and associated with arteriosclerosis. It presents bilaterally.

- **Syringomyelia**: Chronic central degeneration associated with motor and sensory changes seen in bilateral upper limbs, commonly seen after injury in geriatric populations without any gender preponderance. Structural changes can be observed in radiographic imaging.

- **Pronator syndrome**:Â Commonly presents unilaterally and is associated with a chronic injury. Symptoms increase with specific activities. The associated pain is an important hallmark of the condition
