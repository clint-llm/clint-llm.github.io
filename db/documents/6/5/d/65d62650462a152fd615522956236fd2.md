Esophagitis refers to inflammation or injury to the esophageal mucosa. One of the most common causes is gastroesophageal reflux, which can lead to erosive esophagitis. Other etiologies include radiation, infections, local injury caused by medications, pill esophagitis, and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). The most common symptoms in patients with esophagitis are chest pain, odynophagia, and dysphagia. Patients with EoE may present with food impaction. If the esophagitis is severe and leads to strictures, fistulization, and perforation, patients may present with symptoms related to those entities.

**Objectives:**
- Contrast the typical history and physical exam findings in eosinophilic esophagitis, erosive esophagitis, infective esophagitis, and pill esophagitis. 
- Describe the presentation of patients with potential complications of esophagitis such as food impaction, strictures, fistulas, and perforation. 
- Review the etiology-specific management of esophagitis. 
- Outline the importance of enhancing care coordination among the interprofessional team to ensure proper evaluation and management of esophagitis.
