The underlying pathophysiology of exogenous lipoid pneumonia is due to a prolonged foreign body reaction to fat. The offending agent reaches the lungs by inhalation or aspiration of substances that do not induce the cough reflex. Fat is taken up by macrophages in the alveoli and cannot metabolize the substance; therefore, the alveoli are repeatedly exposed to the agent after the death of the macrophage leading to a granulomatous reaction.
