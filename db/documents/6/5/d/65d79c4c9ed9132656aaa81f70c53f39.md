The management of any patient with craniosynostosis is complex and requires a team of subspecialists including pediatricians, oral maxillofacial surgeons, plastic surgeons, neurosurgeons, otorhinolaryngology (ENT) specialists, and ophthalmologists (pediatric and oculoplastics).  Other specialists may be required depending on the specific issues at hand. Surgical management is the treatment modality of choice to correct the maldevelopment of the midface and orbits to prevent blindness and intellectual disability related to the restriction of the brain and orbital development. A detailed review of surgical techniques including the timing of repair can be seen in a recent review of the topic.

It requires long-term followup to monitor ocular development due to the propensity to develop strabismic amblyopia and the need for strabismus surgery. These examinations should also monitor for optic nerve edema that would raise concerns for elevated intracranial pressure. Due to airway changes, sleep apnea is also of concern. The previously mentioned team-based approach helps monitor for these vision and life-threatening complications.

There is some ongoing work investigating the role of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in mutated FGFR-related craniosynostosis conditions.
