Surgical extraction of unerupted or impacted teeth is a common dentoalveolar procedure done by various dental specialties. Like most other surgical procedures, the extraction of unerupted teeth is irreversible. Therefore, a surgeon must have proper knowledge of anatomy and pathophysiology and the appropriate skills to extract teeth.

The surgeon must also be prepared to manage possible complications. Before surgery, a surgeon must evaluate a patient thoroughly and develop an appropriate surgical plan based on a patient's specific therapeutic goals. A surgeon must be able to provide risks, benefits, and alternatives to proposed surgical plans to help patients to make an informed decision.
