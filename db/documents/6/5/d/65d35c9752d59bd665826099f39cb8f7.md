The degree of tricuspid leaflet failure of delamination can vary from mild to absent delamination. The surgical pathology of patients who underwent tricuspid valve replacement has shown that tricuspid leaflets in Ebstein anomaly are usually large, irregularly shaped, thin, transparent, and have abnormal insertion points secondary to short chordal attachments, or have direct myocardial insertion. The septal leaflet can often have a fibrous ridge, and leaflets can have muscularized portions as well.

There is also an atypical Ebstein anomaly whereby the displacement of the septal and posterior leaflets is less than 8 mm/m^2; the anterior leaflet is typically normal, and there is less severe tricuspid annular dilation, no abnormalities of the subvalvular apparatus, and no "atrialization" of the right ventricle.

Surgical pathological studies of mitral valves in patients with Ebstein anomaly have shown primary mitral valve defects in some patients involving the mitral orifice, leaflets, papillary muscles, and cords. About half of the mitral abnormalities were noted to have functional significance.
