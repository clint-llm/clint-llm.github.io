Management of dental infections depends on whether it is a local infection or a severe infection of the fascial spaces, which is rare.

If possible, removal of the source of infection is the most important step in treating dental infections

Dental caries management depends on the extent of dental caries and can range from the insertion of a restorative material, endodontic treatment, to tooth extraction.

Reversible pulpitis treatment with pulp protection and restorative materials is usually sufficient. Irreversible pulpitis treatment involves a root canal and direct or indirect restorations according to the degree of tooth remanent. There is insufficient evidence to recommend antibiotics

Antibiotic therapy for dental infections is necessary for systemic symptoms, fascial space infections, and infections that spread to the bony cortex and surrounding soft tissue

Severe infections or patients who are immunocompromised should get anti-pseudomonal antibiotics. Piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, cefepime, imipenem-cilastatin, or metronidazole with ciprofloxacin can be therapeutic options.
