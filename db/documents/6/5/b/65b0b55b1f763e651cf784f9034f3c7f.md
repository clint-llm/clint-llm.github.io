The primary care provider, nurse practitioner, and internist will often encounter patients with a headache. However, when they encounter a patient with an intense headache and ophthalmoplegia, a referral to a neurologist is necessary. Unlike the typical headache, patients with the Tolosa Hunt syndrome are managed with steroids and immunosuppressive agents. Despite treatment, recurrences are common and the overally quality of life is poor. When patients are managed with steroids, the nurse practitioner and primary care giver should monitor the patient for adverse effects. An interprofessional approach to the care of this disease will provide the best patient outcome. [Level V]
