Neonatal EEG recording can be challenging for inexperienced EEG technician and also the untrained electroencephalographer because of its unique features, limitations and technical data.

The neonatal team including the nurses, respiratory technologists, infusion specialists, radiographers, and neonatologists should work together to achieve a near optimal recording. However, this communication is often not perfect. The information about the age and gestational age should be conveyed to the EEG reader, to decide on the maturity of EEG.

The technologist should be able to adapt to the restrictive environment in protecting the newborn from infections and injury. Nurses should communicate with the technologist about the contraindications and any specific infant related information to the technologist to help decide on the adoption of changes in protocol or lead placements.
