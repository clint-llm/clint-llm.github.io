New devices have advanced in the application of topical oxygen therapy to accelerate wound healing, especially in patients with diabetic foot ulcers.

Topical oxygen therapy can be administered and monitored by nurses, clinicians, and other providers, including the patient. It is important to understand the different types of topical oxygen available to best suit the patient. Knowing when to apply the device and understanding the importance of an optimal wound bed will improve the oxygen delivery to the tissues. An interprofessional team that provides an integrated approach to patient care can help achieve the best possible outcomes.
