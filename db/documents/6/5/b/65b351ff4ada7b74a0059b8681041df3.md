PresbycusisÂ is the most common cause of hearing loss worldwide and is estimated to affect approximately two-thirds of Americans aged 70 or older.

Worldwide, there are similar increases in prevalence with age. Presbycusis affects more than half of older adults by age 75 and nearly all adults over age 90.****The World Health Organization estimates that by 2025, among those aged 60 and above, greater than 500 million will have significant age-related hearing loss.
