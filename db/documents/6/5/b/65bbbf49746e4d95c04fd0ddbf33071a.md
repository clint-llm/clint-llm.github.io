The overall prognosis of OSSN with perfect margin clearance is usually good and has a very less recurrence rate. Incompletely excised tumor margins, old age, deeper tissue penetration, corneal OSSN, and large tumors (greater than 2 mm) are factors that are usually responsible for recurrence, and the prognosis is guarded in these cases. Recent medical and surgical treatment modalities have proven to be effective. The reported local recurrence rate is 5%, and lymph node metastasis is less than 2%. The invasive and mucoepidermoid carcinoma have a worse prognosis.
