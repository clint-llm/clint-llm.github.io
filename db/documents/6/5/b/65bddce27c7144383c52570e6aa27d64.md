The most common indications for gastric resection include:

- Malignancy - adenocarcinoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), neuroendocrine neoplasms, signet ring cell gastric cancer, and hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (CDH1 mutation carriers)

- Peptic ulcer disease - refractory gastric ulcer disease and associated sequelae including bleeding, perforation, or stricture

- Bariatric procedures - Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, or gastric banding

Subtotal distal gastrectomy is considered the gold standard for tumors of the gastric body or antrum in which a 4-6 cm proximal margin can be obtained while maintaining an adequately sized remnant pouch.
