The most common virus associated with bronchiolitis is the Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). However, over the years, many other viruses have been found to cause the same infection, and they includeÂ  the following:

- 
Human rhinovirus

- 
Coronavirus

- 
Human metapneumovirus

- 
Adenovirus

RSV accounts for the majority of cases, although in about 30% of infants, there may be two viruses present at the same time.
