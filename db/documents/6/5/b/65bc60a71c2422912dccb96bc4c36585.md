Allergic rhinitis is an immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated response against inhaled allergens that cause inflammation driven by type 2 helper (Th2) cells. There is a considerable genetic component to the allergic reaction, classified into early and late phase reactions.

In long-standing AR, due to eosinophilic infiltration and nasal mucosa obliteration, a non-IgE mediated hyperresponsiveness develops. The nasal mucosa now becomes hyperreactive to normal stimuli (such as tobacco smoke, cold air) and causes symptoms of sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal pruritis.

There are data to suggest there may be a genetic component to the development of allergic rhinitis, but studies are generally lacking. Monozygotic twins show 45% to 60% concordance, and dizygotic twins have a concordance rate of approximately 25% in the development of AR. Specific regions on chromosomes 3 and 4 also correlate with allergic responses.
