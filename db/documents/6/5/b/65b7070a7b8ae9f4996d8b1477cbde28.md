Most patients won't know they have a thyroid adenoma until they undergo a complete and thorough physical examination. In some cases, they might present with a complaint of visible and palpable neck growth. The patients rarely complain of dyspnea due to tracheal compression, hoarseness due to laryngeal nerve irritation or dysphagia due to esophagus compression. Most of the time, the patients are clinically euthyroid without any symptoms suggesting hyperactive or hypoactive thyroid function. However, about 1% of the patients with thyroid adenomas can be hyperthyroid, and in that case, they might have a constellation of symptoms including, but not limited to, weight loss, increased anxiety, heart palpitations, excessive sweating, changes in the bowel habits as well as changes in the hair or the skin and menstrual irregularities in women of reproductive age.
