Disposition from acute care settings are dependent on the extent of infection, comorbidities, and access to prompt ophthalmological follow up. Uncomplicated cases can be discharged with appropriate treatment, and adequate follow up. Complicated cases, particularly those with fever or acute visual changes, should be admitted with ophthalmology consultation. Complications of dacryocystitis can be devastating. These can include orbital cellulitis, the formation of lacrimal fistulas, meningitis, brain abscess formation, cavernous sinus thrombosis, severe sinusitis, permanent loss of vision, and even death.
