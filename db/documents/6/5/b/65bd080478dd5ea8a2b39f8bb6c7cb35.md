The use of methamphetamine can cause physical and psychological dependence and increased tolerance. Because of the rapid development of tolerance, methamphetamine users frequently need to increase the dose to get to the satisfying "high," which can be very dangerous because the administration of too much methamphetamine also increases the risk of an overdose.

- Acute: When methamphetamine users experience an adverse reaction due to using a large amount of methamphetamine one time, it can be fatal.
