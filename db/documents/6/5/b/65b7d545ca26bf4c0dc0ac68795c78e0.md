ConditionsÂ for which a goniometer ought not to be used to measure active range of motion include the following:

- Joint dislocation

- Unhealed fracture

- Post-surgery if movement disrupts the healing process

- Regions of osteoporosis or bone fragility, as forced measurements may cause iatrogenic injury

- Immediately following an injury where disruption of soft tissue is likely

Conditions where goniometer use is appropriate with added precautions

- Infection or inflammation around a joint

- Severe pain aggravated by movement

- Hypermobility or instability
