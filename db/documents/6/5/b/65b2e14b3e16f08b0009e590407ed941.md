Mycobacterium species include a variety of organisms with different genomic structures, morphology, and tropism.M. tuberculosis is a gram-negative bacteria. It is a small, aerobic, and nonmotile bacillus. It is characterized by a complex wall structure that is rich in long-chain fatty acids. The genus is divided into two groups: fast-growing and slow-growing organisms. M. tuberculosis belongs to the slow-growing group.M. tuberculosis cell wall is rich in peptidoglycan and complex lipids. These structures are major factors for pathogenesis.

M. tuberculosis is a facultative intracellular bacterium. It acts as an inhibitor of macrophages, proliferates within the macrophages, causing the eventual death of invaded macrophages and the release of the bacillus to the alveolar space.Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a very slow-growing organism, taking up to 24 hours to grow.
