Allodynia is defined as "pain due to a stimulus that does not normally provoke pain." An example would be a light feather touch (that should only produce sensation), causing pain. Allodynia is different from hyperalgesia, which is an exaggerated response from a usually painful stimulus, although both can and often do co-exist. Both are types of neuropathic pain. This activity describes the etiology, epidemiology, and management of allodynia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the definition and etiology of allodynia.
- Summarize the difference between allodynia and hyperalgesia.
- Review the role of interprofessional team members in managing allodynia.
- Explain the role of interprofessional teams in providing patient education about allodynia in order to achieve better clinical outcomes.
