Syringomyelia is difficult to treat.

A promising therapy is being recently investigated in which autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells are injected in the syrinx of posttraumatic syringomyelia.

Serial neurologic examinations are critical for following patients with known syringomyelia. Handheld dynamometry of key muscle groups can provide a useful objective adjunct to manual muscle testing. The patient's report of changes in function, such as ambulation, wheelchair propulsion, or transfers, can be the most important factor to determine the progression of the condition. Patients with cervical syringomyelia need monitoring of pulmonary function to assess for worsening of vital capacity. Interdisciplinary evaluations by rehabilitation teams can assess the need for changes in mobility devices, seating/walking activity, and activities of daily living. The team will help to mitigate increasing risks of complications such as pressure ulcers, a decline in mobility, and falls.
