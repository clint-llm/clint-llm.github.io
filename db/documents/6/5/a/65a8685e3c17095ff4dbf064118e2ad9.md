General and supportive measures include oxygen supplements in hypoxemic patients to prevent worsening PH from hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Diuretics should be used to optimize volume status. There is no proposed recommendation for anticoagulation in PVOD patients.

The standard pulmonary vasodilators will not help with the disease and traditionally have been thought to increase the risk of pulmonary edema. The development of pulmonary edema in these patients with the initiation of therapy is due to the early rise in arterial vasodilation and slower rise in venodilation. This leads to increased hydrostatic pressures in the pulmonary capillary bed, resulting in fluid translocation to the alveolar space.

However, recent case reports have noted the possible safety of pulmonary vasodilators in these patients. In a systematic review published in 2019, Ogawa et al. identified 20 case reports of patients with PVOD, which demonstrated the potential efficacy of pulmonary vasodilators in these patients, but with marked difficulties and risks of complications.

If vasodilator therapy is considered, it is recommended to start with a single agent at lower doses with close monitoring and the availability of high-dose diuretic therapy. It can be administered as a palliative measure to decrease the rate of decline in patients who will not be transplant candidates or as a bridge to transplant itself.

There were some reports of the benefit of immunosuppressive agents in patients with idiopathic and heritable PVOD and patients with connective tissue disease-associated PVOD.

A lung transplant is the only curative option. If suspected, these patients should be referred for lung transplant evaluation early in the course of the disease, as lung transplantation is the only therapy shown to increase life expectancy in patients with PVOD.
