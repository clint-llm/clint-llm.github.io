The abducens nerve has the longest intracranial course of any cranial nerve. It is primarily responsible for ipsilateral eye abduction. Abducens nerve palsy results in an inability of the abducens nerve to transmit signals to the lateral rectus, resulting in anÂ inability to abduct the eye and horizontal diplopia.
