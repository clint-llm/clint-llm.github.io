- Clean the area to remove oils from the skin

- Position the patient comfortably.

- Use eye protection for both the operator and the patient.

- Avoid reflecting surfaces or metallic objects near the laser.

- Individualize the parameters to each patient's skin and hair type and the type of laser being used.

- Place the handpiece perpendicular to the skin. Ensure that it is pressed down gently but firmly to bring the follicles close to the surface and temporarily decrease the blood supply to the treatment area.

- Perifollicular edema and erythema is an expected side effect, and this must be explained to the patient prior to the procedure.

**Post-Procedure Care**

- Although most machines have inbuilt cooling systems, ice packs or cooling agents may be used post-procedure to minimize pain and swelling.

- In case of inadvertent epidermal injury, topical antibiotics may be used.

- Strict sun protection and the use of sunscreens is a must.

- Topical steroid creams may be prescribed to minimize erythema and swelling.

The hair matrix is only sensitive to laser treatment during the anagen phase of the hair growth cycle; therefore multiple treatments will be necessary in order to address all hair follicles when they are most sensitive to treatment. In the initial phase of hair removal therapy, 4 to 6 sessions spaced 4 to 6 weeks apart are the minimum required to achieve adequate results.Â Subsequently, patients may need maintenance treatments once every 6 to 12 months as small vellus hair may grow back.

Various factors may affect the outcome, such as:

- Hair location (axillary and pubic hair respond better than hair on the extremities and chest)

- Skin and hair color (light skin of Fitzpatrick skin types I-IV with dark hair achieve the best results due to the lack of melanin in the skin and the abundance of melanin to absorb laser energy in the hair follicles)

- Hair growth stage (anagen hair being most sensitive)

- Laser type

- Hormonal status

- Treatment plan
