Histopathologic findings consistent with AGEP include non-follicular spongiform pustules within the epidermis, particularly within and below the stratum corneum (causing a subcorneal dermatosis), edema of the papillary dermis with neutrophilic and eosinophilic perivascular infiltrates.

Specifically, when differentiating between pustular psoriasis and AGEP, AGEP has necrotic keratinocytes, spongiosis of the epidermis, mixed neutrophilic and eosinophilic infiltrates, and lacks the dilated blood vessels within the dermal papillae that are classically described in psoriasis.

Although not typically performed in the analysis of skin biopsies, gene expression profiling of AGEP skin shows increased IL36G expression compared to healthy skin, and immunohistochemical analysis shows a strong presence of IL-36 alpha and IL-36 gamma in the pustules as well as the peri-pustular epidermis of AGEP biopsies.
