**Ultrasound**- Can be used to identify the parathyroid glands on the posterior thyroid. The parathyroids appear as small, oval masses on the posterior thyroid. They are comparatively homogenous and hypoechoic when compared to the thyroid, allowing for the identification of intra-thyroid parathyroid tissue. It is useful to screen for parathyroid adenomas. Normal parathyroid glands are approximately 5 mm in size and weigh 30 to 50 mg, while parathyroid adenomas are 1 to 2 cm in size, and weigh 500 to 1000 mg. Ultrasound has poor sensitivity for the identification of parathyroid hyperplasia.

**Technetium-99 (sestamibi) Scan**- Technetium-99 (99mTc) is a radiotracer used in nuclear medicine studies.

**4D CT Scan**- This is a specialized imaging technique with higher sensitivity/specificity for parathyroid adenomas than sestamibi scanning.
