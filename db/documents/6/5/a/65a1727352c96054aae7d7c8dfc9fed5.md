Metallic foreign bodies have a high atomic number and hence are readily visible on plain radiographs. The organic ones are those of vegetative origin like wood splinters or thorns. Inorganic materials are non-living beings like glass, plastic, or rubber. If an organic foreign body is suspected, it may be difficult to identify it on radiographs.  As a result, the clinician needs to be extra diligent in wound exploration and inform the patient to return immediately if any signs of infection or foreign body develop. The organic foreign bodies are identifiable using ultrasound pre or intraoperatively. If identified preoperatively, they can also be marked to aid in their removal, and this is particularly beneficial in chronic foreign bodies where a wound is no longer present. The inorganic materials can be visible on radiographs or ultrasound, but this is variable. Usually, the glass will be visible on a plain radiograph. For deeper foreign bodies when there is concern about their involvement with specific structures, computed tomography may be required for better visualization.

The ideal time for foreign body removal is the first 24 hours after an injury to allow better evaluation of the entry and exit sites of the wound and to minimize the inflammatory response and scar formation.
