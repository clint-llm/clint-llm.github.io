Five different arterial injuries can occur with either blunt or penetrating injuries.  The five different injuries include complete wall defect (hemorrhage or pseudoaneurysm), intimal injury (subintimal/intramural hematomas, flaps, disruptions), arteriovenous (AV) fistula, complete transection (with hemorrhage or occlusion), and spasm. Blunt traumas are most commonly associated with intimal defects, whereas, penetrating trauma correlates with defects of the wall, complete transection or AV fistulas.
