The prevalence of penile pearly papules is diversely appreciated and ranges from 14% to 48% of males. They are rarely observed in children and mainly seen in late adolescence and early adulthood. Their prevalence declines in older patients as the lesions involute with aging. Similar papules have never been described on female genitalia.

Many studies show that pearly penile papules are less common in circumcised males and is they are supposed to be secondary to chronic trauma undergone by uncovered corona which leads to the papule involution. However, Rehbein, in his study of 840 males, showed a higher prevalence among circumcised people. A recent study in young circumcised men showed a prevalence of 17.1%.

Although many studies have shown no race predilection to develop pearly penile papules, Rehbein reported them to be more prevalent in African American males.
