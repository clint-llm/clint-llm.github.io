The traditional macroscopic appearance of OG demonstrates a gelatinous gray mass, often with cystic areas and small focal hemorrhages, and there are often macroscopic calcifications.

The microscopic appearance typically demonstrates sheets of regular cells with spherical nuclei surrounded by clear cytoplasm and perinuclear halo, described as a “fried-egg” appearance. This appearance is due to routine processing with formalin and paraffin fixation. There is a network of thin blood vessels distributed throughout the tumor, described as a “chicken-wire” pattern in appearance. There are scattered calcifications and psammoma bodies within the tumor. Myelin-like structures can also be seen on the surface but do not meet all the qualifications for a myelin sheath.

Histologically, OGs can show markers seen in oligodendrocyte and astrocyte cell lineages. For example, OGs lack myelin basic protein (MBP), which is found in myelin-producing oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells. They can stain positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of astrocytes.
