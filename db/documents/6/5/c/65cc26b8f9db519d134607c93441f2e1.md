With a wide range of etiologies for bilirubinuria, an entire interprofessional team must work hand in hand to ensure the best outcomes for the patient. Health care workers such as clinicians, nurse practitioners will be involved in finding the etiology and applying the appropriate management. Nurses will observe and educate patients about disease severity and compliance with treatments. Pharmacists will report back to the medical team with the best medication options, medication dose, and duration of treatment as well as side effects, keeping in mind the medication interactions. Case managers and social workers will help patients with substance addiction to join the services needed and become better. An interprofessional team approach will always be the optimal approach to yield the best possible outcomes. [Level 5]
