Over the years, tattoos have become increasingly popular. According to a 2016 Harris Poll, 3 in 10 adults in the United States have at least one tattoo, compared to 2 in 10 adults in 2012. These tattoos have also become more elaborate, including a multitude of colors and dyes. Â As a general rule, the more advanced and colorful the tattoo, the more difficult will be its removal. Amateur tattoos tend to be located more superficially in the papillary dermis and easier to remove with a laser, whereas professional tattoos are located in the deep reticular dermis.
