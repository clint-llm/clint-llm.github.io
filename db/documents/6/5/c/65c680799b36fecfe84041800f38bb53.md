The prevalence of Buerger disease has diminished over the past 5 years because of decreased smoking and adherence to more stringent diagnostic criteria. The highest incidence occurs in Israeli Jews of Ashkenazi descent and natives of Indian, Korean, and Japanese ancestry.

**United States Statistics**

In 1947, in the United States, there were 104 cases per 100,000 population. Over time, the prevalence has reduced to approximately 12.6-20 cases per 100,000 population.

**Age, Gender, and Race-related Distribution**

Most patients with Buerger disease are aged 20-45 years. It does not occur in the pediatric or elderly population. It is more common in men with a male-to-female ratio of 3:1; however, a rise in the cases among women is being observed, which could be attributable to the growing trend of smoking in women.
