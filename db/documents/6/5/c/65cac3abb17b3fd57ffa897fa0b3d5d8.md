DTIÂ is a specialized diagnostic imaging tool utilizing diffusion-weighted imaging of MRI. DTI has required and will continue to require many fields of expertise in advancing its utility in everyday patient care. Continued research on its growing capabilities will make more healthcare practitioners aware of its value and more radiologists comfortable with interpreting DTI. As radiologists see the value in DTI, more recommendations will be made to acquire DTI to aid with diagnoses and prognosis. As with any modality or imaging tool, discussion with referring physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners to increase awareness of this new option is helpful. For example, utilizing DTI for surgical planning would require surgeons knowing they can trust the findings made by radiologists with this diagnostic tool.
