One of the potential complications of endometrial carcinoma itself is anemia. Due to the excessive loss of blood from the uterus, symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and palpitations may arise. Each treatment modality has its complications, and there is a high risk of developing vaginal stenosis, vaginal atrophy, and bowel/bladder fistula post-irradiation. Surgical treatment may lead to bladder instability, sexual dysfunction, and lymphedema, while chemotherapy has its own side effects, but these are usually limited and easily treated with medication. When the tumor metastasizes to distant organs, it can cause symptoms of weight loss, shortness of breath, and bone pain.
