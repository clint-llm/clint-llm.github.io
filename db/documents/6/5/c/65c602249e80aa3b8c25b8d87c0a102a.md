"Jumper's knee," also called patellar tendinopathy, is a painful condition of the knee, mainly activity-related, caused by small tears in the patellar tendon that mainly occurs in sports requiring strenuous jumping and results in localized patellar tendon tenderness. The tears are typically caused by accumulated stress on the patellar or quadriceps tendon. As the name implies, the condition is common in athletes from jumping sports, where there is a high demand for the speed and power of leg extensors.

The condition has a male predominance, with a more common occurrence in adolescents and young adults. Contrary to traditional belief, a jumper's knee does not involve inflammation of the knee extensor tendons. Studies dating back 40 years describe jumper's knee as a degenerative condition. Jumper's knee is a clinical diagnosis through detailed history taking and a physical exam. Ultrasound can facilitate the diagnosis, as this imaging study is readily available and affordable. Treatment mainly revolves around conservative measures such as reducing activities that place a loading impact on the knee. Once the pain subsides, restoration of function is achieved through physical and exercise therapy.Â Surgery usually remains the last resort for chronic refractory cases.
