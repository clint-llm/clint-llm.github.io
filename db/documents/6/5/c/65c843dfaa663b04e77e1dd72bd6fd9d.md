ERAS pathways have immense clinical significance, both to the patient and the healthcare system as a whole. Meta-analysis has shown that ERAS protocols have decreased the average hospital length of stay by 2.3 days.

The ERAS system has revolutionized the perioperative period by allowing for an earlier return of organ function, reducing the duration of postoperative ileus, and preventing pulmonary complications, thereby improving patient quality of life in the immediate period.
