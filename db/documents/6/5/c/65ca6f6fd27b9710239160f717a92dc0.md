This paper has already listed the FIGO etiology classification for AUB. The PALM-COEIN classification system list nine different differentials for the provider to consider. This section will cover some additional diagnoses that are important differentials in the emergency department. The uterus is the only organ for which bleeding represents a normal physiologic process, and might mask other etiologies of anemia, especially in peri-menopausal women. The normal menstrual cycle, on average, lasts 4-9 days with a blood loss of less than 80 mL. Molimina symptoms like cramping, mood swings, breast tenderness, and fluid retention precede menstruation. Pregnancy or ectopic pregnancy can often present with vaginal bleeding. All women within the reproductive years should have a pregnancy test as part of their initial workup.
