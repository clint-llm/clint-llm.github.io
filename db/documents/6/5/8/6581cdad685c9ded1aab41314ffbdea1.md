The diagnosis of DT must be reviewed by an expert soft-tissue pathologist. Histologically, DT is characterized by the proliferation of uniform spindle cells resembling myofibroblasts,Â in the background of abundant collagenous stroma and vascular network.

On immunohistochemistry, DT stains positive for nuclear beta-catenin, vimentin, cyclooxygenase-2, tyrosine kinase PDGFRb, androgen receptor, and estrogen receptor beta. DT stains negative for desmin, S-100, h-caldesmon, CD34, and c-KIT.
