Macroscopic Findings:

Macroscopic examination often reveals abundant gelatinous pelvic or abdominal mucin or mucinous ascites accompanied by cystic epithelial implants on peritoneal surfaces. These lesions vary in size from a few mm to a few centimeters. A large ‘omental cake’ is also frequently found.

Histopathology:

Multiple histological grading systems have been proposed for pseudomyxoma peritonei. Ronnett et al. first divided pseudomyxoma peritonei into two groups: disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis (DPAM) and peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis (PMCA).

- Acellular mucin: Mucin within the peritoneal cavity without neoplastic epithelial cells.

- Low-grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei (synonymous with DPAM) presents as mucin pools with low cellularity (less than 10%), bland cytology and non-stratified cuboidal epithelium. Tumor cells are arranged in strips or gland-like structures. Infiltrative growth is not present.

- High-grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei (synonymous with PMCA): Mucin pools with high cellularity, moderate/severe cytological atypia, numerous mitoses, and cribriform growth pattern. Destructive infiltrative invasion of underlying organs is often present.

- High-grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei with signet ring cells: Any lesion with a component of signet ring cells, classified separately because of their worse prognosis.

Immunohistochemistry:

Researchers have suggested MUC 2 over-expression as a molecular marker for PMP of intestinal origin.
