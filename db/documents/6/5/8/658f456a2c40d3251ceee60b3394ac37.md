Together, the respiratory and circulatory systems play a remarkable role in the regulation of CO2. While the respiratory system is responsible for gas exchange, the circulatory system is responsible for transporting blood and its components to and from the tissues. Gas exchange occurs in the lungs and tissues. During inspiration, air travels into the alveoli, the primary site of gas exchange in the lungs. At the alveolar-capillary interface, O2 freely diffuses into blood and CO2 diffuses from the blood into the alveolar spaces. In contrast, gas exchange at the tissues results in diffusion of CO2 produced by respiration from the tissues into the blood, while O2 is offloaded from hemoglobin in red blood cells to replenish tissue oxygen stores.

In the long term, respiratory acidosis is compensated by bicarbonate retention in the kidneys, which increases pH towards normal values.
