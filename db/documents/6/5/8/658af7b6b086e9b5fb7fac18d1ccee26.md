Quinidine is well known for its toxicity, causing QT prolongation and, in severe cases, a pleomorphic arrhythmia, a.k.a. "Torsades de pointes." This condition can be fatal, and the management of the situation includes discontinuation of the drug, institution of cardiac and electrolyte (potassium and magnesium) monitoring, management of hypoxia. Clinicians can promptly manage torsades de pointes by giving magnesium sulfate and terminating prolonged episodes by electrical cardioversion; in refractory cases, isoproterenol or transvenous pacing is an option.
