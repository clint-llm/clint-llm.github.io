The presence of gas and free air in the extraluminal space of the intestines is known as pneumatosis intestinalis (PI). The presence of air in any portion of the gastrointestinal tract, from the mucosa to the mesenteric vessels via diffuse collection, cysts, or bubbles, is an abnormal occurrence, correlating with underlying pathology. However, gas in the actual intestines is normal and usually relieved with flatulence.

In other medical literature, pneumatosis intestinalis is also referred to as pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis, intraluminal bowel gas, and pneumatosis coli, depending on where and how free air accumulates in the extraluminal space of the digestive tract. Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis is a collection of individual gas cysts in the submucosa and subserosa of the intestine that can increase in quantity and size if left untreated. The occurrence was first documented in 1730 by DuVernoi during cadaver dissection. It was first diagnosed radiographically in 1946 by Lerner and Gazin, but the clinical pathology and etiology were unknown. Since then, the incidence of pneumatosis intestinalis has increased due to advancements in radiology.
