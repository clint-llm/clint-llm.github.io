The most common complications of medial medullary syndrome are deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Patients may develop severe dysphagia, especially patients with bilateral medial medullary syndrome. Patients can develop aspiration pneumonia. If immediate management is not initiated, then the condition can be fatal. Pulmonary embolism can present with sudden onset dyspnea, which can lead to death. Patients with hemiplegia may develop bedsores. Bedsores can be further complicated by infections and may progress to septicemia and death.
