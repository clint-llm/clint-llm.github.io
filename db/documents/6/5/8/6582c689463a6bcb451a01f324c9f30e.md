Complications after humeral shaft fracture include the following:

- Non-union

- Angulation

- Limited range of motion

- Infection

- Nerve injury

Radial nerve injury occurs in close to 20% of patients with humeral shaft fractures. The majority of these nerve injuries are neurapraxic or axonotmetic and resolve within 6 months. Brachial artery injuries are rare but can occur. Rates of nonunion are increased in patients with advanced age, obesity, diabetes, poor nutrition, and prior radiation exposure
