Patients with discogenic pain will typically report pain in the midline or the immediate paraspinal region with occasional radiation to the flanks or buttocks. Typically, the pain is worsened with axial loading, sitting, or lumbar flexion and relieved with lumbar extension or lying supine. It is also not uncommon for patients to experience associated stiffness. Given the broad differential diagnosis for non-radicular, axial low back pain, and similarity in clinical features, physical exam maneuvers are relatively poor in accurately diagnosing discogenic pain. Therefore, there are no specific physical tests for diagnosis.
