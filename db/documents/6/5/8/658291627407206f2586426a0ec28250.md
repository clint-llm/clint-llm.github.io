Because there is no clear transition between the primary sleep states and stages, there are multiple time periods in a single duration of sleep in which a person can be in a combination of both wakefulness and sleep. Herein lies the most accepted theory of parasomnia etiology.

Furthermore, there are theories that there is a genetic component however this has never been proven and remains antidotal. The exact etiology is unknown however there are strong correlations with fever and illness, excessive physical activity, excessive caffeine or alcohol intake, lack of sleep and exhaustion, and emotional stress.
