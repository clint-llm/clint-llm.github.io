Laryngeal pathology can be related to trauma, infection, malignancy, or, in children, congenital malformation of laryngeal structures.

Four methods have been devised to secure the airway and deliver oxygen to patients undergoing laryngeal surgery: mechanical ventilation, spontaneous ventilation, subglottic jet ventilation, and intermittent apneic anesthesia. Complications can arise from each ventilation strategy. Interdisciplinary planning and communication are key so that necessary adaptations can occur intraoperatively.
