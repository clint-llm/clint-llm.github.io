The first reported case of emphysematous cholecystitis was by Stoltz in 1901. About 1% to 3% of patients with acute cholecystitis can develop this variant. This fulminant form of cholecystitis has been reported to be more common in older patients who also have diabetes mellitus. The prevalence of emphysematous cholecystitis is three times higher in males compared to females. There is also an association with peripheral vascular disease and immunosuppression. The mortality due to this life-threatening form of cholecystitis is reported to be around 15% to 25%.

Diabetes is noted to be present in 30% to 75% of patients with this disorder. The mean age of diagnosis is around 60.

Micro-organisms that have been isolated in patients with emphysematous cholecystitis include the following:

- Clostridia

- Klebsiella

- Escherichia coli

- Enterococci

- Anaerobic streptococci
