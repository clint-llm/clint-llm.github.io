The clinical evaluation of sleep is performed using a polysomnogram, a procedure that utilizes an electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram, electromyogram, electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, airflow, and respiratory effort. These tests are performed overnight and usually require a minimum of 6 hours of monitoring. Specifically, an EEG records brain wave patterns via small electrodes placed on the scalp. A polysomnogram is the gold standard test for diagnosing sleep-related breathing disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea, and sleep-related hypoventilation/hypoxia. A polysomnogram may also be used to evaluate nocturnal seizures, periodic limb movement disorder, narcolepsy, and REM sleep behavior disorder.
