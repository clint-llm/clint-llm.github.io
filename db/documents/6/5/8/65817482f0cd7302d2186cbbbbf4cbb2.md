Determining the readiness of a new clinical space before a full-scale operation is essential. In-situ simulation is rapidly becoming the standard means for testing system-, environment-, process-, and team-related workflows and even identifying latent safety threats.

Skilled, experienced simulation teams must work closely with an interprofessional group to develop, implement, and evaluate high-fidelity in-situ simulation programs to assess critical processes and new clinical environments.
