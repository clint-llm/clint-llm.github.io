The diagnosis and management of type 2 diabetes mellitus are with an interprofessional team. These patients need an appropriate referral to the ophthalmologist, nephrologist, cardiologist, and vascular surgeon. Also, patients need to be educated about lifestyle changes that can help lower blood glucose. All obese patients should be encouraged to lose weight, exercise, and eat a healthy diet. The primary care provider and the diabetic nurse must encourage all people with diabetes to stop smoking and abstain from drinking alcohol. The complications of diabetes mellitus are limb and life-threateningÂ and seriously diminish the quality of life.
