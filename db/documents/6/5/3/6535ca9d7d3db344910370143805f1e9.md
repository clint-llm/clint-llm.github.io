Reentrant arrhythmias are a diverse group of cardiac conduction defects that can manifest in a wide range of presentations. The common reentrant arrhythmias include atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia, other pathway-mediated tachycardia, and ventricular tachycardia. In atrial fibrillation, multiple reentry circuits are found in the left atrium and pulmonary veins, while typical atrial flutter is characterized by a macro reentry circuit in the right atrium. Atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) is the most common reentrant supraventricular tachycardia and utilizes the atrioventricular (AV) node as its reentry circuit. Proper patient assessment and diagnosis are crucial in the management of this condition. This condition has low mortality but, if managed incorrectly, can result in sudden cardiac death. This activity describes the treatment, management, and diagnosis of patients with reentrant arrhythmias and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the stepwise approach for the evaluation of reentrant arrhythmias.
- Summarize treatment modalities available for a patient with a reentrant arrhythmia.
- Review the pathophysiology of various reentrant arrhythmias.
- Describe how the coordination of an interprofessional team can lead to a more rapid diagnosis of reentrant arrhythmias and subsequently decrease associated morbidity and mortality in affected patients.
