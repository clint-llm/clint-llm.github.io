Caroli disease is a rare genetic disorder that is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a geneticist, gastroenterologist, liver specialist, urologist, nephrologist, radiologist, and transplant surgeon.Â The mainstay of therapy is supportive and individualized according to the presentation. The key feature of the disease is recurrent cholangitis and hence patients need a drainage procedure.

Since there are multiple cysts, the patient may develop recurrent episodes of cholangitis, and lobectomy or liver transplant may be required in that case.

Chronic cases are usually managed medically. The aim is to prevent recurrent ascites and variceal bleeding. The primary care provider and nurse practitioner should regularly assess liver function and control the ascites with diuretic therapy. The patient's name should be placed on the liver transplant list as soon as possible because donors are in short supply. The transplant nurse should be consulted to educate the patient on the process of getting a new liver.
