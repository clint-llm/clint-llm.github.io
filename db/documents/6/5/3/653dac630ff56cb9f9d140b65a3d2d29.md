Non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers (nNMBs) are administered as primary therapy in facilitating endotracheal intubations and adjuvant therapy in the perioperative maintenance of anesthesia and care of critically ill patients. Primarily nNMBs (rocuronium, vecuronium, pancuronium, atracurium, cisatracurium, mivacurium) are used to facilitate airway management and decrease the risk of laryngeal injury during regular and emergent intubations. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of nNMBs, so providers can direct patient therapy to optimal outcomes in anesthesia and other conditions where nNMBs have therapeutic benefit.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action and administration nNMBs.
- Summarize when the use of nNMBAs is indicated.
- Outline the adverse effect profile and contraindications of nNMB use.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients who can benefit from therapy with nNMBs.
