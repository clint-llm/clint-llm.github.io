As in all infectious conditions, evaluation should include blood and/or wound cultures prior to the initiation of antibiotics. Laboratory findings typical of infection include leukocytosis with neutrophilia and a left shift as well as lactic acidosis. Notably, no postpartum infection can be excluded based on lab work alone, and clinicians should not be falsely reassured if laboratory diagnostics are unremarkable. Endometritis is largely a clinical diagnosis. Findings suggestive of endometritis include fever, abdominal tenderness, and foul-smelling lochia. If septic abortion is suspected based on history, an ultrasound should be obtained to evaluate for retained products of conception.

If the infection has spread to the uterus, gas may be seen in the myometrium on plain film or computed tomography (CT).
