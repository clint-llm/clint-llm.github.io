This process is essentially a form of operant conditioning with positive feedback for performing the desired action or behavior and negative feedback for not doing so. The first step is to choose the best modality and establish the baseline parameter. The next step is to learn to control the parameter and to practice until the action has become embedded into memory. An example of this is the use of biofeedback for hypertension. In thermal biofeedback, a temperature probe is attached to a patient's finger or toe and is instructed to increase or decrease the temperature in response to the feedback. Warming a digit involves decreasing sympathetic vasoconstrictive tone to that digit and thus increasing blood flow.
