The pathophysiology of leukemia cutis involves the migration of leukemic cells into the skin. The exact mechanism is unknown, but recent molecular analysis is beginning to provide more information on cell-cell interaction and the role of adhesion molecules. Mechanisms involving various chemokines and the molecular expression on leukemic cells mediating the migration of leukemic cells to the skin via skin-selective homing processes are the proposed etiology.
