**History**

The mechanism of injury and whether there was loss of consciousness (and if so, for how long) are important components in the initial evaluation. Symptoms may be non-specific and include nausea, vomiting, headaches, tinnitus, visual changes, dizziness, "foggy" feeling, or confusion. The use of any antiplatelet or anti-coagulation agents should be elicited.Â  Focal neurologic deficits, including numbness, weakness, slurred speech, incontinence of bowel or bladder, altered mental status, or unconsciousness are red flags that necessitate brisk evaluation for intracranial hemorrhage, which is a neurosurgical emergency. In the longer term, many patients struggle with ongoing post-concussive symptoms, including dizziness, balance problems, cognitive difficulties, memory deficits, emotional lability, anxiety, depression, sleep difficulties, delusions, hallucinations, vision changes, and headaches.

**Exam**

Initial vitals are essential to review. Cushing's triad, a combination of hypertension, bradycardia, and irregular or decreased respirations may present in patients with increased intracranial pressure.

Assuming that the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation are intact, the patient should then be evaluated using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), assessing for eye-opening, verbal responses, and motor responses. The minimum score is 3, and the maximum score is 15.

**Glasgow Coma Scale**

Eye-opening response

- Spontaneous (4)

- To verbal stimuli (3)

- To pain (2)

- No response (1)

Verbal response

- Oriented (5)

- Confused (4)

- Inappropriate words (3)

- Incomprehensible speech (2)

- No response (1)

Motor response

- Obeys commands for movement (6)

- Purpose movement to painful stimuli (5)

- Withdraws to painful stimuli (4)

- Flexion response to painful stimuli (decorticate posturing) (3)

- Extension response to painful stimuli (decerebrate posturing) (2)

- No response (1)

Battle sign (bruising behind the ears), raccoon eyes (bruising beneath the eyes), hemotympanum, and CSF otorrhea or rhinorrhea are signs of basilar skull fracture and highly associated with intracranial hemorrhage. Pupil response is testable in all patients. A fixed, dilated pupil ("blown" pupil) on one side may correspond to ipsilateral hemorrhage and herniation.

A thorough neurologic exam, including assessment of cranial nerves, strength, sensation, reflexes, clonus, should follow in patients who can cooperate with the exam. Gait testing should take place for patients not suspected of cervical spine injury, though most patients with a severe head injury will require cervical spine immobilization until ruling out cervical injury clinically and radiologically. In patients who are following up after brain trauma, further neuropsychiatric testing may be necessary.
