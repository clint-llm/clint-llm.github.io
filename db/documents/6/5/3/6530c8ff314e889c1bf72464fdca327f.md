When used as a miotic agent, pilocarpine is available in the form of ophthalmologic eye drops. This dose form will result in ciliary contraction (a contraction of the iris), which will increase aqueous humor outflow, miosis, and accommodation. The ciliary body connects to the zonular fibers that control the accommodation of the lens. Contraction of the ciliary body will relax the zonular fibers, resulting in a more spherical shape of the lens and allowing aqueous outflow to occur. This conformational change is helpful to decrease intraocular pressure in glaucoma. Pilocarpine will also cause constriction of the pupillary sphincter muscle, resulting in miosis. The allowable daily dose is 30 mg.
