Arachnoid cysts are common incidental findings on cross-sectional neuroimaging of the brain. When they are present in the appropriate location and of significant size, they can be symptomatic and require treatment. Also, they rarely occur in the spine and can result in symptoms. Both spinal and intracranial arachnoid cysts present due to mass effect or secondary to rupture. This activity reviews the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of arachnoid cysts and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the typical presentation with an intracranial arachnoid cyst.
- Explain the imaging findings of arachnoid cysts.
- Summarize treatment considerations for arachnoid cysts.
- Describe the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by arachnoid cysts.
