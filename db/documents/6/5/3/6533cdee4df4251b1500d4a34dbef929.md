Rupture of the tibialis anterior tendon (TAT) is an uncommon pathology. However, in the event of a rupture, if the patient experiences significant loss of dorsiflexion and inversion accompanied by gait disorder, the treatment of choice is surgical repair or reconstruction. In surgery, the tendon is reattached to the bone.
