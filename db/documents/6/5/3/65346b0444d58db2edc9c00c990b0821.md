Traumatic eye injury can cause shearing force over the normal blood vessels and can rupture them causing an ocular bleed. It can occur at any age and without any gender predisposition. However, traumatic injuries are more common in young males owing to more outdoor activities and heavy work. Traumatic injury is more common in children during the summer season owing to increased outdoor activities during summer vacations.

The incidence of traumatic hyphema is approximately 12 injuries per 100,000 population.Â Males are three to five times more affected than females.

In a study by Butner et al., it was noted that in patients of vitreous hemorrhage, 34.1% of the cases were of diabetic retinopathy, 22.4% of patients were of a retinal break without retinal detachment, 14.9% cases were of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, and 13% cases were of retinal vein occlusion

The incidence and prevalence of intraocular hemorrhage are directly correlated with the incidence and prevalence of the predisposing factor, which leads to the bleeding.

In a study by Obuchowska et al., it was discussed that the incidence of suprachoroidal hemorrhage after all ocular surgeries was 0.29%.

A study by Al-hitq et al. showed that the incidence of submacular hemorrhage was 5.4 per million per annum. 52% of their patients had past history of Age-Related Macular Degeneration.

Shaken baby syndrome incidence is between 15 and 30 per 100 000 children under the age of 1 year.
