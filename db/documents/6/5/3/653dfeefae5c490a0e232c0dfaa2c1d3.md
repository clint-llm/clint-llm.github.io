**Coronary Perfusion Pressure and Interprofessional Team Monitoring**

Blood pressure is a common measurement in both hospital and community healthcare settings. Adequate blood pressure is required to drive blood flow to organs. Coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) is the term used to measure the flow through coronary arteries.

**Coronary Perfusion Pressure**

Blood pressure is a vital determinant of coronary blood flow. Interestingly, while the non-cardiac organs get perfused during systole (cardiac contraction) and diastole (cardiac relaxation), the high pressures generated in the heart during contraction impede coronary blood flow.

**Myocardial Infarction**

Myocardial infarction due to inadequate blood supply to the heart is a common cause of mortality in the United States, with 790000 cases per year. Therapeutic advances and improvements in care have led to improvements in long-term survival post-myocardial infarction.

Many patients will be treated with glyceryl trinitrate sublingual spray or intravenous infusion after myocardial infarction. At high doses, glyceryl trinitrate infusions decrease blood pressure.

**Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation**

Cardiac arrest describes a state where cardiac output ceases due to an array of potential underlying causes. CPR is necessary for patients who have had cardiac arrest to temporarily replace the oxygenation function of the lungs and the pumping function of the heart while rendering treatment to return the patientâ€™s spontaneous circulation. It is important to maintain CPP during CPR because, due to the absence of cardiac output, these patients are unable to maintain coronary or cerebral perfusion. Studies in humans have shown that greater CPP is associated with higher rates of patient survival.

**Hypotension**

Hypotension is a common clinical finding in hospital inpatients and arises from a wide array of causes. Hypotension and circulatory shock, when blood pressure is unable to ensure organ perfusion, most commonly result from hypovolemia (low circulating blood volume) and sepsis (abnormal immune response to infection). When hypotension occurs to the extent that CPP is not maintained, a myocardial infarction occurs. This type of myocardial infarction results from low blood pressure rather than the presence of a thrombus in the coronary arteries. Patients who suffer from this type of myocardial infarction have a similar mortality rate compared to patients with myocardial infarction resulting from a coronary artery thrombus.
