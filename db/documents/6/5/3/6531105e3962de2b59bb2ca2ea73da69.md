Healthy infants experience an expected drop in blood glucose concentrations immediately following birth as a part of the normal physiologic transition to extrauterine life. Abruptly clamping the umbilical cord at birth disrupts the infant's connection to the placenta, upon which it relied to supply glucose and other metabolites necessary to meet its energy needs in utero. The continuous supply of exogenous intravenous glucose from the placenta suddenly ceases, and the infant's blood glucose concentration declines in the first hours of life. For most healthy infants, this transitional neonatal hypoglycemia is brief, transient and most often asymptomatic.

Infants are at risk for more severe or prolonged hypoglycemia due to one or a combination of the following underlying mechanisms: insufficient glucose supply, with low glycogen or fat stores or poor mechanisms of glucose production; increased glucose utilization caused by excessive insulin production or increased metabolic demand; or the failure of counter-regulatory mechanisms (i.e., pituitary or adrenal failure).

- Intrauterine growth restriction or small compared to gestational age infants

- Infants of diabetic mothers or large for gestational age infants

- Late-preterm infants (34 to 36.6 weeks gestational age)

Preterm, intrauterine growth restricted and small for gestational age infants are at risk for hypoglycemia because they are born with decreased glycogen stores, decreased adipose tissue and experience increased metabolic demands because of their relatively large brain size.

Infants of diabetic mothers (IDM) and large for gestational age infants experience fetal hyperinsulinism and increased peripheral glucose utilization, putting them at risk for hypoglycemia in the immediate postnatal period.

Infants experiencing perinatal stress (e.g., fetal distress, perinatal ischemia, maternal preeclampsia/eclampsia, sepsis, hypothermia) or those with congenital heart disease have increased metabolic energy requirements, which puts them at risk for hypoglycemia.

Other iatrogenic causes of transient neonatal hypoglycemia include intrapartum administration of maternal medication (e.g., beta-adrenergic tocolytic agents, valproic acid, propranolol, and conduction anesthetics), delayed feeding, and exogenous insulin administration.

Low glucose concentrations beyond the first 48 hours of life raise concern for an underlying disorder as the etiology of hypoglycemia. The underlying physiologic mechanisms that cause pathologic or persistent hypoglycemia are similar to those described above: hyperinsulinism (e.g., congenital hyperinsulinism, Beckwith-Wiedmann syndrome, Soto syndrome), insufficient energy supply (i.e., inborn errors of metabolism that result in deficiencies in glycogen, amino acids, or free fatty acids), or a deficiency in cortisol or growth hormone (e.g., Costello syndrome, hypopituitarism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia). Causes of persistent neonatal hypoglycemia include

- Congenital hyperinsulinism

- Congenital syndromes: Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Soto syndrome, Costello syndrome

- Endocrine disorders: congenital hypopituitarism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, hypothyroidism

- Inborn errors of metabolism: maple syrup urine disease, glycogen storage disorders, hereditary fructose intolerance, galactosemia, fatty acid oxidation disorders
