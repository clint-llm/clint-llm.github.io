Although trichodysplasia spinulosa as a clinical entity is predominantly documented in patients with compromised immune systems, infection with the causative virus is widespread. Serologic studies of individuals both with and without compromised immune systems indicate that the prevalence of TSPyV is between 65-80% in both populations.Â TSPyV has no apparent gender predilection, but seroprevalence differences between age groups implicate that primary infection occurs during childhood.

Due to the rarity of this condition and the limited number of case reports, there is insufficient data to establish valid patterns of geographic distribution. Presumably, as this condition becomes more widely recognized and more frequently reported, geographic patterns may align with the distribution of immunocompromised populations.

Risk factors for trichodysplasia spinulosa include solid organ transplant, immunosuppressive medications, hematolymphoid malignancy, and HIV infection. All but one of the reported cases thus far have occurred in patients with indisputable immune compromise.

In September 2014, a case of trichodysplasia spinulosa was reported in a man with Gorlin syndrome being treated for multiple basal cell carcinomas with vismodegib. His trichodysplasia spinulosa eruption was reportedly painful, which is atypical, and resolved when vismodegib was discontinued. No historical or laboratory evidence of immunodeficiency was found.
