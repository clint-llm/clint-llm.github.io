Hodgkin lymphoma is a rare malignancy with an estimated incidence rate of 2.6 cases per 100,000 people in the United States. The disease represents 11% of all lymphomas seen in the United States. It has a bimodal distribution where most of the affected patients are between ages 20 to 40 years, and there is another peak from age 55 years and older. It affects males more than females, especially in the pediatric population, where 85% of cases occur in boys. Nodular sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma is more common in young adults, whereas mixed cellularity Hodgkin lymphoma tends to affect older adults. The incidence of classical Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes is as follows: nodular sclerosis classical Hodgkin lymphoma (70%), mixed cellularity classical HL (25%), lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma (5%), and lymphocyte-depleted classical HL (less than 1%). Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) represents approximately 5% of Hodgkin lymphoma in general.
