Imaging plays a key role in evaluating hibernomas.

**Radiography**

Like most non-mineralized soft tissue masses, radiographs are limited in the evaluation of hibernomas.  Subtle alteration of tissues plains may sometimes be noted in retrospect on radiographs when hibernomas are eventually identified on cross-sectional imaging. These lesions are typically radiolucent on radiographs about muscle and bone with a similar radiodensity to surrounding subcutaneous fat. Depending on their size and location, these neoplasms generally show a nonspecific prominence of subcutaneous soft tissues. Hibernomas identified on radiographs may be displacing another soft tissue structure or superimposed on an air-filled structure such as the lungs.  Intramuscular hibernomas and hibernomas involving the mediastinum, abdomen, and pelvis often cannot be identified on radiographs. Rare instances of intraosseous hibernomas can present as lytic lesions of the affected bone imaged.

**Sonography**

Sonography is most effective in evaluating hibernomas of the subcutaneous soft tissues. The utility of sonography is somewhat limited in the evaluation of intramuscular hibernomas as well as deeper lesions. On sonographic imaging, these neoplasms are generally encapsulated and well-circumscribed with similar echogenicity to surrounding fat. On occasion, these tumors can demonstrate mild hyperechogenicity or mild hypoechogenicity to surrounding subcutaneous fat.  A prominent vessel or vessels within these neoplasms can often be seen on color Doppler imaging. Adjacent prominent vascularity corresponding to a feeder vessel can also be identified.  These sonographic features are shared with both typical and atypical lipomas.

**Computed tomography (CT)**

On CT imaging, these neoplasms are hypoattenuating to muscle. Still, they can be mildly hyperattenuating compared to surrounding subcutaneous fat due to their vascularity and decreased percentage of white fat vacuoles. A feeding vessel or vessels can often be identified on contrast-enhanced imaging.

**Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**

On MRI imaging, hibernomas are often encapsulated and well-circumscribed. They are typically heterogeneous in signal and can be slightly hypointense or isointense to surrounding subcutaneous fat on T1 imaging.

**Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Imaging**

Owing to their composition of brown fat, which has high relative metabolic activity, hibernomas often show increased fluorodeoxyglucose-18 (FDG) activity on PET imaging.
