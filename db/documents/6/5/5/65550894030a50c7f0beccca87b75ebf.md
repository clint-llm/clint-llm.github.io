In contrast to cerebral ischemic infarction, in which guidelines for management and pre- and post-hospital care are well-established, no consensus guidelines exist for the management of acute spinal cord ischemia.

**Surgical Considerations**

Specific etiologies of spinal cord ischemia may be amenable to surgical intervention. Open decompression of epidural abscess or hematoma in the acute setting may prevent secondary vascular injury and long-term neurologic deficit.

**Medical Management and Considerations**

Unfortunately, there are scarce data on the medical management of spinal cord ischemia. Reports exist of treatment with thrombolysis, but the generalizability of this therapy and its associated risks are not certain.
