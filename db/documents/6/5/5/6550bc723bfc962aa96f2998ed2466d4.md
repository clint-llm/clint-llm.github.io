Oncology practice isÂ entering a new age of improved diagnostic testing based on cancer-specific proteins, germline mutations, and genetics. The field is expanding so rapidly that it is difficult for healthcare professionals to keep up. Using the proper testing for the right patient at the right time for the right reason requires an interprofessional team approach, including primary care clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), urologists, oncologists, genetic counselors, pathologists, cancer coordinators, nursing personnel, and pharmacists working together and communicating effectively to provide optimal advice, counseling, and treatment for their patients.

The biomarkers can provide significant insight into potential cancers. All practitioners on the case must document their findings and communicate them to the rest of the team so that all caregivers have the same accurate and updated case information from which to make decisions. Nurses will help coordinate referrals and communication between specialties, and in such cases, an oncology-specialized nurse may prove beneficial. This interprofessional paradigm in using these biomarkers will result in improved diagnosis, which will translate into better care and presumably improved patient outcomes. [Level 5]
