Off-label, venlafaxine can be used for attention deficit disorder, fibromyalgia, diabetic neuropathy, complex pain syndromes, hot flashes, migraine prevention, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Venlafaxine may be used independently or as part of combination therapy with other drugs.
