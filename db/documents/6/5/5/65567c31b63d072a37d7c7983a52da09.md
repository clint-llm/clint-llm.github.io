Platelet adhesion, activation, and aggregation play critical roles in normal hemostasis and pathological thrombosis. These factors are pathologically crucial in initiating intracoronary thromboses that cause acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and the ischemic complications following coronary artery interventions, including stent thrombosis and recurrent myocardial infarction. The interaction of ADP with P2Y and P2Y receptors enhances and sustains platelet activation; these activated platelets expose glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors, which crosslink with fibrin to form platelet aggregates. These aggregates result in mechanical blood flow disruption and can potentially embolize downstream, leading to microvasculature obstruction resulting in myocardial ischemia and infarction.

Prasugrel is an antiplatelet agent in the thienopyridine group.
