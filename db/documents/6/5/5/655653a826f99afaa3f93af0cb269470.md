Surgical repair techniques are divided into two categories, includingÂ aortic root and annular remodeling, and cusp repair techniques. To better understand these techniques, it is important to know the three different types of aortic insufficiencies (AI). Type 1 corresponds to dilated aortic, causing cusps stretching and tethering and a central regurgitation jet. Type 2 is due to valve leaflet prolapse and presents as an eccentric jet. Type 3, which is least amenable to surgical repair, involves fibrosis and calcifications of the valve leading to cusp retraction. In most cases, all three of these co-exist to some degree.

**Aortic Root and Annular Techniques:**Type 1 aortic lesions in aortic sufficiency include pathology of any component of the functional annulus. These type 1 lesions can present alone or can accompany cusp pathology. In such cases, sub-commissural annuloplasty can improve cusp coaptation.

**Valve Sparing Root Replacement (VSRR):**After being first described in 1983, this technique has gradually gained popularity in patients with aortic root dilation and resultant aortic insufficiency.

**Repair of Isolated Aortic Valve-related Aortic Insufficiency:**In patients with Type 1 and Type 2 AI with preserved valvular apparatus, this technique is promising and has been practiced for a while. In type 3 AI, with less pliable valves, this technique might not be successful. Cusp prolapse, generations, and other deformities leading to AI can be effectively repaired. In addition, in patients with annulus and STJ abnormalities, a low threshold to repair of involved structures must be considered. The procedure may involve a circumferential subvalvular annuloplasty, and in patients with suspicion of supravalvular pathology, STJ annuloplasty or root replacement should be performed concomitantly.
