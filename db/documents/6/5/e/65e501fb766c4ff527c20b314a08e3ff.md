Pharyngeal pouch formation begins with lateral migration of the endoderm, and this process becomes stimulated by several fibroblast-growth-factors (FGFs). The predominant factors vary based on the location within the pouches - FGF8 expresses in the anterior region of each pouch, bone-morphogenic-protein-7 (BMP7) expresses in the posterior region, and paired-box-protein-1 (PAX1) expresses in the dorsal area of each pouch. In the second and third pouches, SHH (sonic-hedgehog-signaling-molecule) expresses in the posterior endoderm. Endodermal tissue migration is a key step in the development of the pharyngeal arches, neural crest cell migration, and the differentiation of skeletal structures in the head/neck.
