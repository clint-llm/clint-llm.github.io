Patients with adhesive capsulitis usually present with progressively worsening shoulder pain over weeks to months, followed by significant limitation in shoulder motion. The key clinical sign of adhesive capsulitis is reduced active and passive range of motion with forward flexion, abduction, and external and internal rotation. The natural arm swing that happens when walking may be lost in patients with severe illness. Muscular atrophy may be discovered upon further evaluation of the afflicted shoulder. The palpation reveals diffuse tenderness around the shoulder joint. The distal neurology must be intact in these patients. Resisted movement of the shoulder produces pain and marked limitation in movement mimicking rotator cuff tear. Internal rotation may be measured using the Apley scratch test.
