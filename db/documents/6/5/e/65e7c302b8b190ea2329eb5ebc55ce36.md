A large number of factors can contribute to the etiopathogenesis of myopia. Prolonged screen hours and indoor confinement are often blamed for the development and progression of myopia. Promoting outdoor activities, using modalities like atropine 0.01% once daily in both eyes at night and contact lenses can help prevent myopia progression.

Parents should clearlyÂ understand the need for glasses and the risk of myopia progression. A complete eye examination and refraction should be done regularly. Often myopia in children gets unnoticed as children cannot explain their problems clearly and are usually incidentally diagnosed during a routine evaluation. School eye screening programs should be promoted with better spectacle coverage, especially in developing countries.
