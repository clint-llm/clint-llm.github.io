Airway obstruction can occur anywhere from the pharynx to the bronchi.Â  Obstruction in the larynx, above the vocal cords, has a better prognosis as therapeutic maneuvers tend to be more effective than when the obstruction occurs below the larynx, which may necessitate removal by instrumentation.

Stridor, a variably high pitched respiratory sound, is a common physical exam finding in airway obstruction. The cause is attributed to rapid, turbulent flow through a narrow airway opening. The reduction of airflow increases the energy expended to move air across the airway, resulting in turbulent airflow and, subsequently, stridor and respiratory distress.
