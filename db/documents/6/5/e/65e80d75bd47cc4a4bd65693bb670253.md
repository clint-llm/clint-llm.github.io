Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) targets the immune system by depleting CD4+ T lymphocytes and predisposing patients to an increased risk of opportunistic infections. The use of the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) leads to the restoration of CD4+ T lymphocytes and the normalization of an immune response against pathogens.

Although the introduction of HAART has been a landmark in preventing HIV-related deaths, there are still issues with HAART therapy. Since its inception, there have been several reported side effects of HAART and its possible interactions with other medications. Side effects can range from mild-severe allergic reactions, idiosyncratic reactions, hematological disorders to altered drug metabolism.

Another potential complication that may arise with HAART therapy is immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). IRIS is a poorly understood disease, and its exact mechanism is not yet fully known. It is a state of dysregulated, hyper-inflammatory response against opportunistic infections that usually occurs in the first six months of treatment of HIV/AIDS patients.
