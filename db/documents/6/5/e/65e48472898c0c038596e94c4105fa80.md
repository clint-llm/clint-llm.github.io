Ozone normally occurs in a gas state as three atoms of oxygen (O) linked in a cyclic structure and is a by-product of water purification, bleaching, and any process generating a spark or electric arc in the presence of oxygen.

In spite of this, ozone can be generated by medical devices for therapeutic purposes. Potential medical applications of ozone therapy have a wide range, including 1) limiting postoperative pain after dental extraction when used as a gel, 2) repairing inner ear damage caused by acoustic trauma, 3) reducing coronary stent restenosis when applied as an auto-hem-transfusion, and 4) enhancing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus elimination in mediastinitis when used in conjunction with antibiotics.

Outside of medicine, ozone has been proposed for use in various settings, such as in the pretreatment of textile wastewater.

With the wide range of possible applications and toxicity that can occur at environmental levels from within a home, research on ozone use and toxicity is likely to increase in the future.
