In current clinical practice, procalcitonin (PCT) has developed into a promising new biomarker for the early detection of systemic bacterial infections. PCT is a 116-amino acid residue first explained by Le Moullec et al. in 1984; its diagnostic significance was not recognized until 1993.

Other inflammatory biomarkers, such as C-reactive protein, lack the specificity to accurately distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial infections.

The United States Food and Drug Administration has approved using PCT assays for initiating or discontinuing antibiotics in lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) and for discontinuing antibiotics in patients with sepsis.

PCT should not be used as the sole determinant for antimicrobial therapy.
