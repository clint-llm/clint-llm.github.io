The theories that provide a basis for the pathophysiology of primary cutaneous endometriosis may be explained by the theory of cellular metaplasia, vascular and lymphatic migration. Meyer, in 1903, proposed the theory of tissue differentiation of the mesothelial cells of the peritoneum into endometrial glands and stroma as a cause of endometriosis. Halban, in 1924. proposed the theory of dispersion of cells of the endometrium from the lymphatic vessels, and similarly, Sampson, in 1925, supported this theory of dispersion of cells through the hematogenous route.

The pathophysiology of secondary cutaneous endometriosis is described on the basis of implantation of the endometrial cells on the cutaneous sites during surgical procedures and those cells behaving as being similar to uterine endometrial cells that undergo proliferation and shedding during the menstrual cycle.
