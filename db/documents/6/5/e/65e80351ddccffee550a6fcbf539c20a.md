Human cytotoxic T cell responds to HIV infection by releasing cytolytic proteins and chemokines. Although HIV targets CD4 T cells, under the threat of the human immune system, HIV adopts several mechanisms to escape the cytolytic effect of cytotoxic T cells. Mutation in amino acid synthesis leads to variation in antigen expression and decreased recognition of infected cells by CD 8 cells. Several HIV proteins decrease MHC type 1 expression and have a pro-apoptotic effect of CD 8 cells. These immune evasion adaptations cause persistent HIV infection due to weak cytolytic response by CD 8 cells.

The inability to eliminate pathogens in chronic infection is described as an Exhaustion of T cells. This cytotoxic function loss is induced by the expression of inhibitory receptors on CD8 T cells. These inhibitory receptors impair T cell receptor signaling pathways, blocking its activation and propagation.

Destruction of muscle fibers in polymyositis is executed by perforin and granzyme, which is evident by heavy infiltration of CD8 T cells in the endomysial inflammatory infiltrate.
