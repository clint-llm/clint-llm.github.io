Because early treatment is so important in cyanide toxicity, the most obvious pitfall would be not making the diagnosis early in the course. Some complications that survivors of severe cyanide poisoning may encounter are Parkinson or other forms of neurological sequelae. The basal ganglia are particularly sensitive to cyanide toxicity.  Chronic cyanide exposure can lead to vague symptoms such as a headache, abnormal taste, vomiting, chest pain, and anxiety.
