# Definition/Introduction

The German neurologist Johann Hoffman first postulated this sign. It was described by his assistant Hans Curschmann in 1911 and has become a standard part of the common neurologic exam.

# Issues of Concern

While the Hoffman sign can help as a screening tool, it is not reliable as a stand-alone predictor of spinal cord compression. Degenerative cervical myelopathy is a spinal cord dysfunction that can lead to numbness, pain, imbalance, sensory loss, hyperreflexia, and urinary incontinence. Estimates are that nearly 1.6 per 100000 have had surgical treatment for cervical myelopathy.

# Clinical Significance

The gold standard for diagnosing cervical myelopathy is an MRI. A 2015 study found that positive cord signal changes on MRI correlate with 67% of those with a positive Hoffman sign.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions

As a standard part of neurological examination, all interprofessional healthcare team members should be familiar with the Hoffman sign and its clinical ramifications. This includes clinicians (including NPs and PAs) and nurses, plus physical therapists and chiropractors. It is an easy test to perform, and understanding the significance can help direct the patient to the clinical care they need (e.g., via appropriate referrals and further testing) and improve outcomes. This requires open communication between all members of the healthcare team across professional disciplines. [Level 5]
