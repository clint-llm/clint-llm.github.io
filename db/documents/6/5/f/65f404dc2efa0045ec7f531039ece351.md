False positives are rare, but sweat chloride may elevate falsely in other pathologic syndromes and situations, including:

- Improper testing technique

- Atopic dermatitis

- Untreated adrenal insufficiency

- Glycogen storage disease

- Panhypopituitarism

- Hereditary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus

Newborns may not produce enough sweat and may need to wait until later in infancy before an adequate sweat quantity can be collected.Â Infants with a positive newborn screen can undergo testing as early as 2 days of life. However, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation recommends waiting until the child is 10 days old. For premature infants, testing should wait until they are 2 kilograms in size and greater than 36 weeks corrected gestational age, if possible.
