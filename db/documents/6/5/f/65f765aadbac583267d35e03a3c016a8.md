Gentamicin is a widely used antibiotic, being an important part of the medical practice since the 1940s. Although there is an increasing antimicrobial resistance rate, gentamicin is still a powerful option for many gram-negative infections, including severe ones. Clinicians must always try to identify if the pathogen responsible for the infection is susceptible to gentamicin, allowing a more accurate use of it. Current evidence indicates that a high-dose, extended interval dosing approach is at least equally efficacious as traditional multiple doses but less nephrotoxic and ototoxic and, therefore, should be used whenever possible. Doses must be calculated based on patient weight and adjusted according to the GFR. Nursing should remember that the infusion time must not be less than 30 minutes and keep vigilant for hypersensitivity reactions. The pharmacists are essential to check the prescribing dose and the necessary items for administration and review possible medication interactions. The healthcare team should be prepared to recognize and manage acute kidney injury and inner ear lesions, both potential adverse effects of gentamicin use. Open communication and collaborative work of all interprofessional team members can improveÂ patient care and enhance treatment outcomes with gentamicin. [Level 5]
