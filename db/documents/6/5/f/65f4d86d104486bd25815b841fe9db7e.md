According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the pathological classification of endometrial carcinoma includes nine subtypes. Out of them, endometrioid and serous carcinomas are the most common. Endometrioid carcinoma is further divided into four subtypes based on histopathology - adenocarcinoma with squamous differentiation, villoglandular (papillary subtype with cuboidal/columnar cells), secretory subtype, and ciliated cell subtype. In adenocarcinoma with squamous differentiation (almost 25% of adenocarcinomas), on histological examination keratin pearls, intercellular bridges consisting of ovoid or spindle cells may be seen.

Serous carcinoma, on histopathology, often contains papillae, which are lined by pleomorphic hyperchromatic cells that contain eosinophilic macronucleoli. Other subtypes include mucinous, clear cell, neuroendocrine, serous endometrial intraepithelial, mixed cell adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated and dedifferentiated carcinomas. Piultas et al. proposed integrating pathological with molecular classification to improve management. Accordingly, molecular classification classifies into four subtypes - group 1 is polymerase epsilon (POLE) ultra-mutated, group 2 with microsatellite instability, group 3 with low copy number alterations, and group 4 with serous-like or high copy number alterations. Groups 1-3 are predominantly endometrioid cancers, and group 4 is serous carcinoma.
