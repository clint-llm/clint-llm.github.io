Phlebitic syndrome in association with cancer is distinctive, and its pathogenesis is not well understood. Research has reported the spectrum of overlapping mechanisms in Trousseau syndrome.

Mucins are highly glycosylated glycoproteins secreted by epithelial cells. In patients with carcinomas, mucins are aberrantly glycosylated and get inappropriately secreted into the blood, the liver clears the bulk of these mucins, and a small fraction is resistant. These mucins interact with L-selectin adhesion molecule expressed on leukocyte and P-selection adhesion molecule expressed on platelet and endothelial cells, resulting in the production of platelet rich-microthrombi.

Reports exist of tissue factor (TF) as a cause of Trousseau syndrome. Cancer cells express abnormally high TF and release TF-positive microparticles that are highly procoagulant.

Cancer procoagulant, also described as cysteine proteinase, expressed by malignant cells and also normal cells (except fetal tissue), directly induces the conversion of factor X to factor Xa.

There are reports that hypoxia increases the expression of TF and plasminogen activator inhibitor type1 (PAI-1) that facilitate coagulation.
