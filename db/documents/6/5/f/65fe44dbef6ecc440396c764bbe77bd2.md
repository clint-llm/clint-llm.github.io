Wound irrigation should not be performed if the wound is actively bleeding, as irrigation may dislodge any clots that are forming. Incomplete wound irrigation can lead to the persistence of debris or purulent discharge left inside the wound, especially in abscesses that may end up in sinus formation. When using povidone-iodine, care must be exercised not to pour it profusely inside the wound however, it should be used on the wound edges.
