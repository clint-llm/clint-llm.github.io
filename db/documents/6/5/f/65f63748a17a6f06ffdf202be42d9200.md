Neural injuries are common sequelae following subclavian artery trauma. Patients with brachial plexus injuries have significant long-term complications,Â even with early recognition and repair of the nerve. Therefore, expectations and possible long-term complications should be discussed extensively with patients. The recurrent laryngeal nerve can be damaged during dissection and clamping the right subclavian artery in the neck and left subclavian artery in the thorax. This nerve damage can result in hoarseness, which could be permanent. Care should be taken to try to avoid inadvertently damaging this nerve. The phrenic nerve and vertebral arteries are also at risk of injury. The thoracic duct at its distal location may be inadvertently injured when clamping the distal left subclavian vein. The thoracic duct should be ligated, and drains should be placed if it is injured during the dissection.

Reported procedural complications from the endovascular approach include access site hematoma, pseudoaneurysm formation, stent-graft stenosis, endoleak, thrombosis, and decreased cerebral blood flow due to an endovascular stent covering the vertebral artery.
