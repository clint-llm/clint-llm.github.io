Intense pulsed light (IPL) therapy was first developed in 1992 to treat leg telangiectasias, and initial studies were conducted on rabbit ear veins. Since then, studies have demonstrated IPL to be a safe and effective means of treating pigmented and vascular disorders, including melasma, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, lentigines, ephelides, telangiectasias, port-wine stains, rosacea, poikiloderma of Civatte, hemangiomas, and venous malformations, in addition to hair removal and photoaging. This activity reviews the physics of IPL therapy, its indications and contraindications, and technical aspects of IPL delivery and highlights the role of the interprofessional healthcare team in administering IPL treatments.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the difference between IPL and laser energy.
- Identify the indications for IPL therapy.
- Review the physics of the interaction between light energy and biological tissues.
- Summarize the role of the interprofessional team in the delivery of IPL treatment and the longitudinal care of the IPL patient.
