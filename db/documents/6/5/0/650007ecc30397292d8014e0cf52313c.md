In non-athletic individuals, maximal oxygen uptake can be achieved with the use of a cycle ergometer. The test is performed in a well-ventilated room equipped with full resuscitation facilities. The computer attached to the metabolic cart displays EKG data as well as physiological data as exercise intensity changes. These data include breath by breath oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production, with flow calibration performed before each breath. The patient begins at rest to become familiar with the equipment, while baseline heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, EKG, and gas exchange values are recorded. During a test with a cycle ergometer, saddle height is adjusted, and the patient is asked to pedal at a constant speed prior to a steady increase in work and oxygen consumption. There are multiple protocols available to guide the performer as the activity is increased, including those set forth by Balke and Naughton.
