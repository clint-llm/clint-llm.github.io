Pulsus alternans is an arterial pulse with alternating strong and weak beats. It is found in the setting of severe ventricular dysfunction and other forms of cardiac pathology. The treatment and clinical outcomes for pulsus alternans vary depending upon the underlying causative etiology, though its presence generally suggests a poor prognostic outlook. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of pulsus alternans and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of pulsus alternans.
- Review the common findings associated with pulsus alternans.
- Outline the treatment considerations for patients with pulsus alternans.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with pulsus alternans.
