Intervertebral disc is a fibrocartilage structure that consists of two components: Nucleus pulposus and the annulus fibrosus. The discs absorb the forces across the vertebra and provide cushion during motion.

Mechanical failure of the intervertebral disc is associated with inflammation, dehydration of the nucleus pulposus, decreased disc height, and annular tears.

Discogenic pain is attributable to pain signals arising from nerves in the outer layers of the disc (annulus fibrosus). Outer tears in the annulus fibrosus stimulate nociceptors and inflammatory mediators. LBP pain may also become from nucleus pulposus and vertebral endplates that might irritate the annulus of the intervertebral disc.

Discogenic pain may cause chronic lumbago without sciatica; the pain usually increases with exercise, cough, and Valsalva maneuver. Moreover, physical exam findings differ from a prolapsed or herniated disc where the straight leg raise test is positive.
