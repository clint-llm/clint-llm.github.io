In addition to holding preganglionic sympathetic outflows of the spinal cord, such as efferent outflows, the T5 to T9 white rami communicantes can also contain general afferent (sensory) visceral inflows. These general afferent visceral fibers classify as neither sympathetic nor parasympathetic; however, visceral afferent fibers tend to associate anatomically with sympathetic efferent fibers. As a result, signals from sensory receptors of visceral organs also travel through the peripheral ganglion, sympathetic trunk, and the white rami communicantes. After traveling through the white rami communicantes and the spinal nerve, these visceral afferent fibers then enter the spinal cord via the dorsal root of the spinal cord. Afferent visceral nerves often synapse onto the preganglionic sympathetic neurons located in the intermediolateral cell column.
