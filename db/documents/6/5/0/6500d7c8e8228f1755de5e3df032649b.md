Pityriasis alba is a common, benign skin disorder occurring predominantly in children and adolescents. The name refers to its appearance: pityriasis refers to its fine scales and alba to its pale color (hypopigmentation). Most patients have a history of atopy, and pityriasis alba may be a minor manifestation of atopic dermatitis. It is characterized by ill-defined macules and patches (or thin plaques), round or oval, often with mild scaling, and sometimes with mild pruritus. The lesions initially may be mildly erythematous, and over time they become hypopigmented. They are most commonly located on the face (especially the cheeks), arms, and upper trunk, and they are more noticeable in people with darker skin types. Sun exposure accentuates the lesions. Patients and parents often are concerned about the cosmetic appearance of the lesions. Pityriasis alba resolves spontaneously, with a gradual return of normal skin pigmentation. Time to complete resolution varies from several months to a few years, although most cases resolve within one year. Reassurance, low-potency topical corticosteroids, and mild emollients are the mainstays of treatment.
