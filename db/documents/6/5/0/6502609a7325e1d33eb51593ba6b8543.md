A breech presentation occurs when the presenting part is either the buttocks and/or the feet. On examination, the head is felt in the upper uterine pole and the breech in the pelvic cavity. The fetal heart tones are auscultated higher than anticipated with a vertex presentation.

When the longest axis of the fetus is oriented transversely, the presenting part is typically the shoulder. In the transverse lie on palpation, neither the head nor the buttocks can be palpated in the lower uterine pole inlet, and the fetal head can be felt in the flank.

Occiput posterior position occurs when the fetal occiput is at or posterior to the sacroiliac joint. On examination, there is a lower abdomen flattened, fetal limbs are palpable anteriorly, and the fetal heart tones may be auscultated in the flank.

Brow presentation occurs with some extension of the fetal head. On palpation, the fetal occiput is higher than the sinciput, and more than half the fetal head is felt above the symphysis pubis.

Face presentation results from hyperextension of the fetal head.Â  On palpation, the fold of the neck is felt as a deep indentation between the occiput and the back; however, in face presentation, this depression is limited.
