The collection of a blood sample to determine PCO2 is a significant area of clinical concern due to the need for accuracy of the measurement and its importance in clinical decision-making.  Traditionally, the arterial blood gas is the more reliable sample to monitor PCO2; this is facilitated with the placement of an arterial catheter for hemodynamic monitoring, as the collection of arterial blood gases becomes readily available. However, if the patient does have central venous access, then the collection of venous blood gas is acceptable. The central venous blood gas is the most well established correlative blood gas alternative to the arterial blood gas in terms of PCO2 measurement.

The collection of a peripheral venous blood gas during venipuncture can be the most misleading alternative to an arterial sample, as the collection must avoid ischemic changes from a tourniquet.  One mode of peripheral venous blood collection is to release the tourniquet after venipuncture and to allow a full minute to pass before collection.

The difference between venous PCO2 measurement to arterial PCO2 measurement does increase in the presence of hypotension and shock. The peripheral venous PCO2 difference has demonstrated an increase of up to a factor of three due to ischemic changes. Therefore venous PCO2 has been shown to have a weak correlation to arterial PCO2 in shock or extreme acid-base abnormalities.
