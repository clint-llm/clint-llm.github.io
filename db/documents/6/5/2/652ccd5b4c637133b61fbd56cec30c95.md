C1 fractures are relatively common following trauma and involve patients of all ages. This fracture can be life-threatening, and all personnel in the emergency department or the trauma team must be aware of its presentation and management. While a neurosurgeon usually manages the primary pathology, the aftercareÂ is generally performed by neurosurgery nurses and physiotherapists, operating as part of an interprofessional healthcare team. When promptly treated, the isolated C1 fracture has a good outcome. The small case series reveals that even after anterior plate fixation, the outcomes are good, with patients achieving a return to their pre-injury status. However, the outcomes for the elderly and young males are guarded. This population often suffers from a multiorgan injury and requires intubation and admission to the ICU. Even when discharged, some of these individuals have residual neurological deficits.
