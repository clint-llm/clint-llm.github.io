Laboratory findings in patients with Sweet syndrome include elevated markers of inflammation, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, peripheral leukocytosis, and neutrophilia. Biopsy findings of dense can support the diagnosis infiltrates in the superficial dermis composed primarily of polymorphonucleocytes and marked edema of the dermal papillae. Lymphocytes may also be present in the inflammatory infiltrate.

Besides the laboratory evaluation to aid the diagnosis of Sweet syndrome, workup shall include determining the underlying cause if present, especially malignancies. Complete blood counts with findings of cytopenias, constitutional symptoms including weight loss, lymphadenopathy, and absence of other typically-associated conditions, raise the suspicion of malignancy. Age-appropriate cancer screening, including colonoscopy, mammogram, and PAP smears, should be pursued. Screening for testicular and prostate cancer in males and pelvic ultrasound in females shall also be considerations for diagnostic workup. CT-scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis are also options. Besides malignancy workup, a pregnancy test is necessary for females of childbearing age with Sweet syndrome. Sweet syndrome is usually not an initial presenting feature of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren syndrome, or Behcet disease, and the clinician should pursue diagnostic evaluation for these conditions if other typical clinical findings create suspicion for their presence.
