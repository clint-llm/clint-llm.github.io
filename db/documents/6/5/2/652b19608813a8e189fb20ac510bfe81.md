Global warming may facilitate the emergence of VEEV epidemics. Climate change can lead to longer transmission seasons, changes in rainy seasons, which increase mosquito populations, and increased geographic distributions of tropical mosquito vectors.

Enzootic VEEV exists continuously in tropical regions, and there is a risk of emergence of epizootic strains leading to equine and human outbreaks. In endemic regions, surveillance programs for early detection and implementation of mosquito control and equine vaccination will help control outbreaks.

VEEV was developed as a biological weapon by the United States and the former Soviet Union during the Cold War. It is classified as a biosafety level 3 by the Centers for Disease Control and as a category B priority pathogen by the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases.
