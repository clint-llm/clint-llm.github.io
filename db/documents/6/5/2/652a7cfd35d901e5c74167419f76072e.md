Yersinia enterocolitica is a gram-negative bacillus shaped bacterium that causes a zoonotic disease called yersiniosis. The infection is manifested as acute diarrhea, mesenteric adenitis, terminal ileitis, and pseudoappendicitis. In rare cases, it can even cause sepsis.

In some countries, yersinia infections have overtaken shigella and salmonella species as the most common cause of bacterial gastroenteritis. While most cases are sporadic, large outbreaks are not uncommon. Humans acquire yersinia after consumption of contaminated food as well as a blood transfusion. The one key feature of yersinia is that the individual will continue to shed the organism in feces for nearly 3 months after symptoms have subsided- thus detection of yersinia in stools is critical.
