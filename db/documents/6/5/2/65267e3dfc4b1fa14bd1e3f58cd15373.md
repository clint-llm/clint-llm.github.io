Alendronate is a frequently used agent to manage osteoporosis and several other bone disorders, often prescribed in combination with vitamin D. Besides the clinician, the nurse and pharmacist must be fully aware of the therapeutic uses and adverse reactions of this agent. The most feared complication is osteonecrosis of the jaw, which is most likely to occur when dental workÂ has taken place.

The pharmacist should educate the patient on potential drug interactions with alendronate and perform an overall medication reconciliation to check for drug interactions, reporting any concerns to the physician and nurse. All patients on alendronate require close monitoring for side effects, which can be serious; this is where the nurse needs to monitor the drug, counsel the patient, make a direct inquiry about potential adverse effects, and notify the healthcare team of any issues.

Chen Y et al. conducted a population-based cohort study on patient adherence to alendronate therapy in preventing a second hip fracture.
