While sometimes apparent at birth, patent urachus and other urachal anomalies may have a periodic, more insidious presentation. Frontline healthcare providers, like primary care providers and emergency department physicians, must the diagnosis of patent urachus or urachal remnant and their different presentations as part of the differential diagnosis of a child who is brought in for persistent umbilical drainage, recurrent urinary tract infections, recurrent umbilical infection, and/or a palpable mass near the umbilicus. When utilizing imaging modalities like ultrasound, a skilled sonographer and radiologist familiar with these diagnoses are critical. A pediatric general surgeon should be involved with any suspect urachal anomaly or when umbilical drainage initially thought to be an umbilical granuloma does not improve with silver nitrate application. Pediatric urology involvement may be necessary when other urologic abnormalities are diagnosed. Untreated urachal anomalies were historically thought to all inevitably degenerate into malignancy; however, this is now recognized as an extremely rare occurrence.
