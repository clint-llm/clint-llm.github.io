Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis) was first discovered in 1887 by Weichselbaum from analyzing the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of a patient infected with meningitis.Neisseria meningitidis is associated with many infections. However, its association with fulminant meningococcemia and meningococcal meningitis is what has led to its significant impact.  More importantly, despite recent vaccine campaigns to help reduce complications of this disease, its effects are still impacting at-risk populations.
