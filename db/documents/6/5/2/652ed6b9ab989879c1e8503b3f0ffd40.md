Nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa has a worldwide prevalence of about one in 5000, and carriers number about one in 1000. Males are affected slightly more often than females due to the X-linked form expressed more frequently in males. Syndromic RP is much less common, with estimates for Usher syndrome ranging from 1.8 to 6.2 cases per 100,000 individuals. The average age of symptom onset is dependent on the genetic type. The autosomal recessive form will develop symptoms in the early teen years, but those affected with autosomal dominant RP will likely not have symptoms until well into their 20s. More than three-quarters of individuals with RP will be symptomatic and present for clinical evaluation and diagnosis of the disease by the time they are 30 years of age.
