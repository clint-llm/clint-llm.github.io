Preparation for IPL treatment requires finding the patient a comfortable, private treatment room to expose whatever skin area is problematic without fear of embarrassment. The IPL machine requires a few square feet of floor space and frequently a 220 V outlet for power, which is not uniformly available in the United States. A cold gel is also helpful in improving energy transmission from the handpiece to the skin and patient comfort.

IPL can damage pigmented ocular tissues such as the retina; therefore, eye protection with the appropriate optical density is critical for the patient and the IPL treatment provider. Eye shields should not beÂ repositioned mid-procedure, as this may interfere with the treatment session and lead to inadvertent ocular damage.

Pre-procedure informed consent is important for IPL treatments, as it is for any procedure, and the discussion should focus on the development of reasonable expectations, particularly with respect to final outcome, anticipated number of treatments required to achieve the desired result, post-procedure precautions, like avoiding sun exposure, and the potential for complications, such as temporary or permanent hyper or hypopigmentation, erythema, crusting, blistering, and scarring.
