The term 'cosmeceutical' has always been controversial, with the lack of a proper definition, its difference from individual cosmetic and pharmaceutical agents, the mechanism, dermatological use, and regulatory issues. This activity aims to provide a suitable definition for an ever-transforming and ever-evolving word which has a history of being measured on various yardsticks for inclusion in the healthcare delivery system in different countries. This activity will also distinguish cosmeceuticals from cosmetics and drugs, the uses of each, general regulatory aspects and highlight the role of the interprofessional team in the appropriate utilization of cosmeceuticals and on educating patients about them.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the terms cosmeceutical and nutraceutical as well as the broad categories of agents included in each category.
- Review the regulations, indications, contraindications, and federal drug administration (FDA) approval status of cosmeceutical versus cosmetic versus pharmaceutical and the relevant regulations on the uses, and approval for dermatologic use.
- Describe the use of specific cosmeceuticals in the treatment and prevention of skin conditions.
- Summarize how incorporating an interprofessional didactic about cosmeceutical ensures up-to-date knowledge that can be shared with patients.
