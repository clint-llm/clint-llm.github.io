Schizoaffective disorder is among the most frequently misdiagnosed psychiatric disorders in clinical practice. Due to concerns about the reliability and utility of the diagnostic criteria for schizoaffective disorder, some researchers have proposed revisions, while others have suggested altogether removing the diagnosis from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. This activity describes limitations and challenges related to the diagnostic criteria and highlights the interprofessional team's role in caring for patients with psychiatric disorders.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of schizoaffective disorder.
- Outline the classic clinical presentation of a patient with schizoaffective disorder.
- Summarize the treatment options for patients with schizoaffective disorder.
- Describe the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to improve patient compliance with treatment and thus improve outcomes for patients with schizoaffective disorder.
