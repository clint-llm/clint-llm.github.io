Particular attention to the marginal mandibular nerve is taken throughout the procedure as described above. In one series, temporary neuropraxia with full recovery of the marginal mandibular nerve following submandibular gland excision occurred 15.6% of cases while permanent marginal weakness occurred in 2.2% of cases. Wound healing issues are comparable with other neck surgeries ranging from between 7% to 22%.

In the immediate post-operative period, the hematoma is also possible.  The facial artery can result in significant bleeding with potential compressive effects on the airway.
