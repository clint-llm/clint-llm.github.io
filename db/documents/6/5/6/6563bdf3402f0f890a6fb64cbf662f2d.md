The hyoglossus muscle receives a dual blood supply. The main supply originates from the lingual artery, which is the third branch of the external carotid artery. The lingual artery gives rise to four main branches:

- The deep lingual artery

- The sublingual artery

- The suprahyoid branch

- The dorsal lingual branch

The sublingual artery branches off the lingual artery at the anterior border of the hyoglossus muscle and is the branch of the lingual artery that supplies the hyoglossus.

The other blood supply of the hyoglossus muscle comes from the fourth branch of the external carotid artery, the facial artery. As the facial artery leaves the submandibular gland, it gives off the submental branch. The significance of the submental artery in the hyoglossus’ blood supply varies due to the variability of the sublingual artery. In some specimens, it is seen that the sublingual artery anastomoses with the submental artery. However, sometimes the sublingual artery is completely absent, and in these cases, it is replaced with a branch of the submental artery.

The venous drainage of the hyoglossus is through the lingual vein.

The lymphatic drainage of the hyoglossus is directly through the deep cervical group of lymph nodes.
