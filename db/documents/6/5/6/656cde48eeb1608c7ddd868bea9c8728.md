An interprofessional assessment and management must be implemented for early detection and prompt management of the patients suffering from accessory nerve injury due to any cause. The nurse practitioner and primary care provider need to refer any patient unable to shrug the shoulder or asymmetrical shoulders to a neurologist to determine the cause and treatment. Coordination of care for the patient is crucial, with physical therapy and occupational therapy playing a significant role in better recovery and improved outcomes.
