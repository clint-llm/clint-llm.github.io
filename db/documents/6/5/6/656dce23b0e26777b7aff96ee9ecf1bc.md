History and Physical examination can play an important role in the early and timely detection of PreHTN and HTN. People with a strong family history of HTN (first-degree relatives) is an important part of the diagnosis. People with a history of smoking or other illicit drug abuse are at higher risk to develop HTN. On exam, overweight and obese people (BMI > 25) are at a higher risk to develop PreHTN and HTN.
