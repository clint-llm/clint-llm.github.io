Venous access for this procedure is either by a central venous catheter or large bore peripheral lines. There are multiple manufacturers of the centrifuge-based plasmapheresis machines.

Another technique of performing plasmapheresis is by using semipermeable membrane filters with a standard hemodialysis machine. However, for this technique, central venous access is mandatory due to the need for higher blood flow rates of 100 mL/min to 150 mL/min. There are two membrane-based technologies that are currently available; hollow fiber and parallel plate. Hollow fiber dialyzers are cylindrical shell-like structures, consisting of multiple polysulfone capillary fibers.

Parallel plate dialyzers consist of layered membranes, with ridges and grooves which facilitate filtration. Both these dialyzers allow plasma filtration based on particle size and pressure gradients. Hollow fiber dialyzers are more gentle as opposed to parallel plate dialyzers and are preferred for pediatric patients, whereas hollow fiber dialyzers use less blood volume, and hence require a reduced dose of citrate or heparin for anticoagulation.

The major advantage of membrane-based plasmapheresis over centrifuge-based technology is that the removed processed-plasma by ultrafiltration can be returned to the patient eliminating the need for replacement fluids or colloids.
