# Introduction

Memory is the capability of the brain to encode, store, and retrieve information or data when they are needed. Without memory, it is impossible to perform daily activities or form relationships or learn and progress in our life. That is, memory represents our identity.

According to the multistore model of memory (also known as the modal model), proposed by Atkinson and Shiffrin in 1968, memory consists of three stores: a sensory register, short-term memory (STM), and long-term memory (LTM). STM is the capacity to store and manipulate information for a short time,

Based on cognitive psychology studies, since the late sixties of the last century, researchers proposed to divide LTM into two major two subsets of LTM, explicit memory and implicit memory.

On the other hand, implicit memory does not require conscious intervention to be retrieved. That is, its recovery is not in the form of memories, but through actions or automatisms, "knowing how." It represents, in turn, our abilities (e.g., swimming, cycling, driving the car) and is therefore referred to as procedural memory.

By summarizing LTM can be divided into two subsets:

- Explicit (or declarative) memory

- Episodic memory
- Semantic memory

- Implicit (or procedural) memory

Although the modal model represents an excellent basis for understanding the modalities of memory, it seems to operate an excessive simplification of matter and has been criticized for being a passive and linear model. Based on a wide range of studies conducted on the subject, several alternative memory models have been proposed. Most likely, a model that can explain memory functioning in detail has yet to be proposed. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that the various models and theories should be integrated. In this context, the Working Model of Memory proposed by Baddeley and Hitch, in 1974, offers an explanation of how STM works.

# Development

Overall, explicit memory continues to develop throughout the years, including rapid changes during the first two years of life, until the person reaches 60, which then the explicit memory begins to diminish progressively.The difference in explicit memory between the different age groups, adults, childhood, and infants is due to several reasons. The first reason, the medial temporal lobe is formed and matured before birth, except for the hippocampus, more specifically except for the dentate gyrus, which continues to develop until 11 months of age. The second reason is the rapid myelination, which happens during the first year of life. The final reason is that the connections between the medial temporal lobe and the cortex areas such as the prefrontal cortex are well established between the age of 10 to 18 years.

# Mechanism

Pieces of evidence on the functioning of memory (centers, networks, mechanisms) have been obtained from the study of clinical cases in which anatomical alterations due to trauma or surgery have led to deficits of varying degrees of memory. The most famous clinical case was the American Henry Gustav Molaison, better known as the patient H.M., the most studied person in the history of neuroscience and protagonist as a 'living experiment' of at least a hundred scientific publications. HM's amnesia was a consequence of an intervention, performed to treat drug-resistant epilepsy, which consisted of a bilateral lobotomy of the medial temporal cortex extended several centimeters towards the inside of the brain and including part of the amygdala, the entorhinal cortex and a good part of the hippocampus. After the intervention, the patient showed signs of a very serious form of amnesia. His memory, in fact, was intact as regards the events preceding the surgery but was no longer able to form new LTMs. Many other cognitive faculties, however, remained intact. The procedural memory was also not impaired as H.M. was able to learn how to perform new tasks, even if he could not verbalize what he had learned. The unfortunate case of H.M., who preserved the severe memory deficit for life, allowed for the first time to highlight that non-declarative memory is based on neuronal circuits other than those of the medial temporal lobe and above all does not require conscious memory processes.

**Semantic memory**

A semantic control network is a system of connection between different areas in the brain that works eventually to store, retrieve, or assign meaning to the words, events, ETC.

**Episodic memory**

Episodic memory is the ability to consciously recall or experience a specific event that occurred through the person's life, and it's different from the semantic memories in that you can remember the exact time and place in which the event occurred, or you gained that information.

# Clinical Significance

Various pathological processes can compromise the functioning of explicit memory in its components.

**Alzheimer Disease (AD)**

Dementia is an acquired progressive cognitive impairment that affects the daily activity, and the single major cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounting for 50 to 75 % of all cases of dementia. The majority of AD appears in a sporadic pattern and seems to result from a complex interplay between environmental and genetic factors. The two cardinal features that characterize AD are the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The amyloid plaques are abnormally folded AB proteins that accumulate extracellularly; on the other hand, and the neurofibrillary tangles are paired helical filaments that contain hyperphosphorylated tau.Most patients with AD complain of gradual progressive impairment in explicit memory, and they may also experience behavioral change, disability, hallucinations, and even seizures. The expected death of AD patients is 8.5 years after the first presentation.

**Transient Global Amnesia (TGA)**

Transient global amnesia (TGA) is a clinical syndrome characterized by the sudden onset of temporary anterograde amnesia lasting no more than 24 hours without any other neurological deficits. TGA affects middle-aged and older adults, occurring in 3.4 to 10.4 per 100000 people. The cause and mechanism of TGA are still unclear, but some research suggests jugular vein valve incompetence as a potential mechanism.

TGA is a clinical diagnosis, relying only on a detailed history and physical examination. Patients with TGA are often brought by someone who witnessed the event because TGA patients are not aware of their problem. On physical examination, TGA patients have normal sensory, motor, and cognitive abilities except for the ability to store new information. Other diagnostic tests like EEG and imaging are not routinely performed unless an alternative diagnosis has been suspected, like epilepsy or transient ischemic attack (TIA).

There is no particular treatment for TGA, as this syndrome is self-limited and temporary. Overall, recurrent TGA is relatively uncommon, although it can happen over the years. Patients with TGA have no increase in long term risk for cerebrovascular events.
