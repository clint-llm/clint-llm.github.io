Transfusion reactions range in frequency from relatively common, (mild allergic and febrile non-hemolytic reactions) to rare (anaphylaxis, acute hemolytic, and sepsis). Fatal adverse events have been reported to occur most commonly with TRALI, and long-term or later adverse events are typically the result of disease transmission.

The severity and incidence vary depending on the type of transfusion reaction, the prevalence of disease in the donor population, and the extent of follow-up care the patient receives. Due to advances in donor screening, improved testing, and automated data systems, the risks and fatalities associated with the transfusion of blood products continue to decrease.
