Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) was initially discovered in blood lymphocytes of adults with lymphoproliferative diseases or AIDS and was labeled human B-lymphotropic virus.  Further research identified HHV-6 in CD4+ lymphocytes and as a member of the herpesviruses.  As it was the sixth herpesvirus isolated, it was then subsequently renamed human herpesvirus 6. Typical of a herpes virus, HHV-6 has been known to establish acute, incessant and permanent infection.

HHV-6 is the collective name for the double-stranded DNA viruses HHV-6A and HHV-6B. HHV-6A and HHV-6B, are officially recognized as distinct viruses instead of variants within the herpesvirus family. While much less is known about HHV-6A, it occurs more frequently in the immunocompromised host. In contrast, research has identified HHV-6B as the etiologic agent of the childhood illness exanthema subitem (roseola infantum).
