Chest radiograph:

- Pulmonary bronchogenic cysts: 

- Sharply defined, solitary, round or oval opacities, usually the lower lobe. They can present as a homogeneous water density, as an air-filled cyst, or with an air-fluid level. Abnormalities in the surrounding lung parenchyma, atelectasis or consolidation may occur and may make the diagnosis more difficult.

- Mediastinal bronchogenic cysts:

- Homogeneous, smooth, solitary, round or ovoid masses usually in the middle mediastinum.

Computed tomography scan:

CT is the investigation of choice. The CT density of bronchogenic cysts is variable from typical water density to high density related to blood, increased calcium content, anthracotic pigment, or increased protein content of the fluid.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):

Magnetic resonance imaging is better than CT scan at delineating anatomic relations and the definition of the cyst. The MRI appearance depends on the cyst’s content. On T1-weighted images, the intrinsic signal intensity varies from low to high, depending on the cyst contents. T2-weighted images show high signal intensity. Enhancement after contrast injection is frequently absent.
