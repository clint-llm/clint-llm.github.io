Several factors should be considered regarding pediatric bone anatomy and physiology. Pediatric bones are unlike adult bones. The epiphysis is the growth plate of the bone, is open, closing with time, and is a common fracture location. During development, the epiphysis is weaker than surrounding ligaments, which results in vulnerability to fracture. The porous nature of pediatric bones allows for unique fracture patterns, such as Greenstick fractures and buckle (or torus) fractures and bowing deformities in response to injury.
