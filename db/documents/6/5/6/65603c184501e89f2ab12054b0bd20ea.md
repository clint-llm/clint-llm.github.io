The function of each structure involved in the swallow summarizes into two main themes: propulsion of the bolus toward the stomach and protection of the airway. The oral preparatory stage begins when food or liquid is consumed through diet and enters the oral cavity. When drinking liquids, the posterior tongue rises to meet the soft palate to ensure a proper seal, preventing leakage of liquid oral cavity contents into the oropharynx before the swallow initiates voluntarily.Â  This seal does not form between the palate and tongue during the mastication of solid foods, and therefore free communication between the oral cavity and oropharynx is preserved. Immediately before the initiation of a swallow, the anterior tongue rises to meet the hard palate as the posterior tongue drops and opens the oropharynx. The bolus is then propelled down the palate by the tongue toward the oropharynx; this is the oral propulsive stage. Contrast this with consuming liquids as the pharyngeal stage begins throughout the oral propulsive stage. The first irreversible step in swallowing, the pharyngeal stage, occurs next and is categorized by a rapid phase of muscle contraction to propel the bolus through the upper esophageal sphincter and into the esophagus. This stage starts when the consumed bolus makes its way to the palatoglossal arch.
