Managing exercise-induced laryngeal obstructionÂ requires a multidisciplinary approach. Typically, the team consists of otolaryngologists, pulmonologists, speech pathologists, and psychologists.

Referral to speech pathology for respiratory retraining therapy is considered the first-line in managing EILO. Breathing techniques may vary; this is combined with behavioral therapy, reassurance, and teaching of respiratory mechanics, and sometimes biofeedback.

Supraglottoplasty is considered in refractory cases, especially when supraglottic structures are involved.

Bronchodilators or other inhaled therapies have no role in EILO management. These therapies can help if asthma coexists.
