Early lung development divides into organogenesis and fetal lung development. Fetal lung development further stratifies into pseudoglandular, canalicular, and saccular stages. These stages are not discrete and display overlapping characteristics with one another. Morphological distinctions are the main distinguishing factors separating the individual developmental stages.

The main airways and pleura form during the embryonic stages at weeks 4-7. Formation of the bronchial tree continues into weeks 5-17, during the pseudoglandular stage.Â  During this stage the respiratory buds are growing outward and dividing into the adjacent mesenchymal tissues, giving rise to future respiratory channels. The theorized cause of bronchial atresia occurs during one of these early stages of lung formation.

Pathologically, the diagnosis of bronchial atresia is made based on the macroscopic findings. These being mucus plugging of the prominent alveoli and the involved airways. There are usually no acute or chronic inflammatory changes associated with bronchial atresia unless concomitant infection occurs.
