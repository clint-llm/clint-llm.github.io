Myopia develops in the early to middle childhood years and continues to early adulthood. Most children are born hyperopic. Then, closer to the age of 5-8, they experience a shift in their refraction through a process termed emmetropisation. After this process, the cornea stabilizes but increases in axial length lead to progressive myopia.
