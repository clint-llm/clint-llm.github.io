Neurogenic shock is a devastating consequence of spinal cord injury (SCI) that can manifest as hypotension, bradyarrhythmia, and temperature dysregulation. It is associated with cervical and high thoracic spine injury. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of neurogenic shock and highlights the interprofessional team's role in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of neurogenic shock.
- Describe the presentation of neurogenic shock.
- Summarize the treatment options for the neurogenic shock.
- Explain the importance of cooperation among interprofessional team members in monitoring affected patients and improving outcomes for those with neurogenic shock.
