By definition, a Richter hernia is a herniation of only a portion of the circumference of the bowel wall through the fascial defect. Most commonly, it is the anti-mesenteric portion of the bowel. These hernias often develop in small fascial defects. The defect must be large enough for a portion of the bowel to protrude through but not large enough to accommodate the entire circumference of the bowel. In many cases, the segment of bowel involved is a segment of the terminal ileum.

The ensuing process results from the incarceration of a portion of the bowel wall. Incarceration of the intestine can lead to strangulation of the blood supply to that portion of the bowel followed by edema and venous congestion, leading to rapid segmental ischemia and gangrene with a reported incidence of necrosis of 69% at the time of operative intervention.
