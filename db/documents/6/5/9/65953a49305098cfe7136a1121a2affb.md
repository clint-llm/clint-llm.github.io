Due to the widespread misuse of prescription opioids in recent years, the CDC previously released explicit practice recommendations for primary care clinicians who prescribe opioids for chronic pain. The CDC later released a statement clarifying that their guidelines for prescribing opioids intended to guide primary care practitioners treating patients with “chronic pain outside of active cancer treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care.''

Pain should be assessed, quantified, and documented often. The FDA’s definition of opioid tolerance can help the clinician distinguish opioid naïve patients from opioid-tolerant patients. The WHO’s analgesic ladder can be employed and supplemented with analgesic adjuvant therapy with agents such as NSAIDs, corticosteroids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and ketamine.
