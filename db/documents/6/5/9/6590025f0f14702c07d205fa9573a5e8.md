In surgery, knowledge of the anatomy of the forearm nerves is crucial when it comes to repairing or reconstructing boney or muscular defects. Proper technique and understanding of structures in the forearm help ensure no motor or sensory damage occurs. Some common procedures done to the forearm are ORIF of fractures, osteotomy, tendon repair, and carpal tunnel release. When surgically approaching the forearm through a volar approach, the internervous plane is a landmark to help guide dissection. The proximal internervous plane lies between the brachioradialis muscle and the pronator teres muscle. Distally, the internervous plane lies between the brachioradialis muscle and the flexor carpi radialis muscle.
