Removal from the water will reverse the hydrostatic effect of immersion decreasing filling pressures. Keeping swimmers or divers warm after removal from the water will decrease vasoconstriction and central blood pooling. Patients should be kept upright if they are conscious. For most, a full recovery can be seen within 1-2 days with rest, normobaric oxygen for hypoxemia, and/or beta-mimetic therapy.
