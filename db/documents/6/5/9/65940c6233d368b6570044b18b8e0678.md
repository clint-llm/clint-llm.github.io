A history of hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reaction is an absolute contraindication to the use of pancuronium.

Renal disease is a relative contraindication to the use of pancuronium, especially with other available NMBDs, which have decreased or absent renal clearance, such as rocuronium, vecuronium, and cisatracurium.

The use of pancuroniumÂ should merit careful consideration in cardiac dysfunction and myocardial disease due to concerns for myocardial ischemia, ventricular ectopy, and cardiovascular collapse secondary to vagolytically mediated tachycardia.
