Each respiratory cycle begins with inspiration and ends with expiration. During inspiration, the diaphragm and the external intercostals contract, causing enlargement of the thoracic cavity. As a result, intra-pleural pressure decreases, and so does alveolar pressure, forcing the lungs to expand and air to move in. However, expiration occurs passively when the diaphragm relaxes, owing to the lungs' elastic properties. The respiratory control system drives respiratory cycles and consists of three components: the central neural respiratory generator, the sensory input system, and the muscular effector system.

The rate and strength at which the diaphragm contracts, hence the frequency and volume of respiration, depend heavily on the firing pattern of pacemaker cells in the brainstem. On the other hand, the sensory input system sends signals to the brain to modulate respiratory patterns depending on metabolic demand. Together, these processes aim to optimize the lungs' function of taking in oxygen from the air and expelling carbon dioxide from the body.
