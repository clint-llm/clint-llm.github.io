Radiological evaluation is not indicated upon initial presentation of low back pain because of its self-limiting nature. However, serious conditions such as tumor or infection should be ruled out with a high-quality history and physical examination. Should the back pain not respond to conservative management then plain x-rays, including oblique views and lateral flexion-extension views, may be used to assess the bony quality and alignment of the lumbar spine as well as any dynamic instability. Should the initial presentation also consist of radicular symptoms or symptoms of neurogenic claudication, then the neural elements must be evaluated with an MRI or CT myelogram of the lumbar spine.

The degree of slippage is best characterized on the lateral x-ray.  An oblique view x-ray of the lumbar spine is a good tool to assess the pars defect.  CT Scan of the lumbar spine is the definitive study to assess the pars defect. MRI is the study of choice for evaluation of soft tissue structures including intervertebral discs, ligamentum flavum, the thecal sac, nerve roots, and the conus medullaris in the lumbar spine. MRI is needed for patients who fail conservative treatments and are planning a surgical intervention.
