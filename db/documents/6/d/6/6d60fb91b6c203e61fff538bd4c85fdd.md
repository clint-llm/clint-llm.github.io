The timely performance of a BKA can be both life-saving in severe illness or trauma and restorative through improving function with an appropriate prosthesis. For instance, many patients with severe non-healing foot ulcers have difficulty ambulating and can regain function by removing the infected limb and fitting for a prosthesis.

Similarly, patients with chronic pain from lower extremity trauma may undergo a BKA as a palliative or similarly functional measure, often with satisfactory results. It is important to note that an individual's metabolic demands with ambulation will rise significantly after a BKA, although this depends partly on the postoperative maintenance of lower extremity muscle strength.

Therefore, for frail or elderly patients, this procedure must be undertaken in conjunction with nutritional guidance and an overall discussion of patient health and mobility. Additionally, the long-term clinical survival of BKA patients is notably poor in specific populations; patients with end-stage diabetes mellitus who receive a BKA for foot ulcers have been shown to have an average postoperative life expectancy of around three years.
