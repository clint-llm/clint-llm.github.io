Proper guidelines exist to guide out-of-hospital management. For diphenhydramine and dimenhydrinate, any ingestion under 7.5 mg/kg in children under the age of 6 and less than 300 mg or 7.5 mg/kg for adults and older children, at-home observation is appropriate. If these prove inadequate, prompt evaluation to the closest emergency department is needed. Initially, management should include constant cardiac monitoring and initiation of IV access. Activated charcoal (AC) administration may be indicated, especially if the patient presents shortly after the substance's ingestion. It may be tempting to initiate attempts to increase renal elimination, but due to antihistaminic extensive protein binding and a large volume of distribution, these attempts will be in vain.
