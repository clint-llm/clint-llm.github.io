- **Cystic Fibrosis**
- Men with complaints of infertility, who have congenital obstructive azoospermia, and evidence of bilateral absence of the vas deferens should be further evaluated for cystic fibrosis (CF). While Young syndrome should be suspected in middle-aged male patients, who present with complaints of infertility, the median age for the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is 6-8 months. The exact causality of Young syndrome has not been well-established yet, and environmental factors, including past exposure to mercury, or genetic factors, are considered suspicious causalities. On the other hand, several well-established mutations in the CF Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene are present in up to four-fifths of men with congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens.  Therefore, gene sequencing, and specifically request a test for the 5-thymidine (5T)allele of CFTR, would be requested for further diagnostic purposes.

- **Kartagener Syndrome**
- KS is categorized as a rare cause of male infertility, which is characterized by multi-organ clinical presentations, including bronchiectasis, sinusitis, and a subset of situs inversus, called situs inversus totalis (SIT). Patients with KS often are complicated with episodes of respiratory tract infection and acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis. Moreover, a sub-group of male patients with KS also present with infertility due to dyskinesia of the spermatozoa.****
