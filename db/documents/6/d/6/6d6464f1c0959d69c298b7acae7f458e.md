The muscle has its origin from the inferior surface of the palatine aponeurosis. It descends along with the muscle of the contralateral side in an inferior, forward, and lateral direction anterior to the palatine tonsil and gets inserted into the posterolateral surface of the tongue. Some fibers of the muscle spread over the dorsal surface of the tongue while the other fibers pass deep into the substance of the tongue and intermingle with one of the intrinsic muscles of the tongue (transverses linguae).

In comparison to the other palatal muscles, the palatoglossus muscle is relatively small. The muscle separates the superior part of the tonsil from the “supratonsillar fat.”
