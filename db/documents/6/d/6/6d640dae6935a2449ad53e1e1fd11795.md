The disease subtype is one of the strongest prognostic predictors in systemic mastocytosis.

Certain clinical features are associated with an increased risk of death due to disease progression, independent of the category of systemic mastocytosis present. These features include the following:

- Low platelet count (less than 150 × 10/l)

- Low serum albumin (under 35 g/L)

- Low hemoglobin levels (less than 100 g/L or red blood cell transfusion dependence)

- Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)

- Older age at onset of systemic symptoms (age over 60)

- High alkaline phosphatase

- Hepatosplenomegaly

- Ascites

- Excess bone marrow blasts

- Weight loss

- ASXL1 mutation
