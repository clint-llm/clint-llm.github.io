**FDA-approved Indications**

- Raloxifene is an FDA-approved second-generation selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), a drug with an estrogen-agonistic effect on bone, increasing bone mineral density and mass by decreasing bone resorption. It is indicated in the treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

- Raloxifene is also indicated for the risk reduction of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women, demonstrating a high risk for invasive breast cancer or women with osteoporosis. The definition of high breast cancer risk is one or more first-degree relatives with breast cancer, or at least one breast biopsy showing lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), or atypical hyperplasia, or a 5-year predicted breast cancer risk of more than 1.66%.

- Studies are underway on raloxifene as an adjuvant treatment for postmenopausal women with schizophrenia. It shows particularly promising results in mild presentations of schizophrenia.
