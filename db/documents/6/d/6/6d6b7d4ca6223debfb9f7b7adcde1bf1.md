The goal of management is the prevention of lethal arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes (TdP). As described earlier, the longer the QT interval, the higher the risk is for torsade de pointes. A patient who is hemodynamically unstable should receive non-synchronized electrical defibrillation. Also, first-line treatment is magnesium sulfate, and the benefit is seen independent of serum magnesium level. In those who do not respond to magnesium sulfate, temporary transvenous overdrive pacing should be considered. Isoproterenol and Class IB antiarrhythmic drugs, such as lidocaine and phenytoin may also be used.

For long-term management in congenital Long QT syndrome, beta-blockers are the first line choice, and they help prevent ventricular arrhythmias by stabilizing ventricular action potential and helping block sympathetic surges associated with arrhythmias. An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is recommended in patients with Long QT syndrome who were resuscitated from a cardiac arrest. It is also indicated in those whom have beta-blocker resistant symptoms or have contraindications to beta-blockers. It also may be indicated in asymptomatic individuals who are suspected to be at high risk for ventricular arrhythmias.
