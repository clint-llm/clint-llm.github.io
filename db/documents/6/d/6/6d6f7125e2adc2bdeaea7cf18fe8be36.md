OHs are typically diagnosed in children, and the majority of these lesions will involute over time. Primary clinicians have a key role in reassuring patients, and their parents, about the benign nature of OHs and maintaining regular follow-up appointments for monitoring. If medical therapy is initiated, pharmacists will be helpful in providing education about drug side effects. If sclerotherapy or surgical resection is required, interventional radiologists or oral and maxillofacial surgeons, respectively, will be involved to assess patients as surgical candidates, provide information about the risks and benefits of these procedures, and provide post-procedural monitoring and education.
