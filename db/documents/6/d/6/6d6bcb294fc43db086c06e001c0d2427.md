Lattice corneal dystrophy is an inherited disease of the eye characterized by amyloid deposits, corneal opacification, and recurrent corneal epithelial erosions.

Type II LCD is not corneal dystrophy, but systemic amyloidosis.

The symptoms of LCD can be treated with penetrating keratoplasty, DALK, PTK, FLK, and FALK, and has a good prognosis.
