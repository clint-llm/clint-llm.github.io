Brown recluse spider bites usually occur while indoors and as a defense mechanism as they are crushed or rolled over in bed. Some bites will present with only an urticarial rash. If the bite is more severe, the course usually is as follows.  The initial bite will be painless, but over the subsequent two to eight hours it will become increasingly painful. Systemic symptoms of brown recluse venom can present as malaise, nausea, headache, and myalgias. In children, the systemic reaction is more severe and may also include weakness, fever, joint pain, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, organ failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, seizures, and death.

The bite site may initially have two small puncture wounds with surrounding erythema. From there, the center of the bite will become paler as the outer edge becomes red and edematous; this relates to vasospasm which will cause the pain to become more severe. Over the next few days, a blister will form, and the center of the ulcer will turn a blue/violet color with a hard, stellate, sunken center. After this step, skin sloughing can occur, and the wound will eventually heal by secondary intention, but this can take several weeks.
