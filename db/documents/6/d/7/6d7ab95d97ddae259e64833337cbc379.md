The nerve that is involved in opening and closing the mouth is the trigeminal nerve. This nerveÂ innervates the muscles used for mastication. The lips are only involved because the muscle around the lips is a sphincter used for eating and speaking. The muscle that is around the lips is the orbicularis oris; this muscle acts as a sphincter muscle. The orbicularis oris muscle receives innervation from the facial nerve. The facial nerve also innervates muscles that attach to or close to the lips used in facial expression.
