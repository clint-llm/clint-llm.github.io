The embryological origin and development of the ligament system are still under analysis. Given its integral association with musculoskeletal anatomy, the belief is that precursor cells within the ligament primordia initially develop independently but later integrate to form a single functioning joint.Gdf5/Gdf6, and alpha-5-beta-1 integrin.ScleraxisÂ to be a marker of ligament development, though further analysis of its expression requires examination.

The embryological leaflet involved is the mesoderm.
