Adalimumab is a fully human, high-affinity, recombinant immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-TNF alpha monoclonal antibody. It is a molecule comprising 1330 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 148 kDa.

It does not affect or bind to other cytokines like lymphotoxin or interleukins. Its efficacy in various types of arthritis owes to its potent osteogenic action. TNF mediates activation of NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) ligand (RANKL) receptors on stromal or osteoblast cells. TNF blockade thus inhibits subsequent destruction of cartilage and bone. TNF also plays a role in osteoclast maturation and activation, which remains in check with TNF blockade. Anti-TNF agents also downregulate serum matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 3 (MMP-1 and MMP-3). All of these factors contribute to the efficacy of TNF inhibitors in the treatment of arthritis.
