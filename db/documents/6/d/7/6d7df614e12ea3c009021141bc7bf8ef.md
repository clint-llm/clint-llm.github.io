OAS responds to treatment within 48 to 72 hours once therapy is initiated. An accurate diagnosis of the etiology and instituting prompt specific treatment determines the prognosis of patients with OAS. A subset of patients with Tolosoa-Hunt syndrome may relapse, present with residual neurological deficits, and may need immunosuppressants. The presence of orbital apex syndrome in a patient with primary or secondary neoplasms and hematological malignancies may indicate a poor chance of survival.
