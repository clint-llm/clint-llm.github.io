The sphenoid is just one of the twenty-two bones that form the skull and essentially helps to connect the neurocranium to the facial skeleton. It is a single bone in the midline of the cranial cavity situated posterior to the frontal bone but anterior to the occipital. Its name derives from the Greek 'sphenoeides,' which means wedge-shaped. It has several foramina and fissures present in its surface that allow the entry and exit of nerves and blood vessels to and from the cranial cavity. Shaped like a butterfly or a bat, it has a central body and two lateral wings on either side. It is one of the bones that make up the orbit, in particular, forming the posterior surface. The articulations of the sphenoid are with the frontal, parietal, ethmoid, zygomatic, temporal, occipital, palatine, and vomer bones. There may be several morphological variations in the relationship between the sphenoid, the ethmoid, and the frontal bone. Together, these give rigidity and stability to the skull making it the ideal place to house the brain.
