The nail matrix is a crescent-shaped structure at the base of the nail, which produces the nail plate. Damage to the matrix may lead to scarring and dystrophy of the nail. The matrix is divided into proximal and distal; the proximal matrix is responsible for producing the superficial nail plate, while the distal matrix is responsible for the inferior nail plate. Biopsy of the distal matrix is less likely to produce scarring. The subcutaneous tissue inferior to the nail plate is quite thin, making it easy to reach the bone of the distal phalange. The extensor tendon of each digit is estimated to be approximately 12 mm proximal from the nail cuticle and, therefore, unlikely to be damaged during a routine biopsy.

The nail unit receives its arterial supply from the proper digital arteries that run along with the digits on the medial and lateral aspects. The venous system predominately mirrors the course of the arterial supply. The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th nail digits are innervated by the volar proper digital nerves, while the 1st and 5th nail digits are innervated by the dorsal proper digital nerves.
