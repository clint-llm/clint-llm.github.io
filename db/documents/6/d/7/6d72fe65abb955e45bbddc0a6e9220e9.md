A number of historical factors have been associated with an increased or decreased incidence of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. For example, the presence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS), specifically greater than 3 in a year, are associated with 10 and 15-fold risk increases for SUDEP, respectively.

Few factors are strongly associated with a lowered odds ratio for SUDEP. Two such factors include the presence of another individual in the bedroom who could act as an observer, as well as the use of a monitor/listening device in the room of the child or adult at risk for SUDEP.

The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) 2017 Practice Guidelines on SUDEP studied over 20 other risk factors for SUDEP, including sex, age of seizure onset, a specific type, dose and duration of antiepileptic drug usage, type of epilepsy, comorbid medical and psychologic disorders, imaging and EEG characteristics. None of these were strongly associated with an increased or decreased risk for SUDEP.

Additional SUDEP risk factors under investigation include the time of day during which the seizure occurs, as well as physiologic changes that occur during different times of the day and body position (prone vs. supine).
