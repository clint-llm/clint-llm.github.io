Selection of appropriate antibiotic regimens requires an interprofessional team approach involving physicians and nurses (particularly those with specialized infectious disease backgrounds), pharmacists, and primary care physicians. Further, consultation and coordination with an infectiousÂ disease specialist are usually necessary. [Level 5] Empirical antibiotic therapy is recommended if the suspicion of endocarditis is high; once culture results are obtained, the antibiotic selection can target the sensitivity of the organism.

In general, the nurse practitioner or physician assistant will manage the empirical antibiotic selection and coordinate with the physician regarding antibiotic prophylaxis coverage. The pharmacist will review the selection, allergies, and indications to determine appropriate coverage. If there is a concern, the pharmacist should report back to the clinical team a need for an alternative selection. The medical team will need to monitor the patient for signs of endocarditis development and report back to the team leader as issues develop.

Management of antibiotic regimens for infective endocarditis is best achieved with an interprofessional team involving physicians, infectious disease experts, specialty-trained nursing staff, and pharmacists all collaborating to manage the cases to an optimal patient outcome.
