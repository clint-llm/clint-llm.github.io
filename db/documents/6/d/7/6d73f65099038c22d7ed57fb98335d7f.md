Baker's cysts tend to occur most commonly in adults aged 35 to 70 and most often are associated with inflammatory joint diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, or as a result of overuse or injury to the knee. As they are asymptomatic, Baker's cysts are most often detected incidentally on physical examination or imaging studies (e.g., MRI in an adult with suspected osteoarthritis or internal abnormalities of the knee). Prevalence typically increases with age, most likely due to the increase in knee-bursal communication with age.

In children, Baker's Cysts tend to occur most frequently in those aged 4 to 7 years.
