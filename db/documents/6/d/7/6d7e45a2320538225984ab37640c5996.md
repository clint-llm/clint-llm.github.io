A knee dislocation is a potentially devastating injury and is often a surgical emergency. This injury requires prompt identification, evaluation with appropriate imaging, and consultation with surgery for definitive treatment. Vascular injury and compartment syndrome are dreaded complications that should not be missed in the workup of a knee dislocation. This is in distinct contrast to patellar dislocations, which generally do not require immediate surgical or vascular intervention. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of knee dislocation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for those with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanisms of injury and pathophysiology of knee dislocation injuries.
- Summarize the diagnostic procedure for evaluating knee dislocations, including any necessary diagnostic imaging.
- Review the treatment and rehabilitative options for knee dislocation injuries.
- Describe how an optimally functioning interprofessional team would coordinate care to enhance outcomes for patients with knee dislocations.
