The treatment of magnesium toxicity begins with the discontinuation of all magnesium-containing supplements and medication. In severe cases, intravenous calcium gluconate can be used to displace and neutralize the effects of magnesium. However, definitive treatment requires a reduction of magnesium levels within the body. In patients with normal kidney function, thisÂ is achievable through intravenous diuretics. For patients with impaired kidney function, dialysis treatment is necessary.
