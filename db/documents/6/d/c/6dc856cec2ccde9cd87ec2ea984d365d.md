The psychiatrist generally prescribes lithium, but the drug levels are often monitored by the primary care provider, mental health nurse, pharmacist, and the internist, functioning as an interprofessional team. Lithium continues to be a first-line treatment option for mood stabilization. When prescribed, the pharmacist should carefully inspect the dosing and perform medication reconciliation, so avoid any issues with dosing and subsequent serum levels. Mental health nurses should be alert to the signs and symptoms of lithium toxicity and report such to the prescriber immediately if these are present. It is essential to maintain coordination of care in patients on /lithium therapy owing to its narrow therapeutic index and potential adverse effects and toxicity.

Every patient on lithium needs close monitoring; if the patient is unlikely to comply with followup, clinicians should not prescribe them the drug; this is where the interprofessional team paradigm is most effective. [Level 5]
