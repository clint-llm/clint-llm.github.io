A thorough discussion with a patient prior to the procedure includes the following:

- A detailed explanation of the procedure

- The expected level of discomfort

- A thorough evaluation of the skin entry site

- Prior medical conditions or surgeries that might affect the procedure, to include joint prosthesis

- Potential diagnoses resulting from the procedure

- Potential complications of the procedure

Prior to beginning the fluoroscopic procedure, appropriate lead aprons are worn by all personnel involved. The patient is placed in a comfortable supine position. The patient's lower extremity is placed in either neutral position or is slightly internally rotated to around 10 degrees. Small weights can be placed lateral to both feet to limit motion and to maintain a neutral leg position throughout the procedure. A brief fluoroscopic image is obtained with a metallic marker stick overlying the lateral aspect of the femoral head-neck junction in order for the operator to visualize and plan the proposed needle trajectory. The skin is then marked at the proposed site of entry.
