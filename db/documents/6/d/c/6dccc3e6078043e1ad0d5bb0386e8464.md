Diphtheria is a toxin-mediated infection caused by Corynebacterium species, primarily Corynebacterium diphtheria. It causes skin and mucosal infection and can rarely cause focal infection after bacteremia. The manifestations of C. diphtheria infection are influenced by the anatomic site of infection, the immune status of the host, and the production and systemic distribution of toxin. This activity outlines the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of this highly contagious disease and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the pathogenesis of diphtheria.
- Describe the clinical findings and laboratory investigations required to diagnose diphtheria.
- Summarize the treatment options available for managing a case of diphtheria.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members including infectious disease specialists, pediatricians, providers, and anesthesiologists to improve outcomes of patients affected by diphtheria.
