Hydrocephalus is the symptomatic accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inside the cerebral ventricles.

Surgical treatment with a ventricular shunt placement is the first treatment option. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) and choroid plexus cauterization are possible options in suitable forms of hydrocephalus. Acute hydrocephalus without prompt treatment can result in brain herniation and death. In children, hydrocephalus has a mortality rate of 0 to 3% depending on the duration of the follow-up.
