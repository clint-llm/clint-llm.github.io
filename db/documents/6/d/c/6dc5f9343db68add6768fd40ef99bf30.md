Pyrin, 781 amino acid protein, is believed to be involved in the pathophysiology of FMF. Pyrin is mainly found in the cytoskeleton of the circulation cells, including the white blood cells. White blood cells are responsible for mounting an immune response to pathogens. The exact structure and function of pyrin protein and its role in creating an inflammatory response in FMF are still not completely understood. One central hypothesis is that the pyrin binds to an apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) and caspase-1. This inhibits activation of IL-1beta (interleukin) and hence, the inflammatory pathways. Mutation of MEFV genes disrupts pyrin protein and its function, which leads to activation of IL-1beta and then theÂ entire inflammatory pathway.
