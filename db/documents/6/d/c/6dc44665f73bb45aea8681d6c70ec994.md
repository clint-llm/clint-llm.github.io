Parapnuemonic effusions and empyemas may result in pleural thickening leading to trapped lung, recurrent pneumonia, bloodstream infections if not adequately evacuated. Malignant effusions may also lead to pleural thickening and fibrosis which may result in restrictive lung disease. Pulmonary emboli may lead to pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to chronic dyspnea, exertional intolerance, or hypoxemia. Pulmonary emboli may also lead to death or prolonged hospitalization if not treated in a timely manner.
