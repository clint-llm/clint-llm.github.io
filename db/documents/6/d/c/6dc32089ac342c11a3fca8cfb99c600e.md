Disease severity is variable. A patient may survive for years with presenting symptoms, recover fully, or deteriorate into comatose state and decease. It is hypothesized that incomplete lesions with relative sparing of the superior commissure fibers are associated with better prognosis when compared with lesions extending into the convolution white matter. Extracallosal lesions, cerebral lobe impairment, severe disturbance of consciousness, and heavy alcohol consumption are associated with poor prognosis and/or severe dementia. Early diagnosis and effective treatment are therefore important to the patient’s recovery, and serial MRI has demonstrated some cases of complete disappearance of lesions with early diagnosis and treatment
