The main adverse event to be hypervigilant for in patients with acute lacunar infarctions is a hemorrhagic transformation or adverse bleeding events after IV alteplase therapy. Close monitoring with frequent neurologic exams and a high degree of suspicion can prevent these devastating events.

Preventative treatment is generally well tolerated. However, patients should be notified that there is an increased risk of bleeding on long-term antiplatelet therapy. Side effects of antihypertensive therapy, such as orthostatic hypotension and an increased risk of falls, should also be explained to the patient. No data exists that lacunar infarct patients are at increased risk of statin myopathy over the general population. These medications should be prescribed at the lowest therapeutic dose.
