Relapsing fever is treated with doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for seven to ten days. In pregnant women and children under eight years of age, penicillin or erythromycinÂ are the preferred agents due to the concern of dental staining with doxycycline use. It is important to observe patients for several hours after initiation of antibiotic therapy, as Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is common. Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is a flu-like response to the release of inflammatory contents from within the bacteria after lysis by antibiotics. It is rarely fatal and managed with supportive care. This reaction is more common in adolescents than in younger children.

Improving the patient's nutritional status can go a long way in improving patient outcomes. Borrelia infections may also be self-limited and resolve without treatment in some cases.
