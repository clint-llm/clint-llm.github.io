Trichodysplasia spinulosa is a rare dermatologic condition characterized by painless erythematous papules on the face with folliculocentric keratin spines. This condition is unique to patients with trichodysplasia spinulosa-associated polyomavirus (TSPyV) in the setting of immunosuppression.

The first report of this condition was in 1995, described as a disseminated follicular spiny hyperkeratosis, thought to be a side effect of cyclosporin.

Subsequent case reports clarified that an immunosuppressed state, as opposed to cyclosporin specifically, is the common thread between patients with this condition. In 1999, trichodysplasia spinulosa was formally named as such with the discovery of its viral etiology, which in 2010 was characterized as a novel polyomavirus and aptly named trichodysplasia spinulosa-associated polyomavirus.
