As previously mentioned, all three major salivary glands are composed of either serous, mucous acini, or a combination of both. While the parotid gland is the largest of the three, all glands function to produce saliva to moisturize the mouth and assist in the breakdown of carbohydrates in the mouth. The submandibular gland is the primary source of basal saliva secretion, while the parotid gland is the main source of stimulated saliva secretion.****The submandibular gland releases saliva through its main duct, Wharton’s duct, while the parotid gland and sublingual gland utilize Stensen’s duct and Bartholin’s duct respectively. Salivary glands also play a crucial immunologic role as their secretions contain many immunoglobins, namely IgA, that help fight bacteria and other foreign antigens in the oropharyngeal environment.
