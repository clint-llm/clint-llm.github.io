PCM is the most common disease entity in this category because it is symptomatic and well-studied. PCM comprises about 1% of malignant tumors, 10% to 15% of hematopoietic neoplasms, and causes up to 20% of the deaths in the hematologic malignancies category. PCM is a disease of older adults (greater than 50 yrs.), with a median age at diagnosis of 66 years. There is increased risk in males and African Americans. Non-Ig-M monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance is a PCM precursor disease and presents in up to 4% of plasma cell neoplasms
