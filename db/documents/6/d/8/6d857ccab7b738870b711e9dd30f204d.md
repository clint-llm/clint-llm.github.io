Brainstem surgery may be necessary in cases of brainstem glioma and other tumors. These lesions can result in obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow and obstructive hydrocephalus. Tumor size and location are considered in determining whether a patient is an operative candidate and in selecting the surgical approach.

In cases of Arnold-Chiari malformations, a posterior fossa decompression surgery can be performed to make space for the brainstem and cerebellum. Brainstem access can be approached in many different ways depending on the desired exposure point. Some of these approaches include suboccipital, subtemporal, interhemispheric, transoral, and more. Any surgical procedure has inherent risk, and care must be taken during brainstem surgery not to damage the CNS and overlying structures while obtaining access.
