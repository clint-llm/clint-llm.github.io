Complications of congenital adrenal hyperplasia are common. If the patient does not get enough glucocorticoids, he or she can developÂ adrenal insufficiency and further virilization in the virilizing forms. If a patient receives excessive glucocorticoids, he or she can develop growth failure, obesity, striae, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and cataracts.

The complications of excess mineralocorticoid administration include hypertension and hypokalemia.

Aldosterone deficiency may lead to salt wasting with consequent failure to thrive, hypovolemia, and shock.
