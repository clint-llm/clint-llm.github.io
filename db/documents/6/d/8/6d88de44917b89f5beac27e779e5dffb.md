Management of endometrial cancer and its precursor lesions depends upon the histotype and differentiation (see above: Etiology), extent of disease and status of the patient. The extent of endometrial carcinoma is surgically-pathologically classified, or "staged," according to International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) criteria published in 2009 as:

Stage I:* Tumor confined to the corpus uteri

- IA: No invasion or invasion into less than half of the myometrium

- IB: Invasion equal into or more than half of the myometrium

Stage II:*  Tumor invades cervical stroma but does not extend beyond the uterus

Stage III:*  Local and/or regional spread of tumor

- IIIA: Tumor invades the serosa or corpus and/or adnexa

- IIIB: Vaginal and/or parametrial involvement

- IIIC: Metastases to pelvic and/or para-aortic nodes

- IIIC1: Positive pelvic nodes

- IIIC2: Positive para-aortic nodes with or without pelvic nodes

Stage IV:* Tumor invades bladder and/or bowel mucosa or distant metastases

- IVA: Tumor invasion of bladder and/or bowel mucosa

- IVB: Distant metastases, including intra-abdominal and/or inguinal nodes

*Includes FIGO Grades 1, 2, or 3 (see above: Etiology);  Endocervical glandular involvement on is Stage I. Positive peritoneal cytology is reported separately without changing stage.

Although positive peritoneal cytology does not change FIGO staging, this finding is associated with other factors that portend a poor prognosis.

It is important to understand that staging is a means of coding and reporting the extent of disease and not a formula for managing endometrial cancer. Current FIGO classification by stage depends upon both surgical and pathological findings. Generally, preinvasive neoplastic lesions are diagnosed clinically and pathologically without resort to surgery. Sometimes, it is necessary to clinically and pathologically "stage" cancers when surgery is incomplete or precluded because of co-morbidity or other forbidding reasons.
