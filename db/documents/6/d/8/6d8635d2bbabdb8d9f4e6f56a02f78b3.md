**Opioids**

The second and the third step of the World Health Organization's step ladder includes opioids for pain management.

**Cannabinoids**

Cannabis is not approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is considered an illicit drug by the US drug enforcement agency (DEA). However, still, several US states permit its use in certain medical conditions.

Studies have shown that MC helps reduce the opioid dosage for patients being treated for non-cancer pain. It is also substituted in place of opioids to produce the therapeutic effect.
