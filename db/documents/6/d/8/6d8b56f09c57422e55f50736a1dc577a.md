The creation of fistulas is part of the long-term planning of access for hemodialysis in patients with ESRD. an interprofessional approach manages the planning, creation, and maintenance of the fistula. Before a fistula is planned the dialysis nurse should visit the patient and place a sign on the bed that the hand should not be used for phlebotomy or blood pressure measurement. The patient should be educated to refuse all healthcare workers access to the arm- this is done to protect the arm veins. In addition, the surgeon should examine the patient to determine the type and quality of the cephalic vein. If the vein is not visualized, an ultrasoundÂ may be required to map the vein and document its size. In all cases, the fistula should first be attempted by the autogenous vein.
