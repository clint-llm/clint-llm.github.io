The diagnosis of hydatidosis can pose some difficulty to the nurse practitioner, internist or primary physician, especially in areas where the disease is not endemic. However, being mindful of the possibility alongside picking up clues from the history should help in guiding the workup and eventually the diagnosis.

Management options should be evaluated based on a patient to patient basis. Infectious disease specialists, surgeons, anesthetists, and potentially interventional radiologists could all weigh in on deciding what could lead to the best outcome for the patient. These physicians, as part of a broader interprofessional team approach, to include nurses and pharmacists can provide for the best potential result. This interprofessional discussion is emphasized in complicated cases or in atypical sites for hydatidosis where the literature is less informative on outcomes. [Level 5]
