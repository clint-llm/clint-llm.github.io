Iodine-based dressing: It is better to be avoided in patients with thyroid problems and pregnant patients.

Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT): wound bed is suspicious for the presence of malignancy, unexplored fistula, untreated osteomyelitis, and the presence of necrotic tissue.

Larval therapy is contraindicated if near a major organ, cavity, or blood vessel, if the wound is too dry, or if the wound is prone to significant bleeding.

Relative contraindications for leech therapy include arterial insufficiency, bleeding tendency, Jehovah's Witness, immunosuppression, diabetic patients, previous allergy to leeches or fluoroquinolone antibiotics, and psychological aversion to leech use.

Hyperbaric oxygen: pneumothorax, severe reactive airway disease, and recent chemotherapy use.
