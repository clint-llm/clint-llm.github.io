Primary surgery is usually curative due to the early stage of the disease and unilateral involvement in most cases. Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy suffices for children and pre-menopausal females since only 2 percent of cases are bilateral at presentation.

If the intraoperative frozen section suggests GCT, then a limited staging procedure is carried out. First, the contralateral ovary is assessed, and it should be biopsied if enlarged. Next, peritoneal washings, infra-colic omentectomy, careful palpation of the peritoneum and retroperitoneal nodes, and biopsy of any suspicious lesions are carried out. Complete cytoreduction is of paramount importance if there is a metastatic disease in the abdomen since these tumors are slow-growing and do not respond well to chemotherapy. If the uterus is left in situ in premenopausal patients, a dilatation and curettage of the uterus should be done to rule out the possibility of co-existing endometrial adenocarcinoma. Pelvic or para-aortic lymphadenectomy is of limited value, particularly in early-stage disease, and is currently not recommended.

Enlarged or suspicious nodes are removed to allow evaluation and to ensure maximal cytoreduction. Rinne et al. reported that fertility-sparing surgery, including unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, and stripping of the pelvic peritoneum, was safe and allowed future pregnancies in women with stage 2B-3C disease. Pregnancy did not appear to be detrimental to disease progression.
