Staging of testicular germ cell tumors is commonly performed using the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor–node–metastasis (TNM) staging; it also includes a serum tumor marker (S) classification.

**Tumor (T) Classification**

- pTX: primary tumor cannot be assessed

- pT0: No evidence of primary tumors

- pTis: germ cell neoplasia in situ

- pT1: tumor limited to the testis (including rete testis invasion) without lymphovascular invasion

- pT1a: tumor <3 cm in size

- pT1b: tumor ≥3 cm in size

- pT2: tumor limited to the testis (including rete testis invasion) with lymphovascular invasion, or tumor invading hilar soft tissue or epididymis or penetrating visceral mesothelial layer covering the external surface of tunica albuginea with or without lymphovascular invasion

- pT3: tumor invades spermatic cord with or without lymphovascular invasion

- pT4: tumor invades scrotum with or without lymphovascular invasion

**Clinical Node (N) Classification (imaging-based)**

- cNX: regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed

- cN0: No clinically enlarged regional lymph nodes

- cN1: Imaging reveals one or more enlarged lymph nodes with no node larger than 2cm in greatest dimension

- cN2: Imaging reveals at least one enlarged lymph node larger than 2cm in greatest dimension but less than 5cm in greatest dimension

- cN3: Imaging reveals at least one enlarged lymph node larger than 5cm in greatest dimension

**Pathologic Node (N) Classification (obtained after retroperitoneal lymph node dissection)**

- pNX: regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed

- pN0: No regional lymph node metastasis

- pN1: metastasis with a lymph node mass ≤2 cm in the greatest dimension and ≤5 nodes positive (none >2 cm in the greatest dimension)

- pN2: metastasis with a lymph node mass >2 cm but not >5 cm in the greatest dimension; or >5 nodes positive (none >5 cm); or evidence of extra-nodal extension of tumor

- pN3: metastasis with a lymph node mass >5 cm in the greatest dimension

**Metastasis (M) Classification**

- M0: no distant metastases

- M1a: nonregional nodal or lung metastases

- M1b: distant metastases other than nonregional nodal or lung

**TNM Descriptors**

p indicates pathological classification. For identification of special cases of TNM or pTNM classifications, the m suffix and y and r prefixes are used. The m suffix indicates the presence of multiple primary tumors in a single site and is recorded in parentheses: pT(m)NM. The y prefix indicates those patients in which classification is performed during or following initial multimodality therapy. The r prefix indicates a recurrent tumor when staged after a documented disease-free interval: rTNM.

**Serum Markers (S)**

- SX: marker studies not available or not performed

- S0: marker study levels within normal limits

- S1: LDH <1.5 × ULN and HCG <5,000 mIU/ml and AFP <1,000 ng/ml

- S2: LDH 1.5–10.0 × ULN or HCG 5,000–50,000 mIU/ml or AFP 1,000 to 10,000 ng/ml

- S3: LDH >10.0 × ULN or HCG >50,000 mIU/ml or AFP >10,000 ng/ml

The S stage is based on post-orchiectomy tumor markers.  For patients undergoing chemotherapy, the S stage should be based on the tumor marker levels on the first day of the first cycle of chemotherapy.

The tables outline various clinical stages.
