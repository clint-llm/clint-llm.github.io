Hypersensitivity to prasugrel or any of the components of the formulation is a contraindication for its use. Other contraindications for starting prasugrel are any pathological bleed or history of transient ischemic attack or stroke. The use of prasugrel is not recommended in patients older than 75 due to the increased risk of bleeding.

Caution is advised when considering prasugrel in moderate to severe renal impairment, severe hepatic impairment, a patient history of GI bleeding or active GI ulcers/disease, and in patients with a history of recent surgery or trauma.

Prasugrel use is contraindicated with the concomitant use of abrocitinib (a Janus-kinase inhibitor), because of the additive effects that can lead to life-threatening bleeding risk. There are many other drugs where caution is advised and may require therapy modification; thorough medication reconciliation is required to limit bleeding risks.
