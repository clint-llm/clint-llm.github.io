Aortic rupture can occur from multiple causes, which include blunt aortic injury resulting from rapid deceleration, penetrating trauma, and spontaneous rupture of thoracic or abdominal aortic aneurysms. Aortic rupture is commonly fatal as blood in the aorta is under very high pressure and can quickly escape the vessel through a tear, resulting in rapid hemorrhagic shock, exsanguination, and death. This activity describes the etiology, evaluation, and management of aortic rupture and describes the need for an interprofessional team approach to improve recognition of aortic rupture and enhance patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the clinical features of patients with aortic rupture.
- Outline the evaluation of aortic rupture.
- Explain the surgical treatment options available for patients with aortic rupture.
- Describe how coordination of the interprofessional team can lead to more rapid diagnosis of aortic rupture and subsequently decrease associated morbidity and mortality in affected patients.
