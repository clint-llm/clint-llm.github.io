Surgeries that involve the nerves that innervate the eyes are done to relieve compressive effects. Compression of nervesÂ that innervate eyes can be present with ocular symptoms, for example, patients that experience hemorrhage strokes. Hemorrhage strokes that cause compression of the oculomotor nerve present as a unilateral blown pupil. The blown pupil can indicate which side the bleeding is on. This technique of diagnosis can be useful when brain imaging is contraindicated or inaccessible. While conditions that affect optic nerve such as compression at the optic chiasm manifest as bitemporal hemianopia. One common condition that causes compression of the optic chiasm is from pituitary tumors or pituitary enlargement. With surgery, the removal of the pituitary tumor or gland can resolve the visual field defects.
