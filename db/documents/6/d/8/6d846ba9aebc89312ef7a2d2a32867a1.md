Pudendal neuralgia caused by pudendal nerve entrapment (PNE) is a chronic and often severely disabling neuropathic pain syndrome.

**Anatomy of the Pudendal Nerve**

The pudendal nerve emerges from the S2, S3, and S4 roots' ventral rami of the sacral plexus. It carries sensory, motor, and autonomic fibers; however, an injury to the pudendal nerve causes more sensory effects than motor. It initially courses between two muscles, the piriformis and coccygeus muscles, then departs the pelvic cavity through the greater sciatic foramen ventral to the sacrotuberous ligament.

**Pudendal Nerve Compression Based on Anatomy**

The pudendal nerve entrapment syndromes are subdivided into four types based on the location of the compression.

- Type I - Entrapment below the piriformis muscle as the pudendal nerve exits the greater sciatic notch.

- Type II - Entrapment between sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments is the most common site of pudendal nerve entrapment.

- Type III - Entrapment in the Alcock canal.

- Type IV -Â  Entrapment of terminal branches.
