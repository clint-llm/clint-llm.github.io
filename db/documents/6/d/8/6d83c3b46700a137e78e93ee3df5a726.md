Rhinocerebral mucormycosis, also called zygomycosis, is a rare disease caused by filamentous fungi involving the nose, paranasal sinuses, and brain. It is an opportunistic pathogen commonly found in immunocompromised individuals. Commonly associated diseases include diabetic ketoacidosis, severe burns, steroid therapy, solid organ transplantation, prolonged corticosteroid therapy, hemochromatosis, patients with HIV, neutropenia, malnutrition, hematologic malignancies, etc. But the absence of predisposing factors does not exclude mucormycosis. This activity reviews the role of the interprofessional team in diagnosing, evaluating, and managing the patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of rhinocerebral mucormycosis.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of rhinocerebral mucormycosis.
- Outline the management options available for rhinocerebral mucormycosis.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of patients with rhinocerebral mucormycosis and improve outcomes.
