Congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction leading to epiphora is a common condition that may be seen in up to 20% of infants. The management ranges from conservative therapy to the Crigler technique fr correction. Moreover, the technique of applying pressure on the lacrimal sac is not well known among clinical providers and warrants review. In this activity, the exact technique is described and presented with illustrations and a video. The aim is to teach the method to physicians, nurses, and technicians so that it may be taught properly to the parents of the child and improve clinical outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the etiology of congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction.
- Review the different outcomes depending upon the techniques used to treat congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction.
- Outline the correct way to perform the Crigler technique for children with congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction.
- Describe the importance of collaboration of pediatricians, primary care physicians, ophthalmologists, and nurses in order to learn the correct technique to treat congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction.
