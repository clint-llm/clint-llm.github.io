Patients with diastasis recti may present with concerns about underlying hernia or other pathology. Some patients may be satisfied with reassurance that there are no risks of complications with untreated diastasis recti. Other patients may desire intervention, and clinicians need to explain the treatment options. As far as long-term or systemic considerations for patients with diastasis recti, the aneurysmal disease has been associated with diastasis recti, most likely due to a linked cause of the weakness of the tissues. However, at this time, there are no guidelines indicating additional screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms or other aneurysms in patients with diastasis recti.
