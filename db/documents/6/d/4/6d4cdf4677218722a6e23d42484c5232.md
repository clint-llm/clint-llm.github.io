Chest pain can be due to non-cardiac causes, non-ischemic cardiac disease, and, finally, ischemic cardiac disease. Non-cardiac causes include gastroesophageal reflux disease, lung disease, musculoskeletal causes, and anxiety/panic attacks. Non-ischemic cardiac causes include pericardial disease. The etiology of chest pain caused by cardiac ischemia is largely accepted to be due to atherosclerosis of coronary arteries and coronary vasospasm.
