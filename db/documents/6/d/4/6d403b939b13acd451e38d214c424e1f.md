Extended exposure to above-normal oxygen partial pressures, or shorter exposures to very high partial pressures, can cause oxidative damage to cell membranes leading to the collapse of the alveoli in the lungs.  Pulmonary effects can present as early as within 24 hours of breathing pure oxygen.  Symptoms include pleuritic chest pain, substernal heaviness, coughing, and dyspnea secondary to tracheobronchitis and absorptive atelectasis which can lead to pulmonary edema.  Pulmonary symptoms typically abate 4 hours after cessation of exposure in the majority of patients.  CNS effects manifest with a multitude of potential symptoms.  Early symptoms and signs are quite variable, but twitching of perioral and small muscles of the hand is a fairly consistent feature.  If exposure to oxygen pressures is sustained tinnitus, dysphoria, nausea, and generalized convulsions can develop.   CNS toxicity is expedited by factors such as raised PCO2, stress, fatigue and cold
