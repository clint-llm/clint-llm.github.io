Measures to increase patient-doctor relationships and sustain treatment continuity should be discussed with the patient before starting treatment with methotrexate to prevent morbidity to a greater extent and increase the life expectancy in cancer patients. The risk of potentially life-threatening side effects, hepatotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, myelosuppression, and nephrotoxicity should be discussed with the patients.

- Advise the patient to call 911 immediately if they develop any signs of infection (immunosuppression), experience coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath (pulmonary toxicity), or notice unusual bleeding (liver or bone marrow suppression).

- Inform patients that adverse reactions such as dizziness and fatigue might affect their ability to drive or operate machinery.

- Inform patients of the risks of adverse effects of many-body systems, including gastrointestinal, hematologic, hepatic, infections, neurologic, pulmonary, renal, and skin.

- Advise patients for close follow-up.

- Advise patients to avoid alcohol, including beer, wine, and hard liquor, because of the increased risk of liver disease.

- Advise patients that methotrexate can cause teratogenicity. Inform both female and male patients of reproductive age that they should practice any two forms of birth control- abstinence, oral contraceptives, or condom plus foam.

- Discuss potential drug interactions, particularly salicylates and over-the-counter NSAIDs.

- Warn patients about the possible development of malignancy, specifically lymphoma.

- Discuss the importance of proper dosing and administration and that the recommended dose is once weekly, and that improper daily use of the recommended dose has led to fatal toxicity. Make sure that patients fully understand the necessity for close follow-up and monitoring for toxicity.

- If an accidental overdose occurs, an antidote is available (leucovorin rescue).

Methotrexate can be an effective drug when used appropriately, but given its propensity for drug-drug interactions and adverse effects, the collaborative efforts of the entire interprofessional healthcare team are necessary to bring about optimal therapeutic results. This team includes clinicians (including mid-level practitioners), specialists, nursing staff, and pharmacists, each providing input based on their particular discipline to enhance patient benefit while preventing adverse outcomes from using the drug.
