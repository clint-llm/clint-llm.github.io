Glanzmann thrombasthenia is a congenital bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency of the platelet integrin alpha IIb beta3. This integrin is the platelet fibrinogen receptor and is thus essential to platelet aggregation and hemostasis. Patients with Glanzmann thrombasthenia have lifelong bleeding episodes that often involve the mucocutaneous membranes. This activity reviews the clinical presentation, evaluation, and treatment options for Glanzmann thrombasthenia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of Glanzmann thrombasthenia.

- Descibe the diagnostic options for evaluation of suspected Glanzmann thrombasthenia.
- Explain the treatment options for Glanzmann thrombasthenia.
- Identify the importance of an interprofessional team to optimize outcomes for patients with Glanzmann thrombasthenia.
