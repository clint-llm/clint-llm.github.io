Recent outbreaks of campylobacter underline the importance of epidemiologic reporting and preventative measures. In 2018, there was a multi-state outbreak of Campylobacter with a reported 113 laboratory-confirmed cases spanning over 17 states. This outbreak led to 23 hospitalizations with no reported deaths. During interviews with the patients, those affected answered a survey of questions regarding recent contact with animals and food. Questionnaires revealed that 87% of those affected reported contact with a puppy from the same branch of stores. Using a method of gene sequencing called Whole Gene Sequencing, biologists isolated genetic sequences that proved the samples were related. This established a common source. Isolates were tested for antibiotic sensitivities, and a pattern of resistance was identified. The infection was contained using practices of identifying the pathogen, tracing its source, and providing recommendations for treatment.
