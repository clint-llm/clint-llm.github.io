The use of regional anesthesia has widely been implemented among anesthesiologists and pain providers. It requires training and in-depth knowledge of anatomy.

Whether to perform a regional block depends on the type of procedure, patient's characteristics, and anesthesiologist's preferences. Some of the indications are to avoid side effects of general anesthetic medications (like respiratory depression), postoperative pain control, and to treat certain chronic pain conditions.

The main types of regional anesthesia are

- Neuraxial anesthesia (spinal anesthesia and epidural anesthesia)

- Peripheral nerve blocks

- Intravenous regional anesthesia
