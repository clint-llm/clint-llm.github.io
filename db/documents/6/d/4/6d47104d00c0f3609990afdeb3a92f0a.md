The differential diagnoses of IPH include other causes of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. These include vasculitides such as microscopic polyangiitis, pauci-immune glomerulonephritis, Wegener's granulomatosis, Churg Strauss syndrome, hypersensitivity vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis etcetera. Other examples are Goodpasture's syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome, and lung transplant rejection.
