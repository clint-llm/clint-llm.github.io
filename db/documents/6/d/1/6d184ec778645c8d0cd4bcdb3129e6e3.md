Striae, or stretch marks, are a common complaint and can be distressing. They may affect the abdomen, buttocks, thighs, breasts, back, axillae and groin. They are classified according to appearance or epidemiology, as:

- striae atrophicans (thinned skin)

- striae gravidarum (following pregnancy)

- striae distensae (stretched skin)

- striae rubrae (red), striae albae (white)

- striae nigra (black)

- striae caerulea (dark blue).

StriaeÂ are difficult to treat effectively.
