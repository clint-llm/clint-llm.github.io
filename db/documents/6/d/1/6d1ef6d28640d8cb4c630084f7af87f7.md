Active bleeding is a complication of traumatic renal injury that is critical and guides the acute management of the injury. Active bleeding is more commonly seen with high-grade injuries (IV and V) but, it can also be seen in lower grade injuries as well (II and III). Delayed bleeding is noted in 2 to 3 weeks from injury and is usually due to either an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) or pseudoaneurysm. AVMs and pseudoaneurysms are sequelae that are more commonly seen with higher grade injuries and penetrating trauma. While active bleeding is a more critical complication with renal trauma necessitating immediate attention, urine extravasation is much more common finding and can be seen in about 7% of patients with renal injuries. Urinoma develops when the urine becomes encapsulated, most commonly in the subcapsular space. Most urinomas will resolve without intervention, and the few that are persistent or become infected will require percutaneous or surgical drainage. Furthermore, hydronephrosis, chronic pyelonephritis, and postrenalÂ hypertension are delayed complications that can also be seen.

The most common complications following non-operative management of high grade traumatic renal injuries are hematuria, fever, acute kidney injury and urinoma compared to wound infection, perinephric abscess and urinary tract infection following operative management of these injuries.
