The diagnosis and management of Caplan syndrome are best done with an interprofessional team that includes the primary care provider, nurse practitioner, pulmonologist, radiologist, and pathologist. The majority of patients first come to attention at outpatient clinics where they may complain of dyspnea or joint pains. The diagnosis can be difficult but the condition does not require any specific treatment. The treatment isÂ focused on treating the extrapulmonary manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis.

Exposure to coal dust must be stopped along with other lung toxin exposures such as smoking. The RA should be treated per guidelines with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.

The prognosis for patients with Caplan syndrome is guarded; those with mild disease do not have reduced life expectancy, but those with severe disease may develop lung fibrosis which can be debilitating.
