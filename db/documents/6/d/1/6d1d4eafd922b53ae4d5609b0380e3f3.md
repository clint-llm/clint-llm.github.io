A well-coordinated effort is required from a team of medical professionals, including the medical oncologist, breast surgeons, radio-oncologist, etc., combined with the patient's preferences for the best outcome of the patient. The treatment of each individual is made on the basis of the extent of the disease and the general condition of the patient to withstand the surgical procedure. Traditionally, the treatment of PDB consisted of removal of the breast with lymph node dissection and possible dissection of chest wall muscles and other related tissue (Radical Mastectomy or Modified Radical Mastectomy). Recent efforts have been made to find out the exact extent of the disease and carry out Breast conservative surgery followed by Radiation therapy with the aim to conserve as much breast tissue as possible.
