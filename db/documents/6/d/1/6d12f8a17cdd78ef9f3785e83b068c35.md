Most patients with kidney stones, even those with multiple recurrences, are unaware of the availability of 24-hour urine testing and the potential benefits of preventive measures based on this testing.Â Successful kidney stone preventive programs require high levels of patient compliance, motivation, and discipline for their efficacy. An interprofessional team of nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and physicians should educate patients about preventive therapy. Still, only those individuals who are strongly motivated are likely to have long-term success.

The health care team involved in the care of nephrolithiasis patients has an absolute obligation to inform patients of the existence of such programs, particularly in cases of multiple stone recurrences, solitary kidneys, high surgical risk factors, or those in the pediatric age group.

Clinicians looking after patients with renal calculi should educate them about the importance of hydration; failing to do so will mean low effectiveness of medical therapy. Patients with recurrent renal calculi should be referred to a specialist for workup to rule out an anatomical or metabolic problem. Only through open communication between the team members can the morbidity of renal calculi be lowered.
