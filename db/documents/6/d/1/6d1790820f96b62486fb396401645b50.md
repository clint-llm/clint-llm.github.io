**Objectives:**
- Explain how a patient with a tibial fracture typically presents. 
- Explain the evaluation of a patient with a probable tibial fracture. 
- Contrast the management strategies for tibial fractures. 
- Explore modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by tibial fractures.
