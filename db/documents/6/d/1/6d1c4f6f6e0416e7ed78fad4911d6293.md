Tiotropium is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist medication that provides promising therapeutic benefits for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

**FDA-approved Indications**

- Reduction of bronchospasm

- Reduction of COPD exacerbations

- Maintenance therapy of asthma in patients older than 6-years-old

- Maintenance therapy for patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD)

- Maintenance therapy for bronchitis

- Maintenance therapy for emphysema

**A non-FDA-approved Use**

- The use of tiotropium as add-on therapy to inhaled corticosteroids and other maintenance therapies for pediatric patients from 6 years to 11 years old.

The use of combination tiotropium and olodaterol therapy (LAMA/LABA dual bronchodilator therapy) includes the following FDA-approved indications:

- Maintenance therapy for patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD)

- Maintenance therapy for bronchitis

- Maintenance therapy for emphysema

The "Understanding Potential Long-Term Impacts on Function with Tiotropium" study, also known as UPLIFT, established that tiotropium use in patients with COPD resulted in three significant findings. First participants of the experimental group receiving tiotropium had a reduced risk of COPD exacerbations, second, when compared to the placebo group, the experimental group had an overall improved lung function and quality of life through the course of the 4-year trial, and thirdly the tiotropium reduced respiratory and cardiac morbidity in COPD patients.

Further studies of the use of tiotropium in patients with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage 1 (mild COPD with an FEV1 80% or more of normal), and GOLD stage 2 (moderate COPD with an FEV1 between 50% to 80% of normal) resulted in a lower rate of disease progression as measured by postbronchodilator FEV1, suggesting that tiotropium use in early stages of COPD was beneficial for patients.

Tiotropium has also shown promising therapeutic benefits for pediatric to adolescent patients with symptomatic moderate to severe asthma. In a 1-year randomized controlled trial that studied the use of tiotropium as add on therapy to inhaled corticosteroids maintenance therapy for adolescent patients with moderate asthma, the results were significant (p less than 0.001 for 5 mcg of tiotropium; p less than 0.01 for 2.5 mcg of tiotropium) for improved peak FEV1 at 24 weeks on spirometry.p less than 0.001 for 5 mcg of tiotropium) for improvements in peak and trough FEV1 on spirometry.
