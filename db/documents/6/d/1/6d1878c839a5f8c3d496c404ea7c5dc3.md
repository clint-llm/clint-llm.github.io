The vestibulo-ocular reflex involves three parts

- A peripheral sensory apparatus (which consists of a set of motion sensors: the semicircular canals and the otolith organs (saccule and utricle)

- A central processing mechanism

- A motor output (which are the eye muscles)

Otolith organs are sensitive to linear acceleration and therefore detect the position of the head relative to gravity and head translation. Semicircular canals, however, are responsible for detecting head rotation since these are sensitive to angular acceleration. These organize in a push-pull structure consisting of one coplanar canal on the left side and another coplanar canal on the right side, which work by coordinating with each other. Humans have a total of six canals arranged in three main planes (anterior, posterior, horizontal) on both sides; each plane has a pair of canals. A canal will get stimulated by head motion towards that canal.

The central nervous system (CNS) is the central processing mechanism, which sends its outputs to the spinal cord and ocular muscles to generate the VOR. Each SSC has excitatory projections to a pair of extraocular muscles in each eye and inhibitory projections to an antagonistic pair of muscles.
