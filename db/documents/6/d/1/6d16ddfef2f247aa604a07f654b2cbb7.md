**The heart is Supplied by Three Major Coronary Arteries**

- Left anterior descending with Septal and diagonal branches

- Left circumflex artery

- The right coronary artery bifurcates into the right posterior descending artery and right posterior left ventricular branch.

However, in a patient with a previous history of coronary artery bypass graft, grafts are placed distal to the narrowed segment of the coronary artery. The most commonly used vessels for grafts are saphenous vein graft, left internal mammary artery, right internal mammary artery, radial artery, gastroepiploic artery, and inferior epigastric artery. It is essential to know the site and number of grafts before the graft study.
