The suprascapular nerve is at risk during massive rotator cuff repairs. Literature has described the nerve in close proximity to the operative field used in rotator cuff repairs. The nerve is susceptible near the glenoid rim, rotator cuff footprint, and lateral border of the acromion. The nerve is at risk of injury near these areas during a double interval slide technique for arthroscopic cuff repairs.

The nerve is also at risk for compression neuropathy at the suprascapular and spinoglenoid notch. The nerve should be taken into careful consideration in the manner of suprascapular nerve blocks for the treatment of shoulder pain. Injury to the nerve may also occur when operating in the regions of the neck, shoulder, and scapula.
