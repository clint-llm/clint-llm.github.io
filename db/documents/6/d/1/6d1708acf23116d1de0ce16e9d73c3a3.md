Routine blood counts and HIV PCR testing are indicated to identify the cause of the immunosuppressed state that led to the reactivation of the JC virus. The evaluation of abnormal neurological findings in immunosuppressed patients, such as those with AIDS, begins with radiological imaging. Contrast-enhanced imaging with either CT or MRI aids the clinician in determining the presence of inflammatory change and mass effect. These findings are absent in PML, and their presence would point towards an alternative diagnosis such as toxoplasma encephalitis or primary CNS lymphoma.

PML appears as hypodense confluent lesions on a CT without mass effect, contrast enhancement, or risks of herniation. On an MRI, they appear as areas of a decreased signal on T1 weighted images. MRI with contrast reveals hyperintense lesions on T2 weighted images, particularly in the subcortical lesions, periventricular areas, and lesions limited to the cerebellum.

In PML-IRIS, patients present with worsening neurological status after initiating ART, or after reducing immunosuppressive therapy, inflammatory changes follow and would reveal contrast enhancement, edema, and mass effect on MRI imaging.

CSF JCV DNA isolation with PCR confirms the diagnosis of PML.
