For conventional lobectomy procedures, a rib retractor is the mainstay surgical tool. Long instrumental is essential to reach the hilar structures, and vascular instrumental must be at hand due to the risk of major vessel injuries. Lung parenchyma and hilar structures transection could be done by stapler or cut incision with hand-sewn techniques repair. For VATS lobectomy, some endoscopic instrumental is different than conventional endoscopic surgery.
