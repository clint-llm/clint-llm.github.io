Odontogenic cysts can be inflammatory or developmental in nature. Good oral hygiene and routine dental care can reduce the likelihood of inflammatory odontogenic cysts. In addition, routine clinical and radiographic examinations can aid in detecting asymptomatic inflammatory and developmental odontogenic cysts.

Treatment of these lesions can range from monitoring to surgical treatment. Lesions that have rapid growth, are fixed, and/or appear atypical should be referred immediately to the appropriate healthcare specialist for evaluation, biopsy, diagnosis, and management.

Most members of the healthcare team will encounter odontogenic cysts in their practice. The majority of the cysts are developmental in nature and possess low malignant potential. It is important to note, routine and preventive dental care can reduce extensive treatment and result in more favorable outcomes.
