Anatomical changes that come with aging affect the pathophysiology of head trauma in the elderly.  When compared to a younger population, subdural hematomas (along with intraparenchymal hemorrhages) are the most common types of intracranial bleeds.

Also, advancing age often leads to progressive brain atrophy leaving more room for increased bleeding for the subdural hematoma within the cranial cavity.

The higher incidence of chronic dementia in the elderly may also cause delays in presentation and treatment.  Obtaining an accurate history and physical exam in an elderly patient with dementia can be particularly challenging.

A subset of the elderly population that requires special consideration are the patients on anticoagulation.  A variety of medical conditions such as atrial fibrillation, pulmonary embolism, or deep vein thrombosis require the use of anticoagulation medications. These conditions become increasingly common as the population ages.  In fact, as high as 10% of the elderly patients presenting with trauma are on coumadin.
