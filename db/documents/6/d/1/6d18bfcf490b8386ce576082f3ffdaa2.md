Mobile electrocardiographic monitoring is contraindicated if it delays urgent treatment, hospitalization or a procedure. For example, it should not be part of the initial investigation for angina, where a stress test would be more appropriate.

The monitor is also contraindicated in patients who have syncope and high-risk factors at which time inpatient management is mandatory.

Patients with symptoms such as syncope, near-syncope, episodic dizziness, or palpitation in whom other clear causes have been identified by history, physical examination, or laboratory tests.

The ACC/AHA guidelines discouraged the use of ambulatory ECG for either arrhythmia detection or analysis of heart rhythm variability for risk assessment in patients without symptoms of arrhythmia, even if they had cardiovascular conditions such as left ventricular hypertrophy, or valvular heart disease.

A patient who refuses to undergo further therapy once arrhythmia is established. Routine screening of asymptomatic patients.
