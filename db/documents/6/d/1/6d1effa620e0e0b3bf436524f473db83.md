Amylase is a heterogeneous calcium-dependent metalloenzyme of molecular weights varying from 54-62 kDa.The small size allows it to be easily filtered through the glomeruli.

P-type amylase is synthesized by pancreatic acinar cells and secreted into the intestinal tract via the pancreatic duct system. Its action is favored by the mildly alkaline conditions in the duodenum.

Genetic regulation is likely to play a crucial role in the preliminary determination of salivary amylase.

The function analyte amylase is an endoglycosidase enzyme of the hydrolase class that catalyzes the hydrolysis of 1,4-α-glucosidic linkages between adjacent glucose units in complex carbohydrates.
