There are various treatment options available to these kids to achieve the best possible outcomes for them. These includes:

**Hormonal Therapy**

Recombinant human growth hormone therapy (rhGH) is an effective treatment for patients suffering from growth hormone deficiency. Early intervention can prevent short stature and the psychosocial stress associated with it. The clinical benefits of rhGH are controversial, so its fixed dosing is based on its weight. Newer reports propose that rhGH dosing based on the children's IGF levels may be safe and provide superior outcomes. For patients with idiopathic short stature (ISS), commencing GH therapy can enhance the growth velocity and mean adult height. Hence, it might be suitable to say that the decision to give rhGH does not only depend on the etiology of short stature, i.e., whether it is due to ISS or GHD but also on the status of the epiphyseal maturation, mid-parental height, etc.these markers can be abnormally high even in the presence of GHD and are unreliable.

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs are used to halt the progression of precocious puberty. When administered, these analogs continuously suppress the release of gonadotropins from the pituitary and further down the gonadal steroids, which were responsible for premature bone maturation.

**Surgical Treatment**

Brain tumors need neurosurgery intervention. The limb-lengthening procedures are not recommended as they have high morbidity and mortality.
