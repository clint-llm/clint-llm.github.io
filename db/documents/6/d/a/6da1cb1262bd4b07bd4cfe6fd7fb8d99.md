The next step is the peripheral blood smear and evaluation. When there is unexplained left shifted neutrophilia with basophilia, cytogenetic testing is indicated to rule out CML. FISH for BCR-ABL1 fusion may be performed on peripheral blood and, if positive, supports the diagnosis of CML. The other major myeloproliferative neoplasms (PV, PMF, ET) often harbor mutations other mutations. Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) which is an acquired genetic mutation is found in the vast majority of patients with PV, over 50% of patients with primary myelofibrosis and essential thrombocythemia. A minority of patients with ET or PMF will have mutations in either CALR or MPL. The finding of one of these mutations is not specific for a myeloproliferative neoplasm and must be correlated with morphology and clinical findings.

When a bone marrow biopsy is performed for a suspected myeloid neoplasm, cytogenetic analysis is required. This is where the karyotype or the genetic screen of chromosomes of each WBC is tested. Significant abnormalities of in a conventional karyotype support the diagnosis of a neoplastic process. FISH may be performed concurrently to expedite the identification BCR-ABL fusion in a case of suspected CML.
