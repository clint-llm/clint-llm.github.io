Krabbe disease involves multiple systems, and therefore, the best outcomes can be achieved with an interprofessional approach with a team of clinicians, therapists, and social workers involved. As the disease symptoms present similarly to other leukodystrophies, prompt and accurate diagnosis is essential for an appropriate management plan. It is important to note that treatment for Krabbe disease works best when commenced before the onset of symptoms; therefore, a clinician's vigilance is essential to pick up symptoms in their early stages. Also, screening newborns can help in early identification and early intervention.

An interprofessional team of specialists is employed, including geneticist, neurologist, ophthalmologist, audiometrist, and physiotherapist. The geneticist can help the families understand the disease outcome, risk recurrence, and prenatal testing. The neurologist can provide symptomatic treatment and documentation of neurological sequelae. The social worker can assess the level of care at home and provide options to facilitate it further.
