Iron is found in many over-the-counter (OTC) multivitamins. Iron toxicity from intentional or accidental ingestion is a common poisoning. The acute ingestion of iron is especially hazardous to children. Life-threatening toxicity is associated with pediatric ingestion of potent adult preparations, such as prenatal vitamins. Serious iron ingestion in adults is usually associated with suicide attempts.

Accidental ingestions are more common in children less than 6 years. In addition, iron toxicity may also develop after multiple blood transfusions for a chronic disorder like thalassemia, sickle cell, and hematological cancers.
