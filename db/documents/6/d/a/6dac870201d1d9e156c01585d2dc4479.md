Bipedicled TRAM is performed for individuals that have an acquired breast absence desiring unilateral autologous tissue breast reconstruction. The primary indications for bipedicled TRAM include cases where larger tissue volumes are required for reconstruction, history of chest wall irradiation, or history of lower abdominal wall incision. This activity reviews the use of bipedicled TRAM flaps for unilateral breast absence and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify appropriate candidates for bipedicled TRAM flaps.

- Summarize the risks that are associated with post-operative flap complications.
- Outline the key steps regarding flap elevation and inset.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to ensure the appropriate selection of candidates for bipedicled TRAM flap and to enhance postoperative management.
