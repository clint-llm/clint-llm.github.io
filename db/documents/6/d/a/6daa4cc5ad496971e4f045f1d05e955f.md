Aneurysms of the internal carotid arteries involving the portion of the vessel contained within the cavernous sinus pose different risks and often are managed differently from other intracranial aneurysms. Unlike other cerebral aneurysms, these lesions usually are contained by the dura of the cavernous sinus outside the subarachnoid space.

Cavernous sinus aneurysms are most common in the elderly population and often present with an indolent ophthalmoplegia. The morbidity of these aneurysms is limited, and many patients do not require treatment. However, in selected patients, endovascular occlusion is an option. It is important to note that cavernous sinus aneurysms are not malignant lesions, and the majority are asymptomatic. Hence good clinical judgment is required in the management of these lesions.
