Brachioradial pruritus (BRP) is a localized neuropathic dysesthesia of the dorsolateral upper extremities. It is commonly seen in middle-aged white females with a seasonal predilection for warmer summer months. Cervical radiculopathy or neuropathy in the upper extremities in conjunction with ultraviolet radiation (UVR) are thought to be causative. This activity describes the cause and pathophysiology of brachioradial pruritus and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the cause of brachioradial pruritus.
- Outline the evaluation of a patient with brachioradial pruritus.
- Summarize the treatment options for brachioradial pruritus.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by brachioradial pruritus.
