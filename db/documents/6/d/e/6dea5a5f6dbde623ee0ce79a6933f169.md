The infusion site should be monitored for extravasation. If it occurs, stop the infusion immediately and disconnect, but leave the needle/cannula in place. The extravasated solution should be gently aspirated, but it is crucial not to flush the line. Remove the needle/cannula, initiate the antidote, remove that needle/cannula, and elevate the extremity. The data conflicts over whether to use warm or cold compresses.
