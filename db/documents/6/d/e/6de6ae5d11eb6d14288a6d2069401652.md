# Continuing Education Activity

Barbiturates are a group of sedative-hypnotic medications used for treating seizure disorder, neonatal withdrawal, insomnia, preoperative anxiety, and induction of coma for increased intracranial pressure. They are also useful for inducing anesthesia. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, safe administration, adverse effects, contraindications, and toxicology of phenobarbital, methohexital, butalbital, pentobarbital, primidone, and amobarbital. It also outlines the important monitoring parameters of the broad array of physiological possibilities when using barbiturates in the clinical setting and essential points needed by members of an interprofessional team managing the care of patients when using barbiturates.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of the barbiturate class of drugs.
- Identify the approved and off-label indications for barbiturates.
- Review the adverse events of barbiturates.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance appropriate clinical outcomes with barbiturates, leading to optimal patient outcomes and minimizing adverse events.

# Indications

Barbiturates are a group of sedative-hypnotic medications used for treating seizure disorder, neonatal withdrawal, insomnia, preoperative anxiety, and induction of coma for increased intracranial pressure. They are also useful for inducing anesthesia. Thiopental was introduced in 1934 for induction of anesthesia for general anesthesia.

- **Phenobarbital:**Phenobarbitone has extensive use as an antiepileptic drug in the neonatal and pediatric population. It is the most cost-effective drug treatment for epilepsy in adults in low-resource countries.

- **Methohexital:**Methohexital has demonstrated safety and efficacy for procedural sedation of short duration for cardioversion and pediatric outpatient surgery.

- **Butalbital:**Butalbital is used primarily for the treatment of headache disorders.

- **Pentobarbital:**Pentobarbital is used as a  pre-anesthetic medication and status epilepticus.

- **Primidone:**Primidone is used for seizure disorders. According to the American academy of neurology, depending on comorbidities and potential ADR, primidone(barbiturate) or propranolol can be used for essential tremors.

- **Amobarbital:**Amobarbital has a labeled indication for insomnia, but the American Association of Sleep Medicine does not endorse its use.

# Mechanism of Action

Barbiturates cause postsynaptic enhancement of GABA, interacting with alpha and beta subunits of the GABA-A receptor.

**Structure-Activity Relationships:**The German chemist Adolf von Baeyer synthesized barbituric acid (malonylurea)in 1864.

Amylobarbitone became the first intravenous anesthetic used in 1928. The formulation of parenteral dosage forms came with the addition of sodium at the C2 position.

**Pharmacokinetics**

**Absorption:**Phenobarbital is rapidly absorbed with a time-to-peak concentration in 2-4 hours. The bioavailability of phenobarbital is approximately 90% in adults and less in neonatal populations.

**Distribution:**Highly lipid-soluble barbiturates cross the blood-brain barrier rapidly, but there is rapid redistribution from the CNS to peripheral tissues.

**Metabolism:**The oxidation of barbiturates is the most important biotransformation that terminates biological activity. In addition, n-glycosylation is important for the metabolism of phenobarbital. Phenobarbital is metabolized extensively by the cytochrome P450, and the maturation of this enzyme family mainly occurs during the neonatal period.

**Excretion:**About 25% of phenobarbital is excreted unchanged in the urine. The renal excretion can be increased by osmotic diuresis or alkalinization of the urine. The metabolic elimination of barbiturates is more rapid in young people than in the elderly and infants. Age-related changes have been demonstrated in pharmacokinetics due to slower clearance in the elderly, resulting in higher serum concentrations with smaller drug doses.

# Administration

Barbiturates are administered in oral and parenteral forms (IM and IV). Intramuscular injections of solutions of the sodium salts such as phenobarbital or amobarbital should be administered in large muscle masses to avoid potential necrosis at superficial sites.

- **Phenobarbital:**According to the American Epilepsy Society guidelines, phenobarbital 15 mg/kg in a single dose is suggested for status epilepticus (parenteral benzodiazepines are the first line choice).****When administered as an antiepileptic drug for pediatric patients, phenobarbital may be given as an IV loading dose, followed by IV or oral administration.

- **Methohexital**: Methohexital and thiopental may be administered rectally in pediatrics, particularly if the child cannot cooperate with IV needle administration. This method is best suited in procedures of short duration, such as radiology or dentistry. The usual dose for methohexital is 1 to 1.5 mg/kg for induction. Barbiturates administered for the induction of anesthesia in adults are most commonly given as an IV bolus for a rapid and pleasant loss of consciousness.

- **Thiopental:**When using the IV route of administration in pediatrics, wide variation in the required dose has been noted. Cote recommended a higher dose range for unpremeditated children.

- **Pentobarbital:**Pentobarbital is administered by IM and IV routes. Pentobarbital is administered by intramuscular route 150 to 200 mg as a single dose pre-anesthetic medication. For status epilepticus, pentobarbital is given as a 5 to 15 mg/kg IV loading dose followed by a continuous infusion of 0.5 to 5 mg/kg/hour. It is important to recognize that continuous infusion dosing of pentobarbital is titrated to EEG (Neurocritical Care Society guidelines).

- **Butalbital:**Butalbital is used with aspirin/acetaminophen/caffeine for migraine and tension headaches. American academy of neurology doesn't endorse its use for a long time due to the risk of dependence and medication overuse headaches.

- **Primidone:**The usual starting dose of primidone is 100 to 125 mg at bedtime for seizure control in treatment-naive patients. The regular maintenance beyond ten days is 250 mg three times a day. The total daily dose of primidone should not exceed 2000 mg. Primidone is also used to treat essential tremors; the suggested starting dose is 25 mg daily, increasing by 25 or 50 mg per month as tolerated.

- **Amobarbital:**The sedative dose of amobarbital is 30 mg to 50 mg, given 2 or 3 times daily. The hypnotic dose is 65 mg to 200 mg at bedtime. Amobarbital is a DEA-scheduled II substance, and agents with better safety profiles should be used due to misuse potential.

**Use in Specific Patient Populations**

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**No dose adjustment has been provided for methohexital. The use of thiopental is relatively contraindicated in renal disease. Dose reduction is recommended in phenobarbital. Nephrotoxicity is reported with an overdose of phenobarbital.

- **Patients with Hepatic Impairment:**No dose adjustment has been provided for methohexital. As phenobarbital undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism, dose reduction is advised.

- **Pregnancy Considerations:**The placental transfer occurs within 1 minute of administration.

- **Breastfeeding Considerations:**Clinical data on the effects of phenobarbital indicates that there is inter and intrapatient variability of excretion in breast milk. Phenobarbital can cause drowsiness in infants, especially when used with other sedating drugs. In a series of breastfeeding infants, for each mg/kg of phenobarbital taken by mothers, the infant's serum concentration increased by 2 to 5 mg/L. Several case reports exist of infant sedation occurring in mothers treated with phenobarbital.

# Adverse Effects

For women taking phenobarbital as monotherapy, the drug correlates with congenital defects in exposed infants.

When given in IV anesthetics, barbiturates will produce a reduction in blood pressure and an increase in heart rate. Respiratory depression and apnea may occur.

Thiopental and thiamylal have been shown to release histamine, while methohexital and pentobarbital have minimal histamine release.

Extravasation of thiopental (a vesicant) may cause severe tissue necrosis. If extravasation occurs, treatment measures include hyaluronidase and phentolamine.

Barbiturates such as butalbital can lead to withdrawal symptoms, including seizures. The recommended risk mitigation strategy is to taper off barbituates gradually under supervision.

Hepatotoxicity: Barbiturates can cause allergic reactions and skin rashes associated with mild liver injury. Phenobarbital is predominantly linked with drug-induced liver injury. Phenobarbital-induced serious adverse drug reactions are DRESS (Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.

**Drug-drug Interactions**

- Phenobarbital is known to be an inducer of the cytochrome enzyme system, specifically the CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, and 3A4/5 isozymes that will reduce the efficacy of warfarin, steroids, psychoactive drugs, and immunosuppressants.

- Phenobarbital will also lower the plasma concentrations of other antiepileptic drugs, such as lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, tiagabine, and valproate.

- Contraceptive failure can occur when systemic hormonal contraception drugs are administered with enzyme inducers like phenobarbital.

- Phenobarbital is a strong CYP3A4 inducer; avoid combination with hepatitis C drugs paritaprevir/ritonavir, ombitasvir, and dasabuvir.

- Primidone is also a CYP3A4 inducer; combination with apremilast should be avoided.

- Barbiturates combined with other CNS depressants like benzodiazepines and opioids can cause oversedation and severe respiratory depression.

# Contraindications

Absolute contraindications for any barbiturate include status asthmaticus and acute and intermittent variegate porphyria.

# Monitoring

**Monitoring for Misuse:**Due to the abuse potential of barbiturates, restricted access started with the passage of the Federal Comprehensive Drug Abuse and Control Act of 1970. Barbiturates are classified as Schedule II-IV based on their abuse potential.

**Evaluation and monitoring for anesthesia:**Preanesthetic evaluation is required when barbiturates are used for general anesthesia. RCRI (Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk) can estimate the risk of cardiac complications after noncardiac surgery.

**Development of Tolerance and Dependence:**Tolerance is a gradual loss of effectiveness such that the dose has to be increased to maintain the same effect.

# Toxicity

Acute barbiturate toxicity may result from an intentional or unintentional overdose. Barbiturates have a history of abuse; New York City Health Department data showed 8469 cases of barbiturate poisoning in the period between 1957 through 1963.

A systematic review demonstrates the efficacy of multiple-dose activated charcoal for phenobarbital and primidone overdose. Haemodialysis and haemoperfusion may be considered in patients having life-threatening barbiturate toxicity.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Barbiturates have historically been a widely prescribed class of drugs in outpatient and inpatient settings. Barbiturates are controlled substances; thus, all DEA prescription requirements must be met. The prescription drug monitoring program(PDMP) can identify potential misuse and abuse.

- After 2011, major manufacturers no longer produced thiopental or methohexital

- the preferred routine IV anesthetic induction agent has become propofol due to its availability, rapid onset, and offset

Phenobarbital continues to be used as a second-line antiepileptic drug in the US and has frequent use in low-resource countries as a first-line drug due to its low cost. All healthcare workers, including physicians, and nurse practitioners who prescribe these agents, must be fully aware of the adverse drug reactions, misuse, drug-drug interactions, and the potential to develop physical dependence. When barbiturates are used in anesthesia, supervision by anesthetics and certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) is necessary. Movement disorder specialists should oversee the use of primidone for essential tremors. Given the potential for severe adverse events, including death, a pharmacist should verify the dosing and perform a thorough medication reconciliation to ensure no drug interactions, particularly additive CNS depressing effects.

The healthcare team must know how to resuscitate the patient in case of an overdose; MICU-level care and consultation with a critical care physician are often required. A toxicologist should be consulted in case of severe overdose. A psychiatrist should be consulted once the patient has recovered in case of an overdose. Prescribing barbiturates and follow-up monitoring requires an interprofessional team approach, including clinicians (MD, DO, NP, PA), specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient outcomes related to barbiturate therapy.
