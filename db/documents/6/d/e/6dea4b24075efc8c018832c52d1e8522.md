Prevention is based on knowledge of the risk factors and available prophylactic agents. Although there is some debate about the risk factors discussed above, the practitioner should educate the patient about mitigating the risk of alveolar osteitis. Smoking cessation is something all patients should consider to deter several complications, including AO. Females should also be aware that their risk can increase, especially if they are taking oral contraceptives.

The prophylactic measure with the most support is the use of chlorhexidine. One study demonstrated that chlorhexidine mouthwash following dental extractions reduced AO incidence by 63%.

One systematic review did find the use of chlorhexidine to be safe without any significant adverse reactions. Still, it concluded the evidence was insufficient to support its use to prevent AO.

A systematic review concluded that all other preventative interventions for alveolar osteitis lack sufficient evidence to support their use. Yet platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) is an effective preventive measure in many studies. One randomized controlled trial concluded that PRF in combination with chlorhexidine was the intervention that effectively reduced AO incidence.

Most other interventions have conflicting results, but saline irrigation post-operatively is largely beneficial. Warm saline mouth baths were shown to reduce post-operative complications, including AO. New studies were recommended to establish a standardized protocol to maximize their effectiveness.

Current guidelines have also discouraged the prevention and treatment of alveolar osteitis with the prescription of oral antibiotics. Perioperative antibiotics have some support in reducing infection after dental extractions, but there is poor support for their use with AO. Even in studies that show a minimal reduction or improvement in AO, it is often not statistically significant, and minor adverse reactions to antibiotics are likely. Antibiotics are not indicated for routine extractions in immunocompetent patients.
