The true incidence of superficial thrombophlebitis is unclear. In France, one community-based study noted the incidence of SVT to be 0.64%, while a different community-based study found the incidence to be half that of DVT and similar to PE.

For people who have a history of SVT, the lifetime risk of DVT or PE increases four to six times. While the three-month mortality is about 5% in patients with DVT or PE, it is less than 1% for those with SVT. One suggested reason for the lower mortality in patients with SVT is the younger age of the patients with fewer associated comorbidities.
