Changes in the skin at the microscopic level typically occur from cumulative and prolonged exposure to infrared radiation. Initial changes may show epidermal atrophy, vasodilation, and deposition of hemosiderin/melanin in the dermal layer. The presence of melanin may be related to melanocyte activation. Additionally, there may be dermal capillaries with enlarged endothelial cells. Later changes may also show focal hyperkeratosis or dyskeratosis with squamous atypia, which may be consistent with changes seen in actinic keratosis or other pre-malignant lesions.
