More than 50% of the sensory receptors in the human body are located in the eyes, and a significant portion of the cerebral cortex is devoted to interpreting visual information. The eyes are responsible for detecting visible light, which ranges from 400 to 700 nanometers in wavelength. Objects can absorb and reflect different wavelengths of light, which in turn, are detected by the eye. The color of an object is actually a manifestation of the wavelength that is reflected and not that which is absorbed. For example, an object appears white if it reflects all wavelengths of light and it appears black if it absorbs all wavelengths of light. The fovea centralis, or fovea, is a small depression within the neurosensory retina where visual acuity is the highest. The fovea itself is the central portion of the macula, which is responsible for central vision.
