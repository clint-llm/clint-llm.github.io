Failure of the closure of the neural tube leads to exposure of the neural tube to amniotic fluid. Although -early on- the neuroepithelium, neuronal differentiation, and function develop normally, these neurons die over time because of toxicity from exposure to amniotic fluid. The failed neural tube closure and neurodegeneration in utero is described as a "Two-hit" process.
