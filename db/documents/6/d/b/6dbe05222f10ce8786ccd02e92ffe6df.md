Labyrinthine fistula is an abnormal communication between the inner ear and the surrounding structures. Labyrinthine fistulas are formed most commonly between the inner ear (round window or oval window) at the fissula ante fenestrum and surrounding structures,Â causing perilymph leakage. The first report of a non-surgical 'spontaneous perilymphatic fistula' was identified in four patients, in 1970 by Stroud and Calcettera.

Prior to this in 1962, after stapedectomy/stapes mobilization, the polyethylene strut would sometimes slip and enter the inner ear leading to perilymph accumulation in the inner ear, escaping through the strut. This was termed as "slipped strut problem." Symptoms associated with "slipped strut problem" were hearing fluctuations, aural fullness, vertigo, tinnitus, and imbalance.
