Esophageal webs are usually found in the proximal esophagus and have a covering of squamous epithelium.

- The A rings are located proximal to the squamocolumnar junction. They are covered entirely with squamous epithelium. They are uncommon and usually nonpathological.

- The B rings or Schatzki rings are located precisely at the squamocolumnar junction. The proximal part is covered with squamous epithelium, and the distal portion is covered with columnar epithelium. They are the most common type of rings and can become symptomatic.

- The C rings are located distal to the squamocolumnar junction. They are covered entirely with columnar epithelium. They are the least common, rarely symptomatic, and usually represent diaphragmatic indentation of the esophagus.
