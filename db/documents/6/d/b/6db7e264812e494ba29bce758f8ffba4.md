Adverse drug reactions to mirabegron are generally mild and tolerable. One study showed that the adverse effects of mirabegron include hypertension (most commonly), nasopharyngitis, and urinary tract infection.

Mirabegron is generally considered a safe and effective drug. Mirabegron may also be more useful in the elderly population as the neurocognitive concerns of anti-muscarinic therapy may not be as much of a problem; however, this requires further investigation. According to the manufacturer's labeling, cases of angioedema have been reported, which can be life-threatening and require immediate drug discontinuation and prompt treatment. Mirabegron can increase blood pressure significantly, and its use is not recommended for use in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. In three years of post-marketing surveillance study, an increase in residual urine volume and urinary retention was recognized as a serious adverse drug reaction related to mirabegron therapy. The risk of urinary retention increases in patients with significant bladder outlet obstruction with simultaneous use of anti-muscarinic drugs to treat an overactive bladder. Other common ADRs reported were constipation and dysuria.
