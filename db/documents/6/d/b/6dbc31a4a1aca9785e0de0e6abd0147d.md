A nickel allergy rarely causes significant complications unless the offending agent is left to irritate the patient continually or if the patient develops openings in the skin. The skin may become excoriated and broken, leading to an increased risk of infection. The skin breaks and infections can lead to the development of a superimposed infection (cellulitis). Cellulitis can complicate the treatment plan for the patient, and topical corticosteroids may limit the patient's local immune response to fight the cellulitis. Treatment of the skin infection must be completed along with the removal of the offending agent to allow the skin to heal properly.
