Ectopia lentis is the familial or acquired displacement of the natural crystalline lens from the patellar fossa. The lens can be subluxated or dislocated in the anterior chamber, vitreous cavity, or retinal surface. The patient usually presents with defective vision, diplopia and there can be a loss of accommodation and refractive error. It can be traumatic or acquired secondary to systemic diseases, and the inheritance can be autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive. The diagnosis is usually clinical, and no special investigations are mandated. This activity describes the etiology, epidemiology, clinical presentation, systemic associations, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with ectopia lentis.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of ectopia lentis.
- Review the history and physical process for evaluating ectopia lentis.
- Summarize the management of ectopia lentis.
- Outline the complications of ectopia lentis.
