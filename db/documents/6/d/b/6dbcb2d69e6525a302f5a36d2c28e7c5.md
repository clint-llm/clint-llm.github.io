Patients with giant cell arteritis may develop acute visual disturbances, including temporary or permanent blindness; prompt diagnosis is warranted. While several clinical changes such as head or neck pain, jaw or tongue claudication, polymyalgia, temple tenderness on palpation, and elevated serum inflammatory markers may suggest the diagnosis, no single sign or symptom demonstrates a sensitivity or specificity that approaches temporal artery biopsy (TAB).

Given its greater than 90% positive predictive value, TAB is the gold standard test for diagnosing giant cell arteritis and should be considered in anyone with suspicion of the disease. It is important to note that treatment with systemic corticosteroids should not be delayed until after TAB, as up to 10 days of steroid therapy does not significantly reduce the sensitivity of the biopsy, and early steroid administration reduces morbidity.

The clinician should have a high suspicion of giant cell arteritis in any patient aged 50 years or older with elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein ≥25 mg/L or erythrocyte sedimentation rate ≥50 mm/h) and 1 of the following clinical findings:

- New or atypical headache

- New visual changes

- Jaw or tongue claudication
