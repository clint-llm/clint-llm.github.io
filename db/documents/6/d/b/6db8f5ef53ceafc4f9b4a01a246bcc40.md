PACNS is a rare diagnosis and needs an interdisciplinary team approach including a rheumatologist, internist, endocrinologist, neurologist, radiologist, and pathologist. Patients on chronic steroid therapy should be closely followed for side effects associated with long term steroid use including hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, and increased risk of infections. The disease process can last for many years with intermittent flares or recurrence. Patients benefit from physical and occupational therapy for rehabilitation.
