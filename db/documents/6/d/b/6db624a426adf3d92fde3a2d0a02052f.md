- Most commercial thermometers are only able to read down to 34 C, so a special low-reading thermometer is required to assess the exact level of hypothermia.

- The esophageal thermometer is the most accurate way to determine a patientâ€™s temperature.

- Rectal temperatures take up to 1 hour to adjust for changes in core temperature.

- The pulse oximeter may be inaccurate if placed on the fingers due to peripheral vasoconstriction during hypothermia.

- Patients with hyperkalemia may not show normal ECG changes associated with elevated potassium.

- The coagulation panel performed in the lab may not accurately represent actual coagulopathy in a hypothermic patient as it is normally warmed to 37C before being run.

- J waves are associated with hypothermia, subarachnoid hemorrhage, ACS, and normal variant.

- ECMO and cardiopulmonary bypass are the most invasive but effective ways to rewarming an unstable patient.

- If central access is necessary, a femoral CVL is preferred due to less irritation of the myocardium and risk of dysrhythmia.

- If the patient fails to rewarm despite appropriate rewarming techniques, secondary hypothermia such as hypoglycemia, infection, hypothyroidism, and adrenal insufficiency merit investigation.
