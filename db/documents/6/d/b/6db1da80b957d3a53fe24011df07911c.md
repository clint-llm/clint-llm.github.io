A normal aortic valve is comprised of three semilunar cusps that attach to the aortic wall. Aortic regurgitation (AR), also known as aortic insufficiency, is a form of valvular heart disease that allows for the retrograde flow of blood back into the left ventricle. Chronic AR was initially described by Corrigan in the 19th century by observing syphilitic patients. In AR, retrograde blood flow from the aorta into the left ventricle occurs in the ventricular diastole and, with time, will result in the stress of the left ventricle. The clinical presentation and management of AR depend on the acuity of the regurgitant flow. This activity will review the evaluation and management of aortic regurgitation and explain the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients suffering from this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of aortic regurgitation.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of aortic regurgitation.
- Describe the management options available for aortic regurgitation.
- Outline the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance aortic regurgitation management thereby improving outcomes.
