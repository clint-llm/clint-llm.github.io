The genioglossus is a paired tongue muscle that is in the group of extrinsic muscles of the tongue. The other extrinsic muscles of the tongue are the hyoglossus (chondroglossus), styloglossus and the palatoglossus.

Histologically the genioglossus muscle has significant type 2 fibers present in the anterior section of the genioglossus muscle, whereas the posterior portion of the muscles does not have a large portion of type 2 fibers present. The specific fibers present in the particular portion of the genioglossus muscle determine the function of the muscle. For example, the anterior portion of the genioglossus contains type 2 fibers, and this suggests that this portion of the genioglossus muscle participates in phasic action.
