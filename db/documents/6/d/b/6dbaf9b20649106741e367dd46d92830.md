The development of the BDG procedure has been a disjointed and arduous process. Right heart bypass procedures were first instituted to manage cyanotic infants with tricuspid atresia. Although up to 40 techniques have been described in the literature, there are a few noteworthy ones worth mentioning. Rodbard and Wagner first described right ventricular bypass by connecting the right atrial appendage to the right PA while ligating the main PA in canines. Shortly thereafter, Carlon et al described the first superior cavopulmonary connection in a dog, utilizing a venous shunt to increase pulmonary blood flow as opposed to a BT shunt. This group ligated the SVC, and then created an end-to-end anastomosis between the RPA and the azygos vein.

Glenn’s group at Yale began experimenting with transection of the RPA with subsequent anastomosis of the SVC and or IVC to either the right or main PA.

Circulation following the BDG is characterized by a volume-unloaded ventricle, passive pulmonary blood flow, and cyanosis due to inferior vena cava supply of blood to systemic arterial output. Oxygen saturation lingers in the mid-’80s in patients with a BDG. Cyanosis is exacerbated in these infants as they age during periods of exercise and exertion, including walking and crawling, at which point Fontan completion should be considered.
