# Definition/Introduction

The mode refers to the most frequently occurring number found in a group of numbers. The mode is determined by collecting data to count the frequency of each result. The result with the highest count of occurrences is known as the mode of the set, which is also commonly referred to as the modal value.  If multiple results all have the same high number of counts, then there can be multiple modes in the data set.

# Issues of Concern

The mode of a list or group of events is the most frequent output in that grouping. Therefore the mode will is the most abundant outcome. For example, if there is a set of numbers 1,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3, the mode will be 2 as this is the number appears six times while the next most frequent number is 3, with only two occurrences. Besides working with numbers mode can also compare the number of occurrences of categorical lists.

# Clinical Significance

The mode is one of the significant statistical values that go hand in hand with the mean and median of data sets to compare number sets or data for medical studies. Even with this connection, the mode has little correlation to the median and mean and therefore changes with the addition or subtraction of data points.
