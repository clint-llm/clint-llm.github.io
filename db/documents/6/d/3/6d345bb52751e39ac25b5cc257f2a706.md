The mammary gland shows physiological variations quite commonly in size, shape, contour, density, spacing, volume, etc. These variations depend upon several factors like age, height, weight, genetic composition, race, nourishment, built environment, etc. In some females, they are massive while quite small in size in others. In 25% of the females, there is an observable asymmetry in the size and shape of the breasts of the same person.

Inversion of the nipples is also quite frequently seen in females, which can be physiological and corrects itself or with slight manipulations during the first pregnancy.Â  But sometimes, it is also an early indicator of underlying pathology.

The mammary glands can also present with multiple breasts or nipples. Some of these were already mentioned under the section covering congenital anomalies.
