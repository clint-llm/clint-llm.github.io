The toxic effects of magnesium are inherently linked to the levels (mEq/liters) found in the serum. As magnesium levels rise, different symptoms start to manifest, and the fatality of those symptoms is proportional to the levels of magnesium found. Starting at 5 to 10 mEq/L, patients will begin to develop ECG changes (prolonged PR interval, widened QRS). At 10 mEq/L, there will be a loss of deep tendon reflexes and muscle weakness. At 15 mEq/L, signs of abnormal conductivity surface as SA/AV node block. Additionally, patients begin to experience respiratory paralysis. At 20 mEq/L or higher, the patient is likely to experience cardiac arrest.
