Transposon insertions can be pathogenic, being able to alter gene expression; transposon inserts represent about 5% of the molecular pathology. Among the alterations in the function of the transposons, we find the: Kindler syndrome (in the FERMT1 gene or fermitin family member 1); hemophilia A (in the factor VIII gene or anti-hemophiliac factor or AHF).

Transposon inserts may play a role in determining susceptibility to multifactorial diseases such as tumors. Transposons, and real disease mutations, seem to be able to create hypomorphic alleles: they are not actual pathogenic alleles but alleles with reduced functionality that can worsen the phenotype when they are in association with a mutation- real disease. These hypomorphic alleles may have some weight in generating traits of susceptibility to multifactorial diseases.
