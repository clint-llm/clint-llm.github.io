Kyphoscoliosis is a disease of the thoracolumbar spine in which normal curvature is excessively deviated in multiple planes. Its complications are varied by multiple factors including the age of onset and the primary disease that contributes towards its presentation. These complications may range from mild to severe, therefore education on how these structural changes may result in physical limitations is strongly encouraged. This activity describes the evaluation and management of kyphoscoliosis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with kyphoscoliosis.
- Explain the evaluation of parients with kyphoscoliosis.
- Review the management options available for kyphoscoliosis.
