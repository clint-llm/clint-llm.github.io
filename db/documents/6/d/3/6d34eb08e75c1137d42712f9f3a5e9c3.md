During the evaluation of lid wiper epitheliopathy (LWE), it is important to perform a thorough examination using a slit lamp at low magnification. This examination should encompass the assessment of the eyelids, bulbar conjunctiva, and inferior palpebral conjunctiva to exclude other potential causes of foreign body sensation. To evaluate for corneal pathologies that may mimic LWE, the instillation of sodium fluorescein can be beneficial. This dye helps to visualize epithelial erosions, assess tear film stability, and identify keratitis.

To rule out conditions such as superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis (SLK), conjunctival foreign bodies, and giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC), the patient should be instructed to look down and up while the superior and inferior eyelids are everted. This maneuver helps to assess the conjunctiva and rule out these specific etiologies. Subsequently, the application of lissamine green stain and/or rose bengal can be used to highlight lid wiper epitheliopathy. In patients with LWE, varying degrees of lissamine green or rose bengal staining will be observed, typically starting at the mucocutaneous junction, also known as the Line of Marx, on the upper lid.
