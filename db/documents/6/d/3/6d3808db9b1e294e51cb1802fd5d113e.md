**Antenatal Intervention**

There are no validated criteria for antenatal intervention. However, many advocates for it in cases where posterior urethral valves have been diagnosed by the second trimester with evidence of severe oligohydramnios.

Antenatal intervention is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. A single-center case series of 40 patients with 36 of whom underwent antenatal intervention. Five deaths occurred in prematurely born infants with respiratory failure, one termination due to failure of the shunt, and evidence of poor pulmonary and renal function. Of the eight patients surviving to follow up (mean 11.6 years), 5 had chronic kidney disease, with two having already had a renal transplant and one waiting for a transplant.

More recent work suggests some improvement in outcomes with 17 of the 30 patients in the case series undergoing fetal cystoscopy surviving to one year of life, with 13 of those 17 having a normal renal function at that time.

**Post-natal Intervention**

The presentation can vary the intervention required following delivery. If the neonate is initially unwell, they may require correction of electrolytes, specifically hyperkalemia, as well as support for respiratory distress or urosepsis. Following the stabilization of the infant, the bladder may require drainage in the event of acute retention or inability to pass urine. This is usually performed with a soft feeding tube rather than a balloon catheter, which can cause spasm. Cystoscopic valve ablation is the current initial treatment of choice for posterior urethral valves. This will usually alleviate the obstruction, but vesicoureteric reflux will occur in a third.

For patients with vesicoureteric reflux following cystoscopic valve ablation or bladder neck incision, treatment with prophylactic antibiotics resolved this in 66% with this increase up to 94% resolution of vesicoureteric reflux with ureteroneocystostomy.

In the case of extremely preterm infants, cystoscopic ablation is often not technically feasible. In these cases, vesicostomy diversion can be performed. Vesicostomy is usually preferable as the more invasive upper urinary tract reconstruction, and associated morbidity and mortality have not demonstrated improved longterm outcomes relative to vesicostomy.

Irrespective of the treatment modality employed, there is a high risk of chronic kidney disease in this patient population, and ongoing monitoring of renal function and obstructive urinary symptoms is required.
