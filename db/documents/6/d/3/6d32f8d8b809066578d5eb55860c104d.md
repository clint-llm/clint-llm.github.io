Vision is perhaps the most useful of the senses for humans. More than 50% of the sensory receptors in the human body are located in the eyes, and a significant portion of the cerebral cortex is devoted to interpreting visual information. The eyes are responsible for detecting visible light, with wavelengths ranging from 400 to 700 nanometers. As objects absorb and reflect various wavelengths of light, they appear as they reflect. For example, an object appears white if it reflects all wavelengths of light, and it appears black if it absorbs all wavelengths of light. The ciliary muscle is an important part of the eye that contributes to a person's ability to view objects clearly at varying distances.
