For the treatment of VLM, albendazole and mebendazole both are effective. Albendazole is recommended as it has superior tissue penetration than mebendazole. The dose of albendazole is 10 mg/kg/day divided into two doses for five days. Depending on other endemic infections, ivermectin and DEC (diethylcarbamazine) may be useful as well. Treatment of OLM is more difficult and revolves around decreasing inflammation. Thus, prednisone is often an addition to antihelminthic agents, and surgery is reserved for only the most severe cases.
