Pericarditis is a condition in which the pericardium (a fibroelastic sac surrounding the heart comprised of a parietal and visceral layer that is separated by a potential space) becomes inflamed. Under normal circumstances, the pericardial cavity holds 15 to 50 mL of pericardial fluid (an ultrafiltrate of plasma).

Dressler syndrome is part of a group of post-cardiac injury syndromes, which include:

- postpericardiotomy syndrome

- post-traumatic pericarditis from blunt or penetrating trauma

- iatrogenic causes including

- percutaneous coronary or intracardiac interventions 
- pacemaker lead insertion,
- radiofrequency ablation

Each represents a different clinical condition characterized by an initial cardiac injury involving the pericardium/myocardium and/or pleura and the subsequent inflammatory syndrome ranging from simple, uncomplicated pericarditis to more complicated cases with pleuropericarditis, cardiac tamponade, or massive pleural effusion.

The exact cause of Dressler syndrome is unknown, though it is presumed that an initial injury to mesothelial pericardial cells combined with blood in the pericardial space triggers an immune response and results in an immune complex deposition in the pericardium, pleura, and lungs which causes an inflammatory response.

This theory is supported by a number of observations regarding post-cardiac injury syndromes. There is often a distinct latency period observed at the time of cardiac injury and the development of post-cardiac injury syndromes, with symptoms typically starting anywhere from 3 or 4 days to 2 to 6 weeks post-injury(with occasional symptoms developing a few months post-injury). Both pleural effusion and/or pulmonary infiltrates sometimes present. Additionally, patients that have undergone cardiac surgery with subsequent post-cardiac injury syndrome often are found to have more elevated levels of anti-actin and actomyosin antibodies postoperatively. Finally, patients with Dressler syndrome or another post-cardiac injury syndrome tend to respond very well to anti-inflammatory treatments, and relapses are occasionally seen with withdrawal from steroids.
