Microsporidia are an unusually large group of unique, eukaryotic, obligate, intracellular parasites that biologists have studied for more than 150 years. Microsporidia are well-adapted pathogens and important agricultural parasites that infect honeybees, silkworms, and other insects. The organism is also a parasite for fish, rodents, rabbits, primates, and humans. This article reviews Microsporidia with emphases on the latest biological discoveries.
