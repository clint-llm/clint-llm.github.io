Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were first witnessed in the 1950s following the discovery of the then-novel class of medication known as neuroleptics.

In 1957, Schoenecker submitted the first report of what would later be identified as “tardive dyskinesia” as he described the bucco-oral movements of a patient on chronic neuroleptic therapy. It was he who articulated the distinction between this latent phenomenology and acute extrapyramidal side effects.
