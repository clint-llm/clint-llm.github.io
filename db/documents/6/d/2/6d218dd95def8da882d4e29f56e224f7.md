The anterior mediastinotomy or the Chamberlain procedure is a technique used to biopsy the anterior mediastinal, the periaortic, the aortopulmonary lymph nodes, or the lung. The procedure is used as a diagnostic tool for anterior mediastinal masses like lymphomas or a diagnostic tool for metastasis from lung cancers. This invasive procedure is done when the other techniques like endobronchial biopsy do not supply adequate tissue.
