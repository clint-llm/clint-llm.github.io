Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is becoming increasingly used worldwide in critically ill patients. Pulmonary or cardiopulmonary support may be provided dependent on the patientâ€™s needs. ECMO configurations may also be interchanged dependent on patient needs. The initiation of ECMO-dependent life support requires the cooperation of several different clinical providers. A cardiothoracic surgeon is commonly involved in the initiation of ECMO and the placement of cannulas. Following the start of ECMO, a perfusionist must be available bedside around the clock to monitor for acute changes in the functioning of the circuit. Besides, the effect of heparin must be monitored hourly and adjusted as needed. Hourly arterial blood gas measurements are recorded as well. Intensive care practitioners such as physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners provide oversight of the patient's clinical course and alert the cardiothoracic surgeon to any issues that may arise.
