As mentioned earlier, PFO is a common finding in newborns and adults; the major differential diagnosis includes other congenital heart diseases like:

- Atrial septal defect ( In contrast with PFO, there is an actual defect in the septum, and usually fixed split-second heart sound is heard on examination)

- Ventricular septal defect ( Membrenous or muscular, usually associated with pansystolic murmur)

- Patent ductus arteriosus (another shunt that exists in fetal life as part of the fetal circulation, it may remain patents in newborns, and very few may stay patent into childhood. It usually associated with continuous machinery murmur)
