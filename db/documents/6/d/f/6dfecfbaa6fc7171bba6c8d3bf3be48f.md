Pediculosis (louse infestation) affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide each year and has been reported in all countries and within all socioeconomic classes. The three varieties that are parasitic to humans are Pediculus humanus capitis (head louse), Pthirus pubis (crab louse), and Pediculus humanus (body louse). Head lice cross all socioeconomic barriers, whereas body lice more commonly affect homeless and displaced populations. This activity reviews how to properly evaluate and treat pediculosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the epidemiology of pediculosis.
- Describe the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of pediculosis.
- Summarize the treatment options available for pediculosis.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance the early detection and treatment of pediculosis and improve patient outcomes.
