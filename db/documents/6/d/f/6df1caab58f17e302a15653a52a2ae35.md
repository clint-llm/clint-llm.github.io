Interprofessional communication is paramount in the perioperative care of patients with asthma. This involves effective communication between the anesthesiologist, nurse anesthetist or anesthesia assistant, and the recovery room nurse. In the preoperative period, patients and families should be counseled to continue all routine asthma-related medications, including oral medications with a small sip of water on the morning of surgery.

The key to minimizing post-anesthesia complications is to be vigilant about bronchospasm.  The recovery room nurses should auscultate the chest frequently and report any abnormal findings to the physician. Besides bronchodilator therapy, the nurse should ensure that the patient is performing deep breathing exercises, using the incentive spirometer, and ambulating as appropriate. Also, the anesthesiologist should ensure that the patient has optimal pain control and is awake and alert. All team members are responsible for monitoring the patient’s respiratory status. At the end of each shift, a thorough handoff should be completed to ensure continuity of care. Effective and open communication within the team can help reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with asthma.
