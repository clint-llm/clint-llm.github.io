Although hemolytic uremic syndrome has less than 5% mortality, it can lead to long-term renal complications, especially in children. It is thus necessary to timely diagnose and manage appropriately those diagnosed with HUS. A high index of suspicion in children presenting with symptoms related to HUS and appropriate investigations can lead to better patient outcomes. Nurses need to be vigilant about a drop in hemoglobin and platelet and monitor for symptoms related to anemia and thrombocytopenia. It may also be essential to coordinate with a nephrologist if the patient develops acute renal failure and needs dialysis. Thus, a good patient outcome requires proper communication among an interprofessional team consisting of physicians, nurses, pharmacists, nephrologists, and their teamwork. [Level 5]
