Treatment for HZO includes prompt initiation of antiviral agents for all patients, as well as supportive care for symptom management. Other adjunct therapies, such as antibiotics, topical or systemic corticosteroids, and corneal epithelial debridement, are considered on a case-by-case basis.

- Supportive care: Artificial tears, cold compresses, and analgesics may be employed.

- Antiviral agents: Ideally, treatment with systemic antiviral agents should begin within 72 hours of disease onset. Initiation should not be delayed while awaiting definitive diagnosis or ophthalmology follow-up. Topical antiviral agents may be considered, but there is limited evidence regarding their utility in managing HZO.

- Immunocompetent adult dosing (choose single agent):

- Acyclovir 800 mg orally five times per day for at least 7 days
- Valacyclovir 1000 mg orally every eight hours for at least 7 days (may require renal dosing)
- Famciclovir 500 mg orally three times per day for at least 7 days (may require renal dosing)


- Immunocompromised adult dosing (choose a single agent):

- Acyclovir 10 mg/kg of ideal body weight (IBW) intravenously (IV) every eight hours for at least 7 days
- Foscarnet 90 mg/kg IV every 12 hours (typically reserved for severe or acyclovir-resistant disease)

- Antibiotics: Topical antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin ophthalmic ointment) are often administered to help prevent secondary bacterial infection.

- Corticosteroids: Both topical and systemic corticosteroids may be used in disease management. Systemic corticosteroids are often used in the treatment of herpes zoster, including HZO. However, clinical trials have shown variable results, and the potential for adverse events must be weighed against any potential benefit. The timing and extent to which topical corticosteroids are used are determined through ophthalmology consultation. Manifestations treated with topical corticosteroids include stromal keratitis, uveitis, and trabeculitis.

- Topical aqueous suppressants: These agents are commonly used in combination with topical corticosteroids in the treatment of elevated IOP secondary to HZO.

- Debridement: Ophthalmology may consider debridement in cases of epithelial keratitis.
