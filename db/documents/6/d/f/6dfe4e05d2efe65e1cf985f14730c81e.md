Spinal cord infarct patients have a better prognosis than those with cerebral stroke.Â  A study of 30 patients with spinal cord injury looked at the long-term prognosis by following them for a mean of 7.1 years. The study concluded that long-term mortality was lower in spinal cord infarct patients after adjusting for age and functional scores in the acute phase. The better prognosis is likely because spinal cord infarction patients have lower frequencies of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and cardiac disease.
