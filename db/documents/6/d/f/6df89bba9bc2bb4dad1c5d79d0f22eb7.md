Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is a mitochondrial disease primarily affecting the nervous system and muscles. MELAS presents in children or young adults as recurrent episodes of encephalopathy, myopathy, headache, and focal neurological deficits. The condition is relentlessly progressive, resulting in neurological impairment by adolescence or early adulthood. This activity describes the pathophysiology and presentation of MELAS syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the cause of MELAS syndrome.
- Describe the presentation of MELAS syndrome.
- Summarize the differential diagnosis of MELAS syndrome.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by MELAS syndrome.
