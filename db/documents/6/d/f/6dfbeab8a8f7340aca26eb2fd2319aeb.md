Coral toxicity due to PTX may have various effects and complications depending upon the mode and duration of exposure. Mild toxicities have local and non-specific systemic symptoms. More severe cases can result in hemolysis, cardiotoxicity and myocardial damage, severe respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, rhabdomyolysis, kidney failure, coma, and death resulting from cardiac or respiratory failure. Also, ocular exposure can be severe enough to result in corneal ulceration and even perforation.
