Given the wide areas populated by neural crest cells, neuroblastoma can present in the neck, chest, abdomen, or pelvis. With the most frequent site of origin being the adrenal medulla, patients often present with a solid abdominal mass. With the involvement of the superior cervical ganglia, aside from a neck mass, Horner syndrome (ptosis, miosis, anhydrosis) can be observed. If the tumor involves the spinal cord, cord compression, or paralysis may be seen. Furthermore, tumor behavior can range from spontaneous regression to widespread dissemination at presentation. With over half of all neuroblastoma patients having hematogenous spread at diagnosis, the disease can involve the bone and bone marrow (56% and 71%, respectively), followed by lymph nodes (31%), and lungs (3%). Non-specific clinical signs include fever, weight loss, and fatigue. Thus, signs and symptoms, which can range from an asymptomatic palpable mass to significant critical illness, are highly variable and dependent upon factors now linked with prognosis.

Hypertension is rare and is often caused by compression of the renal artery rather than the catecholamine excess.

Chronic diarrhea due to the secretion of vasoactive intestinal peptide may be the initial presentation.

When the bone is involved, pain and a limp may be present. In addition, bone metastases may present with pathological fractures.

Thoracic lesions may present with Horner syndrome.

In rare cases, the patient may present with myoclonus and opsoclonus. These patients tend to have localized disease and good outcomes. However, the neurological deficit can be disabling.
