Since trismus has been defined as a restriction in mouth opening regardless of etiology, it does not have a wide differential diagnosis. Some authors have argued that "true trismus" is mediated via the trigeminal nerve, and intraarticular causes of impaired mouth opening, such as TMJ ankylosis or fibrosis, should be considered separately.
