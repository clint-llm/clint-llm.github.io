The treatment of carotid artery contusion depends on the patient stability, the presence of symptoms, other organ damage, and comorbidities. Before any specific treatment can take place, the patient must be treated like any trauma patient and stabilized. Undiagnosed or mismanaged cervical injuries secondary to neck trauma can result in a mortality rate of greater than 15%. Furthermore, up to 10% of neck injuries will have associated respiratory compromise. Loss of airway patency may occur, resulting in mortality rates as high as 33%, therefore, securing the airway is the first critical step in management.

The treatment of carotid artery contusion varies from observation to heparinization, to open embolectomy. If the external carotid artery is involved, then conservative measures are adequate.

**Conservative management**: Multiple studies have demonstrated that systemic anticoagulation improves neurologic outcome in patients sustaining carotid artery contusion and blunt carotid injury-related stroke. Initially, standard heparinization protocols were used. Heparin promotes clot stabilization if present, clot resolution through intrinsic fibrinolytic mechanisms and prevent propagation of thrombosis. Initial studies show that up to 45% of patients with blunt carotid injury-related stroke achieve good neurologic status. Antiplatelet agents have gained a lot of popularity recently due to its ease of administration. Both therapies have equivalent results in prevention of the strokes as well as healing progression rates in carotid trauma patients. Recent studies showed a reduction in stroke rate for carotid artery injury from 64% in untreated patients to 6.8% in treated patients (either anticoagulation or antiplatelet). However, initiation of antithrombotic therapy in multi-injured patients should always be carefully considered due to the risk of bleeding. Antithrombotic therapy is contraindicated in patients with recent traumatic brain injury with or without intracerebral hemorrhage.

**Surgical treatment**: Simple intimal tears can be repaired by direct suture or via endarterectomy and patch angioplasty. Diffuse intimal tears and transmural damage are repaired via resection and vein graft interposition. Again, open surgical intervention is reserved for patients with acute focal neurologic deficits. Following completion of the arterial repair, a carotid angiogram should be obtained to assess the circulation and to be certain of the patency of the carotid circulation with no residual clots.
