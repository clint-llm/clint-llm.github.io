Patients with recurrent infections of the respiratory tract without risk factors (negative human immunodeficiency virus, no asplenia, no other immunodeficiencies), as well as recurrent infections of encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Hemophilus influenzae, should be screened for complement deficiency.

Screening for the complement system includes tests for the classical complement pathway (CH50), the alternate pathway (AH50), and the mannose-binding lectin (MBL) pathway (MBL by ELISA). Low CH50 and normal AH50 suggest early classical complement component (C1, C2, and C4) deficiency. Low AH50 with normal CH50 suggests a deficiency of early alternative complement pathway factors (factor B, factor D, and properdin). Low AH50 and low CH50 suggest common terminal complement (C3, C5, C6, C7, C8, or C9) deficiency. If CH50 and AH50 are both normal and the clinician still suspects complement deficiency, MBL functional assay is indicated to screen for MBL deficiency.

Consider performing a head CT scan before a lumbar puncture in a patient suspected to have meningitis. Individuals with classic complement pathway deficiencies must be screened for consequences of immune complex diseases with the help of urinalysis and a complete blood cell count. A lumbar puncture should be performed in cases suspected of having possible meningitis to diagnose bacterial meningitis.
