Diseases commonly mistaken for anetoderma consist primarily of disorders of elastic tissue leading to cutaneous atrophy similar to that of anetoderma.Â Mid-dermal elastolysis has a loss of mid-dermal elastic fibers causing widespread, well-defined, thin, and wrinkled plaques commonly on the trunk and upper arms. In acquired cutis laxa, there is a loss of elastic fibers that cause the skin to have a widespread loose sagging appearance. Granulomatous slack skin disease is a rare variant of cutaneous T cell lymphoma with phagocytized elastic fibers causing findings of erythematous pendulous folds of loose skin. Atrophoderma of Pasini and Pierini present as brown, gray or violaceous macules or patches with a distinct drop-off sloping border on palpation most commonly located on the trunk.
