Primary hyperaldosteronism occurs worldwide, and no evidence suggests that there are more cases of primary hyperaldosteronism in certain areas of the world. Aldosterone-producing adenomas occur more frequently in women than in men. Reports are that there may be a higher prevalence in African Americans or persons of African origin; this is demonstrated more in the idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia variant of the disease.
