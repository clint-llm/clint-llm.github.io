Improved outcomes after atherectomy are dependent on the skills and knowledge of the operator and the teamwork and preparedness of cardiac catheterization laboratory staff. Important healthcare team consideration include: a) equipment-specific training and certification for nurses, technologists, and midlevel practitioners focused on knowledge of equipment, standardization of protocols, and preparation for emergencies; b) minimum volume of PTCA at the medical center to establish competency; c) cardiac surgery available on-site or immediately available via interhospital transfer.
