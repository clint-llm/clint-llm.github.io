The usual evolution of symptoms is slower than might be expected after a major arterial trauma, and the subsequent delay in diagnosis and treatment may unfavorably influence the prognosis. Individuals with carotid artery contusion may have symptoms related to laryngeal and tracheal injuries including dyspnea, dysphonia, hoarseness of voice, dysphagia, stridor, drooling of saliva, subcutaneous emphysema with crepitus, and/or hemoptysis. Other structures at risk in cases of carotid artery injury include the pharynx and the esophagus resulting in dysphagia, bloody saliva, and bloody nasogastric aspirate. Carotid artery contusion may present with neurological deficits. These include weakness, paresthesias, hemiplegia or hemiparesis. Other hard signs of carotid artery injury include an expanding hematoma, pulsatile bleeding, signs of cerebral ischemia, shock unresponsive to fluid resuscitation, or the presence of a new bruit.

Traumatic cerebrovascular injury (TCVI) is a distinct clinical entity which can manifest after blunt trauma to the carotid artery (notably, the cervical portion of the ICA). A significant subset of patients with TCVI-related stroke suffers the ischemic event before admission to the hospital or before initial vascular imaging. Patients diagnosed with TCVI show a variety of symptoms including mild, mono, or hemiplegia to severe neurological deficits and even coma.
