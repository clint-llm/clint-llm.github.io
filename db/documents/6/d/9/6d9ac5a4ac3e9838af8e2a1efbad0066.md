The anatomical variants of the coronary sinus are manifold, ranging from the number of contiguous tributaries to the morphology of luminal valves. While the majority of anatomical variants are benign, some hold clinical implications for cardiac procedures. The presence of anomalous valves in the coronary sinus may hinder cardiac intervention techniques such as defibrillator lead implantation or retrograde cardioplegia.

A persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC) is a rare physiologic variation of the thoracic venous system in which the left brachiocephalic vein fails to develop. Venous blood from the left arm, head, and neck drains directly into the coronary sinus before entering the right atrium. Although PLSVC is clinically silent in isolation, it is commonly associated with other high-risk cardiac defects.
