The diagnosis of patellofemoral syndrome is heavily reliant on a detailed and accurate history and physical examination. Symptoms can be unilateral or bilateral and can be gradual or acute. Patients will also describe a worsening of symptoms with squatting, running, prolonged sitting, or using stairs.

On physical exam, start with the general overview and observation of the patient and the affected joint. Are they obese? What is their age? Are there any muscular abnormalities such as vastus medialis atrophy? Is there erythema on the joint suspicious of infection? Palpation can be useful to determine if the quadriceps or patellar tendons are tender while also checking for effusion or warmth. Simple muscle strength testing can be beneficial, looking for weakness in hip abductors or quadriceps. Make a note of differences between affected and non-affected sides as PFS can lead to weakness. Also, assess the range of motion of the affected knee. Lastly, examination of the ipsilateral hip should also be performed as the pain could be referred.

Multiple special tests can be performed; however, many are nonspecific for PFS. One study comparing the validity of clinical features found the sensitivity of the patellar tilt, active instability, patella alta, and apprehension tests was low at around 50%; specificity ranged between 72% and 100%.
