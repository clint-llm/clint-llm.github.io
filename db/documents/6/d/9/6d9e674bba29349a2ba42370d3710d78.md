The patient should be educated about the management and prognosis of ONSMs as they are slowly progressive. Patients need to have clear information so they can make informed decisions about their tumors.Â Some patients demonstrate clinical stability despite tumor growth, and some patients have rapid vision loss even without an increase in tumor size. All patients should be encouraged to have clinical follow-up evaluations.
