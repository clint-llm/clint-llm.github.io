Rumination syndrome is a functional gastrointestinal disorder defined as the effortless regurgitation of recently ingested food from the stomach back into the oral cavity in the absence of organic disease. The regurgitation usually occurs within the first 15 minutes after the completion of a meal. A simultaneous remastication and expectoration or re-swallowing of indigested food is commonly observed and can continue for up to two hours after each meal.

Rumination syndrome can be present in both children and adults and is classified as a functional gastrointestinal disorder by the Rome IV criteria and as an eating disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V).
