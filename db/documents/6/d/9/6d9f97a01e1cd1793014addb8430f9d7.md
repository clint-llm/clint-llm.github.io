There are various reasons why a fetus cannot, or should not, be delivered vaginally.

There has been an emphasis on decreasing the number of first-time cesareans, as many women who have one cesarean delivery will ultimately have the remainder of their children via cesarean. She may choose another cesarean for various reasons, or she may not be a candidate for a subsequent vaginal birth. For example, if that patient has an unfavorable cervix at term, cervical ripening with medications such as misoprostol is not recommended due to an increased risk of uterine rupture with those agents. In the 2011 article “Safe Prevention of the Primary Cesarean Delivery,” authors addressed the most commonly documented indications for first-time cesarean deliveries (labor dystocia, abnormal fetal heart rate pattern, malpresentation of the fetus, multiple gestations, and suspected fetal macrosomia) and mitigation of how these factors.

**Maternal Indications for Cesarean**

- Prior cesarean delivery

- Maternal request

- Pelvic deformity or cephalopelvic disproportion

- Previous perineal trauma

- Prior pelvic or anal/rectal reconstructive surgery

- Herpes simplex or HIV infection

- Cardiac or pulmonary disease

- Cerebral aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation

- Pathology requiring concurrent intraabdominal surgery

- Perimortem cesarean

**Uterine/Anatomic Indications for Cesarean**

- Abnormal placentation (such as placenta previa, placenta accreta)

- Placental abruption

- Prior classical hysterotomy

- Prior full-thickness myomectomy

- History of uterine incision dehiscence

- Invasive cervical cancer

- Prior trachelectomy

- Genital tract obstructive mass

- Permanent cerclage

**Fetal Indications for Cesarean**

- Nonreassuring fetal status (such as abnormal umbilical cord Doppler study) or abnormal fetal heart tracing

- Umbilical cord prolapse

- Failed operative vaginal delivery

- Malpresentation

- Macrosomia

- Congenital anomaly

- Thrombocytopenia

- Prior neonatal birth trauma

One study in 2007 looked at what level of additional fetal risk a woman or her caregiver considered to be acceptable to achieve a vaginal delivery and to avoid a cesarean section.
