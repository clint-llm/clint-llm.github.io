# Introduction

Prostaglandin I2 (PGI), or prostacyclin, is one of the prostanoids, a group of local hormones that are best known for their roles in mediating inflammation. However, they also perform many other roles in maintaining homeostasis.

# Issues of Concern

Significant issues explored in this article include:

- Mechanism of COX-2 and IP

- PGI2's role in anti-platelet aggregation and preventing thrombosis

- Vasodilatory effects of PGI2 particularly in pulmonary arterial hypertension

- A corresponding increase in COX-1 activity during COX-2 inhibition

# Cellular Level

All prostanoids share a common biosynthetic pathway. Phospholipase A releases arachidonic acid from the phospholipid membrane, after which cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes and their bound synthase enzymes process the substrate into the various prostanoids. The prostanoid produced depends on metabolism by COX-1 or COX-2, which differentially express in tissues, and the respective synthase enzymes they bind.

Specifically, prostaglandin H2 is a substrate produced by both COX-1 and COX-2, but different attached synthase enzymes subsequently process it into the various prostanoids. COX-2 preferentially binds prostaglandin I synthase (PGIS) and some prostaglandin E synthase, while COX-1 binds thromboxane synthase, prostaglandin F synthase, and also prostaglandin E synthase. COX-2 is also controlled by inducible expression, while COX-1 is constitutive.

Prostaglandin I2 is synthesized via COX-2 and PGIS from membrane phospholipids upon pro-inflammatory stimulation via cytokines, growth factors, or other physical and chemical exogenous stimuli.

# Development

PGI2 is primarily produced by endothelial and subendothelial cells, which both originate from the embryonic mesoderm.

Prostaglandins play an essential role in the closure of prenatal cardiac shunts

# Organ Systems Involved

PGI2 acts to promote vasodilation in vascular endothelial cells and pulmonary vessels. Hematologically, it also inhibits platelet aggregation, fibroblast proliferation, and leukocyte adhesion.

# Function

Prostaglandin I2 plays many roles in the body, but its primary known functions are to inhibit platelet aggregation, affect smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation, and limit immune cell proliferation.

# Mechanism

PGI2 binds to IP, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is found primarily on the cell membranes of platelets and smooth muscle and some immune cells.

# Related Testing

PGI2 has a half-life of 2 minutes and quickly metabolizes into 6-keto prostaglandin-F1 alpha,Â which can be found and measured in urine.

While there have been a few studies looking at the link between polymorphisms of PTGS2, the gene for COX-2, and various pathologies, the results are still controversial, and no clinical use for these findings has yet been defined.

# Pathophysiology

Prostaglandin I2 and the COX-2 system is found widely in the body, so the effects of regulation are diverse, and many have not yet been adequately studied.

The induction of the arachidonic acid pathway via inflammatory mediators is well-described: phospholipases (especially A2) cleave arachidonic acid from sources including the cellular membrane, and arachidonic acid is then acted on by cyclo-oxygenase enzymes that convert arachidonic acid to prostaglandins which enter circulation.

Prostaglandin I2 is the most potent known natural inhibitor of platelet aggregation and found in most mammals that use platelet mediated thrombosis for blood clotting.

Prostaglandin I2 also provides potent vasodilatory effects by acting on smooth muscle as a relaxant. COX-2 and its corresponding PGI-Synthase are upregulated in hypoxia to promote a vasodilatory response.

Prostaglandin I2 also appears to play a regulatory role in immune cells, exerting a protective effect on organs from immune-mediated injury. However, many of these pathways have not been adequately explored.

# Clinical Significance

Clinically, the two areas of interest in prostaglandin I2 function are selective inhibition of COX-2, thereby preventing PGI2 expression, and pharmacologic addition of PGI2.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including aspirin, indomethacin, and ibuprofen, all inhibit COX enzymes non-selectively. Currently, however, celecoxib is one of the only approved drugs able to inhibit COX-2 selectively.

Pharmacologic administration of PGI2 analogs is useful in pulmonary arterial hypertension, peripheral occlusive disease, and diabetic vascular complications.

Additionally, several animal models have shown promising results for the use of inhaled iloprost in the treatment for asthma due to its immunomodulatory effects.

It is important to realize that the dose of aspirin(acetylsalicylic acid), a prostaglandin synthase inhibitor have selective effects on the synthesis of thromboxane A2, a prothrombotic prostaglandin, and PGI2, a platelet anti-aggregating agent. Low dose aspirin inhibits more thromboxane A2 without much impact on PGI2, whereas a higher dose inhibits both. That is the main reason why low dose aspirin (such as 81 mg) rather than the high dose (such as 650 mg) is used clinically as antiplatelet therapy in medical practice.
