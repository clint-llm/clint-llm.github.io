The mainstay of treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma is radiotherapy in locoregional lesions as the non-keratinizing variety is highly radiosensitive. Surgical intervention is limited to salvage procedures in recurrent diseases, whereas chemotherapy is preferred concomitantly with radiation in advance stages.

**Radiotherapy**

Radiation is the management of choice for the locoregional lesion. Radiotherapy is effective in all cases except those for distant metastasis hence from stage I to stage IVA**.**NPC shows a tendency for quick spread regionally, especially as the nasopharynx is a small cavity so spread to paranasopharyngeal spaces, musculature, and nodes common. Also, progressively involving the contralateral side is not a rare occurrence. Consequently, a dose of approximately 65 Gy for primary tumor with 50 to 55 Gy is also necessary for nodal negative necks.

A recent innovation in the delivery system employed for radiation is intensity modulation or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). The system is equipped with a CT taking slices of the area involved. The physician specifies the targeted area of the beam and modulates the intensity of the beam employed.

Brachytherapy is another innovative technique for targeted radiotherapy. The technique employed is the implantation of gold grains or iridium implants, jacketed for localized radiotherapy, via a split incision of the soft palate. The technique is useful for localized tumor bulk that has not shown any intracranial extension. The technique spares any local vital organ damage.

Radiotherapy is also employed when treatment failure or recurrence is seen. It has been proven useful in both local recurrence and nodal failures. In such cases, brachytherapy is considered keeping in mind the friability of the local tissue, the general condition of the patient, and the impact on vital organs of the region.

**Chemotherapy**

NPC is highly chemo and radiosensitive. In advanced locoregional disease, concomitant chemoradiotherapy is the mainstay of management. The disease responds better with induction, and concurrent therapy is significant in shrinking the tumor bulk. The commonest agent used as the initial line of chemotherapeutic intervention is cisplatin. The standard of care is a dose of 100 mg every third week.

Chemotherapy is also the option of choice when distant metastasis is involved. NPC with distant poly-metastasis is offered palliative chemotherapy. The agents of choice are cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. With recent advances, there are a number of chemotherapeutic agents that are available for the continuation of therapy. However, the median survival rate is not more than a year.

**Surgical Intervention**

Surgical intervention is employed only as a salvage option. The nasopharynx is a small and deep area that is hard to access, thus making the surgical approach difficult and may be inappropriate. However, when the locally recurring disease is encountered, patients should be given the option of surgical intervention. Surgery is also one of the key modes of management for distant oligo-metastasis in conjunction with radiotherapy and radio ablation.

Nasopharyngectomies are carried out by a number of approaches, and the approach decided should be tailored in accordance with the expertise of the surgeon and the general condition of the patient. The following are some of the popular approaches to the cavity.

- Inferior approach - via transpalatal incision

- Lateral approach - via the lateral skull base

- Inferolateral approach

- Midfacial degloving

- Endoscopic approach

Radical neck dissections are often done accompanying the procedures mentioned above, where extensive neck involvement is seen. Also, in recurring disease, especially nodal recurrence, radical neck dissection is done as a component of salvage therapy.
