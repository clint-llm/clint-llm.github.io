Traditionally, neonatal myasthenia gravis has been regarded as a relatively benign disease with few to no long-term consequences when properly treated. More severe variants associated with long-term medical consequences have been described, including the fetal acetylcholine receptor inactivation syndrome. Thus, these variants should be considered in the differential diagnosis of children who have unexplained muscle weakness in the setting of distinct clinical features known to be associated with these forms of neonatal myasthenia gravis.
