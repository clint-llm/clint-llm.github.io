Phenoxybenzamine is a nonselective, irreversible antagonist of the alpha-adrenergic receptors.

Phenoxybenzamine is an antagonist of both alpha-1 (located in smooth muscle tissue and the central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and endocrine system) and alpha-2 receptors (found throughout the central nervous system). The mechanism by which phenoxybenzamine works is by covalently bonding with a component of the alpha-adrenergic receptor, most likely a cysteine residue, which reduces the sympathetic effects of the two hormones.

The mechanisms described create a vasodilative effect since the alpha-adrenergic receptors are present throughout the walls of all blood vessels), which leads to the drop in blood pressure seen. Since there is a decrease in peripheral vascular tone, the result can be a baroreceptor-mediated increase in the sympathetic tone, characterized by reflex tachycardia (increased heart rate).

The mechanism of phenoxybenzamine involved in the urogenital system is by producing a long-lasting noncompetitive alpha blockade of the postganglionic synapses present in smooth muscles and endocrine glands. Phenoxybenzamine relaxes the urethra and, in turn, increases the opening of the bladder for easier emptying. The drug is metabolized in the liver, with 10% excreted in the urine as an unchanged drug.
