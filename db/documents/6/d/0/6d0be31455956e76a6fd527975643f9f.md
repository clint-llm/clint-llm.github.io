Premature atrial contractions (PACs) are contractions of the atria that are triggered by the atrial myocardium but have not originated from the sinoatrial node (SA node). PACs are also commonly referred to as atrial premature complexes (APCs), premature supraventricular complexes, premature supraventricular beat, and premature atrial beat. This phenomenon can be caused by an assortment of medical diseases, structural abnormalities, pharmaceuticals, and non-regulated compounds.
