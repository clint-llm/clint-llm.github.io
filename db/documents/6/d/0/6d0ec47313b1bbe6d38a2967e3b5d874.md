Today, all healthcare workers should be very familiar with the healthcare institution's policy of performing checks and cross-checks before transfusing blood. This is mandatory and it applies to the laboratory technologist who prepares the blood, the nurse who receives the blood from the blood bank and the nurse who transfuses it; in short, all members of the interprofessional healthcare team. The aim is to prevent adverse reactions to blood. All patients must be educated about the potential for adverse reactions before administering the blood. Further, the nurse must tell the patient to inform her or him in cases they develop a fever, headache, rash or difficulty breathing. The nurse should also be aware that nonhemolytic febrile reactions do occur in 10-15% of patients who receive blood and hence good clinical judgment is required when to continue the transfusion and when to discontinue it. If an adverse reaction occurs, the nurse should immediately stop the transfusion, call the physician and send the blood back with all the tubing back to the laboratory. Caution should be exercised at every step because complications of blood transfusions do have the potential to kill a patient.

**Outcomes**

In general, when massive blood transfusions are done especially in the setting of trauma, the potential for complications is high. Some studies indicate that no more than 20-30 units of blood should be given to avoid complications. Overall, most studies reveal that such transfusions do not lead to patient survival but in fact, are associated with many adverse events.
