The management of common bile duct stones usually entails a team of a surgeon, gastroenterologist, radiologist, and sometimes a hepatobiliary surgeon. The care of these patients is usually done by nurses. Prior to ERCP, the patient should be informed of the potential complications and recovery period. Prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis should be employed. In addition, the patient should be taught how to use the incentive spirometer to prevent atelectasis in the postoperative period. Nausea and vomiting should be managed by the pharmacist, with antiemetic medications. If the pain is severe, the patient may require prescription-strength analgesics. Finally, the patient should have a physical therapy consult and undergo a weight loss program since gallstones are more common in obese individuals.

**Outcomes**

Today in most experienced centers, ERCP can be performed with minimal morbidity and mortality. The rate of complications reported varies from 1-5%. The biggest problem with ERCP is the technical part, which can be difficult in about 5% of cases. Retained gallstones may occur in less than 1% of people, and pancreatitis is known to occur in less than 3% of patients.
