In the 1970s, calcium channel antagonists, also known as calcium channel blockers, were widely used for many indications. This cardiovascular drug class is one of the leading causes of drug-related fatalities. They often classify into two major categories, either non-dihydropyridines or dihydropyridines. The non-dihydropyridines include verapamil, a phenylalkylamine, and diltiazem, a benzothiazepine. The dihydropyridines include many other drugs, most of which end in "pine" (i.e., amlodipine and nicardipine).

Cardiovascular indications include hypertension, coronary spasm, angina pectoris, supraventricular dysrhythmias, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and pulmonary hypertension. In addition to these, they are also prescribed for Raynaud phenomenon, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and migraine headaches.
