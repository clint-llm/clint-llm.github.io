Treatment and management of headache disorders is a challenging task and requires a thorough evaluation.

- Lithium - Raskin et al. published the first reports on the effectiveness of lithium for the treatment of HH. Several other studies have been published since then, corroborating their findings. Effective dose- 150 to 600 mg/day in single or divided doses to a serum level of 0.5 to 1.0 mmol/L.

- Indomethacin has shown positive results with the management of HH.

- Caffeine - 40 to 60 mg of caffeine has shown good results in the treatment of HH. It is also very well tolerated in the elderly population and surprisingly does not interfere with sleep. This is often used as a first-line treatment of these headaches.

- Other medications felt ineffective but with conflicting evidence include tricyclic antidepressants, flunarizine, beta-blockers, verapamil, NSAIDs, prednisolone, other anticonvulsants, acetazolamide, melatonin, benzodiazepines, pizotifen, and topiramate.

- There have been case reports suggesting the efficacy of onabotulinum toxin and occipital nerve stimulation.
