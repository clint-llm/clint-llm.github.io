Primary sclerosing cholangitis is characterized by inflammation, fibrosis, and cholestasis. Hereditary and environmental factors play a role in the pathogenesis of primary sclerosing cholangitis. Healthcare researchers hypothesize that after exposure to an unidentified environmental source, persistent injury of the cells lining the bile ducts (cholangiocytes) occurs via several genetically predisposed pathways.NOTCH4, respectively).

PSC is a premalignant disease, as 10% to 20% of patients with PSC develop cholangiocarcinoma. PSC-induced cholangiocarcinoma is thought to be inflammation-induced cancer contributed by the toxic environment of bile, which acts as a cofactor in accelerating carcinogenesis. Genetic and immune factors may play an important role.
