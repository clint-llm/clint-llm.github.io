Evaluation of the patient with Dissociated vertical deviation requires an interprofessional approach, involving physicians, orthoptists, nurses, pharmacists, and ophthalmic technicians. The interprofessional health staff will be able to guide the patient and help them through the choice of management, ensure compliance with patching, monitor them regularly, and better decision making for surgical intervention. They will be well versed with post-operative care with instructions on the correct administration of eye drops. They will also explain to the patient/parents about the red-flag symptoms of which to be aware and the need to contact the team should they develop them. They will be part of the patient follow-up in an outpatient setting, assisting with visual acuity and orthoptic assessments on regular follow-up visits.
