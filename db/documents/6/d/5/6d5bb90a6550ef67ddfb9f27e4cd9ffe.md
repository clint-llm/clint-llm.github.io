The immunotherapeutic atezolizumab (anti-PDL1, RG7446, MPDL3280A monoclonal antibody against PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) is being evaluated in a phase III clinical trial as a potential first-line treatment for patients with non-squamous or squamous non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors express PDL1. A phase I trial is also ongoing, evaluating atezolizumab in combination with erlotinib or alectinib in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. IPA-3 or OTSSP167 and auranofin were highly synergistic in EGFR or KRAS mutant squamous cell carcinoma cell lines and decreased tumor volume in mice models.
