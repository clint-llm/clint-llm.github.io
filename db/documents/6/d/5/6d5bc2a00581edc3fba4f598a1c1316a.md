Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD) is a group of inherited kidney disorders. It is usually characterized by progressive renal insufficiency, tubulointerstitial nephropathy, and bland urinary sediment. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. It must be promptly diagnosed and treated to avoid the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition. This activity describes the etiology, evaluation, and treatment of autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation of autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease.
- Outline the management options available for autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease and improve outcomes.
