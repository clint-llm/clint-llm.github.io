Occupational therapy has sometimes been mixed with physical therapy, but in its essence, occupational therapy is an assessment and intervention to help people through the therapeutic use of everyday activities. It starts with an assessment, and then an intervention is planned to allow those to maintain, recover, or even develop activities or occupations of individuals.

This is a service that is often provided in long-term care (LTC) facilities. Occupational therapy is performed by occupational therapists and occupational therapy assistants (OTAs). However, an often overlooked aspect of occupational therapy is mental health and wellbeing as many residents in LTC's have a diagnosis of depression.
