Before surgery, implant size and shape must be selected with the patient. First, the pectoral muscle is measured as follows: the width at the lower border and infra-clavicular border of muscle, the height at the midportion of muscle, and the distance between the chondrosternal angle and the axilla. With these dimensions, an implant volume is selected that will achieve the patientâ€™s desires for a larger, more proportional chest.

The pocket for implant placement tends to be about 2 cm smaller than these measurements. If the reconstruction is unilateral, the surgeon must make attempts to match the implant to the contralateral side. If the implant is custom-made, a cast can be used to create the implant.

The patient should also understand the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure to make an informed decision. He should also be made aware of the expected postoperative course and limitations following the procedure.
