Pre-operative assessment of a patient for extraction should be done by dentists, ideally by the same dentist who is due to perform the extraction. However, this is not always possible in a secondary care environment. The dental extraction itself is always performed by the dental surgeon. The dental assistant's role centers on ensuring the required equipment are available and given to the operator at the appropriate points.

The dental assistant is also highly valuable during the extraction process by ensuring good surgical site visibility through a combination of suction and soft-tissue retraction. The dental assistant can also provide post-operative instructions to patients after the extraction if they are appropriately trained. The surgeon must remove their sharp instruments from the tray and dispose of them correctly. The dental assistant or a decontamination team should properly sterilize or dispose of the remaining equipment.
