In adults, monitor TSH levels approximately 6 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with levothyroxine. Upon achieving the correct dosing of levothyroxine, monitor TSH levels after 4 to 6 months and then every 12 months. Patients should receive education about the symptoms of hyperthyroidism and contact their clinician for medication dose decrease if those symptoms appear.

Oral semaglutide (GLP-1 analog) increases total T4 exposure when given levothyroxine. In addition, levothyroxine pharmacokinetics is influenced by co-administration with oral semaglutide. Therefore, thyroid function tests should be monitored, and the clinician should adjust the levothyroxine dose.
