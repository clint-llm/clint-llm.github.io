**Pathophysiology of Dental Caries**

The pathophysiology of dental caries is characterized by a dynamic process that alternates periods of demineralization and remineralization.

Under normal circumstances, the concentration of calcium and phosphate in oral fluids (saliva and biofilm fluid) is supersaturated compared to their concentration in the enamel. These ions are continually deposited on the enamel surface or redeposited on enamel areas where they were previously lost. But when bacteria convert sugars from the diet into acids, the biofilm fluid becomes undersaturated compared to the enamel, leading to demineralization (mineral loss). Even though pH levels remain low (acidic) for a certain time, when the amount of sugar available goes down, the pH of the biofilm fluid returns to neutrality (rises) and becomes sufficiently saturated with calcium, phosphate, and fluoride so that demineralization stops and redeposition of mineral starts. Due to the biofilm calcium and phosphate, redeposition of minerals can occur or by the direct action of salivary calcium and phosphate soon after the biofilm is removed by toothbrushing.

When repeated events of mineral dissolution happen, and the number of subsurface minerals lost surpasses the ones gained over a long period, the disease will show its first clinical sign: a white spot.

All the tooth surfaces are susceptible to caries throughout an individual's lifetime. But, the disease will not occur unless teeth are exposed to cariogenic biofilm and frequent sugar consumption. The modern concept of caries also considers other factors, such as sociodemographic situation, access to dental care, and fluoride exposure, which are significant but not decisive to develop the disease. For all of this, dental caries should be described as a complex biofilm-mediated affection linked mostly to frequent ingestion of sugars and poor oral hygiene combined with inadequate fluoride exposure.

**Evaluation**

We can classify non-cavitated caries lesions as active and inactive, each with different characteristics.

**Active lesion:**The enamel surface is whitish/yellowish, opaque, and typically located close to the gingival margin. It is commonly covered with plaque, with no clinically detectable loss of substance. It feels rough to the touch when the curved part of the explorer is moved softly among the surface - using a sharp explorer to evaluate the lesion's surface is contraindicated because it can break down the enamel.

**Inactive lesion:**The enamel surface is darker and shiny but intact. It feels smooth and hard to the touch; despite that, it is not recommended to evaluate these lesions with an explorer.

Furthermore, as part of the evaluation, patients are classified into two groups considering their risk to develop caries:

**High risk:**patients present one or more risk factors like frequent consumption of dietary carbohydrates (more than four times of sugar per day), inadequate exposure to fluoride, poor oral hygiene, and salivary dysfunction. Although, the best indicator that patients will develop future caries is their past caries history.

**Low risk:**patients that present protective factors like a healthy diet, tooth brushing with a fluoride toothpaste at least twice a day, professional application of topical fluorides, and normal salivary function.

Initial lesions should be managed considering the patient's risk of developing caries (patient-level) and the lesion's activity status (tooth level).
