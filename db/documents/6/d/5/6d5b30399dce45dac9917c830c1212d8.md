The incidence of collagenous colitis ranges from 2.0 to 10.8 per 100000, and lymphocytic colitis ranges from 2.3 to 16 per 100000. There are higher incidences in northern Europe and the northern parts of North America.

Several other diseases with autoimmune background have correlations with microscopic colitis. Like other aspects, it appears that concomitant autoimmune diseases are more common in patients with collagenous colitis when compared to lymphocytic colitis.
