On the spectrum of shoulder pathologies, subacromial bursitis is not one that is associated with many complications. Repeated steroid injections always pose the theoretical risk of introducing an infection into the skin or shoulder joint. There is also a concern of damaging the rotator cuff muscles with recurrent injections. However, Bhatia et al. found no significant difference in the incidence of rotator cuff tears in patients who received fewer than or more than three subacromial corticosteroid injections.
