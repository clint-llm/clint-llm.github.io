The pathophysiology of retinal traction detachment is very well described in PDR cases. Hyperglycemia causes capillary closure and ischemia and elevated levels of nitric oxide (NO), which increases the activity of protein kinase C, activates vascular growth factors including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and several chemokines.

Subsequently, glial cells encompass these new blood vessels, and fibrous proliferation develops in these places. In PDR, typically, the traction occurs at the temporal arcade vessels due to the infiltration of retinal new vessels into the posterior vitreous face and may form a ring-like appearance around the fovea in late stages. This fibrous tissue causes traction over the retinal surface resulting in detachment of the neurosensory retina from the RPE.

Retinal ischemia can result from a number of other causes, namely retinal vein occlusion, sickle cell retinopathy, ROP, FEVR, and trauma. The pathophysiology of RTD in these conditions can be explained similarly to that of PDR due to retinal new vessels (proliferative retinopathy). Other causes, including penetrating trauma, toxocariasis can cause glial proliferation and retinal traction directly without retinal new vessels.

**Types of RTD**

Conventionally, TRDs are divided into:

- Macular

- Extra macular RTD

However, other classifications are also described.

Dubey et al. described RTDs to be:

- surgical if it involved the posterior pole or superior periphery and

- nonsurgical if it involved the inferior periphery.

Kroll and coworkers divided RTD into 4 types.

- Proliferative changes in the vitreoretinal interface but flat and attached retina; vitreous hemorrhage may be observed.

- Extramacular TRD (Bn nasal to the optic nerve, Bt temporal to macula)

- TRD involving the macula but attached fovea (C1-4 further describes quadrants involved)

- Traction at the posterior pole detaching the entire macula

Though there is no consensus regarding the classification, following a classification system before the preoperative workup will help in better decision making in the management of RTDs. The two common anatomical indications for surgery in RTD are RTD threatening macula and RTD involving the macula.

RTD threatening macula: The area of retinal elevation is at least 4 disc diameter, some part of whose is within the 30 degrees of the center of the macula or retinal elevation of less than 4 disc area along with one or more vitreoretinal adhesion causing elevation of the retina within 30 degrees of center of macula in the presence of new vessel or fresh vitreous hemorrhage.

RTD involving macula: Vitreo-retinal traction along the arcade, disc, or along retinal traction lines extending through the fovea and causing vision loss.

The rate of progression of extramacular RTD to involve the macula ranges from 14 to 15% at 1 year and 21 to 23% at the end of 2 years.

RTD should be differentiated from the other 2 types of retinal detachments (RD), i.e., rhegmatogenous RD and exudative RD (see figures).
