The management of EHEC is interprofessional. For most patients, supportive treatment will suffice. Electrolytes and water deficiency should be replaced, especially in patients with D+ HUS. The current advancements in dialysis and intensive care have reduced mortality, mainly in young children. The best option for children is peritoneal dialysis. Bilateral nephrectomy is life-saving and can control the spread of microvascular lesions when the kidneys are the main site of the disease involvement especially in cases of therapy-resistant malignant hypertension. Because the prognosis is often severe, immediate supportive treatment may improve the outcome. Other supportive treatments available for patients with HUS are mainly dependent on their symptoms and may include plasma exchange and blood transfusions.

In general, the primary care provider and nurse practitioner should educate the patient on the prevention of foodborne diseases.  This can be achieved most effectively through the application of food safety assurance programs. Vaccines for EHEC are under study but have not been approved by FDA yet.
