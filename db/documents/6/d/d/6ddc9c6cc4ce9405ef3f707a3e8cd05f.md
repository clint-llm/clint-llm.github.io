The incidence of pulmonary barotrauma greatly depends on the underlying indication for mechanical ventilation. Several trials and meta-analysis have estimated the prevalence between 0% and 50%. More recent data after the implementation of lung-protective ventilation strategies appear to be closer to an incidence of 10% averaged between different populations.

A prospective cohort study published in 2004 looked at 5183 patients throughout 361 ICUs. The incidence of barotrauma was 2.9% in general. Prevalence varied depending on the indication for mechanical ventilation. The incidence was found to be 2.9% in patients with COPD, 6.3% in patients with asthma, 10% in patients with ILD, 6.5% in patients with ARDS, and 4.2% in patients with pneumonia.
