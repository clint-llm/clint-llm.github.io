Pharmacy encompasses the research, production, distribution, disposal, and indications of any medications or drugs. The Federal Drug Administration (FDA) has oversight duties over distribution and, therefore, pharmacy, while state and local governments have some authority within their jurisdictions. While Congress has legislative duties, the FDA also can create and modify regulations.
