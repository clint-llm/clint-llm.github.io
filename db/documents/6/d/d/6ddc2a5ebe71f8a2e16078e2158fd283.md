A histopathologic examination of corneal tissue and cochlea by multiple groups showed plasma cells and lymphocytes infiltration, indicating a cell-mediated reaction that may explain the audiovestibular dysfunction, which includes severe vertigo, bilateral fluctuating hearing loss, and tinnitus.

In addition to cochlear neuron loss, endolymphatic hydrops, new bone formation, degenerative changes in the organ of Corti, and atrophy and demyelination of vestibulocochlear cranial nerve may be noted.

Further pathologic findings that are nonspecific yet compatible with a chronic inflammatory process include damaged aortic valves in aortitis, aortic valve cusp detachments and outpouchings, thinning or thickening, fenestrations, and retraction.

Microscopically, lymphoid cell infiltration, myxomatous changes, and fibrinoid necrosis were revealed in the affected valves.
