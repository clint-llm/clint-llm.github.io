Immunization has become a vital part of public health and disease prevention, yet remain a controversial topic. Diseases which were once responsible for significant morbidity and mortality have now become all but eradicated, thanks to the introduction of vaccines. However, an anti-vaccination movement has resulted in a resurgence of diseases which until recently had been well-controlled. For example, measles is currently undergoing a global resurgence because not all individuals have agreed to be immunized against it. Immunization plays a role in the increased life expectancy and improved quality of life that civilization benefits from. This activity describes the indications, contraindications, and complications associated with immunizations and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in providing education to the public regarding the benefits of vaccination.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the indications for immunization.
- Review the contraindications to immunizations.
- Summarize the complications of immunizations.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for optimizing care coordination and communication to enhance approaches for educating the public about the benefits of immunizations.
