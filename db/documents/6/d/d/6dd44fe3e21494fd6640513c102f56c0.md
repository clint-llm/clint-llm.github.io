Epididymitis is a frequent presentation to the emergency department. However, the diagnosis can often be confused with testicular torsion, which is a surgical emergency. The emergency department provider, nurse practitioner, and internist who encounter patients with testicular pain should consult with a urologist if there is any doubt about the diagnosis.

Patients with epididymitis should be educated about safe sex practice. In addition, these patients should be encouraged to drink plenty of fluids to flush the genitourinary tract and be compliant with antibiotic therapy.

The outcomes for most men with epididymitis are excellent, but relapses may occur in patients who are not compliant with therapy.
