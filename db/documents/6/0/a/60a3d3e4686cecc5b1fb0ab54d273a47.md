Urogenital symptoms induced by gonorrhea can be observed with other sexually transmitted diseases, as well as non-sexually transmitted illnesses. Sexually transmitted infections that can cause dysuria, penile discharge, abnormal vaginal discharge, and pelvic pain include Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Treponema pallidum, Mycoplasma genitalium, and herpes simplex virus.

Acute gonococcal infection can impact multiple organ systems. Infectious and noninfectious diseases can cause urethritis, cervicitis, proctitis, conjunctivitis, pharyngitis, and arthritis. Autoimmune, neoplastic, traumatic, and toxicologic etiologies must be considered when evaluating patients presenting with symptoms that raise suspicion of gonorrhea. The gonococcal infection itself can have autoimmune manifestations such as reactive arthritis in association with urethritis and conjunctivitis.
