Brain MRI shows a large, demarcated, solid mass with surrounding edema, often with significant mass effect. On T1-weighted images, they are hypointense but sometimes can be isointense; on T2-weighted images, they are isointense to hypertense, and the T1-weighted images with contrast shows patchy contrast enhancement.

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy shows a choline peak with reduced N-acetyl-aspartate and a high ratio of choline/aspartate.

Spinal MRI is usually required for the detection of seeding and prognosis.
