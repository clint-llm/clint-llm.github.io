The diagnosis is made clinically with symptoms of rapid onset symptoms within one hour of a fish meal. These symptoms include flushing, rash, headache, diarrhea, similar symptoms in those who also ate the same fish, and prompt improvement after antihistamine administration. The diagnosis may be confirmed by testing histamine levels in uneaten portions of fish or checking for elevated histamine levels in the urine.
