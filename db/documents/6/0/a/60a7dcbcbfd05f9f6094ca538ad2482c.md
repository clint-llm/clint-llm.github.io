Preparation for percutaneous transcatheter PFO closure starts with an evaluation of the patient to see if the patient qualifies for catheter closure; this is evaluated first with cranial imaging followed by echocardiogram with bubble study.  Additional pre-operative tests may include chest x-ray, electrocardiogram, and blood tests to assess the general health of the patient as well as kidney function. Before the procedure, all patients undergoing PFO closure should be pre-treated with antiplatelet therapy, commonly with both aspirin and Plavix daily. Warfarin therapy alone may be an option in patients who need chronic antithrombotic therapy followed by bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin before and after PFO closure. One hour before percutaneous access an intravenous antibiotic dose should be given, typically cefazolin or vancomycin, if they are allergic to penicillin. To avoid left atrial hypovolemia, patients should also receive IV normal saline before and during the procedure.
