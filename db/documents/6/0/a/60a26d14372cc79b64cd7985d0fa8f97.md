The CNS colloid cyst is best managed by an interprofessional team that also includes neurosurgeons, neurologists, radiologists, and neuroscience nurses. When a colloid cyst is diagnosed, the biggest dilemma is how to manage it. The minimally invasive approaches have less morbidity but have a higher rate of recurrence and reoperation. Removing a colloid cyst via a craniotomy has the highest up-front surgical risk but may have the lowest recurrence and reoperation rate. The open craniotomy provides more degrees of freedom for access to the colloid cyst and may be more suitable for larger colloid cysts but does have limitations based on the approach chosen. A thorough discussion should be undertaken with the patient and let him or her decide which approach they favor. Specialty-trained nurses in perianesthesia, operating room, and critical assist in the care monitor patients and report changes in status to the team. An interprofessional team approach will result in gest outcomes. [Level 5]
