The etiologies for papilledema are those that raise intracranial pressure.  The Monro-Kellie hypothesis describes ICP as a function of its total volume of blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and brain parenchyma within the fixed cranial space.  As the volume within the intracranial space goes up, a corresponding decrease in volume from another intracranial component must go down which can be seen with both clinical and radiologic manifestations such as a headache and decreased cerebral blood flow.  Inadequate compensation for this can result in high ICP and can be seen in the following scenarios: space-occupying lesion such as tumor or hemorrhage, increase in CSF such as from obstructive hydrocephalus, increase in blood volume such as from venous sinus thrombosis, or by idiopathic intracranial hypertension.
