The suboccipital muscles form an anatomic landmark of particular importance to surgeons operating within the posterior cervical spine or posterior cranial fossa region. The suboccipital triangle forms a distinct area where surgeons can recognize the vertebral artery and its position within the posterior cervical region. The close relationship between the suboccipital muscles and the vertebral artery may be relevant in patients with significant atherosclerosis. Contraction of the suboccipital muscles may lead to minor compression of the artery, which further reduces blood flow. The decreased blood flow can lead to symptoms of light-headedness and dizziness. Additionally, the suboccipital muscles can be strained by constant movement or injury. This may lead to headaches or neck pain that can be relieved through physical therapy and pain control.

**Cervicogenic Headaches**

Cervicogenic headaches initially present as unilateral neck pain and spread to the head. The painÂ becomes worse with movement or palpation of the neck. This type of headache can commonly be mistaken for migraines or tension headaches. The pain may radiate to other areas, including the shoulder and arm. The suboccipital muscles have been investigated as a potential cause of cervicogenic headaches. In one study, the suboccipital muscles were found to have increased tone and stiffness compared to healthy controls.

Other studies have implicated the C1-C3 nerves as potential causes of cervicogenic headaches.

**Post Dural Puncture Headache (PDPH)**

Pregnant women at full term who are undergoing cesarean section anesthesia for the surgery, and this is most commonly achieved by a regional technique, by administering anesthetic drugs into intradural space, alone or in combination with ongoing drug administration in the epidural space.

The management of post-dural puncture headaches has been a topic of debate, with current practice favoring the placement of an epidural blood patch as a treatment for the presumed pathological mechanism of CSF leak following the puncture

**Suboccipital Muscle Trauma**

Owing to their function as supporters and enablers of head and neck movements, the suboccipital muscles are vulnerable to strain and spasms in trauma, for example, whiplash in car accidents or other rapid deceleration injuries.
