Thermal burns are skin injuries caused by excessive heat, typically from contact with hot surfaces, hot liquids, steam, or flame. Most burns are minor and patients can be treated as outpatients or at local hospitals. Approximately 6.5 percent of all burn victims are treated in specialized burn centers. The decision to transfer and treat at burn centers is based on the extent of body surface area burned, the depth of the burns and individual patient characteristics such as age, additional injuries or other medical problems. This activity will review burn evaluation and management and highlight the role of the interprofessional team in recognizing and treating thermal burns.

**Objectives:**
- Recall the causes of thermal burns.
- Describe the pathophysiology of thermal burns.
- Identify the treatment strategy for a patient with thermal burns.
- Outline the importance of enhancing care coordination among the interprofessional team to ensure proper evaluation and management of thermal burns.
