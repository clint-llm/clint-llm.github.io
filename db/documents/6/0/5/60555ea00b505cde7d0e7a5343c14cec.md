Eye trauma is prevalent, resulting in loss of vision in many people. Without vision, one becomes handicapped, and getting a suitable job is difficult. In many cases, ocular eye injury is preventable, and the onus is on all clinicians to educate patients on eye safety. An interprofessional team is probably the best way to educate and monitor patients with eye trauma. Because of a serious shortage of eye surgeons, most patients are followed up by the primary care provider or nurse practitioner as outpatients.

Eye trauma commonly presents to the emergency department. However, in the ED, besides a superficial exam including a visual acuity test, analysis of deeper injury to the eye is not always possible. Hence, healthcare workers, including nurse practitioners, should always consult with the ophthalmologistÂ on call to assess the eye.

The emergency department physician may treat superficial lacerations around the eye, but all patients with vision loss should be referred to the ophthalmologist. During follow-up, the nurse practitioner and primary care provider should communicate with the eye surgeon if there are any vision-related problems.

Missing eye injuries can lead to permanent visual loss and may include prolonged litigation.

Finally, all clinicians should educate patients on eye safety, such as wearing face helmets and safety goggles when working with splashing liquids or flying debris.
