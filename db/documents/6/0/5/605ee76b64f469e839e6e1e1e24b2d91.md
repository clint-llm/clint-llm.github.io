The process of swallowing, also known as deglutition, involves the movement of substances from the mouth (oral cavity) to the stomach via the pharynx and esophagus. Swallowing is an essential and complex behavior learned very early in development. This pathway shares anatomy with the airway; thus, in addition to directing food into the digestive tract, the swallowing mechanism serves as a vital protector of the airway. The reflexive and voluntary actions of over 30 nerves and muscles produce this coordinated movement.
