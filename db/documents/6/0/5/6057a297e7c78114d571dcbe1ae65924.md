Sleep health and hygiene should also be discussed with patients who have metabolic syndrome because sleep apnea and sleep deprivation can lead to the development of metabolic syndrome. Studies have shown that in patients with moderate to severe sleep apnea,Â 3 months of continuous positive airway pressure can reduce blood pressure and potentially reverse some metabolic syndrome abnormalities.

To recognize the development of metabolic syndrome is crucial to treatment, prevention, and reversal of the disease process. Through history and physical exam, patient education, and workup of the contributing factors appropriately, physicians can not only treat the metabolic syndrome but also potentially alter the trajectory of disease development.
