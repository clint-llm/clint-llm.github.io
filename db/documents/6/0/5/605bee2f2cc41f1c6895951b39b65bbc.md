Acute GVHD can occur in up to 50% of patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling

Risk factors of acute GVHD are higher degrees of HLA mismatch, prior acute GVHD gender disparity, older age of the donor and/or recipient, peripheral stem cell recipients, alloimmunization of the donor, Cytomegalovirus and Epstein Barr virus seropositivity
