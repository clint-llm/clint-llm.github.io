Clinical examination is the mainstay of diagnosis of macular hole (MH). Associated features are also evident usually in the clinical examination. But as it is a disease of old age, associated cataract or other media opacities make it harder for the surgeon sometimes. OCT is the gold standard in the diagnosis, management, and follow-up in MH. It gives the three-dimensional cross-sectional picture of the hole and associated abnormality i.e., epiretinal membrane (ERM) or VMT mainly. It helps to prognosticate pre-operatively and follow up postoperatively. Different MH indices are now calculated to define the prognosis of the case

Fundus fluorescence angiography shows central round hyperfluorescence due to a window defect. It may be done if associated with PCV, RAM, DR. Only macular hole does not usually need evaluation with angiography unless there are other factors including unexplained severe vision loss and others.

A method to confirm the macular hole and the pseudo hole is macular microperimetry using a scanning laser ophthalmoscope where functional follow-up can also be done.
