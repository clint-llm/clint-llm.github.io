Symptoms of a yeast infection may mimic other conditions. Hence physical examination and laboratory testing are very important. The risk factors that may increase the chances of developing a yeast infection include antibiotic usage, diabetes mellitus, pregnancy, hormonal birth control, and immunocompromised conditions such as  HIV, chemotherapy, or some medications. It is essential to test and diagnose accurately when symptoms are bothersome and before starting any treatment.
