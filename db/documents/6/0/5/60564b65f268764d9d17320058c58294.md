A thorough history and physical examination, including an exploration of triggers and exposures are essential to the diagnosis. A potassium hydroxide preparation (KOH prep) should be performed for any scaly erythematous eruption on the palms and soles to rule out dermatophytes. A biopsy is often needed, as palmoplantar psoriasis can be indistinguishable from eczematous hand dermatitides and to also rule out tinea. Histopathologic examination of psoriatic lesions shows parakeratosis, decrease/loss of the granular layer of the epidermis, psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia and Munro microabscesses (neutrophils in stratum corneum). In palmoplantar psoriasis, foci of parakeratosis vertically oriented alternating with orthohyperkeratosis are seen. Laboratory investigations can include c-reactive protein (CRP) and uric acid levels, both of which are elevated in the pustular variant.

Several assessment tools have been developed to help clinicians assess and measure the severity of skin disease activity and response to treatment. Palmoplantar pustulosis and palmoplantar psoriasis are monitored using the Palmoplantar Pustulosis Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PPPASI) and the Palmoplantar Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PPASI), respectively. The Palmar-Plantar Quality-of-Life Index is a statistically unverified assessment tool used in studies to quantify disease severity and quality of life.
