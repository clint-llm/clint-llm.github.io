ISSNHL has high rates of spontaneous recovery; reported rates range from 32 to 65%. ITS treatment modality needs to be used cautiously due to a lack of confirmed understanding of the underlying etiology of some inner ear diseases.

An interprofessional team, particularly between the otolaryngologist, audiovestibular doctor, and audiologist, should provide a holistic and integrated approach to care that can help achieve the best possible outcomes.

It is important that the ISSNHL is recognized early and referred appropriately to give these patients the opportunity access to ITS, should it be appropriate. Studies have shown that earlier time to initiating injections produce higher rates of hearing improvement.

A study by Sugihara et al. (2018) suggested the frequency of intratympanic steroid injections does not significantly affect hearing outcomes.

Following treatment, there should be an audiological follow-up with a repeat audiometric assessment. One study found that the recovery rate on the 7th day of treatment to be useful for predicting final hearing recovery.
