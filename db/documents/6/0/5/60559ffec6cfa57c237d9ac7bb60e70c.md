Eccrine sweat glands receive sympathetic innervation via cholinergic fibers that send impulses as a physiologic response to core body temperature control during times of physical or psychological stress. The thermoregulatory center of the hypothalamus mediates sympathetic innervation to the sweat glands. Cholinergic stimulation of muscarinic receptors induces sweating. Hyperhidrosis involves hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system, causing excessive release of acetylcholine from the nerve ending. It is believed that the negative feedback mechanism to the hypothalamus may be impaired, causing the body to sweat more than what is needed to cool the body. This pathologic reaction can be triggered by medications that increase the release of acetylcholine from the neuron or systemic medical disorders, which also upregulate a sympathetic response.
