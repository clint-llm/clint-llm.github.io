Most ADH cases follow either blunt or penetrating trauma to the thorax or abdomen. A clear history of trauma should prompt appropriate imaging to determine the extent of the injury, which may then demonstrate the presence of ADH. For other causes of ADH, it is crucial to consider the patient's previous surgical history as this may provide a cause of ADH. Patients can present with ADH in a variety of ways. Respiratory, abdominal, and in some cases, cardiac symptoms are predicted.
