Significant risk factors associated with simple limbal epithelial transplantation (SLET) failure include the following:

- Chemical burns

- Symblepharon presence before surgery and simultaneous SLET

- Penetrating keratoplasty.

Failure most often occurs within six months after surgery. Significant complications in the donor eye have not been observed.

The most common complication seen in the treated eye is focally recurrent LSCD. If the recurrent LSCD is not progressing or affecting the visual axis, it may be monitored, and repeat SLET has successfully treated recurrent LSCD.

Hemorrhage under the amniotic membrane may occur, but often resolves or only requires drainage via a needle puncture.

Sterile or infectious keratitis may develop and has been described to respond well to treatment and topical antibiotics. If superficial corneal haze is present, topical cyclosporine 0.05% drops are prescribed for several months.

Complications that may cause graft failure include progressive conjunctivalization, symblepharon, and loss of donor tissue attached to the bandage contact lens.

Rare complications include corneal neovascularization, epithelial hyperplasia, and PED. Â Allogenic SLET will have a risk of immunologic rejection that may be treated with an increased dose of intravenous and oral Immunosuppressants.
