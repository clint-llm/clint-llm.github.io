Individuals planning for IVF undergo several evaluations prior to the start of the treatment cycle. The womanâ€™s ovarian reserve is evaluated using either cycle day three follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol (E2), anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), or antral follicle count. If the woman is determined to have poor ovarian reserve based on any of these values, she can still pursue IVF but may need to consider the use of donor oocytes.

The male partner has a semen analysis to decide whether ICSI is indicated, based on sperm morphology, count, and motility. Uterine cavity imaging identifies any anatomical issues, including endometrial polyps or fibroids, adhesions, or septa that may interfere with embryo implantation. Infectious disease screening for HIV, hepatitis B, and C and syphilis is recommended for both partners.
