Hearing loss can present in different ways depending on the age of the child. Hearing loss in neonates is almost exclusively picked up via newborn screening programme assessments. In older children, parents or other professionals such as school teachers, may notice delayed language skills, behavioral problems or listening to the television at raised volumes. In the history, it is important to ascertain whether there are any associated otological symptoms such as otorrhoea, otalgia, tinnitus, or vertigo. A thorough history is required including asking about any other neurological symptoms, medical history including drug history and precipitating events such as trauma, recent viral infections or new medications.

The examination will involve assessing the ear including the appearance of the pinna particularly inspecting for any deformities such as microtia or anotia. Otoscopic examination of the external auditory canal and tympanic membrane is crucial, with special attention on the attic for cholesteatoma. An examination should also include assessment of cranial nerves, a full neurological assessment, and assessment of balance depending on the age of the child.

With the implementation of Universal Newborn Hearing Screening program, today most patiets are identified within a few months after birth, with intervention started by 6 months.
