Beginning in week 4, the pharyngeal apparatus forms which involves the paired pharyngeal arches, grooves, and pouches. The masseter muscle is a muscle of mastication formed from paraxial mesoderm mesenchyme of pharyngeal arch one (mandibular arch). Each of the pharyngeal arches is a core of mesenchyme covered by a layer of ectoderm externally and a layer of endoderm internally. Somitomeres are loose clusters of cells that develop alongside the neural tube and notochord. There are seven cranial pairs of somitomeres which invade the pharyngeal arches to form the myoblasts that give rise to the larynx, pharynx, and muscles of facial expression and mastication (including the masseter muscle).
