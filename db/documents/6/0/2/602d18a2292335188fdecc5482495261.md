American Indians and Alaska Natives form a heterogeneous population with widely diverse cultures, languages, history, art forms, religious and spiritual beliefs, and traditional practices. Although great resilience exists among this population, the legacy of colonialism, a history of genocidal practices, and intergenerational trauma have led to extreme health disparities. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of American Indians and Alaska Natives through a structurally competent lens and highlights opportunities for intervention at the individual, community, and structural levels to promote health and health care equity.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the etiology of chronic disease among the American Indian and Alaska Native populations. 
- Outline the influence of upstream structures on American Indian and Alaska Native population health.
- Explain the importance of providing contextually tailored, culturally sensitive, strength-based care to American Indian and Alaska Native patients.
- Review the role of the interprofessional team for patients with a history of intergenerational trauma.
