Inflammatory back pain is a chronic pain condition typically associated with an insidious onset of pain localized to the lower back and buttocks. Its pathophysiology is thought to stem from a systemic inflammatory response to some insult with inflammatory mediators that localize to the axial skeletal joints and induce pro-inflammatory intracellular changes. This chronic inflammatory condition results in a cycle of unbalanced bone remodeling associated with bone loss and possible bone fusion.

Inflammatory back pain correlates with the onset of pain before age 40, the persistence of pain for 3 or more months, morning stiffness that improves with mobility or exercise, and an insidious presentation of pain symptoms.
