Since uterine contractions are always present in a thriving uterus, they are differentiated on the basis of frequency, amplitude, duration, and direction of propagation. Although there have been recent advances in knowledge regarding uterine contractions, there still remains a huge gap in understanding the related physiology at the cellular and molecular levels.  Knowledge of the process of uterine contractions that eventually leads to the expulsion of the baby will help clinicians identify abnormalities that may lead to obstetrical complications, such as preterm labor and arrest of labor. This will also aid the pharmacists in developing and improving the drugs used for labor augmentation, induction, and tocolysis. Uterine contractions also play an essential role in minimizing postpartum bleeding, which explains why many drugs used to treat this complication target the pathway involved in myometrial contractility.
