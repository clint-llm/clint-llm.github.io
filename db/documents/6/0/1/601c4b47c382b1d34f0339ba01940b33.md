Differential diagnosis includes any febrile illness with rash, which could be due to viral etiology such as infectious mononucleosis, chickenpox, to bacterial diseases such as Lyme disease and streptococcal infection. Connective tissue disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus should be considered as well. Infections due to other rickettsiae that present with rash or eschar, ehrlichial infections which present with fever and thrombocytopenia, Orientia infections, which produces eschar, and leptospiral infections, which present with fever and abnormal liver enzymes are all part of the differential diagnosis. Febrile illness with multisystem involvement such as dengue should also be considered.
