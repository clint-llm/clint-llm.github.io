Progestin drugs are administered in a variety of ways. The choice depends on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, clinical indication, special populations, patient preferences, patient adherence, insurance coverage, and financial burden. The most commonly prescribed progestin-containing drugs are combination oral contraceptives (COCs), and other options for combination contraceptives consist of a transdermal patch and vaginal ring. However, women who desire a progestin-only contraceptive must decide among the norethindrone or drospirenone progestin-only pills (POPs), etonogestrel implant, levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices (IUDs), and depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) injection.

DMPA injections are given every three months and are available as 150 mg in 1 mL for intramuscular injection and 104 mg in 0.65 mL for subcutaneous injection. For progestin-only methods, the IUD and implant are the most effective options, followed by DPMA injections and then the pill. The progestin-only IUD, implant, and injectable are also more effective than combined oral contraceptives.
