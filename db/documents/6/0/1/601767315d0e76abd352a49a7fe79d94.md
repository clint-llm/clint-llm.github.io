Phocomelia and the thalidomide controversy was a critical step forward in the regulatory practices of pharmacology. The most important responsibility of the healthcare community, regarding phocomelia, is the prevention of prescribing unsafe medications that can cause limb truncation; this occurs through careful prescribing practices and thorough patient education.

For patients born with limb hypoplasia, as is seen in phocomelia, an interdisciplinary team of specialists needs to examine the patient to screen for associated abnormalities that may be fatal, as half of the patients with phocomelia and amelia have associated defects. As many related abnormalities of the heart, vertebrae, or other vital organs may be life-threatening, these anomalies should be addressed promptly by consulting physicians. If surgical intervention is required, a dedicated OR team, including a nurse, scrub technician, and surgical assists, must be well-versed in any operative plan and work efficiently as a team to optimize patient outcomes.

Finally, a prosthetist and therapist can help a developing child with disabilities to function at a higher level. Families caring for disabled children are often under tremendous financial and emotional strain. Therefore, appropriate mental health counseling and social work may be necessary for caring not only for the patient but for their families as well. [Level 5]
