The incidence of neurological sequelae in survivors of pneumococcal meningitis remains high. Kastenbauer et al., in their study of adults, showed that meningitis-associated intracranial complications concerned 74.7% of the patients after pneumococcal meningitis and systemic complications touched over one-third of the patients. Some of the complications were seizure (27.6%), diffuse brain swelling (28.7%), hearing loss (19.7%), ischemic or hemorrhagic brain damage (21.8%), and hydrocephalus (16.1%).

In children, the developmental delay was the most common long-term post-pneumococcal meningitis sequelae concerning 43% of the enrolled children.

Long-term morbidity in survivors of GBS meningitis is significant. One-fourth of the children with GBS meningitis had a mild-to-moderate impairment; almost 20% showed severe impairment when assessed later.
