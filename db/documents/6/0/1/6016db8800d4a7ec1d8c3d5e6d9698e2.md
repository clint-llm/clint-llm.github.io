Before proceeding with the exam and OMT, the clinician should inform the patient of the risks, benefits, and alternative treatment options. Once the patient has given informed consent, the physician should continue with the physical examination.Â  The clinician should first evaluate the fibular head before providing the patient with OMT. First, the clinician should palpate the fibular head, which is lateral and slightly distal to the knee. Next, the patient should be placed supine on the table with the knee flexed. The clinician should place their thumb and index finger on the anterior and posterior aspects of the fibular head, respectively. The clinician should then attempt to move the fibular head anterolaterally and posteromedially to identify any restrictions in motion. A restriction in anterolateral motion means the patient has a posterior fibular head, whereas a restriction in posteromedial motion means the patient has an anterior fibular head.
