For the general population, a diet that contains a daily amount of folic acid below the established upper intake level of 1000 mcg has not been demonstrated to result conclusively in any adverse health outcomes. The U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) examined areas of previous concern, including cognition (relating to vitamin B12 deficiency), cancer, diabetes- and thyroid-related disorders, and hypersensitivity-related outcomes. Researchers identified these areas from previous reports of patients receiving more than 400 mcg daily. Overall, the NTP report concluded that no definitive evidence exists for the areas considered for adverse effects due to folic acid.

This report and other literature reviews performed since draw their conclusions while still emphasizing the need for further investigation. But, overall, the benefits that stand to be gained from folic acid intake justify any potential risk that might be encountered. Furthermore, the mandatory folic acid fortification program guidelines in countries worldwide have yielded no established risks for adverse effects.
