A palpable distal pulse is not adequate for the assessment of normal vascular function in this injury. Therefore, further workup and evaluation are mandatory to rule out any possible popliteal arterial insult that may have occurred during the dislocation. Any sign of vascular compromise mandates emergent vascular surgery consultation.

Delay in the diagnosis of popliteal artery injury may result in irreversible injury and ischemia, requiring above-knee amputation.  Generally, any persistent ischemia greater than eight hours will necessitate amputation. Delayed thrombosis is also possible and may not be present during the initial evaluation.

Other injuries that the clinician may encounter include peroneal nerve injury, a cause of foot drop. Compartment syndrome and deep venous thrombosis are among other possible complications. Associated fractures and ligamentous injuries should receive treatment as per orthopedic surgery recommendations.
