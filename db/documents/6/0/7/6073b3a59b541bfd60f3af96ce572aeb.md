Giant condyloma of Bushke-Löwenstein (GCBL) is a type of verrucous carcinoma first described by Buschke and Löwenstein in 1925. It is a rare form of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) that most commonly appears on the glans penis, foreskin, or perianal regions, but can also be found on other anogenital regions e.g., the vulva, vagina or the bladder.

GCBL is a slow-growing tumor, which in spite of its benign histopathology, is clinically malignant owing mostly to its locally destructive nature and its tendency to recur. GCBL ulcerates and invades deeper tissues, but does not generally metastasize. Malignant transformations of this tumor have been reported.
