Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm is an uncommon myeloid cancer. Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm typically manifests as cutaneous lesions with or without the involvement of extramedullary organs and leukemic spread. Given the clinical obscurity of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm, it might be challenging to distinguish it from benign skin lesions or other neoplastic conditions with cutaneous involvement, such as T-cell lymphoma. Tagraxofusp is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved first-line treatment for blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm in adults and children older than two years. If tagraxofusp is unavailable or in children under two, chemotherapy regimens for acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoid leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome are appropriate alternatives. Unfortunately, relapse is common, and overall survival rates are dismal. In adults, allogeneic stem cell transplantation improves overall survival during initial remission.
