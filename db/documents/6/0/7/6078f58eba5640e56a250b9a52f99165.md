Tafamidis is an innovative drug used to treat certain forms of ATTR amyloidosis (Transthyretin). ATTR amyloidosis is due to transthyretin (prealbumin) misfolding, which becomes unstable and deposits within the extracellular space of mainly cardiac tissue and nerves.

However, in the United States, a predominantly cardiac phenotype is seen due to the high prevalence of V122I mutation (3.5%) in the African American population.

In the multinational ATTR-ACT study, 441 patients with cardiomyopathy (24% ATTRv and 76% ATTRwt) were randomized to receive either tafamidis 80mg or tafamidis 20mg or a placebo once daily for 30 months.

In November 2011, tafamidis was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to treat ATTR amyloidosis to delay neurological progression in patients with stage 1 polyneuropathy.

In 2019, the FDA granted tafamidis priority review, fast track, and breakthrough therapy designations to treatÂ the cardiomyopathy of wild type or hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR-CM). In addition, tafamidis and tafamidis meglumine also obtained orphan drug designation, which provides incentives for developing drugs for rare diseases.
