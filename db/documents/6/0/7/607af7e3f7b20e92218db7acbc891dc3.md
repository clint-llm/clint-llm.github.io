The differential diagnoses of guttate psoriasis include tinea corporis, secondary syphilis, nummular eczema, and pityriasis rosea. Guttate psoriasis can be distinguished from these entities by history and physical exam, although further studies such as potassium hydroxide (KOH) scrapings and serologies may be helpful in ruling out the other disorders in the differential diagnoses.
