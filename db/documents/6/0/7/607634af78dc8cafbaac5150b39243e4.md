The significant complications of malaria are cerebral malaria, severe malarial anemia, and nephrotic syndrome (NS).

Cerebral malaria accounts for 80% of fatal malaria cases, most often occurring with P. falciparum infection.

Increased brain volume is the major contributor to mortality in cerebral malaria. In a 2015 study of Malawian children with cerebral malaria, 84% of those who died had severely increased brain volume on MRI; children who survived showed lower initial brain volume or a downtrend over time.

Severe malarial anemia stems from TNF-alpha-mediated mechanisms involving both increased destruction and decreased production of erythrocytes, including cell lysis as parasites replicate and exit erythrocytes, splenic removal and autoimmune lysis of immune-marked erythrocytes, poor iron incorporation into new heme molecules, and bone marrow suppression during severe infection leading to decreased production.

Nephrotic syndrome occurs secondary to glomerular antigen-antibody complex deposition and presents similarly to membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with proteinuria and decreased renal function, which may lead to renal failure.Â Nephrotic syndrome is common in P. malariae and P. knowlesi, possible in P. vivax, and rare in P. falciparum and P. ovale infections.

Additional complications include:

- Bilious remittent fever presents with abdominal pain and persistent vomiting that may lead to severe dehydration, jaundice, and dark urine.

- Algid malaria is an adrenal insufficiency due to parasitic congestion and subsequent necrosis of the adrenal glands.

- Acute respiratory distress syndrome, circulatory collapse, disseminated intravascular coagulation, pulmonary edema, coma, and death.

Malaria infection during pregnancy may result in low birth weight or fetal demise.
