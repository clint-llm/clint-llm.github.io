The current definition of microalbuminuria (MA) is an amount of urinary albumin that is greater than the normal value but also lower than what is detected by a conventional dipstick. Thus, the rate of urine albumin excretion (UAE) in microalbuminuria is 30 to 300 mg/d. This activity outlines the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of microalbuminuria. It describes the future possible sequelae of microalbuminuria without intervention. Additionally, it highlights the importance of the interprofessional team’s role in screening, managing, and treating this disease and its comorbidities to improve the patient’s quality of life.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiologic basis of microalbuminuria.
- Describe the expected lab findings for a patient with microalbuminuria.
- Outline the recommended management strategies for microalbuminuria.
- Summarize the need for an interprofessional team approach to caring for a patient with microalbuminuria.
