Nurses routinely provide care across multiple settings for patients with cerebral palsy. Providers rely on nursing staff to perform a multitude of crucial tasks in the perioperative setting, including obtaining venous access, assessing pain scores, administering medications, and detecting and intervening on complications. Allied health professionals are similarly of the utmost importance in the postoperative rehabilitation of patients with cerebral palsy. Therefore, all healthcare professionals must understand cerebral palsy and its broad spectrum of clinical manifestations and be able to provide an individualized approach to each patient to ensure the best outcomes.
