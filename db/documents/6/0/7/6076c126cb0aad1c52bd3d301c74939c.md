The posterior articular branches of the tibial nerve are the major neural structure that innervates the ACL.

A few neural mechanoreceptors are located within the ACL, and they are primarily Ruffini receptors, which function as stretch receptors, and free nerve-endings, which function as nociceptors. The free nerve-endings also function as local effectors and secrete neuropeptides with vasoactive function.
