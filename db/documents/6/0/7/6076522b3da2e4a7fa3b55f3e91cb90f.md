Scene safety is an important concept to remember and practice when working in the field. First responders should always protect themselves and their teams while working in the field -- both before and while rendering patient care. Keeping a high suspicion for danger through observation and preparedness will result in a successful mission. First responders must be safe and healthy to ensure that their patients remain safe.
