**Inhalation Sedation with Nitrous Oxide/Oxygen**

In general, adverse effects or serious complications are rare. Examples are:

- Vomiting or nausea

- Laryngospasm

- Diffusion hypoxia

- Nitrous-oxide-induced vitamin B12 inactivation

Intravenous sedation with midazolam:

**Potential Complications**

- Nausea and vomiting

- Transient desaturations

- Paradoxical reactions

- Dizziness

- Drowsiness

- Hiccough

- Hallucinations

- Respiratory depression

**Oral Sedation with Diazepam**

As diazepam and midazolam are the same drug class, their potential complications are similar. They would be less likely in oral sedation due to the route of administration.
