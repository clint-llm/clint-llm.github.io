Before bosentan emerged as a treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension, the only other available treatments were intravenous medications, such as epoprostenol. Bosentan has since become first-line therapy for patients with pulmonary artery hypertension and has been shown in clinical trials to be effective as monotherapy or more widely used as part of combination therapy. Due to its relatively low possibility of toxicity, ease of administration, effectiveness, and disease-modifying abilities, bosentan remains one of the go-to medications when treating patients with pulmonary artery hypertension. Continued research is needed to understand which combination therapy proves to have the best outcomes while maintaining little to no toxicity.

When using bosentan for pulmonary arterial hypertension, it is best to employ an interprofessional team approach with clinicians (including mid-level practitioners), specialists, specialty-trained nursing staff, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to guide cases to optimal outcomes with minimal adverse effects or drug interactions.
