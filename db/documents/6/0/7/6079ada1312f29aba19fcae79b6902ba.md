- Maintain a high level of suspicion for a carotid-cavernous fistula following high-velocity trauma when symptoms of blurry vision, eye and face pain, double vision, and ptosis develop someÂ days or even weeks after the trauma.

- Type A fistulas (high-flow, post-traumatic fistulas) always need intervention to close the fistula.

- Spontaneous closure may occur in Type B, C, and D fistulas.

- Neuro-ophthalmic assessment of vision, intraocular pressures, ocular movements, and assessment of the cranial nerves is vital.
