Rifaximin demonstrates poor absorption into the systemic blood system, and only trace amounts appear in the blood and urine following administration. Prior studies have shown less than 0.4% of the medication detectable in the blood or urine and undetectable levels in bile and breast milk. For this reason, the monitoring of rifaximin is unnecessary.

However, the clinician should monitor disease progression (e.g., response to rifaximin treatment can be monitored by lactulose breath test in patients withÂ IBS-D).
