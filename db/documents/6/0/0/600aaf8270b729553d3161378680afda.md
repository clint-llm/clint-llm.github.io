Classically, students are taught that all dorsal interossei, except for the third, have two heads (bipennate) and all palmar interossei possess one head (unipennate). One retrospective study found that approximately 25 percent of dorsal interossei and only 62 percent of palmar interossei were unipennate.

As previously mentioned, most contemporary anatomy texts teach that the first palmar interosseous muscle is commonly a component of either the adductor pollicis or the flexor pollicis brevis and rarely functional on its own. The notion that the first palmar interosseous muscle is an independent and function intrinsic hand muscle was first suggested by Henle (1858), with several recent studies supporting this claim.
