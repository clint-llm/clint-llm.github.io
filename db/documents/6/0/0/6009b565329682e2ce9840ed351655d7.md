The submental triangle is clinically relevant because tumors and cysts develop within its limits, and abscesses from other regions extend to the area. Furthermore, swollen submental lymph nodes raise suspicion about malignant lesions in their tributary regions. However, lesions of the submental triangle usually develop from a local and benign pathology of the head and neck

A study of 24 masses found in the submental triangle revealed various entities, including lipoma, sarcoidosis, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, hemangioma, abscess, dermoid cyst, and reactive lymphoid hyperplasia

A congenital lymphatic malformation can manifest as a submental space mass, which is suggested by clear fluid in the fine needle aspiration and low flow lesion in ultrasonography with Doppler

The submental lymph nodes are commonly involved in the metastasis of oral cavity cancer

**Submental Lymph Nodes Assessment**

The cut-off value of the size of the submental lymph nodes by measuring the short axis to the long axis ratio is 0.5
