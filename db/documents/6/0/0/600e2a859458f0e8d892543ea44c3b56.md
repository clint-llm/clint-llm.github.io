The etiology of CHD is still largely unknown. Many cases of CHD are multifactorial and result from a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental risk factors. CCHD is usually isolated and sporadic, but it can also be associated with genetic syndromes. Approximately 15% to 20% of infants with CCHD are related to known chromosomal abnormalities, most of these are aneuploidies (trisomy 21, 13, and 18 and Turner syndrome). Potential environmental risk factors include maternal illnesses, including diabetes and phenylketonuria, maternal exposure to toxins or drugs and viral infections during pregnancy.
