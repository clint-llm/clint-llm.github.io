In a study by Griepentrog et al., simple congenital ptosis was the most common form of congenital ptosis (81%), with the mean age of diagnosis of 3.7 years (0.1 to 16.7). Age and sex-adjusted incidence of simple congenital ptosis are 5.9 (4.6-7.2). Male preponderance was seen in patients with simple congenital ptosis (males 57%, females 43%). 11.7% of simple congenital ptosis gave a positive family history of ptosis. Bilateral involvement was seen in 4% of the cases, and out of all unilateral cases, 68% of patients had involvement of the left eye.
