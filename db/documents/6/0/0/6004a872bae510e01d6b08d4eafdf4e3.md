Small for gestational age (SGA) is defined as a birth weight of less than 10th percentile for gestational age. The burden of fetal growth-restricted (FGR) SGA is higher in resource-poor countries, and children born FGR SGA have a higher risk of mortality and morbidity during the neonatal period and beyond. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the evaluation and management of FGR SGA infants.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of fetal growth-restricted, small for gestational age newborns. 
- Describe the evaluation of fetal growth-restricted, small for gestational age newborns. 
- Outline the principles of management of fetal growth-restricted, small for gestational age newborns
