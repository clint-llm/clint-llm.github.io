As stated above, patient compliance with their medications, follow-up with specialists, and patient education is critical in preventing complications. At every patient encounter, the pharmacist, nurse, and clinicians should emphasize the importance of blood glucose control, long-termÂ complications, and management goals. The patient should be encouraged to modify their lifestyle to reduce the risk of complications. In addition, all people with diabetes should be made aware of the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and ways of managing it. Patients should be educated about available resources and the benefits of joining support groups. A dietitian should educate the patient about foods that can be consumed, and the nurse should educate the patient on blood glucose monitoring at home.
