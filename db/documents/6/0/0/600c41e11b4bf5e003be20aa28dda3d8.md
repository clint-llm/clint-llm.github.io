Epilepsia partialis continua (EPC) is an unusual manifestation of epilepsy composed of a sustained repetition of focal onset seizure fragments in rapid succession. EPC can range from anywhere between one hour to several years. EPC may occur as a single episode, repetitive episodes, or as a chronic progressive or non-progressive disorder. In some cases, EPC may spread or generalize.

A plethora of etiologies can be local or systemic. Several structural, metabolic and autoimmune disorders may cause EPC, ranging from strokes and hematomas to diseases like Rasmussen encephalitis. The diagnostic workup includes magnetic resonance imaging to clarify the etiology and EEG which typically shows focal epileptiform or slow wave activity but may vary from etiology to etiology. EEG may also be unrevealing and show no abnormal findings.

The symptoms of EPC have been interpreted to be due to cortical hyperexcitability, but the exact pathophysiology is poorly understood due to a high degree of variability. In general terms, EPC seems to represent an oscillation of excitation and inhibition in a feedback loop whose mechanisms are still not fully understood. It seems that EPC only occurs rarely in an otherwise healthy brain.

Treatment options are limited and specific etiologies have to be taken into consideration, but EPC has shown to be resistant to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Hemispherectomy may be a treatment choice in patients with Rasmussen encephalitis. The overall evidence is limited and mostly in the form of case series. A detailed neurological evaluation is warranted, coupled with a consultation with a group of specialists including neurologists, neurosurgeons, neurointensivists, and rehabilitation specialists. It is also important to note that patient attendants must be educated about this complicated disease and its management options.
