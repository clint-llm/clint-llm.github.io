There are over 9 million recreational scuba divers in the United States alone, and that number continues to rise. Because of this increasing population, the incidence of diving-related dysbarism has also increased. According to the Divers Alert Network (DAN), more than 1000 diving-related injuries occur annually, but less than 1% of divers experience DCS. Barotrauma is the most common form of diving-related injury, with middle ear barotrauma being the most common diving-related complaint. Pulmonary barotrauma is the second leading cause of death in divers (behind drowning).
