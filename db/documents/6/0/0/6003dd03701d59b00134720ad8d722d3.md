Epidural anesthesia can be used to supplement general anesthesia or as the main anesthesia method in certain surgical procedures involving thoracic, abdominal, pelvic, or lower extremities regions. However, spinal anesthesia is more commonly used in these instances.

Epidural analgesia is indicated for pain management during or after surgical procedures involving the regions previously mentioned, severe chronic pain in the context of malignancy, and for labor and delivery.
