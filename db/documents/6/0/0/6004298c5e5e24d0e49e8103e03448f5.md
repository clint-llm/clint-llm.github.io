Seborrheic keratoses are benign lesions and have a good overall prognosis. The primary reason for the treatment of seborrheic keratosis is cosmetic. There are multiple treatment modalities, which have good outcomes with minimal side effects or complications. Patients with numerous seborrheic keratosis should be evaluated more carefully as the high number of lesions can mask concomitant malignant lesions. The sign of Leser-Trelat is suggestive of an internal malignancy and would be associated with a worse prognosis.
