Performing surgery near the masseters requires consideration for the structures running near or originating from the muscle. Surgery of the masseter muscle is a component of facelift procedures, treatment of masseteric enlargement, or trauma. Careful consideration must be placed to not damage the masseteric ligament, fibers of the risorius muscle, and branches of the facial nerve.
