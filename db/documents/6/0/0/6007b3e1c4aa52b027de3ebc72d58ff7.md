Mixed venous oxygen saturation is so-called because it is the combination of venous blood from both the superior and inferior vena caval systems. Venous blood from the upper extremities and head returns to the heart via the superior vena cava (SVC), and venous blood from the lower extremities, renal, and splanchnic circulations returns to the heart via the inferior vena cava (IVC). Venous blood from both ends mixes within the right side of the heart to enter through the pulmonary artery to become oxygenated by the pulmonary circuit. Oxygenated blood, which contains oxyhemoglobin, enters the left heart through the pulmonary vein. Blood from the left side of the heart is pushed through the aorta into the systemic circulation to participate in gas exchange through vascular capillary beds. Venous blood now contains a relatively higher concentration of deoxyhemoglobin and returns to the venous system to be pushed through the heart again and oxygenated once more.

It is important to note that oxygen extraction occurs to different degrees between the upper and lower body. This is due to several factors, such as varying metabolic rates, blood flow, and oxygen consumption performed by different tissues. To illustrate this variation, venous oxygen saturation of specific organs has been estimated to be 37% for the heart versus 92% for the kidneys. With processes that cause more tissue oxygen demand, oxygen delivery can increase on multiple levels with increasing cardiac output, blood flow redistribution, and functional capillary density.

To measure mixed venous saturation, typically, a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) is utilized and is introduced via a central venous catheter and positioned in the pulmonary artery [as shown in the accompanying image]. Pressure waveform changes guide the positioning of PAC as it traverses through the right atrium to the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery since each chamber has its typical pressure waveform profile [see attached image.]
