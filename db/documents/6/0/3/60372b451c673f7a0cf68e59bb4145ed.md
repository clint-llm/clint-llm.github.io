Acetazolamide and topiramate are carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Their effect is to produce alkaline urine (which may sometimes be useful in uric acid urolithiasis) while decreasing citrate excretion.

Consider using 20 mEq potassium citrate (two 10 mEq tablets) at bedtime or with dinner for these patients where a 24-hour urine determination is not available.

Nephrolithiasis patients taking acetazolamide or topiramate, have had Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, or are on thiazide therapy can be presumed to have some degree of hypocitraturia even if they decline 24-hour urine testing. Consider starting these patients on potassium citrate therapy after discussing the pros and cons carefully with them.

Uric acid stone patients are more likely to have severe aciduria than hyperuricosuria or hyperuricemia. A blood test for serum uric acid is recommended as allopurinol can be justified based on hyperuricemia. Even without 24-hour urine testing, potassium citrate therapy can be reasonably offered to these patients based on their aciduria and stone composition. They can then be followed with urinary pH levels and their therapy titrated accordingly.

Urinary citrate is a potent inhibitor of calcium phosphate crystal growth and stone formation; it's responsible for about fifty percent of the normal, total chemical urinary inhibitory effect on calcium phosphate precipitation in normal urine.

**Hypocitraturia: Summary and Clinical Tips**

Potassium citrate is the mainstay of urinary citrate supplementation and alkalinization therapy.

Use dietary therapy (lemonade, orange juice, powdered lemonade). Grapefruit juice is not recommended, despite its high citrate levels, as it inhibits CYP 450 enzymes and does not seem to reduce overall urinary risk factors for stone formation.

Every 30 mEq of potassium citrate is expected to increase urinary citrate by 200 mg. Failure to do so indicates poor citrate absorption, for some reason. Consider switching to liquid citrate therapy and/or sodium bicarbonate.

Optimal urinary citrate significantly reduces the formation of all common stone types (calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, cystine, struvite, and uric acid). This means the clinician doesn't have to know the stone's chemical composition to use citrate therapy.

Monitor serum potassium periodically, especially in patients with renal failure and those taking 60 mEq or more of potassium citrate. Consider a low potassium citrate alternative if hyperkalemia develops.

Nephrolithiasis patients on acetazolamide, thiazides, or topiramate, as well as post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients, can generally be assumed to have some level of hypocitraturia, even without formal 24-hour urine testing.  Consider empiric citrate therapy, which can be monitored by urinary pH in patients unable or unwilling to do 24-hour urine testing.

Warn patients that seeing undissolved potassium citrate tablets in the stool is normal, and they should not be concerned or stop treatment. They see the wax matrix ghost carrier after the medication has been released.

Urinary alkalinization is the preferred treatment for uric acid stones, but using allopurinol or similar agents is recommended and will be very helpful in patients with elevated serum or urine uric acid levels.

Potassium citrate can also be used in calcium phosphate stone formers as long as the urinary pH is maintained below 7.2.

Generic potassium citrate is now reasonably affordable, and OTC citrate supplements are also available in pharmacies and online.

Suggested Optimal Range for Urinary Citrate and Guideline for Supplemental Citrate Therapy in Kidney Stone Formers:

- 24-hour urine citrate should optimally be 640 mg or more. Treatment is recommended if the daily citrate total is <500 mg.

- 24-hour urinary citrate concentration should be 320 mg/L or more. Consider supplemental therapy if the citrate concentration is <250 mg/L.

- Dosage of potassium citrate can be estimated as 30 mEq will roiughly increase daily urinary citrate by 200 mg.

- Urine pH: For most stone formers, the optimal pH is 6 to 6.5. In uric acid stone formers, the optimal urinary pH would be 6.5 for maintenance and 7 for stone dissolution.

- For cystinurics, the optimal urinary pH is 7 to 7.5, depending on cystine concentration.

- pH levels above 7.2 are not generally recommended (except in cystinuria), as this will promote calcium phosphate precipitation.
