Pilocarpine is a muscarinic acetylcholine agonist that is effective in the treatment and management of acute angle-closure glaucoma and radiation-induced xerostomia. Although not a first-line treatment for glaucoma, it is useful as an adjunct medication in the form of ophthalmic drops.Â Pilocarpine is approved for use as an agent to decrease intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma cases, as well as in the management of xerostomia resulting from radiation exposure and Sjogren disease.
