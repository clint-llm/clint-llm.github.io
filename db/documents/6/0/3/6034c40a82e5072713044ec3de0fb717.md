The NREMT is the governing body accountable for certifying trainees in EMS. To become certified, candidates must pass a 2-hour computer-adaptive multiple-choice question exam. At this time, there is no other skill assessment involved. Training programs that consistently had higher than a 75% first-time pass rate were interviewed with the intent of identifying the keys to the success of their graduates. The researchers identified 12 strategies common among these high-performing programs. Although simulation-based training was not explicitly mentioned as one of these strategies, most interviewed directors revealed the regular use of simulation as part of their curricula.

When developing a strong curriculum, directors should consider many different theories of adult learning. Miller’s pyramid is one model that references simulation as an essential component of the learning process. In this model, a learner progresses from Knowledge (e.g., gathering facts) to Competence (i.e., knowing how), to Performance (i.e., showing how), and finally to Action (e.g., integration of new skills into actual practice).

Not just any simulation will allow learners to successfully move from Miller’s third level to the final one. A quality simulation-based training session consists of several important components. First, the topic to be simulated, as well as the goals of learning, should be well-defined. The topic can be anything from a pediatric MCI to a single-patient dyspnea call, while the learning goals can be successful triage or successfully recognizing the need for and completing intubation. Second, the type of simulation tools to be used to achieve the learning goals should be identified. Third, checklist-based evaluation tools for learners and educators should be available.
