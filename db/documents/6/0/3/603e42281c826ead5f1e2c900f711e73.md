The musculature of the thoracic wall can be divided into 2 groups: those involved in inhalation and those responsible for forced exhalation. During inhalation, the anterior-posterior, vertical, and transverse dimensions of the thorax are increased. Contraction of the dome-shaped diaphragm causes the central tendon to be pulled inferiorly, flattening the diaphragm and increasing the vertical dimensions of the thorax.

Beyond the diaphragm compressing the abdominal cavity and the external intercostals lifting the ribs, the serratus posterior superior attaches to ribs 2 through 5 and elevates them during inhalation. When the neck is fixed, the scalene helps to elevate the first and second ribs. Likewise, the sternocleidomastoid can assist in raising the sternum.

Numerous muscles aid in forced exhalation. The internal intercostals are located deep to the external intercostals. While the external intercostals run inferomedially from superior rib to the adjacent inferior rib, the internal intercostals lie perpendicularly to the externals. This allows them to depress the ribs. The transversus thoracis spreads across the inner surface of the thoracic cage from the lower posterior sternum to ribs 2 through 6.
