Fetor ex-ore, fetor oris, oral malodor are terms that refer to repelling odors in the air of expiration.

The gases emanating from the mouth that cause oral malodor are the volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs). These include hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, and dimethyl sulfide. Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria from periodontal infections generate these compounds.

In physiological halitosis, which occurs on waking, the cause is putrefaction of entrapped food particles and desquamated epithelial cells by bacteria.

Contributing factors in the diet include the consumption of volatile foods like onions, garlic, spices, pickles, radish, condiments, betelnut tobacco, and alcohol resulting in malodor. Garlic and onions have a high sulfur concentration in their composition, which on degradation through the gastrointestinal tract, emits the characteristic odor which lasts for hours after consumption.
