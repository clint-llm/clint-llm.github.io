Diagnosis of TVIE is based upon the modified Duke Criteria. This criterion is widely used to diagnose TVIE like all other forms of IE. This criterion allows one to stratify infective endocarditis into a category of definite, possible, or rejected. Based on clinical criteria definite endocarditis is defined as two primary criteria, one major with three minor criteria, or five minor criteria. Possible endocarditis is measured by the presence of one major with two minor criteria, or with three minor criteria alone.

**Major Criteria**

Positive blood culture(any of the followings):

- Two separate blood cultures with organisms known to cause infective endocarditis or

- Organism consistent with endocarditis from blood cultures obtained 12 hours apart or

- Positive culture for organisms that are common skin contaminant in 3 or the majority of ≥4 separate blood cultures (first and last sample drawn at least 1 hour apart) or

- Single positive blood culture of Coxiella burnetti

Evidence of endocardial involvement (vegetation, abscess, new valvular regurgitation, dehiscence of a prosthetic valve)

**Minor Criteria**

- Fever > 38 degrees C (100.4 degrees F)

- Immunologic occurrence: Roth spots, Osler nodes, glomerulonephritis.

- Predisposing heart defect or IVDU

- Vascular phenomena: septic emboli, arterial emboli, conjunctival hemorrhages, splinter hemorrhages, Janeway lesions, mycotic aneurysm

- A positive blood culture that does not meet essential criteria.

Routine laboratory values in IE are generally nonspecific. Basic workup should be done. Some abnormalities which may be found include leukocytosis, elevated ESR, elevated CRP, normocytic anemia, or urinalysis revealing hematuria, proteinuria, or pyuria. EKG may reveal conduction anomalies such as heart block.

- Chest radiographs should be obtained to evaluate for septic emboli or infiltrate.

- CT scan of the abdomen is helpful to evaluate for metastatic emboli. Such emboli include splenic or renal infarcts. Clinicians should have a low threshold to locate these potential foci.

- Blood cultures should be obtained in all individuals with suspected TVIE. A minimum of three sets should be collected from different sites. [26341945]

- Echocardiography should be performed in all individuals with suspected TVIE. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is the first test that is done. TTE is very specific. Transesophageal echocardiography should be pursued if TTE is negative, but a high clinical suspicion for IE exists. TEE may also be used if significant valve regurgitation exists and needs to be further evaluated prior to surgery.
