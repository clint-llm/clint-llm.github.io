ADPKD: Patient may present clinically usually around the third decade of age with hypertension and with or without pain or hematuria of renal origin or other cyst's related-complications as infection or rupture.

Renal stones are a known complication of ADPKD, which contributes to significant morbidity. Medical renal disease as renal tubular acidosis is also common in this population. About 45% of patients may progress to end-stage renal disease, which leads to their dependence on hemodialysis or renal transplant. Imaging studies play a vital role in the diagnosis and screening of families at risk.

ARPKD: Early identification of these patients has increased tremendously in the last few decades with routine antenatal ultrasound which usually shows large and echogenic kidneys. The majority present in the neonatal period with hypertension and renal dysfunction. Hepatic fibrosis may lead to manifestations of portal hypertension. There is a variable phenotypic presentation of the disease depending on the severity of renal and hepatic involvement, which usually have an inverse relationship.

Perinatal Type is the most common. It presents with oligohydramnios and pulmonary hypoplasia and has a poor prognosis.

Neonatal and Infantile Type: Minimal to moderate hepatic/periportal fibrosis.

Juvenile Type: Gross hepatic fibrosis and features of portal hypertension like hepatosplenomegaly and portosystemic varices with less severe renal disease.
