Treatment of atrophie blanche in the absence of underlying disease often starts with antiplatelet, anticoagulation, and fibrinolytic therapies, including aspirin, dipyridamole, pentoxifylline, and heparin. Sulfasalazine, danazol, or stanozolol can work as single agents or in addition to other treatments. Other options that have shown success include hyperbaric oxygen and PUVA (psoralen and ultraviolet A radiation). For patients with refractory disease, rivaroxaban, oral steroids, prostanoids, and IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin) have been used with varying success. Patient education should include recommendations to stop smoking, to avoid irritants and poorly fitting shoes, as well as basic wound care of the lower extremities, i.e., leg elevation, compression therapy, and occlusive wound dressings.
