- Seizures: Benzodiazepine reversal has correlations withÂ seizures. Seizures may happen more frequently in patients who have been on benzodiazepines for long-term sedation or in patients showing signs of severe tricyclic antidepressant overdose. The required dosage of Flumazenil should be measured and prepared by the practitioners to manage seizures. Flumazenil use requires caution in patients relying on a benzodiazepine for seizure control.
