Mutations of the NF-1 gene result in a lack of expression of neurofibromin, thereby promoting tumorigenesis. Neurofibromas develop when both NF-1 alleles get mutated. Neurofibromas embody Schwann cells, perineural cells, mast cells, and fibroblasts.

There is a high genotype-phenotype correlation observed in NF1.

Neurofibroma originates from the Schwann cell (SC) lineage.

Neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) form

1. Boundary cap (BC) cells at the motor exit point (MEP) and the dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) that express:

- Krox20, form SC components of the dorsal and ventral nerve roots and helps in early myelination of the PNS

- Prss56 forms the SC component in the nerve roots, hypodermis, and dermis.

2. Schwann cell precursors (SCPs) that

- Have specific glial genes and molecular markers, such as myelin protein 0 (P0), cadherin-19

- Depending on axon-associated signals, for transition to myelinated or unmyelinated states.

Neurofibromin normally suppresses guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS)

The loss of this function results in the activation of the following:

- Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1 and ERK2), and

- Phosphoinositide 3 kinases (PI3K)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway causing transcription and cellular proliferation.

Biallelic inactivation ofÂ NF1 in SOX10 cells of the SC lineage form neurofibroma.

The pNF arises from the embryonic SC lineage, whereas cNF comes from the mature cell type in the SC lineage.

Loss of contact between SCs and axons and high Ras-Raf-ERK-dependent downregulation of semaphorin 4F (Sema4F) trigger increased proliferation. SC hyperplasia cause increased local innervation with the sprouting of nerve terminals within the upper dermis secondary to the lack of perineurium.

The patterns of mutation involved in the pathogenesis include:

- Frameshift mutations

- Nonsense mutations

- Missense mutations

- Splice-site mutations, and

- Large deletions.

The Syn domain is most commonly affected (80%) in the pathogenesis of NF1.
