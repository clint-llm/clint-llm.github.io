American consumers trust that their prescription drugs are of high quality and are consistent in purity and potency, often without question. According to a study done in 2007, this expectation has been transferred over to herbal supplements despite their lack of regulation in the United States. 70% believed the FDA tests herbal supplements, and 60% thought they regulated them.Gingko biloba supplements underwent comparison, 6 of the samples contained fillers that had no measurable Gingko biloba DNA.

Preparation is another issue affecting herbal supplements. Herb preparation and the parts used significantly affect its efficacy and attributes. For example, Echinacea’s various effects depend on what part of the plant gets harvested, i.e., flowers, roots, or leaves.

One method of alleviating these issues is through certification. In 2007, the FDA established regulations for dietary supplements called Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP). It is a list of nonbinding recommendations in manufacturing, labeling, packing, or holding operations for dietary supplements. Manufacturers can certify their products to verify active components and concentrations of heavy metals and other possible contaminants.

Further research is necessary to standardize extraction methods and the preparation of herbal supplements so that their effectiveness is consistent.
