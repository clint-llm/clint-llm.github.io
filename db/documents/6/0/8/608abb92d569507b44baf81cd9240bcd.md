Patients with precocious pseudopuberty are usually seen initially by a primary care physician or pediatrician. All physicians should be aware of the physiological pubertal changes, their normal sequence, and the age cutoff for considering pubertal changes as precocious. The onset of puberty before the age of six years in African American girls, seven years in caucasian girls, and nine years in boys should be evaluated thoroughly for precocious puberty.

Although primarily managed by an endocrinologist, patients often require interprofessional care. Consultations with oncology are required in cases of precocious puberty due to malignancy. Referral to surgery may be required for surgical excision of an underlying adrenal, ovarian, or testicular tumor. A referral to urology may be required due to the proximity of the gonads to the genitourinary system. Patients with McCune Albright syndrome may require referral to orthopedics to correct bone deformities due to fibrous dysplasia. Patients with precocious pseudopuberty can develop depression or behavioral disorders, which may require consultation with a psychiatrist and a child psychologist. Interdisciplinary collaboration is important for optimal patient outcomes in precocious pseudopuberty.
