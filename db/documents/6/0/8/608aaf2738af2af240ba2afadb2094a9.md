The muscles of the pelvic floor and the connective tissue of pelvis, including pelvic fascia, provide stability to the pelvic floor and are essential for the support of pelvic viscera. The visceral layer of pelvic fascia and parametrium becomes condensed around the uterus to form primary support of uterus in the form of true ligaments. These are pubocervical ligament anteriorly,  cardinal ligament laterally, uterosacral ligament posteriorly, and round ligament. Cardinal ligament and the uterosacral ligaments provide apical support for the uterus and upper vagina.

Peritoneal folds related to the uterus form less important secondary support of uterus in the form of peritoneal ligaments. These are uterovesical fold (anterior ligament) anteriorly, rectouterine fold (posterior ligament) posteriorly, and broad ligament laterally.
