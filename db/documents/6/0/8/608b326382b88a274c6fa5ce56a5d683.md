- The toxicity of antidepressants varies greatly not only between classes but within them as well. Antidepressants are frequently used to self-poison in an attempt to commit suicide, particularly in women. Older tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are more toxic than newer antidepressant classes. Such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Researchers can track drug toxicity using the fatal toxicity index, a ratio of self-poisoning mortality rates to prescription rates. Researchers may also employ a case fatality index, which compares fatal versus non-fatal self-poisoning attempts. With that said, clinicians may wish to alter treatment strategies depending on a patient’s suicide risk.

- According to the literature review, toxicity is higher for TCAs and MAO inhibitors followed by venlafaxine, bupropion, and mirtazapine and is lower for SSRIs. Among the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, citalopram and fluvoxamine appear to be associated with higher case fatality rates in overdose.

**SSRI Poisoning**

**Clinical Features**

- CNS- drowsiness, tremor

- CVS- QRS and QTc interval prolongation(especially with citalopram and escitalopram)

- Potential serotonin syndrome: hyperthermia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, clonus.

**Management**

- Secure airway, breathing, and circulation; intubate as clinically indicated.

- Treat prolonged QRS intervals with sodium bicarbonate

- Prolonged QTc leading to torsades- Administer magnesium sulfate 2 g IV.

- Treat seizures with benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam 1 to 2 mg IV) as needed.

- SSRIs are relatively safe, although serotonin syndrome is common in overdose. The exception is citalopram, which is significantly associated with QTc prolongation.

**SNRI Poisoning**

**Clinical Features**

- Tachycardia

- Hypertension

- Electrocardiogram changes (e.g., prolongation of QT interval, bundle branch block, QRS prolongation), ventricular tachycardia

- Changes in the level of consciousness (ranging from somnolence to coma)

- Mydriasis

- Serotonin syndrome

- Rhabdomyolysis

- Liver necrosis

- Death

**Management**

- In case of acute overdose with SNRI, the clinician should ensure an adequate airway, breathing, and circulation.

- For serotonin syndrome, specific treatment (such as with cyproheptadine may be considered)

- Treat prolonged QRS intervals with sodium bicarbonate

- Prolonged QTc leading to torsades- Administer magnesium sulfate 2 g IV.

- Consider extracorporeal life support in severe poisoning with venlafaxine.

**Atypical Antidepressants Poisoning**

**Bupropion**

**Clinical features**

- Tachycardia

- Hypertension

- Seizures

**Management**

- Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation.

- EEG monitoring is recommended for the first 48 hours post-ingestion.

- Administer intravenous benzodiazepine for seizures.

**Mirtazapine**

**Clinical Features**

- Disorientation

- Drowsiness

- Impaired memory

- Bradyarrhythmias

**Management**

- Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation

- Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs.

- Treat arrhythmias according to ACLS and PALS protocol.

**Serotonin Modulators Poisoning**

**Trazodone**

**Clinical Features**

- Arrhythmias

- Respiratory arrest

- Coma

- Priapism

**Management**

- Treatment should be symptomatic and supportive in the case of hypotension or excessive sedation.

- Priapism requires urgent evaluation by a urologist.

- In patients with ischemic priapism, intracavernosal injection such as phenylephrine.

**Vilazodone**

**Clinical Features**

- drowsiness

- vomiting

- tachycardia

- serotonin syndrome(altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular abnormalities)

**Management**

- Ensure an adequate airway, breathing, and circulation.

- Serotonin syndrome-  Vilazodone has up to 30-fold higher potency for serotonin reuptake inhibition than conventional SSRIs. Consequently, management of serotonin syndrome is the mainstay of therapy.

- Treatment of serotonin syndrome. 

- Administer benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam 1 to 2 mg IV per dose) till the patient is asymptomatic. 
- Administer IV fluids. 
- Consider sedation, paralysis, and endotracheal intubation for severe hyperthermia.
- Administer antidote cyproheptadine(antagonist at 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors).

**TCAs Poisoning**

**Clinical Features**

- Anticholinergic**-**Dilated pupils, absent bowel sounds, constipation, urinary retention

- Cardiac- Tachycardia, hypotension, conduction abnormalities, QRS duration >100 msec

- Neurologic- Sedation, seizures

**Management**

- Maintain airway, breathing, circulation

- Treat hypotension with intravenous crystalloid. Administer vasopressors such as norepinephrine in refractory hypotension.

- If QRS >100 msec, administer IV sodium bicarbonate.

- Administer activated charcoal(1g/kg) if the patient presents within 2 hours of ingestion; often, charcoal is avoided due to the presence of ileus.

- Administer benzodiazepines (lorazepam 2 mg IV) for seizures.

- QRS interval longer than 100 ms is a reliable predictor of serious complications.

**MAOI Poisoning**

**Clinical Features**

- Serotonin syndrome

- Hypertensive crisis

**Management**

- Establish adequate airway, breathing, and circulation.

- Administer parenteral agents for hypertensive crisis.

- Serotonin syndrome- Administer IV fluids, benzodiazepines, and cyproheptadine.

**NMDA antagonist (esketamine) Poisoning**

**Clinical Features**

- Sedation

- Dissociation

- Ulcerative or Interstitial Cystitis

- Embryo-fetal Toxicity

**Management**

- Establish adequate airway, breathing, and circulation.

- There is no specific antidote for esketamine overdose. In the case of overdose, clinicians should consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement. Contact a certified poison control center for the most up-to-date information on managing overdosage.

**Dextromethorphan/bupropion poisoning**

**Clinical Features**

- Seizures

- Serotonin Syndrome

- Psychosis

**Management**

- Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation.

- There is no specific antidote. Provide supportive care.

- Administer benzodiazepines for seizures.

- Consult a medical toxicologist or a certified poison control center.
