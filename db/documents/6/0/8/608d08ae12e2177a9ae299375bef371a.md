HZO is primarily a clinical diagnosis based on history and classic findings on physical and slit-lamp examination. Additional procedures, such as ocular tonometry and corneal esthesiometry, may be performed for a more thorough evaluation to assess for complications. Other diagnostic tests, such as viral cultures, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and antibody testing, are rarely required to establish a diagnosis of HZO. For patients with disseminated herpes zoster (disease involving multiple dermatomes), severe illness, or those with significant risk factors, it is reasonable to consider HIV testing. Additional laboratory tests and imaging are seldom warranted.
