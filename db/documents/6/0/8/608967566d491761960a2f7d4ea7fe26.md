Cranial neural crest cells or multipotent cells are fundamental for the development of facial tissues: bones, teeth, cartilage, connective tissue, and more. The cranial neural crest cells derive from the ectoderm leaflet from the dorsal midline portion. The cranial neural crest cells migrate towards pharyngeal arches and the frontonasal process; in this way, the tissues of the skull and the upper cervical tract form. In this event play critical role signaling pathways such as BMPs (bone morphogenic proteins); FGF (fibroblast growth factor); SHH (sonic hedgehog); WNT (wingless-related integration site). The ectodermal leaflet at week four covers the stomodeum, which ectoderm comes into contact with the endoderm leaflet, due to the development of the oropharyngeal membrane. During the fifth week, the ectoderm meets the mesoderm to start forming the nasal processes. Between the fourth and fifth week, the cells of the three main sheets meet to develop the different structures of the face.
