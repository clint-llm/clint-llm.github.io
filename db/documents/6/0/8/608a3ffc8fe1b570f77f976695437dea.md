As conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is a manifestation of a disease, rather than a disease itself, the prognosis varies depending on underlying disease conditions leading to conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Malignancy related to hepatobiliary system carries a poor prognosis; however, non-malignant causes like infections, toxins, non-malignant strictures tend to have a better outcome if treated promptly.Â Bilirubin levels correlate pointedly with short term mortality in some conditions, including primary biliary cholangitis and alcoholic hepatitis; nonetheless, the elevated bilirubin level does not contribute to the early mortality.
