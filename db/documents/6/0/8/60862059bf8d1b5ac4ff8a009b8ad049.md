As aforementioned, an interprofessional team approach is imperative in the management of patients with disabilities. It detects clinical and device-related problems, advocates for vulnerable patients, facilitates referrals, suggests solutions, and partners with patients to achieve their identified sense of wellbeing.

Homes should have a level path to an entrance without a step. Doors should be greater than 32 inches wide, and doorknobs found 36 inches from the floor to allow for manual WC to enter (these parameters are subject to change depending on the specific device prescribed). Toilets in the home should be 17 to 19 inches tall. A standard WC requires 5 feet (5' x 5') of turning space to make a full 360-degree turn, so there should be ample space in living rooms for turns. All members of the rehabilitation team share the burden of monitoring the patient and their MAE for changes that may affect their mobility in the home. There is little evidence that changing the home environment will prevent injury, but modifications similar to those suggested may decrease reliance on caregivers and caregiver burnout, especially in the elderly.

Importantly, patients should be able to perform three main rehabilitative activities: 1) transfer into and out of a WC, 2) performance of ADLs or IADLs, and 3) mobility. Rehabilitation therapists, the patient, and their families and caregivers are encouraged to work together toward patient adoption of these skills. Each should be demonstrated prior to discharge from healthcare facilities. Patients may also be given handouts for reference or referred to websites that demonstrate the performance of MAE skills. Professional groups, such as the Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America (RESNA), the National Registration of Rehabilitation Technology Suppliers (NRRTS), and the Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA), provide up-to-date and well-researched information for further study.
