Pressure injuries have been given various names over the last several years, including pressure ulcers, pressure ulcers, or bed sores. Pressure injuries are defined as the breakdown of skin integrity due to pressure. This can occur when a bony prominence is under persistent contact with an external surface. The most common site for pressure injuries is the sacrum. Other common sites include the heels, greater trochanter, ischial tuberosity, back of the head, ears, shoulders, elbows, inner knees, or malleoli. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, risk factors, and epidemiology of pressure injuries and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the prevention and treatment of these injuries.

**Objectives:**
- Differentiate the four stages of pressure injuries.
- List the most common sites for pressure injuries.
- Summarize the treatment options for pressure wounds.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to ensure proper pressure injury prevention protocols are in place and enhance surveillance in order to optimize outcomes for patients with pressure wounds.
