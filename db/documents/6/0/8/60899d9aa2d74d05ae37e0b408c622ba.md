Botulinum toxin is a neurotoxin produced from Clostridium botulinum, an anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria.

The use of botulinum toxin has been described in the management of both adductor and abductor laryngeal dystonia/spasmodic dysphonia (SD), vocal tremor, vocal process granuloma, and cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction.Â By selectively denervating targeted laryngeal musculature, the surgeon can strategically address these pathologies.

The vast majority (65%) of SD patients are female, with an average age of onset of 45 years. The prevalence of SD is 1 per 100,000.
