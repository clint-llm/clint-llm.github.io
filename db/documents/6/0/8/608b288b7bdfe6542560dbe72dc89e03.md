The reported incidence of LAST is highly variable. Some studies report 0 events after over 12,000 nerve blocks; whereas, others report an incidence of up to 25 per 10,000 nerve blockades. One study reported seizures in 79 of 10,000 brachial plexus blockade procedures. This complication was due to LAST CNS toxicity as a result of the intravascular local anesthetic injection. Although the published data has been inconsistent, one common theme prevails in that optimizing the management of LAST is of the utmost importance moving forward.
