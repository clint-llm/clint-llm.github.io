Granular parakeratosis has been reported in all ages but is most commonly seen inÂ adults. The condition has a higher prevalence amongst women than men. Granular parakeratosis does not appear to have a geographical or racial predilection. The condition is rare with one study reporting granular parakeratosis being present in only 18 specimens among 363,343 specimens examined.
