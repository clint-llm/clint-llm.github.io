The primary mainstays of treatment are supportive measures. Anti-pyretic medications such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen are given for those patients with fever. If the patient appears dehydrated and cannot tolerate oral hydration, intravenous fluid hydration is indicated. Additionally, patients with HMPV may require supplemental oxygen support such as high flow nasal cannula or even mechanical ventilation in severe cases causing acute respiratory failure, especially in those patients who have pre-existing respiratory or cardiac illness as well as those who are immunocompromised. Most patients do undergo a full recovery. However, every patient with HMPV should be placed on droplet precautions to limit and prevent spread. There is no current vaccine available for HMPV. However, there have been various vaccines against different structures of HMPV that have been tested on non-human primates and rodents that appear promising, however, none have been tested on human volunteers.
