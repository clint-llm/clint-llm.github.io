The interscalene triangle (sometimes termed simply the scalene triangle) is a region of the neck with fundamental importance to the function of the upper limbs, as the roots of the brachial plexus and the third part of the subclavian artery pass through it. The borders of the triangle are the lateral border of the scalenus anterior muscle, the medial border of the scalenus medius muscle, and the first rib inferiorly. Clinical manifestations of complications relating to the interscalene triangle include thoracic outlet syndrome, which can result in vascular or neurological compromise of the upper limb following compression at the interscalene triangle.
