Symptomatic and supportive care are the foundations of treatment for patients with Henoch-Schönlein purpura unless there is renal involvement. Acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be used for joint pain and fever; however, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications should most certainly be avoided if there is gastrointestinal or renal involvement.

Supportive and symptomatic care may include:

- Rehydration with intravenous (IV) fluids

- Pain management

- Wound care for ulcerative skin lesions

The management of Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis may include the following:

- Corticosteroids

- Plasma exchange

- Immunosuppressants

- Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.

Early oral prednisone treatment is useful for the management of renal, joint, and gastrointestinal manifestations. Prednisone does not prevent renal disease; however, it reduces the risk of developing a persistent, renal disease in children.
