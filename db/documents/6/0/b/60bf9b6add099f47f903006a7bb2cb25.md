Aggressive zygomycotic infections occur in immunocompromised individuals. Most commonly, they tend to occur in uncontrolled diabetics, especially those with ketoacidosis. They also occur in patients with malignancies, hematologic disorders, transplants, burns, or those receiving immunosuppressive medications.Â For reasons unknown, two-thirds of zygomycosis occurs in males. The occurrence is equal across race, age, and geography.
