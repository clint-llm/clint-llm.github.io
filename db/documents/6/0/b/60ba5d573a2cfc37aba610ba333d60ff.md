The brain consumes a significant amount of energy compared to its weight and size. The term "anoxia" refers to the complete lack of oxygen delivery to an organ. The term "hypoxia" applies when an organ experiences oxygen delivery that is insufficient to meet the metabolic needs of the tissue. The pathological mechanisms precipitated by cerebral hypoxia or anoxia are similar, and the terms "anoxic brain injury" and "hypoxic brain injury" are sometimes used interchangeably. The brain consumes a significant amount of energy compared to its weight and size. It is highly metabolically active and exquisitely sensitive to hypoxia and hypoperfusion. Cellular injury can begin within minutes, and permanent brain injury will follow if prompt intervention does not occur. For that reason, it is critical to understand the clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and management options. This activity reviews the cause and presentation of hypoxic brain injury and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of hypoxic brain injury.
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with hypoxic brain injury.
- Summarize the treatment of hypoxic brain injury.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by hypoxic brain injury.
