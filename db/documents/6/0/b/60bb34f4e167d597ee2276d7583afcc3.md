Femoral hernias are less frequent than inguinal hernias. Recognition of a femoral hernia is an important factor in the workup and evaluation of a patient who presents with a groin bulge as the options and urgency of repair may differ from that of a more common inguinal hernia. This activity reviews the cause, presentation and diagnosis of femoral hernia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the presentation of a femoral hernia.
- Review the anatomical boundaries of a femoral hernia.
- Summarize the treatment of femoral hernia.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by femoral hernia.
