The therapy of fresh frozen plasma is monitored clinically with signs of bleeding and chemically with coagulation studies and fibrinogen levels. Each unit of fresh frozen plasma contains approximately 200 to 250 mL. Apheresis-derived units can contain as much as 400 to 600 mL. The administration of one 250 mL unit should raise the fibrinogen level by 5 to 10 mg/dl. The goal of therapy is a cessation of bleeding. The laboratory value goal is to correct the prothrombin time/activated partial thromboplastin time to less than 1.5 times normal.
