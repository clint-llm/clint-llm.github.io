Pituitary adenomas are tumors of the anterior pituitary. Most pituitary tumors are slow-growing and benign. They are classified based on size or cell of origin. Patients with pituitary adenoma need to be evaluated by an interprofessional team that includes both endocrinology and neurosurgery to obtain the best results. This activity reviews the presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and management of pituitary adenomas, with particular attention to how the interprofessional healthcare team can best coordinate activity to optimize outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of pituitary adenoma.
- Review the prevalence of pituitary adenoma and the genetic disorders associated with pituitary adenomas.

- Outline the role of the healthcare team in the diagnosis and treatment of non-functional adenoma and functional adenomas like prolactinoma, acromegaly, and Cushing disease.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for patients with functional and non-functional adenomas.
