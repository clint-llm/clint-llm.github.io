Amebiasis can be diagnosed by a demonstration of the organism using direct microscopy of stools or rectal swabs. However, the organisms are seen in only 30% of patients.

Antigen detection using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and polymerase chain reaction techniques is often done. However, the most promising detection method is the loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay because of its rapidity, operational simplicity, high specificity, and sensitivity. An ultrasound or CT scan evaluates for extraintestinal amebiasis.

Cultures can be done from fecal or rectal biopsy specimens or liver aspirates. Cultures are not always positive, with a success rate of about 60%.

Liver aspiration using CT-guided imaging is often performed when there is a collection in the liver. The liver aspiration usually reveals a chocolate-like or thick, dark viscous fluid. Liver aspiration is indicated when the abscess is large, or there is a threat of imminent rupture.

A colonoscopy is done to obtain scrapings of the mucosal surface. It is appropriate when the stool studies are negative for amebiasis.

Blood tests may reveal the following:

- Elevated WBC

- Eosinophilia

- Elevated bilirubin and transaminase enzymes

- Mild anemia

- Elevated ESR

Imaging studies may be required depending on the presentation. Ultrasound can identify a liver abscess.
