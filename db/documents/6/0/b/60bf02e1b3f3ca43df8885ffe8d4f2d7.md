Depending upon the primary etiology of the alkalosis, consultation may be necessary with various subspecialties. A nephrological consult may be needed to elucidate the cause of metabolic alkalosis and management. A cardiologist and an endocrinologist may help with blood pressure control and hormonal correction in conditions of hyperaldosteronism. The patient may require admission under the care of an intensivist for severe electrolyte correction. Infants with pyloric stenosis will need surgical evaluation and correction.
