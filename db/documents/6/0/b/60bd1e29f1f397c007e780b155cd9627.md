Stroke patients require care in multidisciplinary teams in order to optimize outcomes. The need for interdisciplinary care begins in the prehospital setting because of early recognition, and prompt treatment of ischemic stroke symptoms is critical.

After acute treatment decisions have been made, admission to dedicated stroke units has demonstrated improved outcomes. These units ideally incorporate trained nursing staff as well as rehabilitation providers such as physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech-language pathologists.
