It is paramount to identify the risk factors and perform a thorough assessment before performing a direct brow lift. The patient should have the following done:

- Evaluation by a surgeon experienced in facial aesthetic and reconstructive surgery

- Medical optimization prior to proceeding with general anesthesia

- Evaluation by an opthalmologist or optometrist to assist in the management of visual field obstruction, dry eye, ptosis, and/or lagophthalmos.

- A preoperative, operative, and postoperative specialty nurse trained to monitor patients undergoing facial surgery is necessary. This individual will assist with the coordination of care and education.

An interprofessional team, including a facial surgeon, anesthesiologist, and operative nurse, should perform the direct brow lift to obtain the best outcomes. Close follow-up should monitor the patient for potential complications such as brow asymmetry, facial paralysis, paresthesias, alopecia, overcorrection, hematoma formation, keloid formation, and eye dryness. Proper education should counsel the patient on appropriate wound care and activity level.

This interprofessional care is essential to achieving the best results when performing facial reconstructive surgeries such as the direct brow lift. [Level 5]
