A branch of the internal carotid arteries, the ophthalmic artery, provides oxygenated blood supply to the extraocular muscles, some facial muscles, as well as the intrinsic muscles of the eye. The extraocular muscles of the eye include the superior rectus, inferior rectus, lateral rectus, medial rectus, superior oblique, and inferior oblique. The facial muscle that is mostly covered by the ophthalmic artery is the levator palpebrae superioris, a muscle that functions to elevate the superior orbit. Some examples of intrinsic muscles of the eye that the ophthalmic artery supply are the ciliary muscle, iris sphincter, and the radial pupillodilator muscles.
