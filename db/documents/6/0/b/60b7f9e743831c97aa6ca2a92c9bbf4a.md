The deltoid's function is testable in the clinical setting. It is done by manually raising the patient’s arm 15 degrees. After this, ask the patient to abduct the arm against resistance. In patients with normal deltoid function, the arm will contract, and the lateral deltoid contraction will be appreciated via palpation. These clinical findings will not be present in patients who have a dysfunctional deltoid. A deltoid dysfunctional problem commonly arises due to axillary nerve palsy. Common etiologies of this condition include overuse of a crutch, surgery, or posterior shoulder dislocation from severe trauma.
