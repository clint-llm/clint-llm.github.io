Acne conglobata presents with deep burrowing abscesses that interconnect with each other via sinus tracts. Initially, the nodular lesion may mimic a pimple, but underneath there is a vigorous inflammatory reaction and pus formation. Over time, the pus pushes into the adjacent tissues and extrudes on the skin's surface. Scar formation and disfigurement of the body are common with this type of acne. The comedones often occur in groups of three, and the cysts often contain purulent, foul-smelling material discharged on the skin surface.
