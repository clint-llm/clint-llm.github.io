The development of POUR can lead to many hospital complications.

- Acute retention can be extremely painful, and associated autonomic response to bladder overdistension can lead to vomiting, hypo- or hypertension, or even cardiac dysrhythmias, all of which can lead to worse postoperative outcomes.

- POUR can also lead to urinary tract infection either directly (due to poor bladder emptying) or indirectly (due to indwelling or intermittent catheterization).

- Undiagnosed or late-diagnosed POUR can result in extreme, prolonged bladder overdistension with myogenic changes to the bladder.

- Finally, the development of POUR has been demonstrated to lengthen hospital stays.
