Eye formation begins approximately three weeks into human embryonic development and continues through the tenth week. Cells from ectodermal and mesodermal tissues contribute to this development. Specifically, the eye is derived from the neuroepithelium, the surface ectoderm, and the extracellular mesenchyme (neural crest and mesoderm). The neural tube ectoderm gives rise to the ciliary body, including both the ciliary processes and ciliary muscle.
