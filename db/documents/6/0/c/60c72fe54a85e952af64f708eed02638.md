Based on clinical trials and product labeling, topical overdose is not likely to occur or be associated with toxicity. A topical overdose of cenegermin may be flushed from the eye(s) with lukewarm water. It is important to note that cenegermin is minimally absorbed in the systemic circulation, and there is no risk of systemic toxicity. However, in unexpected hypersensitivity reactions, clinicians should take measures to maintain a patent airway, breathing, and circulation.

There is no data on the use of cenegermin in pregnant women; however, animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects on reproductive toxicity. There is no data on the effects of cenegermin therapy on human fertility. However, daily subcutaneous administration in male and female rats had no effects on fertility parameters at 1709 times the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose (MRHOD). Subcutaneous and ocular administration in female rats was associated with ovarian findings, including ovarian follicular cysts, persistent estrus, changes in ovarian weight, reduction of corpora lutea at doses greater than or equal to 119 times the MRHOD according to product labeling.

Topical overdose is not likely associated with toxicity. It is important to note that there is no specific antidote for cenegermin. However, the topical overdose of cenegermin may be flushed from the eye(s) with tepid water. Ophthalmic cenegermin is not expected to cause any toxic effects in breastfed infants.
