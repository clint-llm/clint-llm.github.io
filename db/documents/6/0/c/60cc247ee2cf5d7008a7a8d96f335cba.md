A pericardial rub is highly specific for acute pericarditis. It is generally heard over the left sternal border, it is often louder at inspiration but sometimes can be better heard on forced expiration while the patient bends forward. In most cases, the rub is triphasic (audible in atrial, ventricular systole, and ventricular diastole phases) and is of high frequency.
