Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a wide-spread virus, with manifestations ranging from asymptomatic to severe end-organ dysfunction in immunocompromised patients with congenital CMV disease. Human cytomegalovirus is a member of the viral family known as herpesviruses, Herpesviridae, or human herpesvirus-5 (HHV-5). Human cytomegalovirus infections commonly are associated with the salivary glands. CMV infection may be asymptomatic in healthy people, but they can be life-threatening in an immunocompromised patient. This activity reviews the role of health professionals working together to manage cytomegalovirus.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of cytomegalovirus.
- Outline the presentation of cytomegalovirus.
- Summarize the treatment of cytomegalovirus.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by cytomegalovirus.
