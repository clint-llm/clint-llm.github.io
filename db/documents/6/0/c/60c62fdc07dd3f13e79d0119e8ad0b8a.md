Pertussis, literally meaning “a violent cough,” also known as whooping cough or “the cough of 100 days,” was first described in the Paris epidemic of 1578. Bordetella pertussis, the causative organism, was discovered in 1906, and a vaccine was developed in the 1940s. Before the pertussis vaccine was developed, pertussis was a major cause of infant morbidity and mortality.
