Mucus is the fluid secreted by the airways (also known as bronchial and windpipes) and lungs. In the setting of an infection or a longstanding health condition, the term phlegm is also used. The mixture of saliva and mucus specifically coughed up from the respiratory tract, often either following an infection or an irritation of the mucosa, is precisely labeled "sputum." The term phlegm arises from the Greek word "ϕλ?γμ?" which in the ancient books of medicine was used to label humor caused by heat.

The sputum is examined grossly and microscopically to aid medical diagnosis. The sputum contains various cells and molecular compounds such as soluble lipids and proteins. Its analysis is crucial in medicine. The sputum analysis involves an analytical approach to investigate the cellular and acellular components expelled from the patient's upper respiratory tract. This procedure is essential in the evaluation and management of lower respiratory infections or other longstanding health conditions.
