A pregnancy test is one of the most important tests to obtain in any female of child-bearing age complaining of abdominal/pelvic pain, amenorrhea, vaginal bleeding, or that is hemodynamically unstable. It is a highly sensitive and specific test, but limitations should be understood. If positive for pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy must be considered as a possibility.

Ultrasonography is a widely used imaging tool in early pregnancy due to its accuracy and favorable safety profile for both the patient and fetus. Information on the ultrasound should be interpreted within the clinical context of the patient and the beta-HCG level.
