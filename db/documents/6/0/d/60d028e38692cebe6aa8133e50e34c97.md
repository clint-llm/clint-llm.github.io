Because the early stages of hidradenitis suppurativa are often mistaken for other conditions, the average delay in the correct diagnosis is seven years.

Up to half of the individuals will report a prodromal syndrome involving burning, stinging, pain, pruritus, warmth, or hyperhidrosis in the area 12 to 48 hours before the appearance of a lesion. Triggers can include menstruation, weight gain, stress, hormonal changes, excessive heat, and perspiration. On presentation, individuals are typically well appearing and afebrile unless secondary infection or advanced disease is present.

Characteristic primary lesions are deep-seated nodules, usually 0.5 to 2 cm, that last from days to months. They are often mistaken for furuncles or “boils.” However, while a furuncle will respond rapidly to drainage or antibiotics, the nodules of HS are deep and can rupture and track subcutaneously. Multiple recurrent nodules in the same area may lead to the formation of intercommunicating sinus tracts that can ulcerate or drain. Drainage may be purulent and malodorous. Other lesions include open comedones (described as “tombstone” comedones), often double or multi-headed. In advanced stages, thick fibrotic scars and plaques can develop, leading to architectural distortion of the area.

The axilla is the most common location for HS lesions. Other common areas are the inguinal, inner thighs, perianal and perineal, inframammary, buttocks, pubic area, scrotum, vulva, trunk, and, less commonly, the scalp and retro-auricular areas.

Pertinent history includes onset from puberty into young adulthood and a history of recurrent lesions with intermittent improvement or resolution. Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic condition. Identifying a family history of a similar condition is also helpful in establishing the proper diagnosis.

Once the history and complete physical exam are complete, the Hurley staging system can be used to classify the case.

- Hurley Stage I: Abscess formation without tracts or scars

- Hurley Stage II: Recurrent abscesses with sinus tracts and scarring; there may be single or widely separated lesions

- Hurley Stage III: Diffuse involvement, multiple interconnected sinus tracts, and abscesses across an entire area, leaving little to no uninvolved skin

HS is one component of the follicular occlusion tetrad, including acne conglobata, dissecting cellulitis of the scalp, and pilonidal sinus. Diagnosis of hidradenitis suppurativa in an individual warrants evaluation for these coexisting diagnoses. Clinicians should also keep in mind the association between metabolic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and spondyloarthropathy and assess for these conditions during the history and physical.
