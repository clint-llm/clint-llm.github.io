Ensure that the probe and machine are cleaned before entering a patient room. The correct probes should be connected to the machine. The patient is ideally lying in a supine position on a stretcher with his or her abdomen exposed. Care should be taken to avoid unnecessary exposure with the use of towels tucked around the gown and undergarment edges. This will also aid in keeping unexposed areas clean from ultrasound gel.

For dominant right-hand operators, the ultrasound machine should be positioned at the patientâ€™s anatomic right near the head of the bed, plugged in (if applicable) and turned on. The lights should be dimmed if possible. For evaluation of the gallbladder, being in a fasting state aids in the engorgement of the gallbladder and better visualization. When evaluating the uterus, informing the patient to maintain a full bladder will aid in visualization secondary to fluid in the bladder providing an acoustic window to deeper structures.
