Since it is often called the "great imitator," the differential for neurosyphilis is broad; however, the following are important considerations:

- Brain tumors/abscess - if gummata are found on neuroimaging

- Acute basal meningitis - when cranial nerves palsy is present other causes of acute meningitis, such as tubercular, should be considered

- Subarachnoid hemorrhage

- Herpes encephalitis

- Electrolyte disturbances

- Subacute combined degeneration of cord - tabes dorsalis presents in a similar fashion

- Drug toxicity

- Multiple sclerosis

- Wernicke encephalopathy

- Acute psychiatric illnesses - when a patient of general paresis presents with delirium, mania, psychosis, personality change, or depression.
