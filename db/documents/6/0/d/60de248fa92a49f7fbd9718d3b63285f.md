An estimated 3 million or more people worldwide are exposed to organophosphates each year, accounting for about 300,000 deaths. In the United States, there are around 8000 exposures per year with very few deaths. While most often the exposure occurs from an agricultural pesticide, there are household items, such as ant and roach spray, that also contain organophosphate compounds.
