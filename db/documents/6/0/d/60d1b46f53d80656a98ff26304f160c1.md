Cystoscopy is used to diagnose and manage many urological disorders. The urologist primarily performs the technique with the assistance and monitoring by the nurse. The nurse should monitor vital assigns and report if there is any significant change. After the procedure, the care of the patient is assumed by nurses trained in urology. This individual must immediately report untoward events or complications. The two most immediate complications of the procedure include bleeding and urinary obstruction. Nurses should be familiar with the protocol when to call the urologist when these problems arise. Before discharge, the nurse must coordinate the education of the patient and report any lack of understanding to the clinical team leader so they can provide further assistance. Interprofessional teamwork will result in the best care of the patient and better outcomes. [Level 5]
