Blockage to the flow of aqueous humor occurs due to a number of predisposing anatomic variations. These variations include a shallower anterior chamber, lens size, anterior location of the iris-lens diaphragm, and a narrow entrance to the anterior chamber angle. The shallower anterior chamber angle leads to a large area of the iris and lens being in contact with each other, slowing the flow of aqueous humor from the posterior chamber to the anterior chamber. This, in turn, leads to a pressure difference between the chambers called a pupillary block.

The pupillary block causes bowing of the iris, which narrows the angle of the anterior chamber further. This cycle will perpetuate increasing intraocular pressures leading to the clinical presentation of acute angle-closure glaucoma.
