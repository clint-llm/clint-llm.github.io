While the dura mater, sometimes called the pachymeninx, is derived from the mesoderm, the arachnoid and pia mater, together called the leptomeninges, are derived from the ectoderm. Specifically, the development of the meninges begins with what is known as the perimedullarly mesenchyme, which contains cells from both the ectoderm and mesoderm.
