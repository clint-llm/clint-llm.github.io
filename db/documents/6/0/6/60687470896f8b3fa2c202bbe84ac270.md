Valproic acid is a widely used medication having efficacy in treating multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. A wide range of indications involves multiple medical specialties administering therapy with valproic acid appropriately. Thus, an interprofessional healthcare team, including cliniciansÂ (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), nurses, and pharmacists, with knowledge of its contraindications, dose adjustments, and potential adverse effects, is necessary for health care workers to ensure patient safety and the best outcome. By exercising collaborative efforts and open communication, dosing and management of valproic acid can optimize patient therapy for its various indications. [Level 5]
