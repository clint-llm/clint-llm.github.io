Cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADR), also known as toxidermia, are skin manifestations resulting from systemic drug administration. These reactions range from mild erythematous skin lesions to much more severe reactions such as Lyell's syndrome. TheyÂ represent a heterogeneous field, including various clinical patterns without specific features suggesting drug causality. It is essential to search for the causative agent.
