When a patient with a history of spirochetal infection and recent antibiotic use presents with fever and rash, nausea/vomiting, chills, headache, tachycardia, and often hypotension, antibiotic allergic reaction, worsening infection/sepsis, and viral syndrome should be considered as important differentials because of similar presentations. Prior drug reactions, especially to penicillin, should be carefully assessed. With penicillin allergy, there are generalized urticaria/wheals and eosinophilia, or there are specific antibodies to penicillin in the serum of patients. Occasionally, underlying syphilis can be discovered when the patient develops transient JHR symptomatology while being treated with antibiotics for another infection such as gonorrhea.
