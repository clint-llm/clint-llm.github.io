Disulfiram may be prescribed by the nurse practitioner, physician assistant, primary care provider, emergency department physician, or internist. However, all healthcare workers, including the nursing staff and pharmacist, must be familiar with its adverse effect profile. The agent is not well tolerated, and when consumed with alcohol, can produce severe side effects that can even lead to a heart attack. Today, this drug is not used to treat alcoholism because it is not deemed to be safe.

When using disulfiram requires an interprofessional team approach. Prescribing was covered in the previous paragraph, and the pharmacist should have input regarding dosing as well as drug-drug interactions by performing complete medication reconciliation, reporting any concerns to the prescribing clinician. Nursing should monitor for treatment effectiveness and adverse reactions to disulfiram, also alerting the team should anything significant present. Only with an interprofessional team approach can disulfiram therapy have the potential for success. [Level 5]
