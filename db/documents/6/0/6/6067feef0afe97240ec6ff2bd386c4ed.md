Hyperlipidemia is one of the factors contributing to metabolic syndrome. It could lead to an increased risk of atherosclerosis in patients if not properly managed. There are different causes of hyperlipidemia. They include familial combined hyperlipidemia of different phenotypes, familial defective apolipoprotein B100, familial hypertriglyceridemia, and familial hypercholesterolemia. Apart from these familial forms, some other causes include hyperlipidemia due to lipoprotein X (Lp-X) formation. Lp-X is an abnormal type of lipoprotein present in the plasma of patients with any liver dysfunction. It can be formed in either intra- or extrahepatic cholestasis.

Lp-X is similar in density to LDL, making it difficult to differentiate between true hyperlipidemia and cholestasis-induced hyperlipidemia. The management of cholestasis-induced hyperlipidemia is different compared to true hyperlipidemia. As a result, health care professionals should be able to recognize this immediately for better management outcomes. This article will highlight the etiology, epidemiology, physical examination findings, treatment, complications, deterrence in patient education, and how to enhance outcomes in health care teams involved in Lp-X-induced hyperlipidemia patients.
