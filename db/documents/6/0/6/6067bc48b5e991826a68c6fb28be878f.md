The Lugano classification is the current staging used for patients with NHL. The Lugano classification is based on the Ann Arbor staging system, originally developed for Hodgkin lymphoma in 1974 and modified in 1988. This staging system is based on the number of tumor sites (nodal and extranodal) and their location.

- Stage I refers to NHL involving a single lymph node region (stage I) or a single extra lymphatic organ or site (stage IE) without nodal involvement. A single lymph node region can involve one node or a group of adjacent nodes.

-  Stage II refers to two or more involved lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm (stage II) or localized involvement of an extra lymphatic organ or site (stage IIE).

-  Stage III refers to lymph node involvement on both sides of the diaphragm (stage III).

-  Stage IV refers to the widespread involvement of one or more extra lymphatic organs like the liver, bone marrow, and lung, with or without associated lymph node involvement.

The subscript "E" is used if the limited extranodal extension is noted; the more extensive extranodal disease is categorized as stage IV. Spleen involvement is considered nodal rather than extranodal.
