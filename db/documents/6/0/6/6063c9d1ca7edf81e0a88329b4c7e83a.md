Surgical intervention of the rhomboid muscles is rare. However, it may be required in some cases. Rhomboid muscle flaps can be used in the treatment of head and neck cancers, esophagus reconstruction, mandibular defects, and Sprengel disease (Sprengel deformity), which is the congenital elevation of the scapula.

Although not specifically surgical, ultrasound-guided injections into the rhomboids have also been shown to be more effective than superficial trapezius injections for pain, disability, and quality of life for patients with myofascial pain syndrome.
