The earliest description of adenocarcinoma lung with peripheral pneumonic invasion can be traced to as early as 1876 by Malassez describing a multinodular pulmonary tumor as "cancer encephaloid du poumon." Subsequently, in 1903, Muser described a similar diffuse growth pattern in a pulmonary tumor. History waited another 57 years before Liebow coined the term " bronchioloalveolar carcinoma " in 1960. He used it to describe a well-differentiated form of adenocarcinoma, which exhibits any of the three growth patterns: (1) Single nodular, (2) multinodular, or (3) diffuse pneumonic pattern.

However, the pathologic criteria for bronchioloalveolar carcinoma remained somewhat nebulous. And as knowledge of radiology, histology, and immunophenotyping continued to evolve, the necessity to identify certain subtypes among the conglomerate of NSCLC with a more favorable prognosis and less invasive treatment became increasingly important.

The Liebow definition held its stature until 2004 when the World Health Organization (WHO) publication on the tumors of the lung, pleura, thymus, and heart redefined bronchioloalveolar carcinoma as adenocarcinoma with a lepidic growth pattern along alveolar walls without stromal, vascular, or pleural invasion. They classified bronchioloalveolar carcinoma into (1) mucinous and (2) non-mucinous subtypes. They delineated a continuum as adenocarcinoma with both bronchioloalveolar carcinoma and invasive component and invasive adenocarcinoma with stromal invasion and reactive fibroblastic response.

The extent of the invasive component has been under intense scrutiny to identify the limits of a subtype that still portends a favorable prognosis or a scope of limited resection. A joint collaborative of the International Association for the study of Lung Cancer (IASLC), American thoracic society (ATS), and European Respiratory Society (ERS) introduced a revised classification of pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Among salient modifications was a revised identification of adenocarcinoma precursors as well as a semi-quantitative assessment of adenocarcinoma growth patterns. The classification has been validated worldwide as a stage-independent predictor of survival.

The ATS/ERS/ IASLC classification in 2011, therefore, did away with the term bronchioloalveolar carcinoma altogether and focused on all tumors exhibiting lepidic growth pattern.

**Salient Features of the Revised Classification of 2011**

- Removal of the term bronchioloalveolar carcinoma and hence its subtypes of mucinous and non-mucinous

- Replacement of the prior bronchioloalveolar carcinoma with adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS)

- Introduction of a minimally invasive adenocarcinoma with lepidic growth with less than 5 mm invasive component

- A size limit of 3 cm to noninvasive or minimally invasive adenocarcinoma

Therefore, it is important to remember that the terms "bronchioloalveolar carcinoma " and "adenocarcinoma with lepidic growth" are not synonyms but a reflection of our evolved histologic understanding of a less aggressive form of adenocarcinoma overall.

The 2015 WHO classification approved the classification of pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Finally, in 2017 the 8th Edition of the lung cancer TNM classification acknowledged the new subclassifications and made appropriate changes to the T component based on nodule characteristics.
