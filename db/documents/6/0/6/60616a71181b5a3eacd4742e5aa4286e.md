The Rhabdoviridae family of viruses that are bullet-shaped and composed of two parts cause rabies. The first part is considered more structural and is a viral envelope while the second part is more functional and contains the ribonucleocapsidÂ core. The virus is most commonly spread through the bite of an infected mammal, including domestic and wild ones, but transmission can occur from saliva through broken skin or mucous membranes. Other routes of infection include inhalation of the virus in an aerosolized form, ingestion, transplacentally, and even through organ transplants.
