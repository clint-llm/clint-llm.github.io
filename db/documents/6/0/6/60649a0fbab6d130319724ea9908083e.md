There are two groups of PPIs: the benzimidazole group and the imidazopyridine group. Pantoprazole falls in the benzimidazole group of PPIs. The difference between these two groups is that benzimidazoles have an extended rate of metabolism resulting in a shorter presence in plasma. Regarding the mechanism of action, pantoprazole irreversibly inhibits the H+/K+ ATP pumps. There is an increased rate of pantoprazole degradation with decreased environmental pH. Therefore, it makes sense that this medication would work best in the stomach, where the H+/K+ ATP pumps are located (specifically within the parietal cells of the stomach lining). This step is the final step in gastric acid production. As a result, the binding of pantoprazole to these pumps prevents acid secretion for up to 24 hours. After 24 hours, new pumps have been created, and thus a subsequent dose of pantoprazole is required to inhibit their action. The onset of action is rapid, and the maximal effect occurs between 2 and 6 hours after drug administration. Pantoprazole is also metabolized in the liver, predominantly by CYP2C19 demethylation and sulfation. These metabolites are not known to be of any significance.
