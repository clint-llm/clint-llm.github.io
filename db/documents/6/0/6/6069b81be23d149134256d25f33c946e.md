The choice of agent for initial therapy is based on cost, patient preference, and concern for abuse. Dextroamphetamine is the only amphetamine medication FDA-approved for use in children younger than six years, but most current guidelines recommend behavioral therapy alone in preschool-aged children with ADHD symptoms.

Dosages usually range from 5 mg to 40 mg daily and should not exceed 60 mg, which is the maximum dose for certain adults.

- ADHD: 5 to 40 mg daily divided from one to three doses - divided doses should be at 4 to 6-hour intervals. Doses exceeding 40 mg are rarely more effective.

- Narcolepsy: 5 to 60 mg daily divided from one to three doses; start with 10 mg each morning, increasing dose by 10 mg daily each week; divided doses should be at 4 to 6-hour intervals. Prolonged, high-dose use should be stopped.

- Obesity (short-term treatment): 15 to 30 mg daily divided into three doses, given 30 to 60 minutes before meals. Discontinuation should be tapered. Discontinue prolonged high-dose use.

Lisdexamfetamine may be preferred if there is increased concern for misuse by the patient or a household member, as its chemically-phased release allows for once-daily dosing and may theoretically deter abuse. Lisdexamfetamine is available as capsules or chewable tablets, and typical daily dosages range from 20 mg to 70 mg.
