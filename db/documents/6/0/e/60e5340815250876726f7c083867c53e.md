Peripheral intravenous (IV) lines, catheters or cannulas are indwelling single-lumen plastic conduits that allow fluids, medications and other therapies such as blood products to be introduced directly into a peripheral vein. Placement of peripheral lines is the most commonly performed invasive procedure in acute healthcare settings with more than 1 billion lines being used annually worldwide. This activity describes strategies for placement of peripheral IV lines by anatomical, landmark-based techniques, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in placing and caring for IV lines while minimizing complications.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for peripheral IV line placement.
- Outline the relative contraindications for peripheral line placement in certain clinical conditions.
- Summarize the venous anatomy of the arm for peripheral access.
- Explain the importance of a team approach to patients needing peripheral access and improving outcomes.
