The incidence and prevalence of NR have not been determined. Still, it is thought to be underdiagnosed due to the temporal dissociation of disc edema and macular star formation, which follows after 1 to 2 weeks.

Neuroretinitis of all types usually affects young adults between 8 and 40 years with a median of 24 years. CSD-NR affects females more than males with a ratio of 1.8 to 1, and idiopathic and idiopathic-recurrent does not appear to have a sex predilection. There is some suggestion that geographically, neuroretinitis may be more common in the Mid-Western United States, but this is unconfirmed.
