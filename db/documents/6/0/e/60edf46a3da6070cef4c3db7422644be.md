The musculature of the supraclavicular is critical to understand, as muscles often serve as anatomic landmarks. Most superficially is the platysma, which is a thin muscle that stretches from the pectoralis and deltoid to the base of the mandible superiorly. The platysma overlies the fascial carpet and receives innervated from the cervical branch of the facial nerve. Two of the three borders of the supraclavicular fossa are muscles that are defining structures within the region. Anteromedially, the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) stretches from the sternum to the mastoid bone, and it is superficial to the fascial carpet. The omohyoid muscle represents the superolateral border, and stretches from the scapula to the hyoid bone, passing behind the SCM. The omohyoid is composed of two muscle bellies, the tendon between which lies invested in the deep cervical fascia. Finally, deep to the cervical fascia are the scalene muscles, which are a group of three accessory muscles that originate on the cervical vertebrae and insert on the first and second ribs. Innervation of the scalenes is via C4-C6, and these muscles serve as accessory muscles of respiration.
