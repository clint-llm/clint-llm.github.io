The etiology of essential tremorÂ is mostly unexplained. About half of the cases of essential tremor appear to result from a genetic mutation; although, a specific gene has not been identified. This form is referred to as familial tremor and is an autosomal dominant disorder. The variability in age of onset, the presence of sporadic cases, and incomplete concordance of essential tremor among monozygotic twins suggest that environmental factors play a role.

The Movement Disorders Society diagnostic criteria include:

- Tremor is bilateral, symmetrical, and postural

- The tremor involves the forearms and hand

- Is persistent and visible

- It may be associated with isolated head tremor
