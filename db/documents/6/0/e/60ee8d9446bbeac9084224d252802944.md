To understand the pathophysiology of air leak and air leak syndrome, a basic understanding of pulmonary mechanics is important. The pressure in the pleural cavity is affected by the dynamics of chest wall movement. Changes in body posture and motion affect the pressure in the pleural cavity. The pleural pressure is related to the intrathoracic pressure. Pressure is also exerted on the conducting airway; this is known as the airway pressure. The difference in the airway pressure and the pressure in the pleural cavity is known as transpulmonary pressure. During spontaneous respiratory on a native airway, the transpulmonary pressure maintains a tidal ventilation secondary to the cyclic variability in pleural pressure. For patients on mechanical ventilation, the transpulmonary pressure that determines the tidal ventilation is controlled by cyclic changes in the mean airway pressure (PAW).

The determination of the transpulmonary pressure in a patient breathing spontaneously or on mechanical ventilation requires the measurement of the intrathoracic pressure. This is achieved by using an esophageal balloon catheter position in the distal thirds of the esophagus. The airway pressure can be determined by measuring the pressure near the mouth or the endotracheal tube. Other use values for pulmonary dynamics are lung volume and airflow. Lung volume can be measured using plethysmography.

Measurement of the transpulmonary pressure requires the expiratory flow to be intermittently occluded after the insertion of the esophageal balloon catheter. The difference between the mouth, which is the airway pressure (PAW), and esophageal balloon pressure (PES) is the transpulmonary pressure (PTP).

In air leak and air leak syndrome, there is a presence of air in the pleural cavity that causes changes in the pleural pressure. Two types of pneumothoraxes are of clinical importance from this standpoint.

- **Stable pneumothorax**-****The presence of air in the pleural cavity with no significant change in the volume of air.

- **Unstable pneumothorax**- The presence of air in the pleural cavity that is rapidly changing in volume and expanding. The presence of an air leak is mostly seen in pulmonary surgery but can arise spontaneously from a bleb or trauma.

During normal spontaneous respiration, the tidal volumes and airflow are determined by the cyclic variation in the pleural cavity pressure (PPL). The presence of air leaks will cause a decrease in lung volume, decreased airflow, and increased pleural pressure. This is related to an increase in lung resistance and elastance. The pressure in the pleural cavity is around 0 to -10 cm H20. Placement of a chest tube in the pleural cavity will reverse all the physiological changes associated with the accumulation of air in the pleural cavity. There will be lung expansion with improved airflow and decrease resistance and elastance. To evacuate the air associated with an air leak, a pressure greater than 10cm H20 is usually applied. In most practices, a pressure of -20 cm H20 is usually applied.

The presence of air leaks also affects oxygenation and carbon dioxide retention. The presence of a large air leak with no evacuation will compromise oxygenation. The loss of lung volume with air leak causes a "steal" phenomenon, with smaller lung volume compromising gas exchange and causing hypoxemia.

Large air leak and air leak syndrome negatively affect ventilation and gas exchange with carbon dioxide retention. Evacuation of the air leak will remove carbon dioxide and decrease the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood, causing respiratory alkalosis.

In primary spontaneous pneumothorax, bullae are the primary culprit in about 76% to 100% of cases. This is usually from smoking. Bullae formation follows a particular pathway. Destruction of the elastic fibers in the lung is induced by macrophages and neutrophils, which are activated by exposure to smoke inhalation. The breakdown of elastin causes a disbalance between the oxidant and the antioxidant system as well as the protease-antiprotease system. Once the bullae are formed, they cause inflammation of the airway. The obstruction from inflammation causes the bullae to rupture, causing pneumomediastinum and later pneumothorax.

In patients on mechanical ventilation on high-pressure settings, barotrauma causes leakage of air into the perivascular interstitium. At a critical level of the pressure gradient between the alveolus and the interstitial space, the alveolus ruptures, and air can escape and accumulate in the mediastinum pericardium or pleural cavity. The critical pressure that gives rise to this all depends on (1) the severity of lung injury and (2) the tidal volume used in mechanical ventilation.

To evacuate pneumothorax secondary to an air leak or ALS, a chest tube with drainage usually is connected to the pleural cavity. The level of fluid in the fluid column in the chest tube drainage system changes with the respiratory mechanism. During inspiration, the column rises; during expiration, the level falls. Loss of variability in the fluid column is associated with a loss of connection between the chest tube system and pleural cavity. The following are causes:

- Tube kinking

- Blood clot

- Pus or fibrin

- System blocks
