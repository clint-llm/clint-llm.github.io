Physicians should make it a priority to help patients stop smoking. Smoking even a few cigarettes a day or only smoking occasionally increases a person's chance of developing lung cancer. There are immediate benefits to smoking cessation, which occur only hours, weeks, and months after a person stops smoking. These primary benefits included lowering of blood pressure, decreased cough and phlegm production, increased lung capacity. In the long term, quitting smoking reduces a patient's risk of developing cancer, heart disease, and chronic lung disease. The earlier a person stops smoking, the more their risk of developing lung cancer is reduced. However, stopping smoking at any age is beneficial, and the benefits of smoking cessation are cumulative over time. When a person stops smoking before the age of 40, they reduce their chances of dying from smoking-related disease by 90%. Even people already diagnosed with cancer benefit from smoking cessation. In some forms of cancer, quitting smoking at the time of diagnosis can reduce the chances of dying from cancer by as much as 40%.
