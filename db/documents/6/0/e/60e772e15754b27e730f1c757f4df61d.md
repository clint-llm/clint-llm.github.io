Axillary lymph node biopsies are important in the diagnostic evaluation of cancers such as breast cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma. Understanding the anatomy of the axilla is important for surgeons during the evaluation and removal of lymph nodes. Iatrogenic injury is preventable through being thoroughly aware of the anatomical variants that exist in the axilla.

The long thoracic nerve is close to the axillary lymph nodes and is at risk of injury during lymph node removal or radical mastectomy. Damage to the long thoracic nerve leads to a winged scapula, which is a condition in which the scapula abnormally protrudes from the back.
