The lower extremity is innervated by the lumbosacral plexus, comprising the L1 to S4 nerve roots. Unlike the brachial plexus, the lumbosacral plexus is not easily blocked with a single-injection technique. Consequently, neuraxial blocks were preferred in the past when lower extremity anesthesia or analgesia was desired.

As technological advancements have increased the number of outpatient procedures, neuraxial techniques have become less desirable.
