In disorders that affect the substantia nigra, such as Parkinson disease, surgical intervention is an option for palliative treatment of the symptoms. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) involves the intracranial implantation of an electrode. In Parkinson disease, an electrodeÂ is placed in a target brain area of the basal ganglia such as the subthalamic nucleus or the globus pallidus internus to alter the activity between the direct and indirect basal ganglia pathways to disinhibit motor movement in the absence of dopamine release in the striatum. Implantation of a catheter directly into the striatum can target the putamen with a dopamine agonist such as apomorphine and reduce systemic side effects. Neurotrophic treatment of central brain nuclei such as the substantia nigra is also under investigation for their ability to halt neurodegeneration.
