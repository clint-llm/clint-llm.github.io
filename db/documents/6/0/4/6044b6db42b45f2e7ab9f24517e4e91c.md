Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and is the leading cause of death in the United States.

Several organizations, including the American Heart Association (AHA), The American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation (AACVPR), and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, agree that a comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation program should contain specific core components. These components should optimize cardiovascular risk reduction, reduce disability, encourage active and healthy lifestyle changes, and help maintain those healthy habits after rehabilitation is complete. Cardiac rehabilitation programs should focus on:

- Patient assessment nutritional counseling

- Weight management

- Blood pressure management

- Lipid management

- Diabetes management

- Tobacco cessation

- Psychosocial management

- Physical activity counseling

- Exercise training
