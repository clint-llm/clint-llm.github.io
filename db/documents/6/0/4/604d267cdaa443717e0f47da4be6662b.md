Pediatric hip arthrograms provide information integral to proper patient diagnosis and treatment. A previous study found treatment plans were modified based on hip arthrography findings in 12 of 21 patients with developmental dysplasia of the hip.

In a study of 72 hips with developmental dysplasia of the hip, the shape of the limbus was easily depicted on hip arthrography. Conventional teaching supports that a medial dye pool measuring <6 mm on hip arthrography indicates a deeply reduced hip. Another study supports the medialization ratio to be most helpful in demonstrating hip joint congruency and reducibility. The study revealed prognostic indicators of closed reduction in developmental dysplasia of the hip to be the limbus shape and medialization ratio.

A separate study evaluated hip osteonecrosis after closed reduction of the hip performed with and without arthrography. Arthrography helped identify soft tissue structures preventing a stable reduction. The incidence of osteonecrosis in patients who underwent closed reduction without arthrography was 29%. While the incidence of osteonecrosis in patients who underwent closed reduction with arthrography was only 7.6%.
