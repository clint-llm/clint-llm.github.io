The sural nerve block is usually performed by the anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist; however, the patient must be monitored by an anesthetic nurse during the entire procedure. While the procedure is simple, inadvertent injection into an artery can occur, sometimes with acute catastrophic results. The nurse must constantly monitor the vital signs as well as check for complications and report back to the operative team if any abnormalities arise. Damage to the nerve can also result in paresthesias that may persist for weeks or months. Hence, the nurse and operative team must assist in patient education, especially if untoward events occur. After the procedure, the recovery room nurse must assess the sensation in the leg before discharge and report back if there are any concerns. To achieve the best outcomes, an interprofessional approach is necessary to achieve the best results. [Level 5]
