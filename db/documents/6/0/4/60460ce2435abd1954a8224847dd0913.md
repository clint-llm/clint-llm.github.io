**Otoscopic Examination**

The tympanic membrane can be visualized during an otoscopic examination. Considering that the external acoustic meatus is curved anteriorly and inferiorly, the external ear is gently pulled back and up to straighten the meatus and allow a clear view of the tympanic membrane. When performing an otoscopic examination on an infant, the external ear is pulled back and down due to the bony portion ofÂ the meatus not being fully developed. When light is directed at the tympanic membrane, a characteristic feature to be observed is the anterior cone of light, which radiates anteroinferior from the umbo. The tympanic membrane should be pearly-grey in color, translucent, shiny, and mobile on insufflation. If any of the aforementioned features of the tympanic membrane is altered, a pathological process, usually in the tympanic cavity, should be considered.

**Myringotomy**

Sometimes (e.g., recurrent otitis media infections), an incision in the tympanic membrane needs to be made, usually to allow drainage of fluid from the middle ear, and this procedure is called myringotomy (tympanostomy). The incision is made either in the posteroinferior (more often) or anteroinferior quadrant. The reason why inferior quadrants are incised instead of superior ones is that no important structures (e.g., chorda tympani) pass behind inferior quadrants, and they are generally devoid of blood vessels.
