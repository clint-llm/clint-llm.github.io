The American Nurses Association (ANA) defines standards for registered nurses. The Nursing Professional Development (NPD): Scope and Standards of Practice describe the competencies that NPD practitioners should perform. The roles of all nursing specialties, including those of NPD practitioners, are evolving with the changing healthcare landscape. The ANA and other specialty organizations periodically review and revise standards. The latest edition of the NPD scope and standards was published in 2022 by the Association for Nursing Professional Development.

A diverse, global group of NPD practitioners was convened to update these standards. They used research findings conducted by Harper and Maloney in the spring of 2020 and other current literature to ensure that the new standards reflected current and future NPD practice.

The definition of NPD in the current standards was updated to state, “Nursing professional development is a nursing practice specialty that improves the professional practice and role competence of nurses and other healthcare personnel by facilitating ongoing learning, change, and role competence and growth with the intention of improving population health through indirect care” p. 1.

The revised standards include an updated systems practice model comprised of inputs, throughputs, and outputs. Rainford et al. described the practice model and changes in the latest edition of the standards. Inputs include environmental scanning, the learner, the seven NPD roles, and the NPD standards. Throughputs include the organizational mission and vision and the six key areas of responsibility of NPD practitioners. Areas of NPD responsibility are: 1) orientation and onboarding; 2) competency management; 3) education; 4) role development; 5) collaborative partnerships; and (6) inquiry.

Outputs include learning, change, and professional role competence and growth, which contribute to optimal care and population health. The focus of NPD practice is the healthcare consumer/partner, who is defined as a “patient, person, client, family, group, community, or population who collaborates with the interprofessional healthcare team and maintains autonomy to engage in decision making about activities/treatments/therapies to promote health.” p. 119.

Three years after the 2016 standards were published, Harper and Maloney identified that although the standards have promoted uniformity of titles and alignment with the scope of practice, the specialty needs more work in the areas of advocacy, research, and engagement.[3] In an article about the development of the updated edition, they outlined some of the work that had been done to inform the latest edition of the standards.
