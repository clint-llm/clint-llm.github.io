If a diagnosis of peliosis hepatis is suspected, the evaluation often starts with laboratory studies, mainly a hepatic panel, which may or may not demonstrate changes. Following this, further abdominal imaging studies can be obtained, most frequently ultrasonography of the liver. Additional testing, including computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen, or angiography are also options; however, they are not necessary for the workup. Rather if ultrasound can demonstrate findings raising concern for peliosis hepatis, a biopsy is typically the next best step to make the diagnosis.
