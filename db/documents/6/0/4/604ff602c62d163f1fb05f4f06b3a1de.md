There are three main access sites for the placement of central venous catheters, namely internal jugular, common femoral, and subclavian veins. These are the preferred sites for temporary prominent venous catheter placement. Additionally, for mid-term and long-term central venous access, the basilic and brachial veins are utilized for peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs). A discussion of tunneled catheters and other central access obtained via advanced interventional radiology techniques is beyond the scope of this article. We will focus on the three main sites of access routinely used for short-term (days to weeks) central access.

Understanding the relevant anatomy and adjacent structures is crucial when placing a CVC. The decision of where to place a central line is typically based on clinical parameters and individual clinician experience and preference. Each anatomical site has relative advantages and disadvantages, and one spot is unlikely to be the best choice for every patient. While the evidence does not suggest only one place, each location has known risks and benefits.

The internal jugular vein (IJ) is often chosen for its reliable anatomy, accessibility, low complication rates, and ability to employ ultrasound guidance during the procedure.

The IJ is located anterolateral to the common carotid artery, typically in the superior portion of the triangle created by the two heads of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle and the clavicle. The internal jugular vein joins the subclavian vein to form the brachiocephalic vein. The right and left brachiocephalic veins join to form the SVC. When anatomic landmarks are used, the IJ site can be accessed anteriorly, centrally, or posteriorly about the bifurcation of the SCM. Generally speaking, the central approach is most commonly used. Still, some have argued that the posterior approach is safest (being furthest from the lung apex and the carotid artery) and that the anterior approach is the easiest (as the carotid artery forms a readily palpable reference landmark). While there may still be no consensus about the correct landmark-based approach, most experts agree that ultrasound guidance provides the best chance of locating the vein and avoiding other structures owing to anatomic variability.

The subclavian vein site has the advantage of low rates of both infectious and thrombotic complications.

The SC vein can be accessed above or below the clavicle, though the infraclavicular method is far more commonly employed. The supraclavicular approach offers a well-defined landmark for insertion at the clavisternomastoid angle, a shorter distance from a puncture to the vein, and a straighter path to the SVC, with less proximity to the lung.

The femoral site is sometimes preferable in critically ill patients because the groin is free of other resuscitation equipment and devices which may be required for monitoring and airway access. Central venous access in the common femoral vein offers the advantage of being an easily compressible site, which may be helpful in trauma and other coagulopathic patients.

Unlike IJ or SC lines, femoral central lines do not allow for accurate measurement of central venous pressure (CVP), though this is not important in every clinical scenario. The common femoral vein is located within the femoral triangle. This region is outlined by the adductor longus medially, sartorius muscle laterally, and the inguinal ligament superiorly. There are important anatomical considerations to keep in mind when accessing this particular site. Whereas in the neck, the (carotid) artery is medial to the (internal jugular) vein, the artery is lateral to the vein in the leg. The mnemonic NAVEL is useful for recalling the order of lateral to medial structures: femoral nerve, femoral artery, common femoral vein, "space" (femoral canal), and lymphatics.
