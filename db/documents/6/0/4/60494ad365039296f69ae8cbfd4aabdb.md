Patients with diplopia may initially present to the emergency department physician, primary care provider, and nurse practitioner. However, because there are many causes of diplopia and the workup is beyond the scope of the primary provider, these patients should be referred to an ophthalmologist and preferably to a neuro-ophthalmologist for definitive diagnosis and treatment planning. The prognosis depends on the cause. Emergency department and ophthalmology nurses are involved in the initial evaluation and coordination of evaluation. This interprofessional team can coordinate care to improve outcomes. [Level 5]
