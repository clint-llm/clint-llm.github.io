The management of bronchiolitis is with an interprofessional team that includes the emergency department physician, nurse practitioner, infectious disease consultant and the primary care provider. The majority of children improve with supportive care. Healthcare providers should encourage breastfeeding as it has been shown to reduce the risk of respiratory infections in children. Since the virus is passed on through air droplets, contact isolation precautions like hand washing and the use of hand sanitizers help prevent bronchiolitis infections among infants. The use of gloves and gowns are especially helpful in the hospital setting before entering and exiting the rooms of infected patients to prevent other patients and other family members from contracting the illness. At the same time, parents should be asked to discontinue smoking and maintain a clean air environment for the child.

Vaccinating all children older than 6 months of age against influenza is another preventive measure. In children younger than 6 months of age it is important that family members and caretakers get vaccinated against the influenza virus. The majority of children improve spontaneously over a few days and only the rare infant requires admission.
