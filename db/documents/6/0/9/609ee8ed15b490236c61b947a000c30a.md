Blazina et al. first used the term jumper's knee in 1973. They also classified the pathology by stage according to the onset of pain in relation to physical activity. This classification, along with its modifications, is still widely employed. Blazina et al. suggest four stages.

- Pain after sports activity

- Pain at the beginning of sports activity that disappears with warm-up and sometimes reappears with fatigue

- Pain at rest and during activity, along with the deterioration of performance

- Rupture of the tendon

Classifying the pathology intoÂ three stages according to the duration of symptoms may be useful.

- Acute when symptoms have been present for 0 to 6 weeks

- Sub-acute when symptoms have been present between 6 to 12 weeks

- Chronic after more than three months
