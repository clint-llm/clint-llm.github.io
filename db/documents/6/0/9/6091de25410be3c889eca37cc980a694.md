Products of conception in a normal pregnancy should be identifiable via transvaginal ultrasound when the beta-HCG level is above 1,500 mIU/mL. Fetal heart tones can be appreciated between six and eight weeks of gestation. Between eight and ten weeks of gestation, important information about the pregnancy can be obtained by the provider, including placental location, fetal position and anatomy, amniotic fluid volume, and maternal anatomy, including dimensions of the cervix and uterus. It is noted that anatomic abnormalities diagnosed within the early first trimester are often by chance, while late first trimester diagnoses are typically made duringÂ the anatomic ultrasound scans.

Ultrasound images that do not reveal an intrauterine pregnancy with beta-HCG levels either at or above the discriminatory zone should raise concern for abnormal pathology, including ectopic pregnancy, heterotopic pregnancy, and mass. Similarly, adnexal masses also warrant further investigation. Additionally, free fluid in the abdominal and or pelvis, especially in a hemodynamically unstable patient, should be taken seriously. A ruptured ectopic pregnancy must remain on the differential, and obstetrics should be contacted emergently.
