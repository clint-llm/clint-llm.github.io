Pulmonary papillomas are removed by surgical resection or endoscopic removal. Other techniques include laryngeal micro-debrider therapy, laser, lesion injection of the antiviral drug cidofovir, photodynamic therapy, and subcutaneous interferon-alpha therapy. Surgically removed solitary papillomas do not recur, but recurrences are observed in approximately 20% of patients treated with endoscopic removal. The prognosis of completely surgically removed lesions is good. Rare recurrences are observed in incompletely removed lesions. Malignant transformation is rarely observed in squamous cell papillomas.

Precautions should be taken with laser therapy to prevent aerosolization of HPV DNA particles with potential inhalation by medical staff.
