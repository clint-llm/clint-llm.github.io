"Arcuate sign" is an avulsion fracture of the fibular head and is frequently mistaken for a Segond fracture on radiographs. The arcuate ligament complex or the posterolateral ligaments may avulse from the fibular head during a traumatic deformity to the knee. Like Segond fractures, this finding is pathognomonic for ligamentous knee injury and instability and should be investigated in a similar fashion. There are, however, subtle differences on plain radiographs, as an arcuate avulsion is normally more horizontal, lateral, and posterior than would be seen in a true Segond fracture.
