If ruptured, cavernous aneurysms most commonly cause direct carotid-cavernous fistulas, though they may also cause massive epistaxis if there is erosion into the sphenoid sinus or subarachnoid hemorrhage if there is an extension through the dural ring into the subarachnoid space. However, the most common symptoms from these aneurysms are a result of a mass effect on the adjacent cranial nerves. Many cavernous carotid aneurysms present without symptoms as incidental findings or with only mild symptoms and require no treatment.
