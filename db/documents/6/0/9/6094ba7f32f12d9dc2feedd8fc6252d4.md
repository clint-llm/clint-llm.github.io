The prevalence of diverticulosis is veryÂ high, and while the disorder is asymptomatic, it can present with painless bleeding or progress into an inflammatory state. Because of the enormous healthcare costs in managing complications of diverticulosis, the condition is managed by an interprofessional team.

A dietitian must be consulted to educate the patient on a high-fiber diet. The pharmacist should educate the patient on the avoidance of medications that cause constipation. The nurse should educate the patient on avoiding smoking, drinking ample water, and becoming more physically active, all of which lead to less constipation. The clinician should educate the patient on the potential complications of diverticulosis and the associated healthcare costs. Once a patient has been diagnosed with diverticulosis, the patient should be seen by the interprofessional team to ensure that the patient has acquired sufficient knowledge in preventing complications.

These simple recommendations can help avoid complications like bleeding and diverticulitis. Finally, it is important to inform the patient that when surgery is undertaken for a complication of diverticulosis, there is always a risk of a stoma, which can seriously impair the quality of life.
