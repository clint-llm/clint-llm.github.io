BC is a tumor of old adults (> 60 years). Common presenting symptoms include:

- Microscopic hematuria

- Gross hematurias

- Infection or obstruction.

Other less common symptoms include painful micturition, frequency, constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, and a pelvic mass.

There are no screening tests for the early detection of BC. Gross hematuria correlates with advanced disease stage.
