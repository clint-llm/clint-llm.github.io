Early in the disease process, glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy will present with thinning and atrophy of the retinal ganglion cell layer and thus, thinning of the nerve fiber layer above the ganglion cells. The nerve fiber layer consists of the unmyelinated ganglion cell axons, hence they shrink concomitantly. In more advanced glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy there will be both cupping of the optic nerve as well as atrophy of the ganglion cell layer and subsequently the nerve fiber layer. As the ganglion cells deteriorate the structural integrity of the nerve is compromised. Hence, increased intraocular pressure willÂ push into the optic nerve and cause the visible phenomenon of cupping. Retinal ganglion cell loss also leads to increased space and widening of the subdural optic nerve space.
