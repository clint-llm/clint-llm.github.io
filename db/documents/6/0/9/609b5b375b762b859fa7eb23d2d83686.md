Cutaneous mastocytosis can involve any part of the body, but mostly it is found on the trunk and extremities. Lesions can be single or few, of variable size and appear as yellowish brown pigmented macules, papules or nodules. The lesions are generally non-tender but can be associated with intermittent itching and erythema. Rubbing or stroking the lesion can degranulate the mast cells and cause flushing, itching, and swelling of the skin, known as **Darrier's sign**which is pathognomic of the disease. The blistering and bullous presentation is common in children less than three years of age and can also be present in diffuse and severe forms of the disease. The difference between mastocytoma and UP is based on the number of lesions present when the number is three or fewer nodules it is a mastocytoma. The diffuse disease presents with thickened, leathery skin without individual lesions.

**Telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans**is an extremely uncommon variant that may present as red telangiectatic macules and may be found in conjunction with UP. No scarring results from any of the lesions. While there is no systemic involvement in cutaneous mastocytosis, symptoms of wheezing and syncope have been reported. Gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea have been reported in about 40% of children. Alternatively, a full-blown acute mast cell activation causing anaphylactic symptoms may also occur.
