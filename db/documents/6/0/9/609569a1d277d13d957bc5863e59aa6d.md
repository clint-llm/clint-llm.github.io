Imipramine is available both in tablets and in capsules. The tablets are available in doses of 10, 25, 50 mg, while the capsules are available in doses of 75, 100, 125, 150 mg. Due to the side effects associated with imipramine and with other tricyclic antidepressants, the recommendation is to initiate treatment at a lower dose and then titrate up gradually to higher doses. Some metal ions such as copper, zinc, and magnesium can affect the efficiency of passive and active transport of imipramine.
