A full neurological examination followed by a complete ophthalmological evaluation should be performed. The exam will give a baseline visual acuity and monitor progression or improvement.

The eye with optic nerve compression will have reduced visual acuity. It can also show a deficiency in color vision (dyschromatopsia), which can be evaluated by using the Ishihara test plate. Proptosis or resistance to manual pressure, suggest an intraorbital lesion. Ocular motility abnormalities are checked. The optic disc can be atrophic or edematous but can also appear healthy. Optociliary shunt vessels can be seen due to obstruction in the venous return.

Laboratory studies include complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone, T3, T4, luteinizing hormone, anti-thyroid antibodies, thyroid releasing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin, adrenocorticotropin hormone, insulin growth factor-1, cortisol, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and prostate-specific antigen. The angiotensin-converting-enzyme is usually elevated in more than half of the patients with active sarcoidosis.

Brain and orbit magnetic resonance imaging will show in detail the optic nerves, parasellar area, and orbital contents. Fat suppression images are needed to demonstrate enhancing lesions inside the orbit. Lesions involving the orbital bones should be examined using a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the head and orbit. It will demonstrate orbital fractures and concomitant injuries in traumatic cases. Ultrasonography can be used for intraorbital biopsy of anterior lesions.
