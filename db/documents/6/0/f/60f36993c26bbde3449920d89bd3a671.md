Argyria is the dermatological manifestation of chronic silver exposure toxicity. However, if a large quantity of silver-containing compounds is acutely ingested, silver toxicity can occur and may be fatal. The dose needed to be fatal is 50 mg or more of intravenous colloidal silver. This would lead to pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, and necrosis of bone marrow, liver, and kidneys.
