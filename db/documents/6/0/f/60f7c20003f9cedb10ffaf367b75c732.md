Grossly specimens can show periosteal elevation. Two histologic types of hemangiomas of the vertebra can occur cavernous and capillary angiomas. Cavernous angiomas involve large blood vessels not separated by normal bone. Capillary angiomas involve thin-walled capillary vessels separated by normal bone. There is usually a capsule surrounding the lesion with adjacent bone potentially exhibiting osteolysis.
