**Conventional radiographs:**Anteroposterior, lateral, and notch views. Radiographs have lower sensitivity and specificity in early grades of CMP. In advanced stages, might show chondrosis, cystic changes, advanced cartilage loss, or joint space loss. In general, radiographs can serve as guidance to the underlying etiology such as in cases of trochlear dysplasia, patella Alta, patella Baja, or lateral patellar tilt.

**CT scan:**gives more information with regard to patellofemoral alignment by delineating trochlear geometry. The TT-TG distance can be measured on the CT scan. In addition, torsional deformities of the lower limb can be detected and measured.

**Arthrography with plain radiographs or CT arthrography:**Despite low sensitivity, may demonstrate inhibited contrast in areas of chondromalacia. Also, my sport successfully focal areas of cartilage or irregular cartilage or lost cartilage but again in advanced stages.

**MRI scan:**is the modality of choice for articular cartilage assessment with the best appearances on the T2 sequences, where abnormal cartilage shows high signal intensity. Non-invasive and more reliable and with a higher detection rate than arthroscopy.

Radiologically, patellofemoral congruency can be assessed by multiple variables: sulcus angle, trochlear depth, patellar angle, and evaluating patellar tilt by measuring lateral patellar tilt angle. In an MRI study for patients with CMP, both the lateral patellar tilt angle and trochlear depth were significantly decreased, sulcus angle was significantly higher. And there was no correlation reported between patella angle and CMP.

Another MRI study evaluated the correlation between obesity and CMP and reported that subcutaneous knee fat thickness was significantly higher in CMP patients in comparison with normal populations. Additionally, a significant correction was reported between subcutaneous knee fat thickness and the grade of CMP. Female patients were found to have thicker subcutaneous knee fat and more serious CMP than male patients.

**Arthroscopy:**This is the most efficient modality in diagnosing chondromalacia, and determining the location and size of cartilage lesions as well as patella position. However, due to its invasiveness, non-invasive methods are essential for the diagnosis.
