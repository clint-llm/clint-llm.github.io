Pregnancy is a period of significant changes in the function of the entire endocrine system in women's health. During this time, the production of polypeptide and steroid hormones by the fetal-placental unit results in physiologic changes of most maternal organs. These changes are necessary for the organ systems to adapt to the functional requirements of the mother and the fetus. The hypothalamus-pituitary system is the regulatory center for most hormonal systems. During pregnancy, it provides the essential hormones for the development of the fetus and the maternal adjustment to endocrine and metabolic changes. The pituitary gland enlarges by about one-third to achieve these functional changes, with the major component of this growth being the estrogen-induced hyperplasia of the lactotroph cells. The product of these cells, prolactin (PRL), rises progressively and promotes breast growth in preparation for lactation. The rest of the pituitary hormones, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and growth hormone (GH), are also important. Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) fall to the lowest limits of detectability and are unresponsive to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation during pregnancy. Sheehan syndrome is a rare, emergency clinical scenario, which will worth remembering.
