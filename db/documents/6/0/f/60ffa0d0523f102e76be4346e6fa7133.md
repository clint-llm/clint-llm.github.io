The pathophysiology of atrophie blanche can vary depending on the underlying etiology. It is often idiopathic but may be associated with several other disease processes, including autoimmune conditions and hypercoagulable disorders. The pathogenesis typically involves disturbances in fibrinolysis and/or coagulation, leading to thrombo-occlusion of blood vessels in the superficial dermis.
