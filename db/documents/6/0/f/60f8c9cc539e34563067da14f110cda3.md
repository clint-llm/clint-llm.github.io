If an ultrasound machine is not immediately available and central venous access via the right jugular vein is required, a simple three-finger technique for insertion of a central venous access line into the right internal jugular vein has proven to be a reliable method for accomplishing this task. This technique works well regardless of the body habitus of the patient or whether the patient can rotate their head to the left. This activity describes the indications, contraindications, and complications associated with the internal jugular line placement and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in ensuring safe venous access.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for internal jugular vein access.
- Explain how to insert an internal jugular catheter.
- Summarize the complications of internal jugular vein cannulation.
- Describe the importance of collaboration and coordination amongst the interprofessional team to facilitate safe internal jugular vein cannulation and improve patient outcomes.
