Iron toxicity is classified as corrosive or cellular. Ingested iron can cause direct caustic injury to the gastrointestinal mucosa, resulting in nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Significant fluid and blood loss can lead to hypovolemia. Hemorrhagic necrosis of gastrointestinal mucosa can lead to hematemesis, perforation, and peritonitis. At the cellular level, iron impairs cellular metabolism in the heart, liver, and central nervous system. Free iron enters cells and concentrates in the mitochondria. This disrupts oxidative phosphorylation, catalyzes lipid peroxidation, forms free radicals, and ultimately leads to cell death.

When cellular injury occurs, metabolic acidosis is common.
