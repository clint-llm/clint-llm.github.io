Isolated cortical venous thrombosis (ICVT), also known as cortical vein thrombosis, is a distinct subtype of cerebral venous thrombosis and also a rare cause of stroke. ICVT occurs when a blood clot (thrombus) forms within the cortical vein system but does not involve the dural sinuses, such as the superior sagittal sinus, transverse sinus, etc. Cortical veins include the superficial cerebral veins, such as the superficial middle cerebral vein, and deep cerebral veins, such as the vein of Galen.

Isolated cortical venous thrombosis manifests in a constellation of symptoms such as headache, new-onset seizures, altered consciousness, and focal neurological deficits. If ICVT is not adequately treated, it can cause a cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, or herniation. ICVT is considered a rare cause of stroke and contributes to a mere 6.3% of all cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis.
