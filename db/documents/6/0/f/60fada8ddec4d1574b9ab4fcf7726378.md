# Definition/Introduction

Water is essential for the maintenance of life. As the major element of fluid compartments in the body, water makes up approximately 60% of body weight. Gender, age, physical activity, and adiposity are pertinent factors that may alter this percentage.

The body uses water for a variety of mechanisms from transporting nutrients to excreting wastes and tissue structure viability. Water balance occurs by matching the daily water input/output to and from the body. The primary means of water intake is by consumption of food and fluids. Daily fluid maintenance requirements for adults are approximately 1.5 to 2.5L of water.

During the perioperative period, the goals of fluid management are to provide a suitable volume of parenteral fluid to support cardiac preload, intravascular volume, oxygen carrying capacity, and electrolyte balance. Additionally, parenteral fluid replenishment focuses on equipping the body with enough fluid to meet both insensible and sensible physiologic losses. Maintenance fluid rate replacement is calculated by using the “4-2-1” rule, which came from the 1950s work published in Pediatrics.

# Issues of Concern

Intravenous fluid therapy typically consists of using colloids, crystalloids, or a combination of both. Crystalloids such as normal saline contain usually contain salts with or without glucose. When crystalloids are given, they precipitously equilibrate with and disperse throughout the whole extracellular fluid space. In initial fluid resuscitation, crystalloids are classically the first line fluid used in most patients.

Colloid solutions such as albumin typically contain proteins or large glucose polymers. When a colloid solution is given, the high protein content the solution keeps the solution intravascular for a more extended period. Secondarily, this type of solution works to support the intravascular plasma oncotic pressure. Colloids cost substantially more than crystalloids and are associated with more complications, both of which tend to limit their use.

# Clinical Significance

Evaluation of intravascular volume and clinical assessment are critical because fluid compartment volumes cannot easily be measured. Intravascular volume may undergo assessment by using laboratory/physical exams, and hemodynamic monitoring means.  Frequent evaluations are necessary despite the method used to confirm the initial impression to best manage fluid replacement. The physical examination is most reliable when assessing a patient’s baseline fluid status**.**

Insensible fluid loss is routinely a cause of concern when evaluating patients. Patients may exhibit nonspecific and specific signs on exams such as dry mucous membranes, poor skin turgor, poor capillary refill, tachycardia, and dyspnea. The cause of insensible fluid loss may be due to many diagnoses, including surgery, respiratory loss, dehydration, burns, metabolic, and vascular etiologies. While the physical exam findings may point to hypovolemia, the cause is difficult to know without proper laboratory and imaging studies.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions

Assessment of fluid status is taught in nursing school, medical school, and physician assistant school.  Knowledge of fluid status and insensible fluid losses is paramount in the care of critically ill patients.  There must be free-flowing information and communication regarding fluid status from bedside nurses to the other medical professionals that are part of the patient's care team.  Physicians across the United States are more commonly turning to point of care ultrasound (POCUS) to provide quick, accurate information on the fluid status of their patients by looking at the inferior vena cava and heart using transthoracic echocardiograms.  As this becomes more common, the healthcare team will be able to accurately assess and treat fluid status and monitor for insensible fluid losses.  Interestingly, there is level I/II evidence that radiologists can provide the healthcare team with pertinent imaging findings that may help to elude the cause of hypovolemia,****
