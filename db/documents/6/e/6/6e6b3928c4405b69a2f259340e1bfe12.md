Diagnosis is based primarily on radiographic findings, upper endoscopy, and esophageal manometry. An upperÂ gastrointestinal (GI) series remains a mainstay in the diagnoses of hiatal hernias. The study can show the location of the GE junction, size of the hernia defect, and the orientation of the stomach. Upper endoscopy can evaluate for the presence of Cameron ulcers as well as directly visualize the amount of stomach that has herniated into the chest. High-resolution manometry (HRM) and esophageal pressure topography (EPT) has been shown to reliably detect hiatal hernias, which is characterized by a pressure trough located between the crural hiatus and GE junction. This modality provides information on intraluminal pressure, lower esophageal sphincter function, and coordinated contractile movements of the esophagus. This is important in surgical planning in determining which antireflux procedure would be needed if the repair was indicated.
