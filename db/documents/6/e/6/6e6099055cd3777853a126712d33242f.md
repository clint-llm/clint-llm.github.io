The histopathological findings in tumor lysis syndrome are associated with the deposition of uric acid, calcium phosphate, and xanthine in the lamina of the distal kidney tubules. Crystals of uric acid can also deposit kidney tubular epithelial cells as well as the medulla. The factors that favor the formation of crystals include low urine flow, low solubility, and high levels of solutes. The deposition of crystals in the renal pelvis, calyxes, and the ureter can cause inflammation leading to obstruction of urinary flow. Longstanding obstruction creates hydroureter, hydronephrosis, and subsequent acute kidney failure.
