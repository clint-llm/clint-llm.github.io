Proteinuria is a broad term used to describe protein in the urine. It is a general term for the presence of proteins, including albumin, globulin, Bence-Jones protein, and mucoprotein in the urine.

The primary etiology of proteinuria is the disturbance in the kidney filter. In addition to its association with early renal disease, it is also seen in benign conditions.

According to the UK chronic kidney disease guidelines, proteinuria is defined as a urine protein creatinine ratio (UPCR) of more than 45 mg/mmol, but this does not warrant further evaluation in the absence of hematuria unless the UPCR is more than 100 mg/mmol.

According to the NICE guidelines, proteinuria is defined as a UPCR of more than 50 mg/mmol or a urine albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) of more than 30 mg/mmol.
