The most common complication of foreign body ingestion in children is obstruction of the object in the esophagus, although the foreign body may become lodged anywhere in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Once lodged, the object may partially or completely obstruct the GI tract. Furthermore, some foreign bodies may erode through the GI tract, causing complications due to perforation or migration of the object.  Certain patients may be at higher risk for retention, obstruction, or perforation. These include younger patients with smaller anatomy, those with prior upper GI tract surgery, history of significant gastroesophageal reflux or eosinophilic esophagitis, neuromuscular disease states, or presence of congenital malformations.

The most common site for obstruction is at the thoracic inlet, which is the area between the clavicles on x-ray. The cricopharyngeus sling located at C6 is also located at this level and known to be a common site for the lodgement of foreign bodies. About 10 to 15% of foreign bodies get trapped in the mid esophagus, where the carina and aortic arch overall the esophagus. The rest get entrapped at the lower esophageal junction.

Foreign bodies are likely to get lodged in children with preexisting esophageal abnormalities. Once a foreign body reaches the stomach, it is less likely to be associated with complications. However, some foreign bodies can become trapped at the ileocecal valve.
