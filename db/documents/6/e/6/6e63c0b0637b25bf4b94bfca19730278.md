V/Q ratio is the ratio between air getting into the alveoli and the blood flow to the lungs. Ventilation, perfusion, and V/Q vary in different lung regions because of the effect of gravity and the differences in the sub-atmospheric intrapleural pressure. Both ventilation (V) and perfusion (Q) are higher at the lungs' bases than at the apex. However, the perfusion is proportionally higher than the ventilation at the base and vice versa at the apex. As a result, the V/Q ratio is low at the base and higher at the apex. Considering that ventilation equals approximately 4 L per minute and the perfusion equals 5 L/min, a normal V/Q level is 0.8.

**Potential Differential Diagnosis Based on Mismatched V/Q Ratio**

**1. High V/Q ratio (>0.8)**

It develops when ventilation exceeds perfusion.

Causes are:

- Lung regions with pulmonary blood flow obstruction, e.g., pulmonary embolism or non-embolic obstruction by tumor and/or radiation therapy

- Cardiovascular shock

- Emphysema

**2. Low V/Q ratio (<0.8)**

It develops when perfusion exceeds ventilation. This can occur by either decreasing ventilation or increasing the perfusion without a change in ventilation.

Causes are:

- Pulmonary infections such as pneumonia

- Pulmonary edema

- Acute respiratory distress syndrome

- Alveolar collapse

- Asthma

- Eisenmenger syndrome

- Pulmonary AV communication

- Extrinsic compression of alveoli due to compression atelectasis

- In PE, over perfusion can occur in the normally ventilated regions where blood flow is diverted from the impaired blood flow region
