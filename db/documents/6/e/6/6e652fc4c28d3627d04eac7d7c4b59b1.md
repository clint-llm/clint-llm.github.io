Nasal septoplasty is one of the most commonly performed procedures within otorhinolaryngology (ENT) and plastic surgery. The primary indication for this functional (as opposed to purely aesthetic) surgery is usually septal deviation resulting in significant and symptomatic nasal airway obstruction. Many surgical techniques and approaches have been described; these include endonasal, endoscopic and open procedures. Septoplasty can also be performed alongside or in addition to rhinoplasty, turbinoplasty, or as part of functional endoscopic sinus surgery to improve surgical exposure and access. Operative recovery usually lasts a few weeks, and serious complications are rare. Appropriate patient selection is crucial to maximizing patient outcomes.
