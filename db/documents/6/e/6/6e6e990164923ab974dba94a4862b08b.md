Patients who present with sudden onset focal neurological deficits should immediately have a blood glucose level checked. Hypoglycemia may mimic the focal symptoms of an ischemic CVA and may also exacerbate symptoms of prior CVAs. Ancillary laboratory testing includes a basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, troponin, coagulation studies, and an electrocardiogram. Non-contrast computed tomography (CT) is the first-line imaging of choice due to its non-invasive and rapid nature, as well as its widespread availability. CT is, however, not sensitive for the presence of acute CVA, especially in the first 48 hours, with estimates of sensitivity as low as 12%
