Almost half a million people seek medical care due to burn injuries every year. The anesthesiologist plays a critical role in the management of complicated burn patients in areas of airway management, hemodynamic support, intravascular access, thermoregulation, and pulmonary support.  The airway of a severely burned patient can quickly become compromised with traditional means of anesthesia and requires special attention to ensure adequate ventilation. Pathophysiologic changes in the burn patient pose challenges for fluid resuscitation intraoperatively, induction drug selection, as well as special attention to ventilation strategies. The anesthesiologist's role is critical to optimize the care of burn patients.
