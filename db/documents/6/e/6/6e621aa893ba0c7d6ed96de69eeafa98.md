Several factors may contribute to the chronic inflammation that arises in the epithelial layer of the nasolacrimal duct. Repeated episodes of dacryocystitis may lead to changes in the structural epithelial and subepithelial cells. In particular, loss of typical goblet and epithelial cells, which play a crucial role in tear outflow mechanism, has been described in pathological studies. Chronic inflammation may also cause fibrosis of the connective tissue fibers in the area of the lacrimal sac and nasolacrimal duct, with loss of blood vessels of the cavernous body that contribute to malfunctioning of the tear outflow mechanism and initiate a vicious circle.
