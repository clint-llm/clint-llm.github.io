As many toxic gases overlap in terms of toxic effects, history is imperative to help determine the specific gas causing the toxicity. Occupational history and recent local travel history will help differentiate, i.e., working in a petroleum plant or as a sewage inspector, or traveling to a natural hot spring or volcano. Patients may typically report a strong “rotten egg” smell. However, it is important to note that hydrogen sulfide rapidly desensitizes olfactory nerves, and after prolonged exposure, patients may fail to recall the malodorous scent. Lack of malodor should not be relied upon as a definitive exclusion of hydrogen sulfide toxicity.

Exposure can be low, high, or very high level. chronic low-level exposure presents with irritation to mucous membranes, headache, insomnia, dizziness, and fatigue. High-level exposure presents with cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, nausea, vomiting, and vertigo. Very high-level exposure presents myocardial infarction, loss of consciousness, seizures, and cardiopulmonary arrest. Clinical examination findings for low dose exposure include conjunctivitis, green-gray line on the gingiva, and phryngitis. Clinical examination findings for high-level exposure include bradycardia, agitation, cyanosis, and acute lung injury. At higher doses, pulmonary edema, hemoptysis (hemorrhagic pulmonary edema), and delayed corneal injury may occur. Higher doses may also induce neurological symptoms of seizure, coma, and ultimately death.
