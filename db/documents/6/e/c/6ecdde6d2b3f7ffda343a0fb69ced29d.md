All tissues have variable sensitivity and response to radiation injury. Common sites of irritation and their associated complications are described here:

**Head and Neck**

**Skin and Mucosa -**Acute response involves erythema, inflammation, and desquamation of dry and moist surfaces, which manifest as mucositis, pruritis, hypersensitivity, pain, ulcers in the mucosa.

**Salivary Glands****-**Salivary gland irradiation may result in cell death by apoptosis, manifesting as swelling and tenderness after the first dose of treatment, progressing to xerostomia and subsequent severe dental caries and osteonecrosis, difficulty wearing dentures, eating and speech difficulties. Recovery of salivary gland function, if occurs, takes months or years.

**Nervous System -**Acute effects or cranial irradiation include fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, headaches, hearing loss, acute encephalopathy (rare), and worsening neurologic symptoms (due to edema of the irradiated tumor and surrounding tissues). Long-term neurologic sequelae can be persistent fatigue, neurocognitive effects, cerebrovascular disease, neuroendocrine dysfunction, and secondary malignancies.

**Thorax -**Breast, lung, esophageal, and lymphatic system cancers are frequently treated with irradiation as part of the treatment regimen.

**Lung**- Early phase clinical effects of lung irradiation include congestion, cough, dyspnea, fever, and chest pain caused by radiation pneumonitis. Radiographic studies reveal infiltrates within the irradiated field. Severe cases result in hypoxia and subsequent right-sided heart failure. Partial irradiation on the lung may occasionally induce bilateral immune-mediated pneumonitis that generally resolves without treatment.

**Heart**- Radiation injury to the heart can manifest as acute pericarditis, pericardial effusion, constrictive pericarditis, valvular dysfunction, conductive system dysfunction, and myocardial fibrosis.

**Abdomen and Pelvis**

**Gastrointestinal System -**Acute radiation toxicity presents as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea about 2-3 weeks after radiation therapy. Radiation injury to the large bowel presents with large volume watery diarrhea. Chronic effects include chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, recurrent bouts of ileus or obstruction, proliferative mucosal telangiectasias, or ulceration. The rectum is the most commonly affected normal tissue in radiotherapy for prostate and cervical cancer. Symptoms of acute radiation injury are diarrhea, increased mucus secretion, and tenesmus due to loss of mucosal epithelium. Long-term complications are increased stool frequency, urgency, rectal bleeding, pain, variable degrees of incontinence and strictures, and fistula formation.

**Urinary Tract**- RT can cause varying degrees of irritation and functional impairment of bladder transitional epithelium and mucosa. Acute presentation varies from mild dysuria, increased frequency, urgency, microscopic hematuria to urinary incontinence, gross hematuria, and bladder necrosis.

**Gonads -**Irradiation to ovaries leads to infertility or premature ovarian failure even at low doses with increased sensitivity with advancing age. For women under 40 with a strong desire to preserve fertility, the ovarian transposition procedure can reduce the risk of irradiation. Long-term management is a hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms. Radiotherapy may result in impotence and testicular dysfunction in males. Patients undergoing radiotherapy should be offered sperm or egg cryopreservation options before undergoing RT.

**Cervicitis and Vaginitis -**Acute symptoms of mucositis include erythema, ulceration, exudative changes, serous discharge, and increased predisposition to infection. Full-thickness ulceration may be seen with brachytherapy for cervical cancers. Late side effects include fistulas (rectovaginal or rectovesical), vaginal stenosis, and vaginismus. Treatment is conservative for mild symptoms; persistent non-healing mucositis, ulcers, or fistulas can be treated with hyperbaric oxygen or pentoxifylline, and mechanical dilatation for vaginal stenosis.

**Miscellaneous -**Radiation-induced lymphedema causes local swelling and obstructive symptoms. Treatment is usually patient-directed, including physiotherapy, limb elevation, compression therapy, manual lymphatic drainage, or complete decongestive therapy and intermittent pneumatic compression in severe cases.
