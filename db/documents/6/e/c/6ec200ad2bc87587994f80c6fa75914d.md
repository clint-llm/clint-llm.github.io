Although not common, dupilumab may cause serious adverse effects, including joint aches, eyelid swelling and inflammation, and allergic reactions such as shortness of breath and wheezing.

Nasopharyngitis and headache have also been reported at a higher frequency among patients receiving dupilumab than among those receiving placebo.

It is postulated that dupilumab may possibly induce various forms of arthropathy, enthesitis, and tendinopathy in certain highly atopic individuals by enhancing an IL-17-mediated peripheral spondyloarthritis/psoriatic arthritis pattern of inflammatory enthesitis.
