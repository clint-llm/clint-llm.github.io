The prognosis of dyspareunia depends on the causative factor of this pain. If the underlying cause is known and curable, then it has a better prognosis. Its prognosis is poor in idiopathic dyspareunia. Following treatment, patients with dyspareunia should receive counsel about the prognosis of the disorder. Treatment can last for several months, and complete resolution is also not guaranteed. Studies suggest that results start appearing after at least three months. After that, the patient's distress starts decreasing with improved quality of life. A 24-month follow-up is recommended for the best results.
