Most individuals have bowel movements at regular intervals, and although the frequency varies from person to person, stools should pass without significant straining or discomfort. Functional constipation is a term used to describe a condition in which patients have hard, infrequent bowel movements that are often difficult or painful to pass. Functional constipation does not result from a clearly identifiable anatomic abnormality or disease process and is a diagnosis of exclusion. This activity reviews functional constipation in children and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected children.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the features of the history and physical exam relevant to the diagnosis of functional constipation in children.

- Review "red flags" in the history and physical exam that would suggest a diagnosis other than functional constipation.
- Explain the treatment of functional constipation in children.

- Describe a well-coordinated interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to children with functional constipation.
