Acute intermittent porphyria results from mutations in the HMBS gene, which causes about 50% of HMBS deficiency. The gene is on the 11q24.1-q24.2 chromosome. For now, there are known 391 HMBS gene mutations.

Inducers of acute attacks are alcohol, infections, low caloric intake, reproductive hormones change, and high-risk porphyrogenic drugs. The Norwegian Porphyria Centre (NAPOS), with the European Porphyria Network (Epnet), has created a list of medications that clinicians must avoid using in porphyria patients. These drugs include ketamine, thiopental, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, nitrofurantoin, rifampicin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, spironolactone, methyldopa, valproic acid, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, and risperidone.
