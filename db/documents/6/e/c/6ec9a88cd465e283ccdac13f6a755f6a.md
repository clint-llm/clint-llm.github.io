Data suggest that survival in hATTR-CM is worse when compared to wATTR-CM. Mean survival in hATTR-CM (Val122lle) is approximately 2.5 years. hATTR patients with isolated polyneuropathy with no heart involvement have a better prognosis with a mean survival of 8 to 10 years.

The median survival in wATTR is approximately 3.5 years, and it can further be risk-stratified based on the Mayo Clinic wATTR-CM staging system. Stage I: 66 months; Stage II: 42 months; Stage III: 20 months.

The U.K. National amyloidosis center studied both hATTR and wATTR cohorts and used Nt-proBNP (>3000 pg/dl) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (<45 ml/min/1.73m^2). They reported mean survival in hATTR-CM (Val122lle) of 29 months and wATTR of 49 months. Interestingly, echocardiographic findings, including left ventricular mass, wall thickness, and degree of diastolic dysfunction, were not found to be an independent predictor of survival.

Technitium pyrophosphate scan can be used for prognosticating ATTR-CM as well. A heart to the contralateral chest uptake ratio of 1.6 or greater has poorer 5-year outcomes.
