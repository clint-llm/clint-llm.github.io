**Acute Compartment Syndrome (ACS)**

Compartment syndrome develops when pressures within a closed compartment (i.e., the lower leg) exceeds the perfusion pressure of the vessel, leading to tissue ischemia, nerve compression, and subsequent pain out of proportion on exam.

ACS commonly presents in patients sustaining blunt trauma from motor vehicle accidents. Young patients suffering from tibial fractures of the diaphysis are at higher risk for developing compartment syndrome and must be monitored accordingly.

**Four Compartment Fasciotomy**

Current management of compartment syndrome involves releasing all four lower leg compartments.

- Neurovascular injury

- Soft tissue injury

**Pediatric Considerations**

Tibial fractures are among the most common fractures sustained by the pediatric population.

Indications for lower extremity amputations include the presence of lower extremity ischemia from arterial occlusion (including critical limb ischemia), distal extremity infection, or presence of a malignant tumor.

**Achilles Tendon Rupture**

The Achilles tendon is the strongest tendon, and susceptible to injury and rupture.

Treatment

- Rest/activity modification

- NSAIDs

- Physical therapy (e.g., eccentric exercises)

Though tendinopathy management is generally with nonoperative treatment modalities, acute AT ruptures may require surgical intervention.  A common repair technique for tears located near the musculotendinous junction includes a direct end-to-end repair (open versus percutaneous techniques).  Direct repairs are most amenable to healing within six weeks out from the injury date.  The data remains controversial regarding the outcome following surgery compared to nonoperative management (i.e., functional bracing/rehab protocols).

**Gastrocnemius Tears**

Tearing of the gastrocnemius muscle is a common injury in patients over the age of 40 years, and is often referred to as tennis leg, because of its prevalence within the sport.
