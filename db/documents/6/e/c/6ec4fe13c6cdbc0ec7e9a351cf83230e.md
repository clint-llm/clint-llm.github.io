Platysmaplasty is an elective cosmetic procedure and is indicated in those patients who want to reverse age-related changes in the neck, such as loose, saggy skin, platysmal bands/cords, and excess fat in the neck (turkey-gobbler neck). A standard face-lift (cervicofacial rhytidectomy) will adequately address most of these age-related neck changes and remains the gold standard, but for those patients who are unwilling to undergo a face-lift, the neck-lift or platysmaplasty remainsÂ a reasonable alternative.

Giampapa and Di Bernardo have proposed the following five criteria for neck-lift candidacy:

- A poorly-defined CMA

- A poorly-defined inferior mandibular border or jawline

- Absence of laxity in the midfacial structures

- Small to moderate amounts of jowl and neck fat

- Patients who do not want to undergo a full face-lift

Certain absolute indications for midline platysmaplasty include:

- Patients with excessive redundancy in platysmal banding (depth more than 1.5 cm) and not corrected by lateral suspension/advancement of platysma

- Subplatysmal lipectomy, if performed, must be combined with midline platysmaplasty

- Patients with a type III platysmal decussation pattern (platysma muscle split apart or dehisced from midline).
