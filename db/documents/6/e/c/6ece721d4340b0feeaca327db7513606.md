Von Hebra first described erythroderma (exfoliative dermatitis) in 1868. It characteristically demonstrates diffuse erythema and scaling of greater than 90% of the body surface area. It is a reaction pattern and cutaneous manifestation of a myriad of underlying ailments, including psoriasis and eczema, or a reaction to the consumption of certain drugs. Though some experts believe it does not pose a significant risk of death, erythroderma is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires proper diagnosis, identification of underlying etiology, and management.
