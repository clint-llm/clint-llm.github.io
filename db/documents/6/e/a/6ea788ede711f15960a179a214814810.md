Fibrosarcomas are defined as a malignant neoplasm composed of fibroblasts that may have varying amounts of collagen production and a "herringbone" architecture. Adult fibrosarcomas have displayed a declining incidence over the past several decades as the classification of fibrosarcoma continually narrows, and other mesenchymal and non-mesenchymal tumors that mimic fibrosarcomas are more accurately diagnosed.
