Asthma typically presents with a history of respiratory symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough, and is characterized by underlying chronic airway inflammation

Asthma should be suspected in children with a history of wheezing if following symptoms are noted:

- Wheezing or coughing on physical exercise/activity, laughing or crying in absence of apparent respiratory

- A history of allergic disease (eczema or allergic rhinitis) or asthma in first-degree relatives

- Clinical improvement during 2-3 months of controller treatment and worsening after cessation

Symptoms may be triggered by many factors, including upper respiratory tract infections, activity, stress and environmental exposure to allergens, and tobacco smoke to name a few.

In the 2017 update, the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) published guidelines for asthma management in children ages five years and younger. While medications are an important component of asthma management, it is important to remember that a multi-pronged approach to asthma management comprises several strategies, including education, skills training, clinical monitoring, and environmental control measures when necessary. The goals of asthma management include normal activity and good control of asthma symptoms as well as minimizing future risk from exacerbations and medication side effects. Also, another goal is to maintain lung function and lung development as close to normal as possible.

The following section highlights a stepwise approach to asthma medications used for rescue and control in this age group. Step therapy is based on the domains of severity and control.
