The medial collateral ligament (MCL) is a flat band of connective tissue that runs from the medial epicondyle of the femur to the medial condyle of the tibia. Its role is to provide valgus stability to the knee joint. MCL injuries often occur in sports, especially in skiing. Sixty percent of skiing knee injuries involve the MCL. This activity describes the evaluation and management of medial collateral ligament injuries and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the mechanism of injury commonly associated with medial collateral ligament injuries.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with a medial collateral ligament injury.
- Review the treatment and management options available for medial collateral ligament injuries.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of medial collateral ligament injuries and improve outcomes.
