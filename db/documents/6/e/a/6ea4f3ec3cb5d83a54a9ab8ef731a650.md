The function of the ophthalmic veins is to drain blood from the eye and orbit, in addition to periocular adnexal tissues and parts of the mid-face, including the glabella and nasal bridge. The tributaries of the SOV include the following: the lacrimal vein, central retinal vein, superior vortex veins, anterior ethmoidal vein, several muscular veins, medial ophthalmic vein, and sometimes the IOV. The tributaries of the IOV include the following: veins from the inferior oblique, inferior rectus, eyelids, and lacrimal sac, and the inferior vortex veins. Blood collected from these tributary vessels then usually drains into the internal jugular vein via the cavernous sinus; however, alternate venous drainage pathways exist in a subset of the population, such as the pterygoid plexus, which drains into either the internal or external jugular vein. The jugular veins deliver blood into the right atrium of the heart by way of the superior vena cava.
