To recognize and appropriately diagnose myelophthisic anemia, the combinations of relevant laboratory data, peripheral blood smear, and bone marrow biopsy should be studied. Laboratory data include a complete blood count, which will show the level of white blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, MCV, reticulocytes counts, and Red cell distribution with (RDW). In myelophthisic anemia, pancytopenia could be found due to infiltration by cancers and also fibrosis. MCV is usually normal in this type of cancer, and reticulocyte counts are low. A peripheral blood smear will show abnormal red blood cells ranging from immature to defective shapes and the size of the cells. Red blood cells will be nucleated, and some will be inÂ teardrop forms. Other cells include giant platelets and immature leucocytes. The presence of these immature cells is called leucoerythroblastic.
