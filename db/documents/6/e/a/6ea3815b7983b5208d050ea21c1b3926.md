The interprofessional team, including both clinicians and nurses, has an ethical duty to ensure patients know and understand their healthcare-related rights. By providing a holistic and integrated approach, it can lead to improved outcomes regarding comprehension for the patient and their family. The PSDA has expansive applications to the nursing field, both regarding actions and interventions. Taking the time to understand the PSDA legislation, and how it applies to patients and the care delivered by nursing staff, will improve the quality of both care and communications.
