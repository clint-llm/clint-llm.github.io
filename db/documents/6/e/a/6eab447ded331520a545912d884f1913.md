Coarctation of the aorta is a congenital anomaly in which there is a narrowing of the aorta resulting in increased pressure proximal to the narrowing and decreased perfusion distal to it. There are three varieties of aortic coarctations: preductal, ductal, and postductal. Each of these classifications is named relative to the ductus arteriosus, which connects the main pulmonary artery to the proximal descending aorta. The ductus arteriosus closes at birth and becomes the ligamentum arteriosum within three weeks of closure. In the postductal form of coarctation of the aorta, the narrowing occurs distal to the ductus arteriosus. This variant is the most common form in adults, often presenting as upper extremity hypertension and weak pulses in the lower extremities. The internal thoracic artery plays a significant role in providing collateral circulation to the lower extremities in postductal coarctation. The increased blood pressure and flow through vessels proximal to the coarctation results in increased flow through the subclavian artery and into the internal thoracic artery, anterior intercostal artery, posterior intercostal artery, and then into the descending thoracic aorta. The intercostal collateral vessels become dilated and tortuous, eroding the inferior margins of the ribs. This erosive process shows up as rib notching on chest x-ray, a classic sign seen in postductal coarctation of the aorta.
