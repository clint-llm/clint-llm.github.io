In 2017, the National Poison Data System (NPDS) of the Annual Report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers observed patients with a single exposure to paralytic shellfish poisoning. They reported 3 major outcomes, 20 moderate outcomes, 17 minor outcomes, and no deaths among 109 patients.

Mortality rates from paralytic shellfish poisoning, the most severe of the shellfish poisoning syndromes, ranges between 1% and 12%. In severe cases, muscle paralysis along with respiratory failure can cause death in 2–25 hours. However, the risk of death is decreased if healthcare providers have prompt access to advanced life support.
