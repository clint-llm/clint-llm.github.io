Other patients at risk for a toxic optic neuropathy, including patients who abuse alcohol, and tobacco users,Â who are starting amiodarone, should be taught about the risks for optic nerve damage.

This includes patients undergoing gastric bypass surgery, starting methotrexate therapy, and being diagnosed with pernicious anemia.
