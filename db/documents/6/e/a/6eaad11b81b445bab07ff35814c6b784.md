The management of patients with CM-II is best when using an interprofessional team that includes primary care doctors, neurosurgeons, and radiologists. CM-II trained nurses, physical therapists, and pharmacists should also assist in the case. The patients typically present early in their clinical course because of the associated abnormalities, including myelomeningocele. Utilizing clinical and radiographic findings, the diagnosis can be made. Treatment of CM-II often requires intervention from neurosurgery. Attention must also be given to neonatal feeding difficulties, apnea, respiratory failure, and neurogenic bowel. If there is residual impairment, rehabilitation is essential to regain mobility and function. Long-term follow-up is essential to evaluate for worsening symptoms and whether additional treatment is necessary. Open communication between interprofessional team members is essential for improving outcomes. [Level 5]
