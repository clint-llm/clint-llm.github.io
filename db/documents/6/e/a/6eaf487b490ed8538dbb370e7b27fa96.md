The proceduralist should obtain informed consent. The patient is positioned appropriately depending on the location of the targeted nerve. Minimal or no sedation is typically required. However, moderate sedation may be considered in certain instances, such as chemical neurolysis with alcohol which may be painful, or during RFA. Aseptic technique should be maintained throughout the procedure.
