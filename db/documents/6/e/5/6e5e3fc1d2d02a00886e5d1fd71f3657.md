During the last decades, electrophysiology has evolved into an essential subspecialty in the field of cardiology. Through meticulous electrophysiologic studies (EPS),Â researchers have gained insight into the mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmias, developing very effective ablative therapies. The purpose of an EPS is to record intracardiac signals not obvious in the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) and to assess their timing and their relationship to the simultaneously recorded ECG signals. The interpretation of these recordings is perceived, however, as complex and confusing by many young cardiologists.

In this review, we will provide a brief introduction to the basic findings of an EPS. Also, we will discuss the role of the EPS interpretation in the diagnosis and therapy of the most common arrhythmias.
