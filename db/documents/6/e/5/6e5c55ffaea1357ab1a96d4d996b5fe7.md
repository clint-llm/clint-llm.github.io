Atracurium is indicated as an addition to general anesthesia to facilitate endotracheal intubation and provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation. While muscle relaxation is typically reserved to facilitate endotracheal intubation, studies have shown the efficacy of atracurium to facilitate the placement of a laryngeal mask airway. The study in question showed that when compared to laryngeal mask airway (LMA) placement with only propofol, administration of atracurium led to greater jaw relaxation and faster insertion.
