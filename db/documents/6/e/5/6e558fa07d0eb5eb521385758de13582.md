Motor and vocal tics have 3 components:

- Premonitory urge,

- Physical expression of the tic,

- Sense of relief experienced afterward

Further, there are exacerbating factors such as anxiety and voluntary suppressionÂ that influence the expression of tics. These various components involve multiple circuits in the brain, which connect the frontal cortex to subcortical structures (thalamus and basal ganglia).

Antipsychotics have been shown to reduce tics, pointing toward a major role for dopamine in GTS. Dopamine receptors are involved in both the excitatory and inhibitory pathways of the basal ganglia as well as the frontal cortex and ventral striatum. Theories suggest abnormalities in dopamine pathways at the presynaptic, intrasynaptic, and postsynaptic levels, but additional research is needed for further clarification. GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) disruption has been demonstrated in pathological post-mortem studies of Tourette syndrome patients. This disruption may result in the disinhibition of cortico-basal ganglia loops. Other neurotransmitters have been studied including glutamate, acetylcholine, serotonin, noradrenaline, and histamine and been found to have varying degrees of evidence supporting involvement in GTS.
