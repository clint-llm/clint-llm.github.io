The deep petrosal nerve delivers sympathetic information to the blood vessels of the lacrimal glands, oral cavity, and the nasal cavity. These sympathetic fibers that typically make up the deep petrosal nerve have variations in origin and pathway. Some fibers travel on the internal carotid plexus to the deep petrosal/ vidian, while others travel on the maxillary artery plexus of the external carotid artery right to the pterygopalatine ganglion.

There are some variations of where the nerve fibers of the vidian nerve enter the pterygopalatine ganglion as well. Firstly, about 30% of people have a partitioned pterygopalatine ganglion, and the other 70% of people have a single pterygopalatine ganglion. Of those with partitioned pterygopalatine ganglions, two-thirds receive the vidian nerve fibers on the lower partition of the ganglion; the other third receives nerve fibers to the upper partition of the ganglion. Of those with single pterygopalatine ganglions, a fifth receive the vidian nerve fibers on the lower partition of the ganglion; the remaining people receive vidian nerve fibers on the upper partition of the ganglion.
