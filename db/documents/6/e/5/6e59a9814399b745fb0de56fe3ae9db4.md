Creatine phosphokinase (CK) is the best initial test to perform. Values to consider DMD are above 10-times normal limits, while for BMD are above 5-times the normal limit. DCM CK values could present in a wide range above normal reference. Other tests that may present with high values are aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).

Transaminases could also be from hepatic origin.  In order to differentiate, gamma-glutamyl transferase needs to be ordered. If values are normal, then it is likely to be secondary to a myopathy like DMD.

The most accurate test is DMD gene deletion-duplication analysis, as 60% to 70% of patients show this abnormality. Should it not be positive on the basis of a strong clinical picture, sequencing would be recommended to assess for the rest (20% to 30%).
