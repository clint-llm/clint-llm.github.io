Effective management of PKU is best accomplished with a team approach. Depending upon the severity, this typically involves a primary care physician, a dietitian with PKU experience and a genetic counselor or geneticist/metabolism specialist. A clinical psychologist and social worker, as well as a developmental pediatrician, may be needed to address social and developmental concerns. Women of childbearing age with PKU and considering pregnancy, an obstetrician-gynecologist should be consulted before an anticipated pregnancy.
