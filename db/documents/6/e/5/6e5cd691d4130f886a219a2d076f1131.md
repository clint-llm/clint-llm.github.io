Dakin solution, also called Dakin fluid or Carrel-Dakin fluid, is a dilute sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) solution commonly known as bleach. The mixture of sodium peroxide (NaO) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) produces sodium hypochlorite. The main active agent in Dakin's solution is created when the chlorine in the solution reacts with water in the environment to form hypochlorous acid (HClO). This hypochlorous acid produces a potent antibacterial effect in tissues. This activity reviews the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, toxicity, and administration of Dakin solution as it applies to the clinical setting.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for the use of Dakin solution in a clinical setting.
- Explain the potential adverse effects of Dakin's solution.
- Describe the various strengths of Dakin's solution and which is best in the clinical setting.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients when using Dakin's solution for its intended indications.
