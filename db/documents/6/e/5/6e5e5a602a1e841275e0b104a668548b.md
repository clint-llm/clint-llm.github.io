Histologically, Stewart-Treves syndrome displays networks of small lymphatics and proliferating vascular channels that dissect dermal collagen and may obliterate appendages. The tumor endothelial cells lining these channels are commonly seen undergoing mitotic changes and display hyperchromatism and pleomorphism. The appearance of the epidermis can vary from atrophic to hyperkeratotic and acanthotic. Angiosarcomas typically can express CD31, CD34, D2-40, Ki67, and Ulex europaeus-1 lectin upon immunohistochemistry staining. Immunohistochemical detection of factor VIII-related antigen, although very specific for endothelial cells, is often negative in well-differentiated angiosarcomas.
