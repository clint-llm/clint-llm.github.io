There is no clinical trial data of anifrolumab use in pediatrics, pregnancy, and patients with renal/hepatic impairments. Additionally, researchers excluded patients with active severe lupus nephritis or neuropsychiatric SLE in clinical trials. Thus, at the current moment, anifrolumab should not be administered in this subset of populations.

Due to anifrolumabâ€™s side effect profile, clinicians should exercise caution in patients with an active infection or a history of herpes zoster.
