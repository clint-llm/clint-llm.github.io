In the United States, more than 5 million central venous catheters are inserted every year in both hospitalized and surgical patients. Once an indication for central venous catheterization is established, the clinician has multiple sites to select from including the internal jugular vein, subclavian vein, femoral vein or a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC). This activity reviews the indications and contraindications for subclavian lines and the technique involved in their placement. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of central lines and in preventing complications.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures pertinent to subclavian line insertion.
- Describe how the patient should be positioned during insertion of a subclavian line.
- Cite the complications associated with subclavian line insertion.
- Employ interprofessional team strategies to enhance care coordination and communication to ensure safe venous access and improved patient outcomes.
