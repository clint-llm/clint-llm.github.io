The removal or reversal of the causative agent primarily treats locked-in syndrome. Initially, acute management of locked-in syndrome should be focused on securing a patent airway, maintaining adequate oxygen saturation levels, and ensuring the patient is stable from a cardiac standpoint using heart rate, blood pressure, and occasionally orthostatic hypotension as predictive markers.

Care is then addressed at treating the precipitating agent. In the event of an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, the stroke protocol should be swiftly employed. Prompt thrombolytic therapy has been shown in one case to expedite the recovery process to nearly full recovery in ischemia related to LIS.

Removal of any precipitating mass should be done in cases of tumors and other mass lesions. Meningitis and abscesses may be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Treatments for demyelinating diseases are variable. The treatment of LIS from central pontine myelinolysis is focused on supportive measures: gradual correction of sodium abnormalities and closeÂ monitoring of respiratory status is imperative.

Subacute and chronic therapy aims at improving the patient's motor functionality months after the onset of the insult. Management at this stage should be based primarily on physical, respiratory, and speech therapy.
