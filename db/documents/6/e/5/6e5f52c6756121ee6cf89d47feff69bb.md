RPR testing is considered to be a relatively inexpensive and simple procedure. However, there are reports documenting a wide range of variability between laboratories. One report by Gupta et al. in 2009 found a 58.7% variation in RPR testing amongst 138 serology panels between 26 laboratories. This variability was attributed to several factors, including delayed testing, insufficient laboratory temperatures, use of different RPR card tests in various labs, and skewed interpretation of results. RPR testing requires the provision of standard resources and strict adherence to proper guidelines. This includes refrigeration to store antigens, monitoring laboratory temperatures and humidity, a light source, and sufficient electricity supply. There have been cautions regarding antigen susceptibility to sunlight, freezing, and thawing. Additionally, it is important to have properly trained personnel to interpret RPR results correctly.

Of note, automated RPR testing is also available and has been noted to be able to handle a larger sample size and requires less reader subjectivity.
