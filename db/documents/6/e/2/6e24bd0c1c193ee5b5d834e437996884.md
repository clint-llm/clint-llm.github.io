Histopathology depends on the underlying cause. For example, In protein-losing enteropathy caused by Crohn disease, we can see granulomas and acute and chronic inflammation of the colonic wall. Crypt abscesses, crypt branching, increased lamina propria cellularity, basal plasmacytosis, basal lymphoid aggregates are present in ulcerative colitis. Various other mucosal abnormalities can be seen depending upon the etiology.
