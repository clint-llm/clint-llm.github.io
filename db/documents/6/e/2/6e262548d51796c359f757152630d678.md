The relationship between obesity and hypertension is well established in adults and children, but the mechanism by which obesity causes hypertension is not yet clearly understood.

This build-up of fat creates a plaque that grows bigger until it causes critical obstruction of the arterial lumen leading to downstream local disturbances in the organs it supplies, eventually increasing morbidity and even sudden death rates.

High dietary fat and carbohydrate also directly stimulate peripheral alpha-1 and beta-adrenergic receptors, resulting in hypertension.  In addition, blockade of both alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors causes a more prominent decrease in blood pressure in obese hypertensive patients than non-obese hypertensive patients. However, increased heart rate results from decreased parasympathetic activity.

Obesity affects all major body organs such as the heart, liver, kidney, lungs, colon, skin, blood vessels, and brain. The kidney appears to be the most affected by obesity, and dietary fat restriction significantly reverses renal damage. At first, obesity causes renal vasodilatation and glomerular hyperfiltration, maintaining sodium balance despite higher tubular sodium reabsorption. The increased tubular reabsorption combined with raised blood pressure in arteries, metabolic abnormalities, inflammatory causes, oxidative stress, and lipotoxicity contributes to exacerbating renal damage by following a vicious cycle. The most directly dependent on body weight appears to be renal injury, and dietary fat restriction significantly reverses renal damage. At first, obesity causes renal vasodilatation and glomerular hyperfiltration, which functions to maintain sodium balance despite higher tubular sodium reabsorption. The increased tubular reabsorption combined with raised blood pressure in arteries, metabolic abnormalities, inflammatory causes, oxidative stress, and lipotoxicity contributes to the exacerbation of renal damage by following a vicious cycle.

Clinically, this damage is evident as proteinuria, followed by a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate several years later. Adipose tissue, particularly abdominal fat, is also linked with generalized effects on various body systems through the secretion of hormones and cytokines, causing a type of glomerular damage called obese-associated glomerulopathy.

Abdominal fat serves to be a prime component among the characteristic features of metabolic syndrome. It is expected that the incidence of metabolic syndrome will increase up to 53% in 2035. Other factors leading to metabolic syndrome include nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated (PPAR) modulation, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, high blood pressure, and certain proinflammatory states. Higher body fat mass also results in increased adipocyte size of subcutaneous and omentum fat. Hyperplasia occurs predominantly in subcutaneous fats, whereas hypertrophy is found in both mental and subcutaneous fat tissue. Eventually, fat accumulation progressively increased in the subcutaneous compartment as compared to visceral fat tissue. WC and BMI are significant indicators of visceral adiposity in adults and strongly predict the presence of hepatic steatosis.
