Kyrle disease typically presents as hyperkeratotic papules and nodules with a central keratotic plug. Skin lesions occur most commonly on the lower extremities, especially the calf, tibial region, and posterior aspect. It may also affect the arms and head and neck regions. Rarely, there is the involvement of the palms and soles.
