In the 2008 MRC CRASH study of 10,000 TBI patients with GCS <15, 1 in 5 patients were deceased at 2 weeks, 1 in 4 were deceased at 6 months, and 1 in 3 were deceased or severely disabled at 6 months. Clinical predictors of poor outcome include advanced age, initial post-resuscitation GCS, hypotension, hypoxia, pupil abnormalities, elevations in ICP, and co-morbid diseases. Radiological predictors of bad outcome include obliteration of the 3rd ventricle and/or basal cisterns, midline shift, petechial hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and brainstem injury. The two main tools used to predict outcome in TBI are the CRASH and IMPACT Head Injury Prognosis Calculators. The IMPACT prognosis calculator predicts a 6-month outcome in adult patients with moderate to severe TBI. The CRASH prognosis calculator predicts death at 14 days and death and severe disability at 6 months in adult patients with GCS 14 or less. Use caution when applying these results to individual patients since the outcomes apply at a population level.

Special mention should be made of outcomes in mild traumatic brain injury, often called “concussion.” Adults and children less than 8 years old tend to recover quickly, with 85% to 90% recovering within 14 days. In adolescents and teenage males, recovery typically takes about 4 weeks, while teenage females may take longer than 4 weeks to recover. In contrast to older dogma, newer evidence has shown that early exercise leads to a quicker recovery.
