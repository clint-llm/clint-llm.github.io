A careful diagnostic evaluation of patients clinically suspected to have CSF leak is crucial, with the awareness of CSF components and imaging abnormalities.

Evaluating a suspected leak should include testing rhinorrhea or otorrhea for beta-2 transferrin, a compound found only in CSF and perilymph, making it a highly specific and sensitive test.

Traumatic rhinorrhea has been classified according to the latency of occurrence, and different evaluation and treatment methods can be applied accordingly.  In the acute/early onset type, the patient presents with a CSF leak within the first two days of trauma, the delayed type presents at least one week after trauma, and the late onset/occult type presents within three months after trauma. According to several authors, 50% start in the first 2 or 3 days, 70% start within the first week, and almost all traumatic CSF leaks occur within three months of trauma.

High-resolution CT (HRCT) of paranasal sinuses and temporal bone is typically sufficient for identifying single osseous defects. If multiple defects are suspected on HRCT, CT cisternography is useful to localize the lesions further. If initial CT is suspicious for meningoencephalocele, magnetic resonance (MR) cisternography is highly sensitive to soft tissue findings. If the leak is intermittent but active, HRCT is still the first-line imaging test of choice. If the suspected leak is inactive at the time of imaging, consider contrast-enhanced MR cisternography or radionucleotide cisternography.

The cause of spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea may be attributed to idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH); therefore, imaging evaluation and fundoscopy are highly recommended. In cases of spontaneous CSF leak with intracranial hypotension, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain may show intracranial pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement with contrast, subdural fluid collections, and downward displacement of the brain. MRI of the spine can also show dural collapse and may demonstrate CSF leakage from spinal dural defects.

In a recent study, MRI findings of intracranial hypotension were present in 79% of patients with spontaneous CSF leaks. These findings have an overall sensitivity of 85.7%. With detailed analyses, enhancement of the pachymeninges showed the highest sensitivity of 78.6%, followed by subdural fluid accumulation and sagging brain, 21.4%, and subsequently by engorgement of venous structures and pituitary hyperemia, both 14.3%.
