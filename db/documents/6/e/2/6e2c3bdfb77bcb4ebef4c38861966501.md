# Introduction

A basic understanding of statistical concepts is necessary to effectively evaluate existing literature. Statistical results do not, however, allow one to determine the clinical applicability of published findings. Statistical results can be used to make inferences about the probability of an event among a given population. Careful interpretation by the clinician is required to determine the value of the data as it applies to an individual patient or group of patients.

Good research studies will provide a clear, testable hypothesis, or prediction, about what they expect to find in the relationships being tested.

Statistics are used to test a study’s alternative or experimental hypothesis. Statistical models are fitted based on the nature, type, and other characteristics of the dataset. Data typically involves levels of measurement, and these determine the type of statistical models that can be applied to test a hypothesis.

It is up to the researcher to appropriately apply statistical models when testing hypotheses. Several approaches can be used to analyze the same dataset, and how this is accomplished depends heavily on the nature of the wording in a researcher’s hypothesis.

It is strongly recommended that unfamiliar users consult with a statistical analyst when designing and running statistical models. Biostatistician consultations can occur at any time during a study, but earlier consultations are wise to prevent the introduction of accidental bias into study data and to help ensure accuracy and collection methods that will be adequate to allow for tests of hypotheses.

# Issues of Concern

**Statistical Significance**

If the probability of obtaining a test statistic value by chance (p-value) is less than .05, then the experimental hypothesis is accepted as true. Another way of to think about p-values is the probability that the null hypothesis is true, which for a cutoff of p is less than .05 would mean there is a less than 5% chance that the difference observed is not a true difference.

# Clinical Significance

To evaluate the clinical relevance or importance of a significant result, one must be certain to consider the size of the effect.

- Conducting a review of the literature and examining reported results,

- Conducting pilot studies to get an indication of effects that might be seen in larger studies,

- Making educated guesses based on what is clinically or practically meaningful and informed by experience

- Using conventional recommendations for effect size measures

One common measure of effect is the correlation coefficient, r. In general, small effects, or r=.10, indicate that the effect explains 1% of the total variance. Likewise, r=.30 is considered a medium effect, and r=.50 is considered large, explaining 25% of the variance and holding greater clinical relevance. The square of a correlational r-value indicates the proportion of variance explained by the relationship tested. Similarly, confidence intervals offer a way to determine the clinical strength or magnitude of observed effects.

It is also important to note that although a study may be designed and statistically tested in a way that suggests inference and causation could be concluded (e.g., longitudinal observations of change over time), only studies that employ a randomized and/or controlled design will permit causative declarations to be made from their results.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Statistical analysis is essential for any clinical research. Of greater importance is to understand the clinical significance of reported results and to determine whether those results can be extrapolated to the general population. Understanding the definitions and methods described above should help in better understanding and usability for medical professionals and students.
