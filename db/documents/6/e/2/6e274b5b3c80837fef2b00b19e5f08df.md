Vagal maneuvers are techniques used to increase vagal parasympathetic tone in an attempt to diagnose and treat various arrhythmias. They are often utilized first in an effort to abort episodes of stable supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or differentiate SVT from ventricular tachycardias (VT). Common vagal maneuvers include carotid sinus massage (CSM), Valsalva maneuver (VM), and diving reflex. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and techniques for administering vagal maneuvers.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for using vagal maneuvers.
- Review the anatomy of the relevant structures involved in vagal maneuvers and why they are effective.
- Describe the proper techniques of the carotid sinus massage, Valsalva maneuver, modified Valsalva, and diving reflex.
- Outline the importance of coordination among the interprofessional team and when care should be escalated to involve more caregivers/providers.
