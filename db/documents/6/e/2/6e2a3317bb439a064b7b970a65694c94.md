The lumbosacral trunk is a collection of neural fibers that interconnect the lumbar and sacral plexus. The lumbosacralÂ trunk consists of the entire anterior segment of the fourth and fifth lumbar nerves. These nerve fibers run on the medial side of the psoas major muscle and run inferiorly over the pelvic brim to join the first sacral nerve. The lumbosacral trunk gives rise to the following nerves:

- Sciatic nerve

- Superior gluteal nerve

- Inferior gluteal nerve

- The nerve to internal obturator and superior gemellus muscles

- The nerve to quadratus femoris and inferior gemellus muscles
