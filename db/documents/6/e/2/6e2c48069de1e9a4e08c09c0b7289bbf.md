Abdominal cavity infections commonly arise following the inflammation or disruption of the gastrointestinal tract. Less frequently, they might originate from the gynecologic or urinary tract. Abdominal infections are typically polymicrobial and result in either an intra-abdominal abscess and phlegmon in more localized cases or secondary peritonitis in more diffuse conditions.

An abdominal abscess is a collection of cellular debris, enzymes, and liquefied remains from an infection or non-infectious source. An intra-abdominal abscess usually signals that something serious is happening to the patient. In many cases, the omentum, viscera, or mesentery may wall off an intraabdominal abscess. An abdominal abscess is quiteÂ common and is a serious condition. To avoid high morbidity and mortality, the condition must be promptly diagnosed and treated. In general, sepsis that occurs after perforation in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract or leak is often associated with less morbidity and mortality compared to leaks that result from a colonic perforation or injury.
