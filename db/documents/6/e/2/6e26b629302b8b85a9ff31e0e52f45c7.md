The deletion or malformation of specific proteins secondary to inherited or de-novo mutations results in abnormal protein structure or function and thereby causing muscle weakness. The common forms of congenital muscular dystrophies result from alterations in plasma membrane surface proteins or those forming a part of the membrane-extracellular matrix interface.

The major categories of congenital muscular dystrophies based on the proteins affected are

- Collagen type VI related – Ulrich (severe variant) and Bethlehem (milder) myopathy

- Merosin related – this includes patients with a mutation in laminin alpha 2 protein which is merosin deficient

- Alpha dystroglycan related – including walker Warburg, muscle eye brain and Fukuyama myopathy (Fukutin gene at 9q31-33)

The correlation between genotype and phenotype depends on the affected protein being completely deficient or partially deficient, which is determined by the type of mutation in the gene.
