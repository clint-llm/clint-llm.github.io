Subacute combined degeneration is an acquired condition that is caused by vitamin B12 deficiency. The absorption of vitamin B12 is a multistep process; any abnormality in the steps of absorption can lead to a deficiency. The causes of vitamin B12 deficiency include the following:

**1. Nutritional Deficiency**

Cobalamin is a water-soluble vitamin. Although it can be stored in large amounts, vitamin B12 cannot be synthesized by the human body and requires supplementation from dietary sources. Therefore, vitamin B12 deficiency can develop if dietary intake is low and body stores are depleted. Cobalamin is mainly present in food derived from animals such as meat, fish, dairy products, eggs, and fortified cereals. The richest sources of vitamin B12 are clams and animal liver, the latter of which has historically been used to treat vitamin B12 deficiency. Plant-based food does not contain cobalamin. Therefore, strict vegetarians and vegans are at risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency. Individuals who follow strict vegan diets are especially prone to developing deficiency when there is increased demand for vitamin B12, such as during pregnancy or lactation. Breastfed infants whose mothers have B12 deficiency can also develop a deficiency unless they receive supplementation.

**2. Gastric Abnormalities**

- **Gastric surgery/Gastritis:**Vitamin B12 in food exists in a protein-bound form. The entry of food into the stomach stimulates gastric acid production, which leads to the dissociation of vitamin B12 from these proteins. The release of vitamin B12 from its protein-bound form is necessary for it to bind with the intrinsic factor and its eventual absorption. Loss of parietal cells of the stomach due to gastric surgery or gastritis leads to a decline in the production of gastric acid and intrinsic factors, which can result in vitamin B12 deficiency.

- **Autoimmune gastritis/Pernicious anemia:**Autoimmune gastritis, previously known as pernicious anemia, is the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency. It occurs as a result of autoimmune-mediated destruction of the parietal cells, chronic inflammation, and atrophy of the mucosa of the corpus and fundus of the stomach. Normally, the intrinsic factor, which is produced by the parietal cells, binds to vitamin B12 and facilitates its transport to the ileum, where it can be absorbed. Destruction of the parietal cells and subsequent intrinsic factor deficiency leads to reduced uptake of vitamin B12.

**3. Small Bowel Disease**

Many diseases that affect the small intestine can lead to the malabsorption of vitamin B12. These include inflammatory bowel disease, sprue, radiation enteritis, lymphoma, and amyloidosis. Celiac disease can lead to vitamin B12 deficiency if there is non-adherence to a gluten-free diet. Ileal resection can result in a deficiency by reducing the absorptive surface area. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, seen in intestinal motility disorders, anatomic abnormalities (blind loop, diverticulitis), and chronic pancreatitis, increases the utilization of vitamin B12-intrinsic factor and can lead to a deficiency.

**4. Pancreatic Disease**

Pancreatic enzymes are required to cleave vitamin B12 from salivary proteins (haptocorrins) and transfer it to the intrinsic factor. This step is interrupted in patients with pancreatic insufficiency or chronic pancreatitis and can lead to reduced absorption of vitamin B12.

**5. Drug-induced**

Several medications, such as gastric acid suppressants, metformin, and nitrous oxide, can result in vitamin B12 deficiency.

- **Gastric acid suppressants:**Patients receiving histamine H2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors in high doses or for longer than two years are at risk of developing cobalamin deficiency. The underlying mechanism involves the suppression of gastric acid production, which prevents vitamin B12 from dissociating from its protein-bound form. This reduces the amount of vitamin B12 available for binding to the intrinsic factor and leads to its reduced absorption.

- **Metformin:**Metformin, a common anti-diabetic medication, can cause B12 deficiency in approximately 10-30 % of patients receiving it. The mechanism involves interference with calcium-dependent ileal absorption of the B12-intrinsic factor complex. The effect of metformin on B12 absorption is reversible with calcium supplementation.

- **Nitrous oxide:**Subacute combined degeneration has been observed in patients who use nitrous oxide recreationally or are exposed to it as an anesthetic agent. The mechanism involves nitrous oxide-induced inactivation of vitamin B12 and inhibition of methionine synthetase, disrupting methylation and DNA synthesis and leading to injury of the neuronal axons. Patients with a pre-existing B12 deficiency are particularly prone to developing acute life-threatening neurological symptoms on exposure to nitrous oxide, which can be fatal.

**6. Fish tapeworm infestation**

Ingestion of raw freshwater fish can lead to infestation with Dibothriocephalus latus, which competes with the host for vitamin B12 absorption and can result in a deficiency.

**7. Genetic abnormalities**

Vitamin B12 deficiency can occur in neonates with genetic abnormalities such as transcobalamin deficiency and Imerslund Grasbeck syndrome.
