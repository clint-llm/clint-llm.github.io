The presentation of a patient with cystic kidney disease varies with the underlyingÂ disease etiology. Physical examination is usually only pertinent to inherited renal disease, presenting as a palpable mass in a neonate or child. Patients with ADPKD commonly present with flank pain, renal failure, hypertension, or palpable masses. Acquired cystic kidney disease rarely becomes large enough to become palpable on physical examination. Renal cysts are often found incidentally during an ultrasound or cross-sectional imaging for other causes. Taking a thorough family history is key to elucidating possible genetic factors in a patient with renal cysts.
