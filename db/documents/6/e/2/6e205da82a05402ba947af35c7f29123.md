Bagassosis is an airborne disease caused by inhalation of the fibrous cane-sugar residue, bagasse.

Although bagassosis is caused by the inhalation of bagasse, the specific etiological mechanism responsible for causing the disease is considered multifactorial. Historically, the disease has been attributed to irritant properties of the bagasse itself, microorganisms present in the dust, its silica content, an allergic reaction, and a combination of these factors. It most commonly occurs in those frequently in contact with this material, e.g., sugar factory workers. A study showed that 11 out of 21 bagasse-shredding workers developed the disease over 15 months.

Aerobacter cloacae is a microorganism that has been seen as a possible causative organism in the etiology of bagassosis.T. sacchari and T. vulgaris) are the causative agents found in bagasse responsible for triggering a pathological response.
