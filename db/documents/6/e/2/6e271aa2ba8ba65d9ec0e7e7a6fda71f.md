Essential tremor is the most common neurologic disorder that affects postural or action tremors. The worldwide estimated prevalence is up to 5% of the population. Family history can be found in near 50% of cases and in 90% concordance in monozygotic twins. The incidence of essential tremorÂ increases with age, although it often affects young individuals, especially when it is familial.
