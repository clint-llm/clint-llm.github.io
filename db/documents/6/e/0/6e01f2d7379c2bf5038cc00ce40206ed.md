FGLP is a significantly superior procedure to blind LP. It is associated with reduced postlumbar puncture headache (Level 1).

FGLP is a commonly performed procedure in radiology departments either for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. We generally recommendÂ that the clinical team try at least one attempt using the nonimage-guided bedside LP; however, this will negatively impact the radiology department.

The interprofessional clinical team requesting FGLP should understand this implication and comprehend that the clinicians might lose the skill of blind LP in the future. Clinicians should be aware of the contraindications and complications of the FGLP. It is important to note that FGLP is not immune to the complications of blind LP; however, they occur less frequently. Experienced nursing staff can assist the clinicians during the procedure and perform patient monitoring. Interprofessional coordination and communication will yield the best results from these diagnostic tests. [Level 5]
