Thiazides****and loop diuretics can cause hypokalemia, while potassium-sparing diuretics cause hyperkalemia.

Hyperkalemia is common in ACE inhibitor and ARB treatment, and special caution is required when combining these agents with potassium-sparing diuretics. Potassium levels should be closely monitored in patients with chronic kidney disease when ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or potassium-sparing diuretics are used.

Monitoring for hypotension and edema is necessary for patients on dihydropyridine CCBs. Non-dihydropyridine CCBs and beta-blockers are known to cause bradycardia, and heart rate requires monitoring, especially if these two medications are combined. QTc interval needs monitoring in patients on sotalol.

Monitoring for tachyarrhythmias and orthostatic hypotension is a recommendation in patients on alpha-blockers.

Complete blood count and ANA levels are advisable for monitoring when the patient is on hydralazine treatment.
