Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease that results in the formation of granulomas which classically are non-caseating granulomas, that may be found throughout lymph nodes and organs, including the brain and nervous system. About 5 to 10 percent of patients with sarcoidosis will have neurologic complications. Neurosarcoidosis may be asymptomatic but can be life-threatening and tends to occur in cases with systemic involvement. This activity examines when this condition should be considered on differential diagnosis and how to properly evaluate for it. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the common presenting features of neurosarcoidosis. 
- Review how to properly evaluate for neurosarcoidosis.
- Outline the management of neurosarcoidosis. 
- Explain how an interprofessional approach is imperative to the effective management of patients with neurosarcoidosis.
