Eosinophilic gastroenteritis belongs to the group of eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders, which comprise eosinophilic esophagitis and eosinophilic colitis. It predominantly affects females. The presentation is variable, based on age, anatomy (involvement of region of the GI tract), and histology (infiltration of eosinophil in different layers of the gastrointestinal tract). A detailed history, along with a physical examination, is essential, as differential diagnosis is broad. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a rare condition that can present with a variety of signs and symptoms. Corticosteroids are the primary medication therapy for eosinophilic gastroenteritis. This activity presents the pathophysiology of eosinophilic gastroenteritis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.
