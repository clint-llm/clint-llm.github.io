Indications for vascular ultrasound are numerous.

Venous ultrasound can help evaluate venous thrombosis, hemodialysis graft patency, venous malformations, and chronic venous disease.

Vascular ultrasound may help evaluate a patient before and after interventional procedures. Some commonly evaluated procedures include transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), angioplasty, venoplasty, and stent placement.

The evaluation of the lymph nodes can be performed for various indications to include palpable lymphadenopathy, concern for metastatic disease (such as in the setting of breast cancer), evaluation of infection (such as in the setting of tuberculosis), as well as in the setting of biopsy planning in patients with known systemic disease.
