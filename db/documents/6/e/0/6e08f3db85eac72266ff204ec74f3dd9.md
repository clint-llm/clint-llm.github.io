Patients with medullary sponge kidney usually are asymptomatic. In symptomatic patients, hematuria, renal colic, fever, and dysuria are the most common presenting symptoms. Gross hematuria has been reported in about 10% to 20% of patients. Complications such as nephrolithiasis, renal calculi, and urinary tract infections may be seen. Patients are prone to renal calculi because of urinary stasis, hypercalciuria, increased risk of UTIs and distal renal tubular acidosis.

Some patients will describe chronic renal pain without any obvious infection, obstruction, hydronephrosis or stones.  The etiology of this pain is unclear but could be due to collecting tubule ductal obstructions from mineral plugs.

The diagnosis often is made by radiologic studies such as renal ultrasound and CT urogram and, occasionally, plain abdominal films involving the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB).

It has been estimated that 12% to 20% of all recurrent calcium stone formers may have medullary sponge kidney.  In women and younger patients (younger than 20 years), the estimated incidence is even higher at 20% to 30%.

Hemihypertrophy is noted in about 25% of cases of medullary sponge kidney. Conversely, 10% of patients with hemihypertrophy have medullary sponge kidney.
