Romosozumab is administered as a once-a-month subcutaneous injection for 12 months. The recommended monthly dose is 210 mg, regardless of body weight.

After 12 months of monthly injections, romosozumab should be discontinued as its effects wane. Studies have shown that after one year of discontinuing romosozumab, BMD levels return to baseline; therefore, it is recommended that after discontinuing romosozumab, the patient continues osteoporosis treatment with antiresorptive therapy to maintain and continue increased bone mass density.

Romosozumab should be stored at 36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit.

If a missed or delayed dose occurs, romosozumab should be administered as soon as possible, with subsequent injections to be administered monthly from the new date.

**Pharmacokinetics**

A single dose of romosozumab (210 mg) has a maximum average serum concentration of 22.2 (5.8) mcg/mL, with a steady concentration state being achieved three months after monthly administration in postmenopausal women.

Absorption occurs on average within five days with an estimated volume distribution of 3.92 L at a steady state.
