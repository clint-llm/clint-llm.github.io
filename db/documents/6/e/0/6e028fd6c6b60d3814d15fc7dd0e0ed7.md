Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a heterogeneous group of conditions that include chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension.

Preeclampsia is a multiorgan disease process characterized by new-onset elevated blood pressure and proteinuria or one of its severe features after 20 weeks' gestation.

Onset is by definition after 20 weeks and although delivery usually resolves the condition, symptoms can present as late as 4-6 weeks postpartum.

Patients who meet the criteria for preeclampsia are at an increased risk of cerebral edema, stroke, pulmonary edema, disseminated intravascular coagulation, liver failure, and renal failure. Fetal risks include intrauterine demise, neonatal demise, placental abruption, prematurity, ischemic encephalopathy, and intrauterine growth restriction.
