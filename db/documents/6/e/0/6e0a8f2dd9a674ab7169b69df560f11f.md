Glanders is an uncommon zoonotic disease that is transmitted to humans from solipeds such as horses, mules, and donkeys. It has been eradicated in many parts of the world. Transmission is uncommon even in the setting of frequent close contact with infected animals. However, occupational exposure is a key risk factor. Melioidosis is endemic in Southeast Asia, China, and northern Australia. There have also been cases in India as well as the Middle East, Africa, and Central and South America. It is found in soil and water, and it is known to cause disease in animals such as cats, goats, sheep, and horses. A history of contact with soil and surface water is almost always present in humans with melioidosis. Contaminated groundwater, flooding, and typhoons have been implicated in outbreaks of melioidosis. Epidemiological surveillance is vital to detect any outbreak or local emergence in humans or animals. Expert evidence indicates that glanders and melioidosis are best managed by an interprofessional team of health care workers that includes an epidemiologist, an infectious disease consultant, internists, a pharmacist, and a nurse.

Since glanders and melioidosis can present with the involvement of almost any organ system, high suspicion should be maintained in those with identified risk factors. The medical laboratory is essential to help make the diagnosis of the disease. In the setting of a large outbreak in people without risk factors, a biological attack should be considered, and public health and law enforcement officials should be notified. Once the infection is treated, the pharmacist should ensure that the patient remains compliant with drug therapy. In addition, if there is any evidence of recurrence, the patient should be referred to an internist for evaluation; rates of recurrence of melioidosis may be as high as 20% but can be reduced with appropriate therapy.
