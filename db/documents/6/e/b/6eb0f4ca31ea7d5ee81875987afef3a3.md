As with all biological medications, appropriate screening for severe infection must be carried out before beginning a drug such as ustekinumab; this includes screening for infections such as tuberculosis, HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C and treatment if identified.Â Providers must exercise caution in recommending treatment for elderly patients, patients with a history of malignancy, or a predisposition to infection.

Ustekinumab can be used during pregnancy. Based on limited human data, there is no expected risk of fetal harm, and teratogenicity has not been demonstrated in animal studies at up to 100 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). The drug may also be used during breastfeeding; no human data is currently available, but there is no expectation of infant harm based on the drug's properties. No human data exist regarding ustekinumab's effect on milk production.
