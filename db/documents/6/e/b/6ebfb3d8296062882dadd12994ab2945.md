Brachioplasty is an operation performed to improve the contour of the upper arm and axilla. It refers to skin and limited subcutaneous fat resection of the upper arm. Brachioplasty entails the excision of excess skin and lipodystrophy of the upper arm, which can extend onto the lateral chest wall. It is most commonly performed in patients following massive weight loss, although other indications include following pregnancy and aging. This activity reviews the assessment and management of the patient presenting for brachioplasty and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients who wish to undergo brachioplasty, as well as mentioning key alternatives.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the anatomy of the upper arm with relevance to brachioplasty.
- Summarize at least one classification for assessment of patients presenting with excess adipose tissue and skin in the upper arm.
- Identify the high-risk patient at risk of increased postoperative complications, and consider non-invasive alternatives to brachioplasty.
- Discuss the common and uncommon complications of brachioplasty.
