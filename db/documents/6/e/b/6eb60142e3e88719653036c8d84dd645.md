Many disease processes are amenable to anatomic segmental resection: malignant, metastatic, and nonmalignant.

Malignant - Segmental resection is appropriate in select patients with non-small cell lung cancer defined by NCCN:

- Poor pulmonary reserve or other contraindication for lobectomy

- Peripheral nodule with equal or less than 2cm size with pure adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) histology, greater than 50% ground-glass appearance on CT, or long doubling time confirmed on radiologic surveillance. Segmentectomy should achieve parenchymal margins of equal or greater than 2cm and sample appropriate N1 and N2 lymph node stations.

- Metastatic - Resection of pulmonary metastases has been shown to improve survival in colon cancer. This may involve resection of isolated lesions or multiple lesions to minimize loss of pulmonary reserve.

- Nonmalignant - Segmentectomy has been documented in congenital malformations (bronchial atresia, bronchiectasis, pulmonary arteriovenous malformation, and pulmonary sequestration), infectious processes (aspergilloma and nontuberculous mycobacterium), and other pulmonary pathology (bronchiectasis and inflammatory pseudotumors).
