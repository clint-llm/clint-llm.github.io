As stated above, the zygoma comprises a significant portion of the inferior and lateral orbital walls; thus, any fracture of theÂ zygoma warrants investigation into fractures or injury of the orbit. Also, cervical spine injury must be ruled out, as well as other concomitant facial fractures, including frontal sinus, nasal, midface (e.g., Lefort, NOE), and mandible fractures. Septal hematoma should be ruled out as well to avoid septal necrosis and resultant saddle nose deformity. Lastly, malocclusion requires attention, as well.
