The CNS effects secondary to oxygen toxicity is known as the Bert effect. This can occur with hyperbaric oxygen therapy in a dose-dependent corelation

The phenomenon of pulmonary toxicity is commonly referred to as the Smith effect.  This can occur after prolonged exposure to oxygen >0.5 ATA.  The incidence of displaying pulmonary symptoms with oxygen toxicity is 5%.  Preterm newborns are at distinct risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retrolental fibroplasia with prolonged exposure to high concentrations of oxygen.

Some chemicals such as the chemotherapeutic agent bleomycin also increase the risk of oxygen toxicity
