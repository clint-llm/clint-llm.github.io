The signs and symptoms of aseptic meningitis are often vague and nonspecific; therefore, the differential is quite broad. The headache and fever, being some of the most common symptoms, drive the differential.

Bacterial meningitis is the most concerning and common alternative cause and should be the default diagnosis until ruled out. Intracranial hemorrhage, especially subarachnoid hemorrhage, should be considered in patients with the appropriate clinical presentation. Neoplastic disorders (leukemia, tumors of the brain), other types of headaches (migraine), inflammation of brain structures (brain abscess, epidural abscess) should also be considered.

Fever from almost any source can present with headache and neck stiffness as associated symptoms. Urinary tract infections and pneumonia can present with headaches, body aches, and fever. Thus, an exhaustive search for infectious sources is part of every workup.

Many of the causes of aseptic meningitis may give most or all of the symptoms but have no meningeal involvement. Viral syndromes, in particular, often give headaches, muscle aches, weakness, and fever.

The broader differential includes anemia, which classically causes headaches and weakness. In addition, the list includes carbon monoxide exposure, child abuse, tick-borne illness, and TB, which demonstrates the breadth of possibilities.
