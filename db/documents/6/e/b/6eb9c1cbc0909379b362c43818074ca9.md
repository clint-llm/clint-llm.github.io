The main symptom of ulcerative colitis is bloody diarrhea, with or without mucus. Associated symptoms also include urgency or tenesmus, abdominal pain, malaise, weight loss, and fever, depending on the extent and severity of the disease. The onset of the disease is typically gradual, and patients will likely experience periods of spontaneous remission and subsequent relapses. Factors that typically exacerbate ulcerative colitis include smoking cessation and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use.

There are some extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) that are also present in 10% to 30% of patients with ulcerative colitis. Extraintestinal manifestations associated with disease activity include episcleritis, scleritis, and uveitis, peripheral arthropathies, erythema nodosum, and pyoderma gangrenosum. Extraintestinal manifestations independent of colitis activity include axial arthropathies, sacroiliitis, and ankylosing spondylitis. A significant hepatic extraintestinal manifestation of ulcerative colitis includes primary sclerosing cholangitis and is associated with a greater risk of colorectal cancer.
