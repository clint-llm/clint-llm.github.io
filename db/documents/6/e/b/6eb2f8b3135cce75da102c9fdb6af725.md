Complete dilation of the cervix is achieved when the cervix dilates to 10 cm. How rapidly a female will progress to full dilation is dependent on several factors, including her parity, medical history, pelvic anatomy, the size of the fetus, and the position of the fetus at the time of labor.

The stages of labor and their associated cervical dilations are as follows:

- Stage 1: Effacement and dilation of the cervix from 0 to 10 cm

- Latent phase: 0-6 cm
- Active phase: 6-10 cm

- Stage 2: Delivery of the fetus

- Stage 3: Expulsion of the placenta

The latent phase should not exceed 20 hours in a primigravida female or 14 hours in a multigravida female. If the mother does not fully dilate by these average time estimates, she is said to be having an arrest of the active phase of Stage 1 labor.
