The key to an early accurate diagnosis in infants presenting with a salt-wasting crisis is to obtain a blood sample before therapy is begun. This is termed the 'critical sample,' and tests done on this specimen will avoid confounders from therapy. One aliquot is sent for analysis of serum electrolytes, aldosterone, 17 hydroxyprogesterone, and plasma renin activity or concentration. This will serve as the initial panel and will guide further testing.

A second aliquot is saved for confirmatory tests, which could include serum cortisol and ACTH in CAH, and 18 OHC and urine THA which are elevated and decreased respectively in type 1 as opposed to the type 2 ALD synthase deficiency. In infants with ALD synthase deficiency but normal aldosterone concentrations, a PAC/PRC ratio is useful to clarify the diagnosis of primary hypoaldosteronism.

In some infants with very high ALD levels as part of PHA may exhibit a phenomenon called the 'hook effect' inherent in certain assay methods. In these infants, the initial ALD profiling may be reported as low, misleading the clinician to diagnose ALD synthase deficiency, but a repeat assay with serial sample dilutions will reveal very high ALD levels confirming PHA.

Biochemistry:

Serum electrolytes

Serum and urine aldosterone

Serum cortisol and plasma ACTH

Serum 17 hydroxyprogesterone (17 OHP)

18 hydroxycorticosterone (18OHC) (low to normal in type 1 and high in type 2 ALD synthase deficiency

Urinary tetrahydro-aldosterone (THA), the metabolite of ALD (decreased in type 1 and low normal or normal in type 2 ALD synthase deficiency)

Plasma renin activity(PRA) or plasma renin concentration (PRC) if available

PAC/PRC ratio

PAC/K+ ratio( in CKD, less than 10 ng/dl is suggestive of HA and greater than 10 ng/dl is suggestive of renal aldosterone resistance)

Serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
