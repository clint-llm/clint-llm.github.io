Because the tentorium cerebelli is attached to the edges of the superior petrosal sinus, during surgical procedures, the superior petrosal sinus is useful as a landmark. The tentorium cerebelli is also used to classify the location of tumors. Herniation of the brain through the tentorium cerebelliÂ may require surgical intervention.

The drainage pattern of the superior petrosal venous complex into the superior petrosal sinus can determine the surgical approach in neurosurgical procedures. For example, surgeons use the retrosigmoid suprameatal neurosurgical approach in type II and III cases. To better outcomes, before surgery, CT angiogram and magnetic resonance venogram can be used to visualize the junction of the superior petrosal venous complex and the superior petrosal sinus to determine the drainage pattern. The correct classification of superior petrosal venous complex drainage pattern and imaging can guide both the surgical approach and division of the superior petrosal sinus and the tentorium cerebelli.
