Variants of the rhomboid muscles are rare but present interesting cases when discovered. There have been three reported cases of an additional rhomboid muscle discovered in humans. The first, known as “occipito-scapularis,” is attached at the level of the occipital bone and passes inferior and across the splenius capitis. It coursed deep to the trapezius and inserted into the insertions of the rhomboid major and minor muscles at the level of the spine of the scapula. A second variant, “rhomboideus-occipitalis or capitis,” originated at the superior nuchal line deep to the trapezius. It then inserts between the inferior rhomboid minor and superior levator scapulae and into the serratus posterior. The third variant, also referred to as “rhomboideus capitis,” originated from the superior nuchal line and moved inferiorly on the splenius capitis. It follows the medial levator scapulae before inserting on the medial scapula opposite the scapular spine.
