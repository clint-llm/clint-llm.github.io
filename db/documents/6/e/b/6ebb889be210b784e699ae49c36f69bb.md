Evaluation should include a thorough patient history with a focused physical exam and laboratory workup with appropriate imaging. There are no specific laboratory tests for diagnosing Wernicke encephalopathy as it is a clinical diagnosis with the above mentioned classic signs and symptoms. However, a complete blood count and the comprehensive metabolic panel can be completed to exclude other causes of central nervous system abnormalities. Moreover, normal brain imaging cannot rule out Wernicke encephalopathy and therefore not very beneficial either. Caine et al. criteria were established in 1997 which is now 85% sensitive if patients have two or more of the classic features that include: ataxia, confusion, and ophthalmoplegia. Also, looking for risk factors helps in evaluating the patient as Wernicke encephalopathy were classically thought of as a disease exclusively due to alcoholism. However, in recent years Wernicke encephalopathy is also seen in patients that are chronically malnourished, post-bariatric surgery, hyperemesis gravidarum, liver disease, hyperthyroidism, and severe anorexia nervosa.
