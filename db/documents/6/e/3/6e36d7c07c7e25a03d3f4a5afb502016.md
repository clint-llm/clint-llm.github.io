Surgical repair of any injury is no small feat. In penile fractures, this remains true; not only is the urologist necessary, but the patient must also have a broad interprofessional team for a successful outcome. The emergency department, with its team of physicians, advanced practice providers, nurses, and ancillary staff, is often essential for the identification and diagnosis of penile fractures. Regarding the actual repair of the injury, the entirety of the operating room staff has a part to play in a patient's outcome. Postoperatively the patient will require surgical wound care instructions by urology nurses, close follow-up in the urologic offices with interaction, and care by office staff. Finally, the management of complications may include counseling by licensed therapists or psychologists for the facilitation of return to baseline sexual function. In no way is the successful management of a penile fracture possible without a cohesive and comprehensive interprofessional healthcare team who are all coordinated and collectively invested in the patient and their outcome.
