- Dental infections originate at the tooth or its supporting structures and can spread to the surrounding tissue.

- Dental infections most commonly occur when bacteria invade the pulp and spread to surrounding tissues. Infections can also affect the gums causing gingivitis, which can later cause periodontal disease.

- More serious complaints such as fever, facial edema, trismus, dysphagia, or dysphonia can be symptoms of a more serious dental infection that has spread into deep neck spaces.

- CT with contrast can help evaluate the extent and severity of fascial space infection.

- In most cases, drainage, along with the removal of the source of infection, are the most important steps in treating dental infections.

- Serious complications from dental infections are rare. They include osteomyelitis, Ludwig angina, retropharyngeal abscess, parapharyngeal abscess, necrotizing mediastinitis, cavernous sinus thrombosis, meningitis, and subdural empyema.
