Several health behaviors can have effects and increase lipid levels. Examples include tobacco use, physical inactivity, nutrition, and obesity. Specifically, nutrition risk factors include the insufficient consumption of fruits, nuts/seeds, vegetables, or high consumption of saturated fats.

Dyslipidemia can be due to familial disorders as well. Autosomal dominant mutations cause most cases of familial hypercholesterolemia in LDL receptors, which causes an elevation in LDL-C levels. Other mutations in the cholesterol pathway have been identified but are less common.
