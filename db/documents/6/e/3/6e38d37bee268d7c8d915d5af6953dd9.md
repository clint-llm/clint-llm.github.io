The following imaging diagnostics are appropriate in the setting of history and physical examination suggestive of brain tumors:

- **Computed tomogram (CT) head**: A good study should be done to evaluate acute intracranial findings such as hemorrhage, edema, and asymmetry in the brain tissue.

- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Brain**: This is a sensitive study to determine the characteristics of brain tumors. Low-grade tumors usually do not enhance while high-grade tumors have a different degree of enhancement. In addition, MRI is a great study to evaluate the degree of cerebral edema. An MRI study of the brain will facilitate the treatment plan and response to surgical, radiation, chemotherapy.

- **Chest X-Ray**: Patients newly diagnosed with a brain tumor need an appropriate metastaticÂ workup based on the patient's history and physical examination. For example, patients with an extensive history of tobacco use might require a chest x-ray. If there is any finding of a mass on the chest x-ray, it needs to be investigated using a CT scan of the body or positron emission tomography (PET) scan to identify the potential primary source for metastatic disease.
