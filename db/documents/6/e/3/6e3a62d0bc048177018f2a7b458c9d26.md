- There are no absoluteÂ contraindications to PET/CT; however, risks versus benefits should be considered in pregnant patients.

- Patient obesity may be a factor for scanner weight limits, require a higher dose of FDG, and reduce image quality and interpretation.

- Patients with diabetes will need blood sugar control to levels below 200 mg/dL to prevent glucose competition with FDG for cellular uptake.

- Patients with iodine allergy may require premedication for prophylaxis only if iodinated contrast is used for the CT portion.
