Diagnosis of dacryocystitis is primarily clinical based on history and physical exam findings. Cultures and gram staining can be obtained by expressing purulent material via the Crigler massage. In toxic appearing patients, particularly those with fever or acute visual changes, laboratory studies and blood cultures should be considered. Also, consider emergent ophthalmological consultation in these cases.  Strong consideration should be given to CT scan if orbital cellulitis or extensive infection is suspected. If there are anatomical concerns, a plain-film dacryocystogram (DCG) can be performed by qualified personnel. Subtraction DCG technique will potentially help improve the viewing quality of the image.

In chronic cases, appropriate serologic testing can be performed if systemic diseases are suspected as the underlying cause. Antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody testing can be performed if Wegener’s granulomatosis is suspected. Likewise, antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing can be pursued if systemic lupus erythematosus is suspected.
