The inner ear develops embryologically from ectodermal cells by week 4 of gestation. Invagination of these cells forms the otic vesicle, which contains a dorsal and a ventral pouch. The dorsal pouch forms the endolymphatic duct and vestibular structures, while the ventral pouch elongates to become the cochlea. The cochlea forms a two-and-a-half turn coil by week 10 of gestation and reaches a maximum labyrinth length by 18 weeks. The organ of Corti develops from the sensory neuroepithelium within the cochlear duct. SOX2 is an important transcription factor that plays a key role in cochlear development. Mutations in SOX2 have been shown to be associated with sensorineural hearing loss.
