On histologic examination of a patient with apocrine chromhidrosis, the apocrine glands appear normal in morphology and size; however, the number of glands varies. Within the cytoplasm of apocrine cells, an increased number of yellow-brown lipofuscin pigments will be evident using hematoxylin-eosin staining. The lipofuscin granules are positive with oil red O and periodic acidâ€“Schiff staining and fluoresce with nonstained paraffin-embedded sections with ultraviolet light at 360 nm.

Histology of eccrine chromhidrosis will appear normal, and fungi or bacteria may be present in the setting of pseudochromhidrosis.
