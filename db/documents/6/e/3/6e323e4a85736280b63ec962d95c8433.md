Proper guidance makes the patient more likely to report developing complications early and prevent severe morbidity. The nursing staff also assists the surgeon during the procedure and monitors the patient for immediate complications. It is essential for nurses practicing in the field of head and facial surgery to familiarize themselves with the possible complications of this procedure and to assess the neurologic status of patients undergoing TAB to identify adverse outcomes if they occur.
