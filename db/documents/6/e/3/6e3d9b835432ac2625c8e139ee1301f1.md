PVE is responsible for about 20% of endocarditis cases. It occurs in up to 6% of patients who have valve prosthesis.

Epidemiology of the aortic PVE is different if the valve replacement was done surgically ( surgical aortic valve replacement SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).

In SAVR, the rate of incidence of PVE is 6 per 1000 cases.

In TVAR, the incidence rate of PVE in the bioprosthetic valve is similar to the SARV PVE with a bioprosthetic valve.

Healthcare-associated infection is associated with late PVE and occurs due to nosocomial infection when patients are admitted due to other medical conditions or due to exposure in an outpatient facility exposure as in infusion centers, nursing homes, or during hemodialysis.
