Diagnosis of cardiomegaly is primarily through imaging techniques that assess the heart's size and function. Diagnostic testing includes one of the following:

- A chest X-ray with an enlarged cardiac silhouette and a cardiothoracic ratio of more than 50% suggests cardiomegaly.

- A transthoracic echocardiogram can be used to assess LV, RV, atrial size, and systolic/diastolic function. It can also determine valve structure and function and wall motion changes that suggest ischemia.

- Cardiac MRI is an emerging diagnostic modality for accurately evaluating LV and RV mass, size, and function. It can also characterize ischemic and non-ischemic causes such as myocarditis.

- An electrocardiogram (ECG) can reveal non-specific changes, including LV/RV hypertrophy, low voltage QRS in case of fibrosis/dilated cardiomyopathy, conduction abnormality, arrhythmia, premature ventricular complexes (PVCs), ST-T wave changes, and Q waves suggestive of prior myocardial infarction (MI).

- Serum levels of brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP), troponin I and T, renal function, and liver function tests are helpful in the setting of heart failure.

- Stress test and/or coronary angiogram to evaluate for coronary artery disease.

- Often the etiology of cardiomegaly is unclear despite standard workup. In such cases, additional testing may be pursued to determine the underlying etiology.
