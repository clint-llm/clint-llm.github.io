In describing pathophysiology, angioedema is classified as histamine-mediated angioedema and bradykinin-mediated angioedema

**Histamine-mediated angioedema**is the most common and is secondary to mast-cells and basophil activation.

**Bradykinin-mediated angioedema**(hereditary angioedema, acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema). Allergic reactions and hives do not trigger this condition. C1-inhibitor is a regulator of complement and the contact system; if deficient or dysfunctional it causes activation of the contact system resulting in uncontrolled production of kallikrein leading to proteolysis of high-molecular-weight kininogen and bradykinin, leading to edema by increasing in vascular permeability. Bradykinin-mediated angioedema is seen in:

- C1 inhibitor deficiency: Excessive production of bradykinin

- Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema: Decreased degradation of bradykinin

- Histamine and bradykinin increase localized microvascular permeability.

- NSAID induced: cyclooxygenase 1 inhibitor affects arachnoid acid metabolism, leukotriene/prostaglandin binding to the receptor or may be IgE mediated

**Genetics:**

Hereditary angioedema can be secondary to F12 gene, angiopoietin-1, and plasminogen or some unknown gene mutation.

C1 inhibitor is a serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN)
