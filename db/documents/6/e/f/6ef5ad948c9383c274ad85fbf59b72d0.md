Aneurysmal bone cysts are a rare osseous tumor, comprising 1% to 6% of primary osseous tumors. According to a retrospective study, the incidence of primary aneurysmal bone cysts was 0.14 per 10 people. The majority of patients diagnosed with an aneurysmal bone cyst (8 out of 10) are children and adolescents less than 20 years old. There is a slightly increased incidence rate seen in females (1 to 1.3).
