Piezogenic papules most often present asymptomatically, but they may become painful. History alone may not be helpful unless the papules are painful. Painful papules should prompt inquiry into repetitive use and occupational and sporting activities. Awareness of this condition can prove very helpful in a patient with elusive pain who may not have noticed the protrusions.

On exam, piezogenic pedal papules present with firm, yellowish to skin-colored papules that protrude from the lateral, posterior, or medial aspects of the heel. The papules become more prominent when the patient stands in a full weight-bearingÂ position and, by definition, resolve when the patient removes weight. Lesions typically occur bilaterally. Similar lesions have been noted on the ventral wrist; then, the pressure is applied to the palm of the hand. Many patients will develop both pedal and wrist lesions. Most recently, in addition to pedal and wrist papules, a case of muscle herniation of the lower legs that coexists with piezogenic pedal papules has also been reported.

Infantile pedal papules present in non-weight bearing infants as larger nodules on the medial aspect of the heel.
