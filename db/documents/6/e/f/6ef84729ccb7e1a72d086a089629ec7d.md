- Detailed clinical history to rule out infections, drug intake, etc.

- Hormonal evaluation to assess causes of hirsutism.

- Counsel the patient to manage expectations. It must be stressed that the procedure provides permanent hair reduction rather than removal.

- Evaluate skin and hair types to choose the right laser and parameters.

- Avoid hair epilation by plucking or waxing for 6 weeks before the procedure.

- Sunscreens may be prescribed 4 to 6 weeks before the procedure, especially on exposed areas.

- Pre-procedure photographs, with due consent, to maintain a record for evaluation of treatment response.

- Shave the area long enough before the procedure to allow a slight stubble to develop; this will provide enough of a target for the laser without absorbing too much energy in the hair shaft itself.

- Obtain an informed consent.

- If need be, a topical anesthetic cream may be applied one-half to one hour before the procedure.
