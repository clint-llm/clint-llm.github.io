During embryology, the arteries in the face, neck, and chest form from the aortic arches. The aortic arches will form around the same time as the formation brachial apparatus. The third aortic arch will develop into the common carotid artery. The common carotid artery will ascend laterally along the face, neck, and head. At the level of cervical vertebra four, the common carotid artery will bifurcate into the external carotid artery and internal carotid artery. The external carotid artery is responsible for perfusing the face and head. One of the branches that come off the external carotid artery is the posterior auricular artery. The external carotid artery branches into the posterior auricular artery at the level of the angle of the mandible. The posterior artery will then ascend towards the region posterior to the ear.
