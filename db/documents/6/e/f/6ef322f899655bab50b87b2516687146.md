Annular pancreas (AP) is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by partial or complete circumferential encasement of the second part of the duodenum by a band of pancreatic tissue during embryogenesis.

Based on the morphologic distribution of pancreatic tissue, AP has been classified into a complete or incomplete type. Complete type AP shows pancreatic parenchyma or annular duct completely encircling the second part of the duodenum confirmed by macroscopic inspection, and incomplete type AP demonstrates partial circumferential encasement of the duodenum by pancreatic tissue confirmed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or surgical evaluation.
