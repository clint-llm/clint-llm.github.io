Patients usually present between the ages of 11 and 18 years. Progression of the disease varies, but total disability or death usually occurs within 10 years and is due to complications of a central nervous system (CNS) degeneration and status epilepticus. Myoclonus is usually the reason for early disability and wheelchair dependency. Myoclonus becomes progressive, continuous, generalized, and difficult to control over time.

The main seizure types in Lafora disease include myoclonic seizures and occipital seizures. However, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, atypical absence seizures, atonic, and complex partial seizures may occur.

Myoclonus can be symmetric, asymmetric, partial, or generalized. It can occur at rest but usually disappears with sleep. It is exaggerated by action, photic stimulation, or emotional excitement.

Both losses of tone and myoclonus can occur. Trains of massive myoclonus with relative preservation of consciousness have also been reported.

Occipital seizures may present as transient blindness, simple or complex visual hallucinations, photo myoclonic, or convulsive photoresponses. They can also present as a migraine with scintillating scotomata.

The course of the disease is progressive and characterized by increasing frequency and intractability of seizures. Status epilepticus with any of the previously mentioned seizure types is common. Cognitive decline and dementia, as well as dysarthria, usually start early in the disease. Spasticity may be evident in the late stages andÂ associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms including behavioral changes, depression, and apathy.
