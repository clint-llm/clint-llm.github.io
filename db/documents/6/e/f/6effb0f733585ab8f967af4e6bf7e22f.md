Residual nasal deformity is frequently present to varying degrees following reduction of nasal bone and septal fractures. Saddle nose deformity and septal perforations may occur after septoplasty or septal hematoma formation or after severe septal injury. Olfactory disturbances are relatively common, occurring in up to one-third of patients with nasal bone fractures. This may be due to the manipulation of the olfactory neuroepithelium during closed reduction, which is located on the superior and/or supreme turbinate.
