Syncope is a transient loss of consciousness and postural tone followed by spontaneous recovery. While there are numerous classification schemes used to further identify and manage underlying conditions that may lead to syncope, syncope ultimately results from decreased cerebral perfusion. Syncopal episodes may occur suddenly and without preceding signs or symptoms or may be preceded by dizziness, lightheadedness, diaphoresis, nausea, visual disturbances, or other signs and symptoms. Patients may describe syncopal events in a wide variety of ways, some of which include fainting, blacking out, falling out, having a spell, or losing consciousness. Syncope is responsible for 1 to 3.5 percent of all emergency department visits and 6 percent of all hospital admissions in the United States. Underlying conditions that may cause decreased brain perfusion and lead to syncope can range from benign to life-threatening. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of syncope and stresses the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe syncope. 
- Explain how to evaluate syncope.
- Review considerations that influence the management of syncope.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance outcomes for patients affected by syncope.
