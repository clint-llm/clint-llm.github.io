Infectious colitis is complex and requires an interprofessional team for the diagnosis, management, and early detection of complications. The team comprises a gastroenterologist, infectious disease consultant, pathologist, microbiologist, pharmacist, clinical pharmacologist, and general practitioner, which covers the range of expertise needed for the management of infectious colitis and handling any complications. All members of the interprofessional healthcare team, including clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), specialists, specialty-trained nursing staff, and pharmacists, need to communicate and collaborate across disciplinary lines in their areas of expertise to keep the entire team informed and current on the status of the case and changes required.

The nursing staff should monitor the follow-up of the patient. If signs and symptoms fail to resolve and/or signs or symptoms of dehydration develop, the nursing staff should arrange a return visit or possibly recommend emergency department evaluation.

Careful assessment of the patient condition and involvement of the healthcare team in evaluation and decision making is necessary for better outcomes. The nurse assigned to patient education should focus on teaching patients to wash hands, eating only well-cooked foods, and drinking bottled water, particularly during traveling, which are the essential preventable measures that patients need to know.
