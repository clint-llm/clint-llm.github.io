Thyroid hormone has physiological effects on multiple organs system. As a result, the symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism involve manifestations from multiple organ systems. Clinical manifestations are associated with a hyperadrenergic and hypermetabolic state. Common manifestations include unintentional weight loss (about 10% of patients can gain weight due to increased appetite), palpitations, tremors, heat intolerance, dyspnea on exertion, increased anxiety, irritability, fatigue, muscle weakness, increased frequency of bowel movements (some patients can have significant diarrhea), hair loss, loss of libido, and oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea in women.

Patients with subacute thyroiditis can present with significant anterior neck pain and fever. On physical examination, patients have tachycardia (some can present with atrial fibrillation), hypertension, tremors, warm and moist skin, hyperreflexia, and an anxious appearance. Some patients might have signs of heart failure.

Eye signs of lid lad or lid retraction can be seen in all causes of hyperthyroidism due to a hyperadrenergic state.

Examining the thyroid will reveal a diffuse non-nodular enlargement of the thyroid in Graves disease; a diffuse non-symmetric nodular enlargement can be seen in toxic multinodular goiter, and a single large nodule can be palpated in cases of a toxic adenoma. An exquisitely tender thyroid can be noted in subacute thyroiditis.
