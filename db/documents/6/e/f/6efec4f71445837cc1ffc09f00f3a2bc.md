- The position of the AC joint makes it vulnerable to direct trauma to the superior or lateral aspect of the shoulder.

- In an isolated injury, patients typically have pain and swelling over the joint with or without a deformity depending on the degree of injury.

- All patients should receive a radiographic evaluation of the affected shoulder, and if the diagnosis is in question, obtain radiographs of the contralateral AC joint as well.

- Type I and II injuries occur twice as frequently as type III to VI injuries.

- Most injuries can have management non-operatively. If uncertainty exists or it is a Rockwell grade III or greater, an orthopedic physician should be urgently consulted.

- Non-operative management includes rest, protection with a sling, ice, NSAIDs, and physical therapy.
