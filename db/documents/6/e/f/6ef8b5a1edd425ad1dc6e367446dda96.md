The majority of reported cases of amantadine keratopathy have shown complete resolution of corneal edema and visual acuity with discontinuation of amantadine.

Currently, there is little to no evidence to stratify a patientâ€™s risk of developing amantadine keratopathy. Decreased vision following initiation of treatment should undoubtedly prompt a referral to an ophthalmologist by the prescribing neurologist. Patients with a history of ocular trauma, ocular surgery, corneal or anterior segment disease, and possibly those of a certain age may necessitate a consultation by a corneal specialist prior to initiation of amantadine therapy. However, further research is needed to elucidate guidelines for such practice. Increased corneal backscatter on slit-lamp examination and CCT have been shown to have weak predictive value in the prognosis of FECD.
