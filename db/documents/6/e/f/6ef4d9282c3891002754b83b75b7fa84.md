The genus of Treponema includes several uncultivable spirochete pathogens notably including but not limited to T. pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, Treponema endemicum, the causative agent of bejel, related Treponema carateum, the causative agent of pinta, and Treponema pertenue, the causative agent of yaws. The first genome mapping off T. pallidum in 1998 led to the further genomic sequencing of twelve treponemal pathogens and this notably revealed minimal variability between sub-species.T. pertenue and its associated disease, yaws presents with a distinct history and clinical features. Unlike syphilis, yaws is neither sexually transmitted nor transmitted from mother to baby. Disease is most commonly seen in children and is transmitted from skin to skin contact.
