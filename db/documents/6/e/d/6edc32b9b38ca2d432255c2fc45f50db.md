The factors that are involved in analytical quality in laboratories correlate to the definition, creation, and control of quality. Several errors can arise from external and internal sources, along with certain permanent and variable factors. Internal Quality Control (IQC) systems and External Quality Assurance systems (EQAS) need to be established for every individual laboratory. In-house standard operating procedures (SOPs) must be established and strictly adhered to by every lab personnel. Even a slight change in any of the QC parameters can make a significant difference,Â resulting in erroneous results.

The use of reference standards and control materials is important in each analysis. Controls and standards are important pre-requisite and are specific for each analytical method, and these can be prepared in-house or obtained commercially. All laboratories should establish a reference range for all the parameters for their particular methods, but the range obtained should not be significantly different from the published data.

Monitoring is required at each step to ensure that the established protocols are followed and to check for any errors or deviations from the normal. Levey Jennings chart can be of great assistance for monitoring. It is a graphic representation of daily controls or averages of the results. Thus, even a single-day error can be identified, and corrective measures can be taken on time.
