The BBB is the central element of the neurovascular unit (NVU), consisting of tight junctions between endothelial cells. These NVUs exist within the capillaries and post-capillary venules that vascularize the CNS, including most parts of the brain and the spinal cord. A notable exception is a group of specialized neuroepithelial structures within the CNS, termed the circumventricular organs (CVOs). Unlike the remainder of the CNS, CVOs are vascularized by fenestrated capillaries, allowing bidirectional communication between blood and the brain. Grouped at the midline of the brain proximal to the third and fourth ventricles, CVOs perform regulated secretory and sensory functions that, due to the BBB, the remainder of the CNS cannot.

Seven significant CVOs are grouped by function into secretory and sensory organs. The four secretory CVOs are the median eminence, neurohypophysis, pineal gland, and sub-commissural organ. The three sensory CVOs are the area postrema, the subfornical organ, and the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis. These structures and their fenestrated capillaries play critical roles in neuroendocrine function.

Recent MRI studies have also indicated that while the BBB regulates blood-brain interaction, the brain utilizes lymphatic vessels in the dura mater to directly communicate with the peripheral immune system, which plays a role in CNS immune response and toxin transport.
