The sensitivity of receptors associated with GVA fibers can affect the body's ability to maintain homeostasis. Upregulation or downregulation of these receptors can also change the intensity of the signal propagated through the afferent fiber. This intensity becomes especially important when it affects the perception of referred pain.

Understanding variations in nerve anatomy is vital, especially for accurate nerve conduction studies.
