Research has identified over 200 missense mutations that affect seven different voltage-gated sodium channels that cause excitability disorders or channelopathies. While these disorders are rare, they are an example of how proteins altered by genetic variability and mutations can profoundly affect the functioning of voltage-gated sodium channels. One example of such a mutation is the SCN1A gene, which encodes the NAV 1.1 voltage-gated sodium channel alpha subunit.
