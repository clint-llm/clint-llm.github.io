The term amaurosis fugax is often used interchangeably to describe transient visual loss (TVL). However, it is employed widely in medicine to refer to any cause of transient monocular visual loss. Here, we will refer to amaurosis fugax only in the context ofÂ transient monocular visual loss associated with vascular thromboembolic events arising from the internal carotid arterial system.

The condition is not common in children and more likely to have a benign cause. In adults, in most cases, the cause is atherosclerotic emboli from the carotid artery bifurcation.
