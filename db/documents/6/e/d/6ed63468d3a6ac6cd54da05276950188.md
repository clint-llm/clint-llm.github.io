Kallmann syndrome is usually treated pharmacologically with steroid replacement therapy such as testosterone or estrogen-progestin supplementation. Fertility can be increased using gonadotropin-based pharmacologic options. Complications of the condition may include osteoporosis, cardiac diseases, and psychological or neurological disorders, and consultations with appropriate specialists should be considered if indicated. Such associated conditions may show the need for dietary supplementation or physical therapy-based rehabilitation, among others.
