Psoriasis occurs worldwide, and its prevalence varies. In the United States, about 2% of the population is affected. High rates of psoriasis have been reported in the Faroe Islands. The prevalence of psoriasis is low in Japan and may be absent in Aboriginal Australians and Indians from South America.

Psoriasis can present at any age. A bimodal age of onset has been recognized. The mean age of onset for the first presentation of psoriasis can range from 15 to 20 years of age, with a second peak occurring at 55 to 60 years.
