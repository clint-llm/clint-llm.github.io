Gonococcal and chlamydial proctitis and anusitis occur predominantly in young adults. Incidence is more in males than females. Gonococcal proctitis is most common in individuals younger than 25 years. Among men who have sex with men (MSM), prevalence rates of rectal chlamydia and rectal gonorrhea are 9% and 5% respectively. People of Jewish descent are 3-5 times more likely to develop UC and more than 30% of patients with UC have isolated rectal involvement. In children diagnosed with UC, 25% will only have ulcerative proctitis (UP). Girls are two times more likely to have UP than boys. Acute radiation proctitis and anusitis occur in the majority of patients, but are self-limited and last up to three months after the start of radiotherapy. CRP prevalence ranges from 2% to 20% and onset ranges from eight to 13 months but can occur many years after radiation exposure. DP onset is usually from three to 36 months after fecal diversion, and less than 50% of patients are symptomatic.
