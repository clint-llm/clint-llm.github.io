Early recognition is critical for the management of adrenal insufficiency. Addison crisis is a severe endocrine emergency; immediate recognition and treatment are required. Beware that if not recognized and treated, the adrenal crisis can be fatal. The confirmatory laboratory evaluation should not delay the treatment. Blood samples should be obtained for subsequent measurement of ACTH and cortisol levels. The elevation of ACTH with low cortisol is diagnostic of a primary adrenal insufficiency. Measurement of cortisol in the ACTH stimulation test may be performed when initial laboratory evaluation cannot establish the diagnosis. Plasma renin level is often elevated and is indicative of a mineralocorticoid deficiency, accompanied by a low aldosterone level.

**Acute Phase**

Patients with an adrenal crisis require the following:

- Fluid resuscitation to restore the intravascular volume with intravenous (IV) normal saline

- Dextrose to correct hypoglycemia

- Correction of the hormone deficiency, both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid

The immediate hormonal treatment is the administration of hydrocortisone. The initial dose for adrenal crisis is 100 mg IV bolus, followed by 50 to 100 mg IV every 6 hours over 24 hours. In children, the dose is 50 mg/m^2 (max: 100 mg) IV bolus, followed by 50 to 100 mg/m^2.  Since this dose has significant mineralocorticoid activity, mineralocorticoids such as fludrocortisone are unnecessary during the acute phase.

**Maintenance Phase**

Life-long treatment with hormonal replacement is required. Maintenance therapy aims to provide a replacement to maintain a physiologic glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid level.  The usual doses are as follows;

- Glucocorticoid:  Hydrocortisone 5 to 25 mg/day (can be divided into 2 or 3 doses)

Prednisone 3 to 5 mg/day

Doses should be adjusted according to the clinical response and normalization of electrolyte abnormalities. To minimize adverse effects, the dose should be titrated to the lowest possible dose that controls symptoms; ensure the patient is clinically well.  Plasma Renin level can also be used to adjust the doses. Serum ACTH levels may vary significantly and cannot be used for dose adjustment. It is important to consider concurrent medications when deciding the glucocorticoid dose. For example, certain drugs such as Rifampin can increase hepatic glucocorticoid metabolism and may inactivate cortisol. Dexamethasone is not an appropriate choice for maintenance treatment; the dose titration is difficult and increases the risk of the Cushing effect.

- Mineralocorticoid: Fludrocortisone 0.05 to 0.2 mg daily.

In children, the initial hydrocortisone dose is  8 mg/m^2/day orally; this can be divided into 3 or 4 doses.

Fludrocortisone should be administered at a sufficient dose to keep the plasma renin level in the reference range.

**Treatment Considerations**

- In patients with Addison’s disease, glucocorticoid secretion does not increase during stress. Therefore, in the presence of fever, infection, or other illnesses, the hydrocortisone dose should be increased to compensate for a possible stress response.

- In general, a****usual stress dose is 2-3 times the daily maintenance dose.****

- Patients taking rifampin require an increased dose of hydrocortisone, as it increases the clearance of hydrocortisone.

- Thyroid hormone can increase the hepatic clearance of cortisol; this can precipitate an adrenal crisis. Glucocorticoid replacement can potentially normalize thyroid-stimulating hormone.

- In patients with concomitant diabetes insipidus, glucocorticoid therapy can aggravate diabetes insipidus. Cortisol is required for free-water clearance, and cortisol deficiency may prevent polyuria.

- Pregnancy, particularly during the third trimester, increases corticosteroid requirements.
