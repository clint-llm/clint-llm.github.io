- Early recognition and intervention of cachexia improve the quality of life and survival.

- Physical exercise should be a component of anticachexia protocols.

- Drugs needing more study include growth hormone-releasing peptide 2, and growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) expression plasmids.

- A combination of anticachexia agents can be beneficial.

- Ghrelin analogs, including anamorelin, show the most promise.

- Medroxyprogesterone acetate, celecoxib, cannabinoids, and antioxidants are used.

- Drugs being studied include ghrelin mimetics such as BIM-28131, BIM-28125, L163 255, and RC-1291. Enobosarm is an androgen receptor modulator. MT-102 is an anabolic-catabolic transforming agents.

- New drug targets include proinflammatory cytokine inhibitors and myostatin inhibitors.
