The majority of patients with vitamin D deficiency are asymptomatic. However, even mild chronic vitamin D deficiency can lead to chronic hypocalcemia and hyperparathyroidism which can contribute risk of osteoporosis, falls and fractures especially in the elderly population. Patients with a prolonged and severe vitamin D deficiency can experience symptoms associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism including bone pain, arthralgias, myalgias, fatigue, muscle twitching (fasciculations), and weakness. Fragility fractures may result from chronic vitamin D deficiency leading to osteoporosis. In children, irritability, lethargy, developmental delay, bone changes, or fractures can be symptoms of vitamin D deficiency.
