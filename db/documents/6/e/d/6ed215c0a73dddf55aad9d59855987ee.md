Plantar fasciitis is a clinical diagnosis and imaging is not necessary. A provider may consider obtaining x-rays or ultrasound evaluation if history or physical exam indicate other injuries or conditions or the patient fails to improve after a reasonable amount of time. X-rays and/or ultrasound evaluation may show calcifications in the soft tissues or heel spurs on the inferior aspect of the heel. Additionally, ultrasound may show thickening and swelling of the plantar fascia which is a typical feature. If the patient is not responding to conservative therapy after longer periods of time, then the provider may consider ordering an MRI to evaluate for tears, stress fractures, or osteochondral defects.
