Initial evaluation may involve barium enema or CT colonography, but ultimately a colonoscopy is required for tissue biopsy.

Baseline CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with IV and oral contrast is the preferred cost-effective staging imaging study before Cca surgical resection. CT abdomen and pelvis provides a moderate strength initial assessment of accurately staging T (50%) and N (73%) but rather provide immediate higher sensitivity for distant metastasis (87%). CT chest remains controversial, as 9% will show indeterminate lesions, of that 11% represented metastatic lesions. MRI and CT triple phase imaging have improved the detection of liver metastasis. Positron emission tomography (PET) is not routinely indicated on the preoperative staging of Cca. Biopsy of the suspicious metastatic site should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.
