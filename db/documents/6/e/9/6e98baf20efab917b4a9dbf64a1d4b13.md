Cosmetic rehabilitation is essential in TED management. Asymmetrical proptosis is common during inactive disease. A graded surgical orbital decompression helps achieve a cosmetically symmetrical look.

The surgical plan is customized depending on the amount of proptosis correction, the pattern of strabismus, and the orbital anatomy. The restricted EOM is recessed to achieve orthophoria in the primary gaze. The final correction for the lid retraction is planned at least six months after the strabismus surgery. Blepharotomy, blepahromyotomy, levator recession, and spacer grafts are the common strategies for lid retraction correction.
