Every child should be tested for herpes simplex virus (HSV) and other viral etiology testing can be based on time of year and geographical location. Diagnostic clues for diagnosing anti- NMDAR encephalitis are shown in figure 1. Confirmation of the clinical diagnosis requires demonstration of IgG antibodies against the GluN1 subunit of NMDAR in the serum or CSF sample.

Brain MRI demonstrates bilateral T2 or FLAIR signal hyperintensities in hippocampi, frontal cortex, medial temporal lobe, cerebellar cortex, spinal cord, and medulla oblongata.

Electroencephalography shows a slow continuous rhythmic and disorganized activity in delta and theta range superimposed seizures, as 90% of patients have a slowing of EEG at some point during the illness.
