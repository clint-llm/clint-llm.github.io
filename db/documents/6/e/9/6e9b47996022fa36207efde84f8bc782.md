The nurse is very important for the successful performance of the TAP block. Their interventions include:

- Verify that the patient signed the inform consent for the procedure

- Verify the side of the procedure (if unilateral) that is the correct side of the abdomen

- Setting up the ultrasound, syringes, needles, medications, and all equipment necessary to perform theÂ block

- Placing all the monitors pre-procedure (EKG, pulse oximetry and blood pressure monitors)

- Positioning and preparing the patient for the procedure

- Performing the pre-procedure time-out

- Assisting the operator if needed during the procedure
