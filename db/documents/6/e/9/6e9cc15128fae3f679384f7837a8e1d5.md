Due to the diffuse presence of cholinergic receptors throughout the body, their dysfunction affects both the peripheral and central nervous systems. At the somatic neuromuscular junction, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are at the center of the pathophysiology of antibody-mediated myasthenia gravis and congenital myasthenic syndromes. Within the central nervous system, there is evidence of dysfunctional muscarinic and nicotinic receptors playing a role in the development of Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and addiction.

The neuromuscular junction works to convey the electrical signal of voluntary movement to mechanical action. The dysfunctional states of myasthenia gravis and congenital myasthenia syndromes disrupt transmission at the neuromuscular junction. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease that generates antibodies against theÂ nicotinic receptor at the neuromuscular junction. The binding of pathologic antibodies to the receptor results in its loss of function and recycling back within the cell.

Within the central nervous system, cholinergic receptors play a role in developing Alzheimer, Parkinson, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and addiction. Alzheimer disease is debilitating; progressive dementia mostly affecting individuals over the age of 65. Early disease research found a common disruption of M1 receptor signaling. Researchers have found this to play an important role in cognitive function in animal models, with M1 gene knockouts demonstrating memory decline and accumulation of the pathologic Alzheimer protein, amyloid-beta.
