For common fibular nerve neuropathy, the patient may complain of weakness in the dorsiflexors (extensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum longus, tibialis anterior), which could result in a foot drop or a foot slap with a steppage gait.

For deep fibular neuropathy, patients may complain of pain, weakness, or atrophy of the foot, especially the EDB muscle. Patients may also experience numbness/paresthesias of the first and second webspace. They may experience pain over the dorsum of the foot, which is relieved with motion.

For superficial fibular neuropathies, patients may complain of pain, numbness, paresthesias, or loss of sensation in the distal anterolateral calf and the foot's dorsum, except for the first webspace. Patients can present with weakness in foot eversion if the injury is proximal to the innervation of the tibialis longus and brevis muscles.
