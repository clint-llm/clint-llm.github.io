Usually, laboratory tests are not required for the diagnosis of entropion. If a patient is found to have a cicatricial entropion, an infection or autoimmune disease workup needs to be performed before treatment of the entropion. The source of the entropion needs to be identified. If an involutional entropion is found, consider an exophthalmometry reading to determine if relative enophthalmos is present.
