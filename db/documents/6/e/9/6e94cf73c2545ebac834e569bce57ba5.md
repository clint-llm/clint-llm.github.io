Field intubation can be a life-saving procedure that should be part of all ALS and critical care prehospital providers' skill set. There are clinical situations where no other options for airway control and patient ventilation are possible.  Despite this need, the decision to perform field intubation should not be taken lightly.  The procedure is technically difficult and fraught with complications.  Multiple studies and editorials even question its utility and show concern for a trend of worse outcomes from field intubation versus basic airway management by EMS.
