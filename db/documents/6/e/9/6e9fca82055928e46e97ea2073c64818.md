In the neonatal intensive care unit, physicians, practitioners, and nursing staff taking care of the infants should have a clinical suspicion of neonatal hyperglycemia. The signs and symptoms of neonatal hyperglycemia are often vague and nonspecific. The healthcare team should be aware of the management strategyÂ and complications of neonatal hyperglycemia. The at-risk infants should be monitored closely and treated if the hyperglycemia is severe and persistent to avoid further complications. Early initiation of enteral feeds and optimized parenteral nutrition with adequate amino acid supplementation can prevent neonatal hyperglycemia.
