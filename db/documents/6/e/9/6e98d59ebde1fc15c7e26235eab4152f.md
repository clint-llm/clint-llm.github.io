Several factors affect the result of the susceptibility testing which covers the whole sampling, testing, and reporting procedures.  Any deviation from the standard AST procedure can significantly impact succeeding areas of laboratory workflow which in turn could later affect patient diagnosis, treatment, and management.  Support systems of the laboratory workflow require strict monitoring, and laboratory personnel should be well trained and competent enough to perform the procedure.

For instance, "poor specimen quality" can be the first sign leading to an erroneous result.  A perfectly carried out inoculation to MHA plate using “mixed colonies” will turn out unsatisfactory results.  Poor standardization of bacterial suspension and a "longer depth of agar" could yield misleading endpoints.  Supportive supervision for laboratory staff is necessary, to prevent wasting time and resources.

Purchasing poor quality MIC panels can lead to "dehydrated wells" or "mixed wells."  Doing the procedure without personal protective equipment (PPE) can increase the incidence of laboratory-acquired infections.  Inadequacy and lack of supplies needed to perform AST will extend turn-around time and therefore, decrease laboratory productivity and delay patient therapy.  Providing AST on drugs that do not align with the hospital’s formulary makes laboratory service available yet ineffective.
