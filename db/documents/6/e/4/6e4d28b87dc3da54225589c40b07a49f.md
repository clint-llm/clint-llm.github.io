Treatment of both groups somewhat follows the same algorithm, although individualized treatment is the goal. The level of disease activity, the presence of poor prognostic factors or concomitant illnesses, functional impairment, the patient's tolerance of medication, the risk of adverse effects, the expectations of treatment, and other psychosocial factors must be considered.

NSAIDS and pain medication are usually the first choice and can be given for weeks to months. Exercise and physical therapy will benefit all and prevent long-term joint stiffness, damage, and functional impairment. Traditional biologics such as methotrexate, Leflunomide and sulfasalazine are effective in RA but not AS. Anti-tumor necrosis factor agents are effective in AS. Systemic glucocorticoids are best avoided especially in long-term.

Surgical interventions are tailored to individual patients. Fusion of the atlantoaxial joint of the cervical spine is needed if there is significant neck or occipital pain or evidence of neurologic dysfunction due to C1-C2 subluxation, as occurs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis but not AS. Joint replacement might be needed.
