Evaluation of syncope should focus on risk stratifying between low-risk and high-risk syncope. As noted, a complete history and physical exam will help assist with risk stratification. New medications, such as beta-blockers, nitrates, diuretics, and antiarrhythmics, should be carefully considered as possible contributors. A family history of sudden cardiac death is a dangerous predictor of adverse outcome.

Benign or low-risk characteristics include age younger than 40, syncope after standing from a sitting position, warmth, nausea, cough, or micturition before syncope, and an individualized trigger for syncope (such as pain or emotional distress). In children, these triggers are known as psychogenic. A history of recurring syncope in a young patient in the setting of these benign events indicates a low-risk factor. Dehydration is a common cause of syncope in young patients, and orthostatic evaluation can be considered as part of the workup. Rarely, a cerebrovascular accident, such as an intracranial bleed, can cause a reflex-mediated syncope. Features that indicate high-risk include exertional syncope, chest pain, history of congestive heart failure, aortic stenosis, left ventricular outflow tract disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, past myocardial infarction, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement. Of note, recurrence of syncope multiple times in 6 months should warrant further evaluation, regardless of age.

Vital sign abnormalities, such as hypotension, may indicate an acute bleed. In older patients and menstruating females, an exam looking for pallor or gastrointestinal bleed should be considered as this can lead to cerebral hypoperfusion, causing syncope. Hemoglobin or hematocrit is indicated in such patients. Other vital sign abnormalities, such as bradycardia, may indicate arteriovenous (AV) dissociation. Hypoxia can indicate a pulmonary embolism. Physical exam findings of a new murmur can indicate dangerous valvular pathologies, such as aortic stenosis or mitral regurgitation.

All patients should receive a screening electrocardiogram (ECG). ECG features, such as a new left bundle branch block, Brugada pattern, arrhythmogenic RV dysplasia, prolonged QTc, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patterns, suggest high risk and indicate a need for further workup. Similarly, sinus bradycardia, dysrhythmias, and second or third-degree AV blocks should all warrant further workup.
