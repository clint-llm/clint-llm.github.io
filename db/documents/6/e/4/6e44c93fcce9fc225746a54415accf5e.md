Disc degeneration is usually associated with disc herniation. With aging, the disc fibrochondrocytes undergo senescence and a reduction in proteoglycans production. This reduction in proteoglycans leads to dehydration and disc collapse, increasing the strain on the annulus fibrosus, resulting in tears and fissures, and consequentially facilitating the nucleus pulposus herniation. Therefore, when repetitive mechanical stressors are applied on the disc, it results in a gradual onset of symptoms that tend to be chronic.

On the other hand, axial overloading applies a large biomechanical force on the healthy disc, which may result in extrusion of disc material through a failing annulus fibrosus. Those injuries usually result in more severe acute symptoms.
