The exact pathophysiological process is not understood well.

Dr. Tarlov's original theory is that due to trauma and hemorrhage, this causes hemosiderin deposition and a blockage of venous drainage in the perineurium and epineurium, leading to cystic degeneration.

Another theory is that genetic risk factors that increase congenital arachnoidal proliferation along with the exiting sacral nerve roots promote the development of the cystic structures.

The cysts themselves are connected to the subarachnoid space, and the leading theory in the growth of cysts is due to a one-way valve mechanism. The pulsatile flow of the CSF allows the cyst to expand but not reduce in size, and it is thought that this explains why only some Tarlov cysts are symptomatic and worsen with time. The growth and pressure that it exerts on adjacent nerve fibers result in neurological symptoms, but it may also erode the surrounding sacral bone and irritate the periosteum, which may also result in pain.
