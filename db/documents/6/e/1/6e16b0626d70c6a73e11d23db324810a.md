Although prospective longitudinal data are limited, the usual course of essential tremor is one of slow, gradual progression. Essential tremor may remain stable in a minority of patients. However, a stable course should raise suspicion for an alternative diagnosis such as an enhanced, physiologic tremor or drug-induced tremor rather than an essential tremor. While prospective data are limited, essential tremors may be associated with an increased risk for developing Parkinson disease. Survival in essential tremor does not differ from the general population. The overall quality of life is poor.
