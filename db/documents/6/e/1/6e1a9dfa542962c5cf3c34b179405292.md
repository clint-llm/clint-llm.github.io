Adrenal insufficiency ranges from mild nonspecific symptoms to life-threatening shock condition. Adrenal insufficiency is a diagnosis that will not be made unless the clinician maintains a level of suspicion. The decreasing or suppressed adrenal function may be masked until stress or illness triggers an adrenal crisis.

An important distinction in these patients is the presence of mineralocorticoid deficiency. Those with secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency will typically have preserved mineralocorticoid function due to the separate feedback systems. Mineralocorticoid levels are regulated by the renin-angiotensin system, independent of hypothalamic or pituitary signals.

Another important distinction is the acute versus chronic nature of the disease. Acute adrenal insufficiency patients often present in a critically ill state while chronic presentations can be insidious.
