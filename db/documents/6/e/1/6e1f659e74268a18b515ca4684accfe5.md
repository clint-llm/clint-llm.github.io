ACS occurs when tissue fluid pressure exceeds capillary perfusion pressure to the muscle and nerves within an anatomic compartment. The muscle fascia and other connective tissues are inelastic. As the pressure builds, the venous return eventually is halted, which results in the transudation of fluid. This sets off a cascade of events, leading to an edema-hypoxia cycle. Once edema is severe enough to cause hypoxia, adhesion molecules are activated, leading to the attachment of neutrophils, a release of reactive oxygen species, and severe vasoconstriction. This process results in reperfusion injury and is the basis behind the no-reflow phenomenon. It is estimated muscle necrosis starts to occur within 2-3 hours of injury in as many as 35% of patients.
