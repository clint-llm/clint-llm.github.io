In 1961, Sarles et al. originally described IgG4-related disease in the pancreas based on a case of pancreatitis with hypergammaglobulinemia

There is not enough data to determine the true prevalence of IgG-4RD. Many medical disorders previously thought to be unique are now included in the spectrum of IgG4-RD. Most of the data come from Japan where the prevalence of autoimmune pancreatitis is 0.8 cases per 100,000 and accounts for 6 % of cases of chronic pancreatitis. In a clinic series by the Mayo Clinic, 11% of patients undergoing pancreatic resection for benign indications had AIP

The disease can affect almost any organs. Hence the symptoms and signs are based on the affected organs, and the severity of the disease can vary. There are multiple organ involvements in 60% to 90% of patients. Commonly, the presentation is subacute due to the enlargement of the organs, and few are found incidentally during diagnostic imaging, laboratory work, i.e., Biochemistry and Immunopathology. IgG4-RD related tubulointerstitial nephritis may present with mass like lesions in radiological studies with acute or chronic renal failure. Allergy history is very common, with symptoms including atopy, bronchial asthma, and sinusitis in about 40% of cases. A single or multi-organ presentation may progress to include more organs and would need close follow up. The disease can affect almost any organs. Hence the symptoms and signs are based on the affected organs, and the severity of the disease can vary. The IgG4 RD responder index is a research tool that may be used in clinical practice to detect changes in disease activity and determine improvements or worsening in the affected organs.

**Clinical Diagnosis**

Diagnosis is based on clinical and histological features. There are two types of criteria available: (1) the Mayo Clinic HISORt criteria for the diagnosis of AIP and (2) the Japanese Comprehensive Clinical Diagnostic (CCD) criteria for IgG4-RD. Histopathology is the current "gold standard" for diagnosis.

**The Mayo Clinic HISORt Criteria for the Diagnosis of AIP**

**Histopathology (one or both criteria required)**

- Characteristic appearances within biopsy or resection material.*

- At least ten lgG4-positive plasma cells per high power field within areas of lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate.

**Imaging and serology (3 criteria required)
**

- Diffusely enlarged pancreas with delayed and "rim" enhancement.

- Irregular pancreatic duct.

- Increased serum IgG4 concentration.

**Response to steroid therapy (3 criteria required)**

- Unexplained pancreatic disease after a full clinical workup – including the exclusion of cancer.

- Raised serum IgG4 concentration and/or extrapancreatic organ involvement with increased numbers of tissue lgG4-positive plasma cells.

- Resolution or marked improvement in disease with steroid therapy.

*This includes a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, "storiform" fibrosis, and obliterative phlebitis; the inflammatory cell infiltrate alone is not sufficient to meet this criterion.

**The Japanese Comprehensive Clinical Diagnostic (CCD) Criteria for IgG-4RD**

- Clinical examination showing characteristic diffuse/localized swelling or masses in single or multiple organs.

- Hematological examination shows elevated serum lgG4 concentrations (greater than 135 mg/dL).

- Histopathological examination shows:

- Marked lymphocyte and plasmacytic infiltration and fibrosis.

- Infiltration of IgG4 + plasma cells: ratio of IgG4 +/ IgG + cells greater than 40% and greater than 10 IgG4 + plasma cells/HPF.

Definite: 1 + 2 + 3Probable: 1 + 3Possible: 1 + 2

However, it is vital to differentiate IgG4-RD from malignant tumors of each organ (e.g., cancer, lymphoma) and similar diseases (e.g., Sjogren syndrome, primary sclerosing cholangitis, Castleman disease, secondary retroperitoneal fibrosis, Wegener granulomatosis, sarcoidosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome) by additional histopathological examination. Even when patients cannot be diagnosed using the CCD criteria, they may be diagnosed using organ-specific diagnostic criteria for IgG4-RD.

**Laboratory Diagnosis**

Elevated serum IgG 4 levels of more than 1.4 g/L is seen in 70% to 80% of patients. IgG4 elevation more than two times the upper limit of normal (normal 140 mg/dL) has 99% specificity for IgG4-RD

**Radiological Diagnosis**

Radiological images cannot differentiate between malignancy and benign disease in the affected organs.

**Computed tomography and Magnetic resonance imaging**

A combination of CT and MRI can identify the affected organs and monitor the disease activity, remission, or relapse. Patients with the following results have a high probability of autoimmune pancreatitis

- A diffusely enlarged pancreas with delayed enhancement and borders

- No features in the presence or absence of a capsule-like rim in CT with contrast or

- MRI with more than twice the upper limit of IgG4 levels

**Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (
**
**ERCP) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)**

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) can help obtain tissue samples for diagnosis. In case of renal lesions, they are commonly bilateral and multiple and involve the cortex. The radiological findings are classified as one of the following:

- Large, solitary masses

- Small, peripheral cortical nodules

- Round or wedge-shaped lesions

- Diffuse, patchy involvement

**Histopathology**

The three classic features are lymphoplasmacytic inflammation, fibrosis with a storiform pattern, and obliterative venulitis. Lymphoplasmacytic inflammation is dense with lymphoid aggregate and germinal center formation; eosinophilia may be prominent in the infiltrate. Lymphocytic venulitis is common. A storiform pattern is standard for this disease, and it marks a radiating pattern of closely packed fibroblasts (3). In addition to these, there may be keloid or hyaline patterns. Granulomas are uncommon, and the presentation makes the diagnosis unlikely. Obliterative venulitis is difficult to identify using eosin and hematoxylin stains, and special connective tissue stains like elastin Van Gieson are useful. Individually these finding may be seen in any non-IgG4-RD disease, the presence of all the three components makes this diagnosis distinct. In a renal disease with tubulointerstitial nephritis, microscopy shows a plasma-cell-rich interstitial inflammatory cell infiltrate. The plasma cells in the lesions stain positively for IgG4.

**Treatment**

**Corticosteroids 
**

Corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment. No randomized controlled studies for the treatment of IgG4-RD have been done to date. Some patients with AIP have had spontaneous remission with no treatment

**Prednisone 
**

The two opinions regarding steroid dosages are from Japan and the Mayo Clinic in the United States. Seventeen referral centers in Japan suggested treating patients with prednisolone first. Specifically, 0.6 mg/kg per day for 2 to 4 weeks and tapered 3 to 6 months to a dose of 5 mg per day, and finally continued at a dose between 2.5 to 5 mg per day for up to 3 years

**Biliary stenting**

In addition to treatment with prednisone, many patients with AIP also undergo a biliary stenting procedure which is believed to shorten the time needed for symptomatic improvement

**B-cell depletion
**

B-cell depletion using rituximab (1 g intravenously [IV] every 15 days for a total of 2 doses) is another mode of treatment. Patients undergoing B-cell depletion treatment show a rapid clinical response and lowering of serum IgG4 level. But the reduction of tissue IgG4 and Plasma cells are not significant. Targeted and often rapid reduction of serum IgG4 concentrations is possible through B-cell depletion, resulting in the relative preservation of other immunoglobulins and immunoglobulin subclass concentrations. This suggests that B-cell depletion achieves its effects, at least in part, by interfering with the repletion of short-lived plasma cells that are producing IgG4
