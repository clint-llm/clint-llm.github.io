The organisms commonly cultured from Bezold's abscesses include gram-positive aerobes: Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Enterococcus species; gram-negative aerobes: Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, and Proteus species and anaerobes, particularly Peptostreptococcus and Fusobacterium species. These are the same organisms implicated in coalescent mastoiditis, from which this condition develops. While this infection is exceedingly rare in modern times, immunosuppressed patients and patients in areas without access to antibiotic treatments remain at higher risk.
