Nerve compression syndromes produce a variety of signs and symptoms, depending on the nerve that is affected. For all of these syndromes, it is essential to obtain a detailed history from each patient regarding the nature and duration of their symptoms. A patient’s medical history is another crucial component to consider as the presence of systemic disease can be contributing to the symptoms experienced. These can include chronic inflammatory conditions (autoimmune disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis), pregnancy, obesity, and hypothyroidism. In performing a physical exam, pay attention to any anatomic factors that can result in nerve compressions such as the presence of masses (lipomas, fibromas, ganglion cysts) or hematomas. It is also essential to assess the entire affected extremity and the cervical spine to ascertain if the lesion is occurring proximal to the hand. More detailed signs and symptoms for each syndrome are listed below based on the affected nerve.

**Median Nerve**

Median nerve compression at the hand and wrist is called carpal tunnel syndrome. It is the most common type of nerve injury and results from compression of the median nerve at the wrist as it passes between the carpal bones and the flexor retinaculum. It is typically the result of repetitive use of the hands but can be the result of other factors such as obesity, diabetes, pregnancy, and hypothyroidism. Patients often report numbness, tingling, and pain that worsens at night. These symptoms can be elicited from activities that involve prolonged wrist flexion and/or extension. Shaking the hand may alleviate the symptoms. They may also be weakness and clumsiness of the hand with activities such as gripping and grasping. The physical exam is an important component in the diagnosis of carpal tunnel as it can help distinguish carpal tunnel from other diagnoses such as proximal median neuropathy (pronator syndrome) and cervical radiculopathy. Sensory symptoms involve the thumb, index, long, and lateral half of the ring finger. There will be no sensory loss at the thenar eminence with carpal tunnel syndrome when compared to more proximal lesions. If motor weakness is present, it is typically evident with weakness of thumb abduction. There may also be atrophy of the thenar eminence as the median nerve innervates many muscles in this region. Signs that will be absent in carpal tunnel syndrome include weakness in forearm pronation, finger abduction, and finger extension. There are several provocative tests used to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome

- **Tinel sign**is performed by gently tapping on the median nerve at the carpal tunnel. A positive result is when there is an electrical shock sensation in the median nerve distribution. The sensitivity of this test is 50 percent, and the specificity is 77 percent.

- **Phalen test**is performed by flexing the wrist for 60 seconds. A positive result is when there is numbness or tingling in the median nerve distribution. The sensitivity of this test is 68 percent, and the specificity is 73 percent.

- **Carpal tunnel compression test (Durkan test)**is performed by pressing the examiner’s thumbs over the carpal tunnel and holding pressure for 30 seconds. A positive test occurs with the onset of pain or paresthesia in the median nerve distribution. The sensitivity of this test is 87 percent, and the specificity is 90 percent.

- **Flick sign:**History of awakening with symptoms and shaking the hand to provide relief. This sign has the maximum specificity (96%) in the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome.

**Ulnar Nerve**

Ulnar neuropathy at the hand or wrist (commonly called ulnar tunnel syndrome) can result from a variety of reasons that include ganglion formation, lipoma, tumors, carpal bone fractures, and external pressure such as the use of a screwdriver, bicycle, wheelchair, or walker. Ulnar neuropathy at this level can be the result of compression of the ulnar nerve at three zones.

- **Zone 1 compression**occurs with nerve compression proximal to or within the Guyon canal, occurring before the bifurcation of the ulnar nerve into the superficial and deep branches. Because the nerve has yet to bifurcate into sensory and motor branches, compression at this site will result in both motor and sensory symptoms. The motor weakness of all the ulnar-innervated intrinsic muscles of the hand will be present along with sensory deficits over the hypothenar eminence and the small and ring fingers.

- **Zone 2 compression**occurs distal to the bifurcation and affects the motor branch exclusively; this will manifest with motor weakness of the ulnar innervated intrinsic muscles without any sensory deficits along the ulnar nerve distribution.

- **Zone 3 compression**occurs distal to the bifurcation affecting only the superficial branch of the ulnar nerve, manifesting as a sensory disturbance to the palmar aspect of the little finger and the palmar-ulnar ring finger. There will be no hypothenar and interosseous weakness.

The initial aspect of the physical exam should be to observe for hypothenar or interossei atrophy, clawing of the fingers, or inability to cross the fingers. This deficit demonstrates the weakness of the ulnar-innervated intrinsic hand muscles. Palpation of the hand and wrist may elucidate the presence of masses or tenderness that could indicate a carpal fracture. The neurological exam will help to distinguish ulnar neuropathy of the wrist from more proximal lesions. If present, sensory disturbances will be seen at the palmar small finger and ulnar half of the ring finger. There will be no sensory changes on the dorsal medial hand or medial forearm, which can present in more proximal lesions such as cubital tunnel syndrome, cervical radiculopathy, or brachial plexopathy. Motor weakness will manifest with weakness of finger abduction. There will be a weakness of distal interphalangeal (DIP) flexion, thumb abduction, of finger extension. Other findings in the physical examination can include:

- Weak grasp from loss of metacarpal-phalangeal flexion strength

- A weak pinch from loss of thumb adduction

- **Froment sign:**this is performed by having the patient attempt to hold a piece of paper between the thumb and index finger. The examiner then attempts to pull the paper out of the patient’s fingers. A positive result is seen with compensatory interphalangeal joint hyperflexion by the flexor pollicis longus, which is innervated by the anterior interosseous nerve. This is to compensate for the loss of thumb adduction from the weakness of the adductor pollicis longus.

- **Wartenberg sign,**which presents as an abduction posturing of the little finger, due to weakness of the adducting palmar interosseous muscle.

**Radial nerve**

Radial nerve compression at the hand and wrist typically involves the superficial branch; a condition referred to as Wartenberg syndrome or cheiralgia parestheica. This is a relatively rare condition but can be caused by local trauma to the wrist such as distal radial fractures or from external compressions, such as with handcuffs, wristwatch, or bracelets. This nerve can also become compressed by soft tissue masses such as lipomas or ganglion cysts. Symptoms are strictly sensory and there, are no motor deficits noted. Patients typically present with pain, tingling, or paresthesias along the dorsolateral aspect of the wrist, hand, and fingers. Symptoms of pain predominate over other sensory symptoms. Patients may also have the aggravation of their symptoms with motions that involve repetitive wrist flexion and ulnar deviation. Physical examination should elucidate the presence of masses or signs of external pressure. There will be no motor deficits noted nor signs of atrophy. Patients may have decreased grip strength, but this is typically secondary to pain rather than to specifically identifiable weakness. The sensory examination may demonstrate abnormal sensation to light touch and 2-point discrimination on the dorsolateral aspect of the wrist and hand. Provocative tests that can be utilized to diagnose Wartenberg’s syndrome include

- **Tinel sign:**gentle tapping over the course of the superficial branch of the radial nerve resulting in the reproduction of pain and/or paresthesias. This is the most common finding.

- **Dellon test:**THis test is performed with active, forceful hyperpronation of the forearm with flexion and ulnar deviation of the wrist, which reproduces symptoms of pain.

- **Finkelstein test:**performed by asking the patient to make a fist around the thumb and ulnar deviate the wrist. A positive test is indicative of De Quervain tenosynovitis (tendonitis of the first dorsal compartment). This test may be positive in patients with Wartenberg syndrome as the neuropathy, and first dorsal compartment tenosynovitis may coexist.
