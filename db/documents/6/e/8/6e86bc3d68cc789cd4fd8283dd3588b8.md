History starts from pre-conception through the antenatal and neonatal periods. Important points in the medical history include reviewing any chronic maternal conditions such as hypertension, renal disease, diabetes mellitus; if the mother has an acute or chronic infection such as HIV, toxoplasmosis, rubella, malaria; the motherâ€™s nutritional status; and if substance use/abuse was present. Vaccination history and screening for antibody titers to ensure immunity to infections such as rubella and Cytomegalovirus should be determined. It is important to ask for a history of FGR SGA in prior pregnancies or in the family history. Discussing the antenatal care and social stressors are important as well.

Neonates with FGR SGA are usually thin, with loose peeling skin, decrease muscle mass, and loss of subcutaneous fat tissues. The face in these newborns is usually shrunken and wrinkled, and the umbilical cord is thin. The membranous bone formation in these infants is decreased, resulting in widened cranial sutures and larger than normal anterior fontanelle. The head appears relatively larger than the rest of the body in neonates with asymmetric FGR SGA.
