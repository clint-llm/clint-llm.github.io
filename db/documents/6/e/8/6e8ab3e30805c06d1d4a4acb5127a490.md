A clinical diagnosis is feasible in most settings, but many clinicians may pursue a histopathological investigation as a diagnostic adjunct. In cases in which a premalignant or malignant etiology is considered in the differential diagnosis, a biopsy is recommended in order to elicit the hornâ€™s potentially carcinogenic implications. A deep biopsy or total excision is the recommended method to obtain a sufficient sample of the suspicious lesion.

Further workup of the disease is dependent upon the histopathological findings of the primary disease process. Imaging is not required or recommended, and lab testing is unnecessary unless the primary pathology warrants further investigation.
