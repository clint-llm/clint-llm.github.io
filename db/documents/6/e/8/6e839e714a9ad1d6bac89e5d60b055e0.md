Pigmented lesions of the skinÂ are commonly called freckles. They include solar lentigo, congenital nevi, mucosal nevi, and special nevi of the palms and soles. This activity will help to differentiate the various pedal nevi from acral lentiginous melanoma clinically. Plantar melanomas are characteristically late to be diagnosed, have a poorer response to treatment, and have a significantly higher mortality rate when compared to more proximal melanomas.
