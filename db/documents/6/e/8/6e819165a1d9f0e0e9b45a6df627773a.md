Though nisoldipine is a well-tolerated medication among patients, it does have some side effects mainly associated with its vasodilating property. Common adverse effects associated with nisoldipine include flushing, vasodilation (4%), hypotension, syncope, peripheral edema (7% to 29% and it is dose-related), headache (22%), dizziness (3% to 10%), and nausea (2%). Additionally, chest pain (2%), palpitations (3%), dermatitis (2%), pharyngitis  (5%), and sinusitis (3%) may also exhibit in individuals taking nisoldipine. Conditions such as anemia, anxiety, alopecia, difficulty swallowing, gingival hyperplasia, or ischemia are associated with less than 1% of the population taking the drug.

In less than 1 % population taking nisoldipine following adverse reactions are reported in postmarketing surveillance.
