Asthma is a wide-reaching, chronic inflammatory illness that impacts millions of people daily. It is frequently responsible for unscheduled healthcare usage, missed school, and workdays. It is an inappropriate immune response, much like an environmental allergy, to a triggering factor that induces bronchial hyperreactivity constriction with the remodeling of smooth muscle and increased mucous secretion into the airways.
