Prognosis mainly depends on the severity of the disease. Those with subtotal chronic coronary occlusion have a better prognosis than with total chronic coronary occlusion. Total coronary occlusion is associated with a worse overall prognosis, with higher rates of death and non-fatal adverse cardiovascular events in several populations.

Patients with un-revascularized CTOs have been found to have higher mortality and a higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, including death from myocardial infarction comparedÂ to patients with multivessel coronary artery disease who are completely revascularized.
