Spider naevus is dilation of preexisting central arterioles from which numerous thin-walled capillary branches radiate like spider legs, carrying away freely flowing blood. They form due to the failure of the sphincteric muscle surrounding a cutaneous arteriole leading to dilatation of central arteriole. The exact cause of spider angioma is not known. For decades, there have been many hypotheses of possible mechanisms that lead to the arteriolar vasodilation. Important among those are direct vasodilatory effects of alcohol, substance P, hyperestrogenism, and inadequate hepatic metabolism of steroid hormones. Angiogenesis as a possible mechanism in the pathogenesis of spider nevi has been proposed due to elevated serum vascular growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) levels in patients with liver cirrhosis. Sex hormone imbalance predominantly hyperestrogenism has also been implicated for the development spider naevi. This is also suggested by the occurrence of spider angioma in individuals with a hyperestrogenic state, like pregnancy.
