Azilsartan, commercially formulated as azilsartan medoxomil, is an angiotensin-receptor blocking (ARB) agent. The drug is also commercially available as a combination therapy with chlorthalidone. Azilsartan received FDA approval in 2011 as an antihypertensive agent.

In preclinical and clinical studies, azilsartan has been shown to reduce blood pressure levels more dramatically than its precursors valsartan and olmesartan and is theorized to lower mortality rates and the onset of cardiovascular disease.

In patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension, ARBs are effective in reducing blood pressure in addition to the other first-line agents.
