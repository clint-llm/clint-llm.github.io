The differential diagnosis for uremic pericarditis is broad. Pericarditis has manyÂ different etiologies, which must all be ruled out before diagnosing. Although uremic pericarditis is the most common form of pericarditis in end-stage renal disease and dialysis patients, others can also occur and warrant appropriate evaluation. These other causes include:

- Infectious (viral, bacterial, fungal)

- Inflammatory (systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, vasculitis)

- Metabolic (hypothyroidism)

- Neoplastic (primary or metastatic)

- Trauma (blunt or penetrating)

- Cardiac (postpericardiotomy syndrome, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection)

- Medication-induced (i.e., hydralazine, methyldopa, procainamide, minoxidil)
