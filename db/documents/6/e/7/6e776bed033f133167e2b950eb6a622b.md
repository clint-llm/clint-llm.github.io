The evaluation of a health professional with substance use or potential substance use disorder is a challenge. Health professionals may make efforts to hide or cover up their use and use of alcohol or drugs. Evaluation and diagnosis will be conducted by a clinician experienced in dealing with potentially difficult and challenging patients.

**DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Evaluating and Diagnosing a Substance Use Disorder**

A problematic pattern of use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress is manifested by two or more of the following within a 12-month period:

- Often take larger amounts or for a longer period than was intended.

- Persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control use.

- A great deal of time spent in activities necessary to obtain, use, or recover from the substance’s effects.

- Crave or have a strong desire or urge to use the substance.

- Recurrent use causing failure to fulfill primary role obligations at work, school, or home

- Continued use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by its effects.

- Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of use.

- Recurrent use in situations in which it is physically hazardous.

- Continued use despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem was likely caused or exacerbated by the substance.

- Tolerance

- Withdrawal

**Severity**

DSM-5 specifies mild, moderate, and severe based on the number of diagnostic criteria met by the patient at the time of diagnosis:

- Mild: 2 to 3 criteria

- Moderate: 4 to 5 criteria

- Severe: 6 or more criteria

**DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Evaluating and Diagnosing an Alcohol Use Disorder**

- Recurrent drinking, resulting in failure to fulfill role obligations

- Recurrent drinking in hazardous situations

- Continued drinking despite alcohol-related social or interpersonal problems

- Evidence of tolerance

- Evidence of alcohol withdrawal or use of alcohol for relief or avoidance of withdrawal

- Drinking in larger amounts or over longer periods than intended

- Persistent desire or unsuccessful attempts to stop or reduce drinking

- A great deal of time spent obtaining, using, or recovering from alcohol

- Important activities are given up or reduced because of drinking

- Continued drinking despite knowledge of physical or psychological problems caused by alcohol

- Alcohol craving

**Severity**: The severity of alcohol use disorder at the time of diagnosis can be specified as a subtype based on the number of symptoms present:

- Mild: Two to three symptoms

- Moderate: Four to five symptoms

- Severe: Six or more symptoms

**Laboratory Testing**

**Alcohol
**

Diagnosis of an alcohol problem can be made in the outpatient department by using the CAGE questionnaire, which includes the following: (need to) cut down, annoyance (on drinking), guilt (about drinking), an eye-opener.

Screening tools like The Ten question Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) and The abbreviated 3-question Audit-consumption (Audit-C) are recommended for screening.

**Laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis include:**

- Serum alcohol concentration

- Direct alcohol biomarkers: Ethyl glucuronide

- Liver enzymes – aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, and albumin to test for liver damage. An AST: ALT ratio of 2 to 1 is indicative of alcohol-induced liver disease.

- Hemoglobin, complete blood count – to determine the presence and severity of anemia, pancytopenia, and macrocytosis. A mean corpuscular volume greater than 100 fL constitutes macrocytosis. Pancytopenia and macrocytosis usually require very heavy prolonged use and often liver disease.

- Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) –  an indicator of excessive alcohol use when elevated. The reference range is 8 to 40 units/L (females) and 9 to 50 units/L (males).

- The patient's social network, especially family, should be involved in treatment to the extent possible (and agreed to by the patient, if a legally competent adult), provide additional history and therapeutic support, and help monitor the patient's progress and adherence to treatment.

**Substance Use Disorder**

- Drug of abuse screen

- Urine drug levels

- Blood drug levels

- Hair drug levels

- Saliva drug levels

- Breath drug levels
