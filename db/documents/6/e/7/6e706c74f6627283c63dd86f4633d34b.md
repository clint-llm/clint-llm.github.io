The pulmonary valve is the semilunar valve that separates the right ventricle from the pulmonary trunk. Anatomically, the annulus (ring-like connective tissue) of this valve delimits the right ventricle chamber at the junction of the pulmonary arterial trunk.

The pulmonary valve is separated from the tricuspid valve by a muscular fold, known as the ventriculoinfundibular fold. At its septal margin, the fold forms the supraventricular crest and this fold inserts between the anterior and posterior limbs of the septomarginal trabeculation. This same fold also forms the subpulmonary infundibulum of the right ventricular outlet.

Histologically, the pulmonary valve consists of stratified extracellular matrix compartments of four layers which are the arterialis, fibrosa, spongiosa, and the ventricularis layer. The arterialis faces the artery, and the ventricularis layer faces the ventricle.

The pulmonary valve opens at the systolic phase of the cardiac cycle enabling the deoxygenated blood to be pumped from the right ventricle to the pulmonary circulation. It closes at the diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle, allowing sufficient filling of the right ventricle. The pulmonary valve has a diameter of about 20 mm.
