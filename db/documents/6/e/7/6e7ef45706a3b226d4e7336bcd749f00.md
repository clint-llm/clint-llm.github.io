Many conditions can cause exudative retinal detachment. Choroidal pathologies like choroidal melanoma, choroidal lymphoma, choroidal hemangioma, choroidal osteoma, choroidal metastasis, leukemia including ALL (acute lymphoid leukemia), AML (acute myeloid leukemia), CLL (chronic myeloid leukemia), CML (chronic myeloid leukemia).

Miscellaneous causes like central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor-associated retinopathy, uveal effusion syndrome, paraneoplastic retinopathy including acute paraneoplastic polymorphous vitelliform maculopathy (AEPPVM) and bilateral diffuse uveal melanocytic proliferation (BDUMP).

The causes of exudative retinal detachment, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RD), and tractional RD are different. Thus exudative retinal detachment should be differentiated from rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RD) and tractional RD.

In hemorrhagic retinal detachment, there is subretinal blood compared to an exudative retinal detachment which is serous. Causes of hemorrhagic retinal detachment include peripheral exudative hemorrhagic chorioretinopathy (thought by many authors to be a variant of IPCV), trauma, leukemia, and age-related macular degeneration, specifically in patients on blood thinners.
