The triangle of auscultation is at the inferior angle of the scapula best exposed by instructing the patient to cross his arms over his chest and bending forward. It is bordered on three sides â€“ inferiorly by the latissimus dorsi muscle, superiorly by the inferior border of the trapezius, and laterally by the medial border of the scapula formed by the teres major muscle and infraspinatus muscle.

The triangle of auscultation is an important anatomical landmark that allows for better auscultation during the pulmonary examination.
