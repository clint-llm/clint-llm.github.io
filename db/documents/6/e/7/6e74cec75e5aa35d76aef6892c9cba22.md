Corneal imaging is widely used by ophthalmologists to understand the shape and curvature of the cornea. Corneal topography evaluates the anterior surface of the cornea and displays the information using a color-coded map. On the other hand, corneal tomography takes into account the thickness of the cornea, allowing the posterior surface of the cornea to be elucidated.
