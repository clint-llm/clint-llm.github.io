Adult T cell leukemia is clinically classified into four subgroups defined by the Shimoyama criteria: acute, chronic, lymphoma, and smoldering

- **Acute**subtype accounts for >50% of cases and presents with leukemic pictures, systemic symptoms, lymphadenopathy, organ infiltration, hypercalcemia, and high serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level.

- **Chronic**ATL is characterized by the presence of skin, lung and liver involvement, lymphocytosis (≥4 × 103 cells/μL) with normal LDH, and calcium. The chronic ATL has two subgroups: favorable and unfavorable. The unfavorable subgroup presents with at least one poor prognostic factor such as elevated LDH, elevated BUN, and decreased albumin

- The **lymphomatous**form is characterized by extensive lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, markedly increased LDH, hypercalcemia, and less than 1% presence of circulating leukemic cells in the peripheral blood.

- The **smoldering**form presents with lung or skin involvement, normal lymphocyte count, normal or mildly increased LDH.

All forms of ATL may demonstrate variable skin findings. Tumor lysis syndrome, as well as central nervous system involvement, may be seen in aggressive ATL. Due to severe immunosuppression, all ATL patients are at increased risk for infections, including fungal, viral, and parasitic infections, specifically strongyloidiasis.
