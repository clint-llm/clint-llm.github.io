The evaluation of age-related cognitive decline is limited by the lack of specific diagnostic tests, non-pathological changes in the brain, and difficulty in differentiating signs and symptoms from normal aging.

The diagnosis of MCI is based on subjective complaints, as mentioned earlier. At the initial visit, certain conditions must be investigated, such as polypharmacy, hypothyroidism, Vitamin B12 deficiency, hypo/hyperglycemia, sensory loss (hearing/vision), obstructive sleep apnea, and underlying infection.

After common medical conditions that could alter the mentation are ruled out, the proceeding step is to interview the patient, followed by an interview of family members and, if possible close friends.

A comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is a multidisciplinary and multimodal approach to evaluating a geriatric patient.

- History of presenting illness

- Medical history

- Current and previous medications

- Family history with an emphasis on cognitive issues

- Social history, including occupation, education level, living situation, substance use, and advanced care planning

- Physical examination

- Cognitive assessment

- Laboratory studies

- Review of imaging

- Interview family members

- Identifying other professionals involved in the patient’s care

Subsequently, the following core components must be investigated:

**Cognition**- The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) does not recommend screening for cognitive impairment in older patients due to a lack of evidence for harm and benefit.

There are many screening tests available, and they generally test 1 or more domains of cognition. The most commonly used screening tests are the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Mini-Cognitive Assessment (Mini-Cog).

Other tests are the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the clock drawing test (CDT), and the St. Louis University Mental Status Examination (SLUMS). One meta-analysis reveals that the sensitivity of MMSE, MoCA, and other screening tools is 75 to 92%, and the specificity is 81 to 91%.

Depending on the screening test used, the domains tested are language, executive function, abstract reasoning, attention and concentration, memory, and visuospatial skills.

Office staff can also be trained to administer these screening tests. It is important to note that not one test can diagnose dementia or MCI. A positive screen must be followed by a thorough investigation that must include screening for mental health, especially depression.

Mood and altered thought content can also negatively impact cognitive and memory performance. These tests can also keep track of cognitive impairment over time. The caregiver completes certain screening tests, such as the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in The Elderly (IQCODE) and Alzheimer Disease Caregiver Questionnaire (ADCQ).

Interviewing family members and close friends also increase the amount of data that can be used to assess the patient’s cognitive abilities, especially memory and personality changes.

**Functional ability**- There are two key allotments of functional ability. The first is activities of daily living (ADL) which includes self-care activities, such as dressing, ambulation and transfers, bathing, toileting, feeding, grooming, and controlling bladder function. The second allotment is instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) which includes activities that a patient performs for independent living, such as managing finances, taking medication, driving, cooking, shopping, housework, and answering the phone.

It is common to see dependency in IADLs than ADLs, and further loss of IADLs can impact independent living. However, impairment in ADLs can lead to a reduced quality of life and functional decline. It is no surprise that early intervention can reduce negative future outcomes. The standard screening tool for functional ability is the Katz ADL scale for ADLs and the Lawton IADL scale for IADLs.

**Falls, gait, and mobility assessment**- Falls are underreported to the clinicians by the elderly patients.

Gait should also be observed when the patient walks into the examination room by direct observation. The get-up and go-test evaluate a patient’s mobility and postural stability in addition to the gait. If the patient takes more than 12 seconds to complete the test, there is an increased risk of falls and functional decline. The office staff can also help the physician by administering this test. Direct observation is beneficial for identifying patients who might require assistive devices for ambulation and physical therapy for improving strength.

**Polypharmacy**- Certain medications can cause functional impairment in the elderly owing to their side effect profiles. The American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Beers Criteria lists certain medications that should be potentially avoided in older patients unless there is a specific indication for use.

Physicians should take the time to review the medication list of their patients, especially when there are multiple specialists involved in medical management. The use of anticholinergic medications, opiates, benzodiazepines, muscle relaxants, sleep medications, and tricyclic anti-depressants must be reevaluated regularly to prevent polypharmacy and avoid adverse outcomes.

Antihypertensive medications can also cause hypotension leading to falls. Other tools to address the appropriateness of prescriptions are the Screening Tool To Alert Doctors To The Right Treatment (START) and Screening Tool of Older Persons' Prescriptions (STOPP). It is important to consider the time to achieve the medical benefit, the patient’s ability to manage and take the medication, and overall treatment goals when addressing the relevance of a medication.

**Diet and nutrition**- It is vital to assess the patient's capacity to prepare their food, swallow, digest, and appetite level. Some objective measurements of nutrition include body mass index, height, and weight. Older individuals have reduced physiologic reserves, which puts them at increased risk for malnutrition, especially during an acute illness or hospitalization. One study showed that the body mass index under 23 kg/m² was associated with increased mortality.

Cognition, social, and financial factors must be taken into account for a patient who reports significant weight loss. It is equally important to assess for underlying medical issues and psychological causes. After a thorough investigation, a plan of care can be devised for the patient to address their nutrition status, and if needed, appetite stimulants can be considered if appropriate.

**Hearing -**Age-related hearing loss, also called presbycusis, is an important consideration when assessing an elderly patient as it can lead to poor performance on cognitive assessments, social isolation, misunderstanding, anxiety or depression, and cognitive fatigue from an assessment, increased effort from listening, and frailty.

The finger rub test whispered voice test, or an audiometric test can be used to assess for hearing impairment.

**Vision**- Age-related visual changes are expected in the geriatric population. Reduced vision can impact the quality of life and activities of daily living, which can further reduce the chances of independent living. With aging, the visual acuity under low illumination is reduced, leading to low spatial contrast sensitivity, reduced color discrimination, and poor adaptation to the dark.

Even though there is a lack of evidence for screening of vision loss by USPSTF and AAFP, vision testing can be done using a Snellen chart in the office. Some key aspects of visual assessment include testing the visual field, acuity, color and contrast discrimination, use of visual and non-visual cues, and patient’s assessment of lighting.

It is also essential to observe the patient for their ability to perform the ADLs and IADLs for comfort level, stressors, and safety. Adverse consequences of visual deficits include increased risk of falls, reduced accessibility, postural instability, and increased risk of an automobile collision.

**Screening for depression**- Normal aging does not include depression, and patients with depression have reduced function, poor appetite, sleep, and quality of life. They may also have multiple vague complaints, anxiety, preoccupation with finances, bodily function, and difficulty making decisions. Many studies have shown that depression affects cognitive impairment and memory, which is why any evaluation for them must have a screen for depression.

Depression is seen in almost 40% of elderly patients residing in nursing home settings, whereas it is seen between 4% and 9% of elderly patients living in a community.

**Urinary incontinence**- The incidence of urinary incontinence increase with age, and it does not come without repercussions. Some of them are urinary tract infections, decubitus ulcers, sepsis, and increased mortality.

A review of medications must also be performed to rule out any reversible causes. A screening questionnaire asking if the patient has lost control of their bladder in the last year and got wet, as well as asking if it has happened on more than six different days, is effective in identifying incontinence. It is also important to ask if the incontinence occurs with sneezing, coughing, or lifting. Other components of assessment include inquiry into previous urologic surgeries, fluid intake, and mobility.

**Socioenvironmental circumstances**- Understanding the social health of elderly patients is tied to their overall well-being. Social history involves assessing the informal needs of the patient at their place of residence, eligibility of care resources, support structure, community involvement, caregiver needs, exercise, and financial assessment.

Determining the most appropriate living arrangement is an important shared decision that usually occurs after home safety, injury risk, financial security, and caregiver support are well analyzed.

Caregivers should be screened for burnout, and if needed, alternative living arrangements and support group referrals should be made. Sexually transmitted infections and sexual activity are commonly missed on CGA. Similarly, sexual dysfunction and impotence also need to be discussed for potential treatment options.

Another important topic of inquiry is mistreatment. Elder abuse prevalence is about 10%, and women are more likely to be the victims of abuse than men. A shared living space with a spouse or adult children (the two most common abusers) is a risk factor, along with low income, isolation, and poor physical health.

Types of abuse include financial exploitation, physical, verbal, sexual, and neglect. There are many manifestations of abuse, such as the presence of abrasions, lacerations, fractures, subtle signs of intimidation by the caregiver, frequent urinary tract infections while in a living facility, failure to pay for medications or renew prescriptions, worsening of chronic medical conditions, presence of decubitus ulcers, signs of malnutrition, dehydration, and poor hygiene.

When abuse is suspected, the physician should seek support from law enforcement, social work, and protective services to report and intervene.

**Frailty**- Frailty is described as a state of reduced physiologic reserve that leads to a state of vulnerability to external stressors.

Frailty encompasses the physical, social, and cognitive aspects of the patient. The two common measures of frailty include frailty index and frailty phenotype. The five areas of assessment for frailty phenotype are weakness (grip strength lower than 20% at baseline), unintentional weight loss (>10 pounds in the prior year), poor endurance and energy (self-reported), slowness, and low physical activity.

The frailty index, which is a continuous scale based on the effect of functional, psychosocial, medical, and age-related deficits, can predict mortality better than the frailty phenotype.

Frailty can predict cognitive decline, and conversely, cognitive impairment can predict frailty.

**Advanced care planning (ACP)**- ACP is the process of identifying the patient’s goals and the extent of medical care in the future when the patient is unable to make a decision due to a serious illness. The key steps in the process are assessing the willingness of the patient, appointing surrogate decision-makers, articulating and documenting the patient’s values on medical care and quality of life, and translating those values and preferences into clinical management and treatment plans.
