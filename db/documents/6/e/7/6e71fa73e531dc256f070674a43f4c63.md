Typically, BDD is caused by group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus infection.

Group B streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, and more recently even methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have been reported as etiological agents.

The organisms tend to invade the skin through open wounds from insect bites, traumatic cuts, erosions, and burns or through abnormalities of skin appendages such as nails. The actual pathogenesis of the blister is not very clear. Streptococcus does not seem to cause the development of bullae, through a toxin-mediated or another indirect mechanism. S. aureus, however, does secrete toxins that can cause epidermal splitting. It should be noted that Streptococcus and S. aureus-associated BDD are clinically indistinguishable, and this makes the role of toxins in BDD uncertain.
