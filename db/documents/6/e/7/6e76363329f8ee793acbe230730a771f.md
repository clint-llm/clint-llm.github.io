Diagnosing avian influenza requires high clinical suspicion. In patients who present with viral syndromes and have risk factors such as recent live bird handling or poultry culling, there should be a high suspicion of the disease. Additional testing should evaluate for sequelae of avian influenza virus (AIV) infection, such as respiratory impairment and other organ dysfunction. As the disease can present as a severe respiratory illness, evaluation, and careful monitoring of a patient’s respiratory status should be undertaken for any patient with suspected or confirmed AIV infection. Respiratory intervention may include anywhere from supplemental oxygen to mechanical ventilation to ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) in the most severe cases.

Rapid antigen testing for AIV does exist but is often falsely negative in confirmed cases. The preferred source of a sample for testing is a nasopharyngeal swab or aspirate, but other body fluids are usable if the nasopharyngeal swab or aspirate is not available.
