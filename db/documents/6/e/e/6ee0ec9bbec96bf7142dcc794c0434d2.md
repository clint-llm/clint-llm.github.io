The straight leg raise test is performed with the patient in a supine position. The examiner gently raises the patient's leg by flexing the hip with the knee in extension, and the test is considered positive when the patient experiences pain along the lower limb in the same distribution of the lower radicular nerve roots (usually L5 or S1).

Furthermore, a positive straight leg raise test is determined when pain is elicited by lower limb flexion at an angle lower than 45 degrees. Patients usually request that the examiner abort the maneuver during the test if the pain is reproduced during the leg straightening. The buttock pain is usually relieved by flexing the patient's knee (Figure 1).

Additional maneuvers have been described to enhance the test's sensitivity, such as the Bragaad sign, which consists of concomitant foot dorsiflexion to increase the pain while the examiner completes the leg raise.

An additional maneuver is the crossed straight leg test (crossed over Lasegue), in which the examiner passively flexes the patient's uninvolved limb while maintaining the knee in extension. A positive test is when the patient reports pain in the involved limb at 40 degrees of hip flexion with the uninvolved limb. A crossed straight test is positiveÂ with central disc herniation in cases of severe nerve root irritation.
