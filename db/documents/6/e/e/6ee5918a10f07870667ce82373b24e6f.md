The palmar grasp reflex is a primitive, prehensile, involuntary response to a mechanical stimulus present in a newborn. It appears around 16 weeks of gestation and can be elicited in preterm infants as young as 25 weeks of postconceptional age.

To elicit the reflex, the infant is laid in a symmetrical supine and comfortable position while he or she is awake.

The higher brain centers regulate the palmar grasp, though it is a spinal reflex. The afferent nerve fibers include the ulnar and median sensory nerves that supply the palmar surface. The spinal relay center is in the cervical spinal cord, and the efferent nerve fibers have the motor nerves that supply the hand's flexors and adductors.
