- It is essential to complete the ATLS primary survey to identify and manage any life-threatening injury. This is followed by the secondary survey, including examining the affected limb.

- The examination should include the soft tissue assessment and neurovascular status.

- Ankle fracture-dislocation requires urgent manipulation to restore the ankle mortise.

- The appropriate imaging should be obtained to help the diagnosis and management.

- Always assess the neurovascular status of the ankle before and after reduction and splinting.

- There may be accessory ossicles in the joint due to anatomical variants that can be confused for an avulsion fracture in a trauma.
