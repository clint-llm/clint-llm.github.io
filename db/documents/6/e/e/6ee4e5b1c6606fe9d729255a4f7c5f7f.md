Our skin serves many functions - including protective, sensory, temperature regulation, and fluid homeostasis. The outermost layer, the epidermis, is primarily involved in protective functions both as a physical and an immunologic barrier. These functions can all be correlated histologically, and derangements of these functions have clinical ramifications. This article will cover the structure and function of the normal epidermis. It will also briefly describe tissue preparation, immunohistochemistry, light microscopy, and electron microscopy. Lastly, it will describe some pathologies and select clinical and histologic correlations.
