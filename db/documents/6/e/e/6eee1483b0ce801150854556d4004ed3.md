**Holoprosencephaly**

Failure of the forebrain to separate into the left and right hemisphere will result in holoprosencephaly. There are different degrees of severity of holoprosencephaly, from incomplete separation to no separation of the hemispheres. Moderate holoprosencephaly can present with cleft lip and palate. The severe form may present with cyclopia. Holoprosencephaly can be seen in trisomy 13 and can also be present in other chromosomal abnormality as well.

**Anencephaly**

Failure of the rostral neural tube to form results in anencephaly, a congenital defect where the brain, scalp, and skull do not form. An infantÂ with anencephaly is mostly stillborn, and those that do survive dies within hours or weeks.

**Lissencephaly**

Lissencephaly is a disorder where the brain fails to form folds resulting in a lack of sulci and gyri.
