Using fluoroscopy, the clinician can confirm and document the precise locations of the injections. Lucas et al. did a prospective study where patients underwent fluoroscopic guided injections in the foot and ankle and found that it improved clinical confidence with diagnosis and could help determine subsequent treatment.

In another retrospective review study, intraarticular fluoroscopic injections were done in patients to help identify a source of pain before surgery. This helped the treating physician identify the source of pain and lead to good arthrodesis outcomes in the majority of their patients.
