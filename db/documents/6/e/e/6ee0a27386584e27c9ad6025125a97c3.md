The causes of acute myocarditis are broadly classified into infectious and non-infectious categories. In most cases (50%), no cause can be identified (idiopathic). The most implicated etiology in patients with an identified cause is a viral infection.

**Infectious Causes**

- Virus: Coxsackie and echoviruses are the most common cardiotropic viruses causing myocarditis. Other viral pathogens include the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), adenovirus, hepatitis B and C, Parvovirus B19, poliovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, etc.

- Bacteria: Bacteria notorious for causing myocarditis include legionella, staphylococci, Salmonella, Shigella, streptococci, Clostridium, tuberculosis, etc.

- Parasites: Trichinosis, schistosomiasis.

- Protozoa: Trypanosoma cruzi (causative agent of Chagas disease) and Toxoplasmosis gondii.

- Spirochetes: Borrelia burgdorferi.

**Non-infectious Causes**

Include a variety of causes such as eosinophilic myocarditis, collagen vascular diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis, and dermatomyositis, cardiotoxic drugs, systemic diseases such as sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel diseases, or giant cell arteritis, acute rheumatic fever, venoms and chemicals such as hydrocarbons and cellular rejection after a cardiac transplant.
