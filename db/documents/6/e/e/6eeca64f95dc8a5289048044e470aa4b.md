Risk factors for perineal lacerations include nulliparity, operative vaginal delivery, midline episiotomy, Asian race, and increased fetal weight.

An episiotomy is a surgical procedure performed at the bedside during the second stage of labor which causes enlargement of the posterior vagina.

The two most common types of episiotomies are midline and mediolateral.

There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of episiotomy.Â  Both the World Health Organization and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists recommended restricted use of episiotomy.
