Cutaneous findings vary widely, but the most dramatic features occur in OCA1A due to complete lack of melanin.  The white hair, white eyelashes, white skin, and pink eyes are typical of what the general populations consider an albino.  Some darkening over time from shampoos and water minerals may occur but spares the eyelashes and eyebrows.  Every other form of albinism has some residual pigmentation that can increase with time, mostly through pheomelanin.  For this reason, comparison with family members may be vital in raising the clinical suspicion of albinism, especially if ocular manifestations are mild. Relative hypopigmentation in Caucasian families is more difficult to appreciate than in families with more pigment.

Ocular findings are the more debilitating clinical feature due to its effect on vision; they can be divided into refractive and nonrefractive errors.

- Photophobia (light sensitivity or the perception of light as brighter than it is) or photodysphoria (discomfort in bright light or extreme photophobia)

- Refractive errors (astigmatism 73%, myopia 24%, hyperopia 3% frequency by one study)

- Foveal hypoplasia on dilated eye exam (lack of foveal reflex)

- Involuntary pulsatile horizontal nystagmus: Usually beginning 1.5 to two months after birth when visual acuity starts to sharpen; almost all children develop it by 4 months of age; gradually diminishes in amplitude with age. Postural head changes (such as side gazing) and convergence (like when looking at things very close to the face) damps the nystagmus, and these compensatory maneuvers improve vision and may be some of the earliest indicators of visual deficits. Nystagmus is exacerbated with fatigue, physiological (illness, pain) or psychic stress (anger, anxiety), and monocular vision (covering one eye).

- Strabismus: Misaligned eyes or disconjugate gaze due to misrouted optic nerve fibers at the chiasm, for example, exotropia, esotropia, vertical misalignment

- Reduced stereopsis (fine depth perception) and binocular vision due to strabismus

- Reduced iris pigmentation (variable from pink, to light blue, green, gray, or light brown)

- Iris transillumination (“pink irides” with spoke wheel appearance) in ambient light or on slit lamp examination as light reflects off the retina and back through the iris

- Yellow or orange retina due to hypomelanosis of retinal epithelium, it loses its normal red appearance and has prominent choroidal vessels

- Selective visual evoked potential (VEP) confirm that retinostriate nerve fibers have excessively crossed as they have been misrouted to the occiput at the optic chiasm. Regular VEP will not demonstrate this; only the selective VEP, however, this is usually not necessary since strabismus implies misrouted optic nerve. Normal optic nerve routing, as demonstrated on a selective VEP, rule out OCA.

The most common phenotypes of each of the forms of albinism, including visual deficit ranges, are included below:

- OCA1

- Type A has a complete absence of melanin. Subjects have white skin and white hair. Irides are light colored, pink or red (in ambient light) with (+) nystagmus, (+) foveal hypoplasia, (+) iris transillumination, and (+) photophobia. Visual acuity 20/100 to 20/400
- Type B (aka, “yellow OCA”) has some residual TYR function. Subjects are initially identical to type A, but by age 3 will show some melanization of skin (cream to tan with light nevi and freckles) and hair (from yellow to light brown). Irides are blue, green, hazel, or light brown. Visual acuity ranges from 20/100 to 20/200.

- OCA2

- Classic OCA2: Skin is creamy white (not stark white like in OCA1) or tan skin, frequently with nevi and freckles. Hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes are yellow, blond, or light brown. Irides are blue, hazel, brown or gray. Visual acuity ranges from 20/25 to 20/200, usually 20/60 to 20/100. 
- Brown OCA2: Subjects appear normal with brown skin, hair, and eyes, but are relatively hypopigmented compared to family members
- Red OCA2: This variant occurs with a concomitant MC1R gene mutation. Subjects have light-colored eyes and vision problems; however, they typically have red hair.

- OCA3: This condition, however, mostly affects dark-skinned individuals where it may be brown or “rufous” OCA.  The latter is characterized by reddish brown (copper) skin, red or reddish yellow (ginger) hair, hazel or light brown irides, and sometimes undetectable visual impairment.

- OCA4: Similar to classic OCA2 because of pheomelanin predominance. Skin is cream colored to tan to normal. Hair is never stark white; it may be silvery white to light blond to yellow to very light brown.  Skin and hair color are usually correlated. Irides are blue, hazel to light brown. Visual acuity ranges from 20/30 to 20/400; usually 20/100 to 20/200.

- OCA5: Subjects have white skin and golden hair. (+) nystagmus, (+) foveal hypoplasia, (+) photophobia, (+) impaired visual acuity

- OCA6: Similar to OCA4 because of similar gene product function. Subjects have white skin and light hair that darkens with age. Irides are brown with (+) mild nystagmus, (+) foveal hypoplasia, (+) mild photophobia. Visual acuity is 20/100.

- OCA7: Skin coloration is lighter only when compared to relatives. Hair is light blond to dark brown. (+) Nystagmus, (+) foveal hypoplasia, (+) iris transillumination. Visual acuity ranges from 20/30 to 20/400.

- Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS): Subjects have white to olive skin.  Hair is white to brown. Irides are hypopigmented with (+) nystagmus, (+) foveal hypoplasia, and (+) iris transillumination. Visual acuity ranges from 20/50 to 20/400. Subjects also have mild to moderate bleeding due to platelet dysfunction and some lung or kidney abnormalities due to ceroid deposition.  Two subtypes have immunodeficiency (with recurrent infections) and hemophagocytic syndrome. Other types develop pulmonary fibrosis by the thirties and granulomatous colitis.

- Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS): Subjects have partial OCA (hypopigmented skin, gray or silver-sheen hair, nystagmus, foveal hypoplasia, photophobia). All subjects exhibit increased susceptibility to pyogenic infections, neutropenia, peripheral neuropathy, mild coagulopathy.

- Angelman syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS): Subjects have hypopigmented skin and hair relative to other family members. Ocular features (nystagmus, foveal hypoplasia) are usually absent or mild but, when present, are associated with the OCA2 pathogenic variant on the non-deleted chromosome.

- AS: characteristic facies, short stature, mental retardation, spastic gait, stiff arm movements, an inappropriate outburst of laughter
- PWS: poor muscle tone, short stature, small hands and feet, mental retardation, hyperphagia resulting in obesity and type 2 diabetes

- Ocular albinism (OA1): Hypopigmentation is limited to the eye, with perhaps slightly paler skin and eyes only when compared to other family members. (+) nystagmus, (+) foveal hypoplasia, (+) photophobia. Visual acuity ranges from 20/100 to 20/200. Females rarely have some nystagmus and low vision. Because 90% of female carriers have X-inactivation, they possess pigmentary mosaicism in the retina, which helps to make the diagnosis in the affected male children and distinguish OA1 from OCA2 in lighter skinned families.
