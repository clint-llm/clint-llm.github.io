- Renal vein thrombosis (RVT), the presence of thrombus in the major renal veins or its tributaries, is a rare clinical entity.

- Males are affected more commonly than females with no racial predilection.

- Clinical manifestations vary by the rapidity of the venous occlusion.

- The most common etiology is nephrotic syndrome, though can be seen with primary hypercoagulability disorders, malignant renal tumors, infections, trauma, or as a post-renal transplant complication.

- CT angiography is almost 100% sensitive and specific to diagnose RVT.

- Anticoagulation is provided to prevent complications such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.

- RVT carries a favorable prognosis though outcomes depend on the underlying etiology.
