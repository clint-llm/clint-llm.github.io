The Society of Nuclear Medicine & Molecular Imaging (SNMMI) and the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) has endorsed protocols for various nuclear medicine studies. In SPECT brain death examinations with Tc99m-HMPAO or Tc99m-ECD, the SNMMI endorses taking dynamic images during radiotracer injection followed by anterior and lateral planar images of the brain after 20 minutes.

If a non-brain-binding radiopharmaceutical is utilized, such as Tc99m-diethylenetriamine pentaacetate (Tc99m-DTPA), the SNMMI endorses taking anterior, right lateral, left lateral, and posterior planar images until radiotracer counts are 500,000 to 1,000,000 per image.

Dynamic images are also obtained during radiotracer injection if non-brain-binding radiopharmaceuticals are utilized. Three dimensional SPECT images may also be obtained in the case of Tc99m-HMPAO and Tc99m-ECD to help differentiate radiotracer activity within the brain from radiotracer activity in the scalp.

In addition, both the SNMMI and EANM have endorsed a set of general guidelines for using Tc99m radiopharmaceuticals in cerebral perfusion imaging related to patient preparation and post-image processing.

Outside of brain death examinations, no specific protocols for cerebral perfusion imaging have been endorsed by the SNMMI or EANM. Protocols for SPECT and PET cerebral perfusion, which are not performed for brain death, vary but generally include taking dynamic images during radiotracer injection followed by SPECT images at the expected time of peak radiotracer activity.
