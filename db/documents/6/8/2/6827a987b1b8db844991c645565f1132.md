Compliance with lifestyle modification and pharmacologic treatment and control of precipitating factors (like hypertension and arrhythmias)Â are crucial to prevent hospitalizations for heart failure exacerbation and improve the quality of life. Many of those precipitating factors are potentially under patient control. That is why patient education is an integral part of a multidisciplinary approach to decrease mortality and morbidity due to heart failure.
