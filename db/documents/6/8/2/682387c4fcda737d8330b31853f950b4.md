The severity of lid wiper epitheliopathy can be accurately graded through objective measurement (Korb et al grading protocol) and subjective photographic scales.

While the Korb scale is objective, it requires accurate measurements in 2 dimensions and 3 steps to determine a final LWE Severity Grade. A subsequent method was developed by Lievens et al called the Photographic Lid Wiper Epitheliopathy (PLWE) scale. This method requires comparison to 4 standard photos with grade 0 through 3 lissamine green staining on the mucocutaneous junction of the superior tarsal conjunctiva.
