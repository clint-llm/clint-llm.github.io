Ebstein anomaly is a rare congenital heart defect with no apparent cause. Mild forms are asymptomatic. It can present as early as in fetal life and as late as early adulthood. Disease severity varies across a broad spectrum from newborns who do not survive beyond infancy to asymptomatic adults diagnosed incidentally in the sixth and seventh decades of life.
