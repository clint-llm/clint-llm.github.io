Children with ECC may experience significant pain, which makes eating and sometimes talking difficult, and a physical developmental delay will be seen due to poor nutrition.Â A study showed that children with early childhood caries were significantly shorter and lighter than controls without caries.

Because of the altered appearance of their teeth, children with ECC can become socially and psychologically affected, leading to decreased school performance.

Often, these children come from low-income families who lack access to healthcare, and the condition worsens. With time caries can progress to pulpitis and severe dental abscesses impairing erythropoiesis by affecting inflammation-induced metabolic pathways, causing chronic anemia and growth retardation.

ECC poses further health issues in children with special needs. In severe cases, it serves as a potential nidus of streptococcal infection, which can cause potentially lethal endocarditis if it spreads to a defective heart valve. It could also spread to other organs causing fever, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection.
