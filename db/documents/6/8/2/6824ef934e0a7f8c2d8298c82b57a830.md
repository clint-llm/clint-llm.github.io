Treatment varies greatly depending on the involved organs. If the disease is isolated, observation alone may be appropriate. Surgical removal of an isolated area is also a treatment option. Isolated skin lesions may resolve on their own, especially if they present in infancy (congenital self-healing reticulohistiocytosis), or may be treated with topical steroids, oral methotrexate, or thalidomide. Chemotherapy and radiation may be used for more systemic involved cases. There are several different chemotherapy protocols that have been used; currently, protocols are using prednisone and vinblastine, though other regimen options include vincristine, cytosine arabinoside, prednisone, cladribine, or pamidronate.

Late complications are common; therefore, follow up with oncology is crucial. Complications include diabetes insipidus, growth failure, delayed puberty, tooth loss, mandibular bone loss, hearing loss, secondary cancers, neurologic/cerebellar effects, liver disease, and pulmonary fibrosis.
