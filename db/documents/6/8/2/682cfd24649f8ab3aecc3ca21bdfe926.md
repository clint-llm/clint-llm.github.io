Different epithelial cell types are present by 12 weeks and are resembling adult cells of the intestine by 22 weeks.

Enteric nervous system development, as well as that of other cells in the gut, is regulated by different factors, including the sonic hedgehog and Indian hedgehog, bone morphogenetic protein, Wnt signaling, and platelet-derived growth factor. The hedgehog signaling is vital for early left and right patterning, along with villi formation. The bone morphogenetic protein is essential for dorsal-ventral patterning. Wnt signaling is involved in anterior-posterior signaling, villi formation, and epithelial stem cell proliferation in the intestines. PDGF plays a significant role in smooth muscle differentiation.

These signaling pathways are essential for the cell systems to develop and integrate for GI function.
