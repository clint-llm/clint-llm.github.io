The stellate cells are thought to be the source of collagen in pathological conditions. Chronic liver injury activates hepatic stellate cells, which are activated and transformed into a myofibroblast-like phenotype. They then lay down the extracellular matrix. Chronic inflammation, cytokine production by damaged parenchymal cells, and disruption of the extracellular matrix are well-characterized stimuli to stellate cells.

The etiology affects the patterns of liver fibrosis. Chronic hepatotropic virus infection causes portal expansion followed by periportal fibrosis, septal (bridging) fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Alcoholic liver disease and adult non-alcoholic fatty liver disease cause fibrosis, starting with a centrilobular perivenular distribution and sinusoidal fibrosis. Pediatric fatty liver disease is similar to hepatotropic virus infection with a periportal distribution. Perisinusoidal or perivenular fibrosis is usually not apparent.

Biliary tract disease cirrhosis is characterized by feathery degeneration of periseptal hepatocyte leasing to the presence of prominent “halos” and irregular-shaped nodules (“jigsaw” micronodular pattern). Fibrosis progressively links the adjacent central veins and portal tracts in venous outflow obstruction, resulting inveno-portal cirrhosis or veno-centric (“reversed lobulation” cirrhosis).
