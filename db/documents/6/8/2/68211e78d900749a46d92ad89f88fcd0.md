The location of the tumor determines the presenting symptoms and signs.

**Loss of Vision**

Children will often not complain of loss of vision. Overall, 85% of patients with glioma will lose some vision, and over time, approximately 25% will retain vision between 20/20 and 20/40. About 60% of patients will develop vision worse than 20/300. Patients may have an afferent pupillary defect, and where visual field assessment is possible, there may be visual field defects. Optic nerve atrophy (seen in 60% of patients upon fundoscopic examination) and optic disc edema (seen in 50% of intraorbital tumors) may be seen. Patients with chiasmal tumors will show optic nerve edema in 20% of cases, and these will have associated orbital optic nerve involvement.

**Proptosis**

Proptosis is seen in 95% of patients presenting with glioma is the commonest presenting sign. It is commonly seen with optic nerve gliomas but less so when the tumor is confined to the optic chiasm (seen in less than 20% of patients). When proptosis is seen in patients with optic chiasm glioma, there is almost always concomitant involvement of the optic nerve.

Limitation of ocular motility: seen infrequently with optic nerve gliomas. Limitation of ocular motility may be seen in 30% of optic nerve gliomas confined to the orbit and 20% of patients where the chiasm is involved.

**Headache/Pain**

The most common presenting symptom of OPG is headache, although it is only found in about 30% of patients, mostly in chiasmal involvement.

Other symptoms and signs include nystagmus, spasmus nutans, convulsions, nausea, dizziness, strabismus, developmental regression, and growth retardation. Hydrocephalus may develop when the tumor spreads from the chiasm. These patients may also develop hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction with precocious puberty, growth hormone deficiency, and deficiency of gonadotropin, TSH, and ACTH.

In summary, the optic pathway gliomas present with:

- Early vision loss 88%

- Optic disc swelling 35%

- Optic nerve head atrophy 59%

- Proptosis in orbital tumors 94%

- Proptosis in chiasmal tumors 22%

- Nystagmus 24%

- Hypothalamic signs 26%

- Increased intracranial pressure 27%
