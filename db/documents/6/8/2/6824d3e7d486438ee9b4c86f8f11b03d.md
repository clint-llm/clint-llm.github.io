Because fluorescein administration is for diagnostic purposes, its use is most commonly by specialists, especially ophthalmologists and surgeons, as well as optometrists, but it is also used by general practitioners, including physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. Nurses and/or medical assistants may also assess the proper dosage for the desired procedure. Not all health professionals readily operate with a fluorescent agent. Nurses can assist in the procedure via preparation, monitoring for adverse effects, and post-procedural care. Interprofessional coordination between the various members of the healthcare team will result in optimal results when using fluorescein for diagnostic purposes, which in turn can lead to appropriate therapeutic intervention and improved patient outcomes.
