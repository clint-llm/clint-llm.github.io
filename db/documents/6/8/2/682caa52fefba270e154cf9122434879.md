**Idiopathic Acute eosinophilic pneumonia-**is usually a diagnosis of exclusion.

- Eosinophilia on BAL (>25% eosinophils)

- Marked leukocytosis, but blood eosinophilia is initially not common

- Serum IgE may be moderately elevated

- Pulmonary function tests reveal restrictive ventilatory defect with reduced DLCO

- Nonspecific chest radiographs with subtle ground-glass opacities - bilateral diffuse mixed ground-glass opacities develop as the disease progresses

- Small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions are common

- CT scan confirms the diagnosis but usually not required

- Fluid analysis- High pH and marked eosinophilia

**Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia**- the diagnosis is based on clinical, radiographic, and BAL findings and on the inability to document pulmonary or systemic infection.

- Marked eosinophilia on bronchoalveolar lavage, typically accounting for more than 40 percent of white blood cells

- Moderate leukocytosis with peripheral blood eosinophilia in most patients

- Serum IgE levels elevation is a feature in half of the patients

- Moderate normocytic, normochromic anemia with thrombocytosis is present.

- ESR is typically elevated

- Pulmonary function tests depend on the severity of the disease; it may be restrictive, obstructive, or normal.

- Peripheral infiltrates on chest radiographs. Infiltrates are mostly bilateral, located in mid and upper lung zones.
