Aprepitant is a medication used to manage and treat chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). It is in the neurokinin-1 antagonist class of medications. This activity outlines and reviews the indications, actions, and contraindications for aprepitant as a valuable agent in preventing and managing CINV and PONV. This activity will also highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the healthcare team in the management of patients either receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy or general anesthesia.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of the aprepitant.
- Describe the adverse effects of aprepitant.
- Summarize appropriate monitoring of aprepitant.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination using aprepitant to improve outcomes.
