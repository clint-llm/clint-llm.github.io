HbS polymerization is the key pathophysiological event, and it occurs during cellular or tissue hypoxia, oxidative stress, or dehydration. The mutated beta-globin chains of the HbS molecule tend to form a tetramer resulting in the change in the shape of red blood cell (RBC) to a crescent or sickle, with increased rigidity. Local oxygen tension, acidosis, and hyperosmolarity are some factors that influence the tetramerization. Repeated cycles of tetramer formation make the sickle RBCs exhibit high adhesion to the activated endothelium resulting in increased microvascular transit time, leading to further sickling. The whole process ultimately results in the early destruction of the RBCs and frequent, widespread vaso-occlusive episodes with consequent acute and chronic organ damage.

The main cause of disease severity is the rate and degree of HbS tetramerization, which leads to 2 major pathophysiologic events:

- Vaso-occlusion with ischemia-reperfusion injury

- Hemolytic anemia

The renal complications in sickle cell disease originate from the occluded vessels (vasa recta) in the renal medulla, given the low partial pressure of oxygen (10 to 35 mm Hg), acidosis, and high osmolarity, which predisposes to hemoglobin S tetramerization and subsequent sickling of the erythrocytes. Repeated cycles of sickling and sludging lead to microinfarcts and ischemic injury giving rise to chronic microvascular disease which is seen in patients with SCN.

- Hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1A) and its activation

- Expression of endothelin-1

- Reduced nitric oxide promoting increased reactive oxygen species and vasoconstriction

Hyperfiltration injury from a paradoxical increase in the total RBF and GFR in renal medulla ultimately results in proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis, which together with tubulointerstitial fibrosis leads to progressive CKD,

Possible mechanisms for glomerular abnormalities in HbSS patients include:

- The fragmented RBCs in glomerular capillaries activate the mesangial cells, which promote matrix proteins synthesis and migration into the peripheral capillary wall, resulting in GBM reduplication

- Glomerular deposition of immune complexes comprising renal tubular epithelial antigen and specific antibody to renal tubular epithelial antigen, which mediate the glomerulonephritis
