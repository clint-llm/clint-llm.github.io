Symptoms of anxiety or abnormalities in gait are often first notified by nurses. It can be very beneficial for them to know when biofeedback is beneficial and when it may be offered as a supplemental treatment. There are many indications where biofeedback can help in the care of a patient, so nurses should be aware of presenting symptoms and consider its use. In some states, certain providers such as psychologists may not be able to physically touch their patients to apply sensors and may require a health care provider such as a nurse to act as a chaperone or apply the sensors. Nurses can also provide education to patients about their current medical condition. For instance, a patient with urinary incontinence may receive information from nurses about reducing accidents by having scheduled voiding times.
