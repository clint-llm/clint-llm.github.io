**Treatment of Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia**

Phototherapy and exchange transfusion are the mainstay of treatment for patients with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

**Phototherapy**

Phototherapy (PT) remains the first-line treatment for managing pathological unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. PT is very effective in reducing TSB to safe levels and reduces the risk of bilirubin toxicity and the need for exchange transfusion. Phototherapy is started based on risk factors and the TSB levels on the bilirubin nomogram.

Bilirubin absorbs light optimally in the blue-green range (460 to 490 nm). PT works by inducing bilirubin photoisomerization and converting bilirubin into lumirubin, which is the rate-limiting step for bilirubin excretion.

Few studies have also reported an increased incidence of solid organ tumors and non-lymphocytic leukemias in children treated with phototherapy.

**Exchange Transfusion**

Exchange transfusion (ET), the first successful treatment ever used for jaundice, is currently the second-line treatment for severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

**Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG)**

IVIG is used when immune-mediated hemolysis is the cause of UHB jaundice and prevents RBC hemolysis by coating Fc receptors on RBCs.The AAP recommends IVIG infusion in immune-mediated hemolysis if TSB remains within 2 to 3 mg/dl of exchange level despite intensive phototherapy.

**Treatment of Conjugated Hyperbilirubinemia**

Treatment of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is tailored to the specific etiology. Patients diagnosed with biliary atresia require a Kasai operation (hepatic portoenterostomy) preferably within two months of life for best outcomes.
