There are few known cases of overdose with levetiracetam in clinical trials. Drowsiness, somnolence, agitation, respiratory depression, and coma have been observed with levetiracetam overdose. There is no antidote for levetiracetam. General supportive measures, airway protection, and monitoring of vital signs are done on overdose patients. Clinicians should contact poison control. Hemodialysis may be needed in patients with significant renal impairment. A four-hour hemodialysis session can remove almost 50% of the drug.
