Cholera is a well-known disease caused by intestinal infection with the toxin-producing bacteria Vibrio cholerae. This potentially fatal diarrheal disease results in large volumes of watery stool, causing rapid dehydration that can progress to hypovolemic shock and metabolic acidosis. The case-fatality ratio is up to half in vulnerable groups during outbreaks but can be under 1% if properly treated.V. cholerae have reached the pandemic level 7 times. Unlike many other infectious diseases, cholera continues to be a worldwide public health concern. Today, cholera persists in regions of the world with unsatisfactory hygienic conditions and regions afflicted by natural disasters and/or humanitarian crises. Research has led to the development of oral rehydration therapy, antibiotic treatment, and new oral vaccines that have saved millions of lives.
