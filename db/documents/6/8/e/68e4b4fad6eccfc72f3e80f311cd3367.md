Murmurs are the most common reason for pediatric cardiologist referral and evaluation. There are reports that up to 72% of children will have a murmur at some point during childhood and adolescence, and of these, some may stay present until adulthood, while others will resolve with time. This activity explains the proper evaluation and management of pediatric murmurs and reviews the most common benign murmurs found in pediatric patients. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for pediatric patients with murmurs.

**Objectives:**
- Review the physical exam findings associated with benign pediatric murmurs. 
- Identify which pediatric murmurs require subspecialty referral and work-up.
- Review the most common benign murmurs found in pediatric patients. 
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric murmurs and improve patient outcomes.
