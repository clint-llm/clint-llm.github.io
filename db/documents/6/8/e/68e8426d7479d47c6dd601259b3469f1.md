# Continuing Education Activity

Pembrolizumab is a medication used in the management and treatment of various oncologic conditions. It is in the cancer immunotherapy class of drugs. This activity will highlight pembrolizumab's mechanism of action, indications, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., non-approved indications currently in clinical trials, administration, dosing, monitoring, and relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with advanced cancers.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for pembrolizumab.
- Summarize the mechanism of action pembrolizumab.
- Explain the importance of monitoring for patients on pembrolizumab, including immune-mediated adverse events.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team when dosing and monitoring pembrolizumab immunotherapy to improve patient outcomes with advanced cancers.

# Indications

Pembrolizumab is an FDA-approved monoclonal antibody directed against programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and sold in the US. It initially received FDA accelerated approval for refractory, advanced melanoma in September 2014. Subsequently, it has received approval for the treatment of many other oncologic conditions, and many more are currently in clinical development.

# Mechanism of Action

Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG4 kappa antibody directed against human cell surface PD-1 (programmed death receptor-1) on lymphocytes. The PD-1 receptor provides an important “immune checkpoint,” which helps prevent the immune system from attacking itself.

# Administration

Pembrolizumab is FDA-approved for intravenous use. It comes in either a 50 mg lyophilized powder for reconstitution or a 25 mg/mL solution.  The most common administration schedule is a 200 mg infusion given over 30 minutes every three weeks. Most monoclonal antibodies are dosed based on body size; however, studies have shown that pembrolizumab fixed-dosing provides adequate coverage and yields the advantage of reduced dosage errors, convenience, and less waste (for an expensive therapy).

# Adverse Effects

Clinically significant adverse reactions include:

- Immune-mediated skin adverse reactions (exfoliative dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis)

- Immune-mediated endocrinopathies (thyroid disorders, type 1 diabetes, hypophysitis)

- Immune-mediated colitis

- Immune-mediated pneumonitis

- Immune-mediated hepatotoxicity/hepatitis

- Immune-mediated renal dysfunction and nephritis

- Infusion-related reactions (anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity)

- Other immune-mediated adverse reactions (Guillain-Barre syndrome, uveitis, myasthenia gravis, pancreatitis, sarcoidosis, vasculitis, hemolytic anemia, arthritis, myositis, and encephalitis)

Common Side effects that occurred in over 10% of clinical trial participants include:

- Nervous system (headache)

- Musculoskeletal (back pain, arthralgia)

- Skin (vitiligo, rash, pruritus)

- Metabolism (decreased appetite, weight loss, hyponatremia)

- Respiratory (cough, dyspnea)

- General (fatigue, pyrexia, asthenia, influenza-like illness, peripheral edema

- Gastrointestinal (diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting)

- Endocrine (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism)

- Infections (pneumonia, urinary tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection)

- Cardiac (arrhythmias)

- Blood/lymphatic (anemia)

- Hepatobiliary (hepatoxicity, elevated liver function tests)

- Renal and urinary (hematuria, increase blood creatinine)

# Contraindications

There are no contraindications for pembrolizumab.

Limitations of use:

- Pembrolizumab is not recommended in PMBCL (primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma) patients who require urgent cytoreductive therapy.

- Pembrolizumab’s safety and effectiveness in MSI-H central nervous system pediatric cancer have not been established as this population met the exclusion criteria from clinical trials.

# Monitoring

- Monitor for signs and symptoms of colitis, pneumonitis, hypophysitis, and suspected severe skin reactions.

- Monitor for renal function changes as a sign of immune-mediated nephritis.

- Monitor for liver function changes as a sign of immune-mediated hepatitis.

- Monitor for thyroid function changes as a sign of a thyroid disorder.

- Monitor for infusion reactions such as chills, fever, flushing, hypotension, hypoxemia, pruritis, rash, rigors, and wheezing. While checkpoint inhibitors have lower rates of infusion reaction than other monoclonal antibodies, it is still important to monitor.

- Monitor for hyperglycemia as a sign of type-1 diabetics.

- Monitor for hepatic function changes when given in combination with axitinib as a sign of hepatotoxicity. In one study, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase increased by over 25% of pembrolizumab plus axitinib-treated patients.

# Toxicity

- Pembrolizumab has the potential to cause fetal harm.

- Animal studies have shown increased severity in certain types of infections, including M. tuberculosis, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, and hepatitis B virus.

- Pembrolizumab has not been the subject of testing for potential carcinogenicity or genotoxicity.

- Pembrolizumab has an elimination terminal half-life of 27 days.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Pembrolizumab is a relatively new biological agent, and even though it is effective, it does require close monitoring for safety; thus, besides the clinician who prescribes the agent, both the nurse and pharmacist are responsible for educating the patient on the potential side effects of the drug. Since some of the adverse effects are delayed-onset like colitis and hypophysitis, an outpatient oncology nurse should follow the patients. The clinician, nurse, and pharmacist team members should regularly check the renal and liver function. During IV administration, the drug is known to cause chills, fever, flushing, hypotension, hypoxemia, pruritis, rash, rigors, and wheezing. While checkpoint inhibitors have lower rates of infusion reaction than other monoclonal antibodies, it is still essential to monitor. More crucially, the drug may cause transient increases in blood glucose. Finally, because the drug can trigger an allergic reaction, the interprofessional team needs to have the necessary medications and equipment to counter it in the room.

**Outcomes**

PD-L1 expression levels and treatment decision-making in NSCLC (Level 1).

Tumor-expressed PD-L1 has the potential to suppress immune system responses by downregulating anti-tumor lymphocyte activity upon binding PD-1. In theory, an antibody that can block this interaction should be an effective anti-cancer agent. In practice, clinical trials of pembrolizumab and other checkpoint inhibitors have shown meaningful responses in many oncology indications thus far. As a corollary, it would make sense that tumors that express the most PD-L1 would be the most susceptible to one of these antibodies.

In NSCLC, for example, Brody et al. conducted a large meta-analysis of thirty-five different clinical trials and showed many studies that linked higher PD-L1 expression with worse survival, but also several other studies that showed no such effect.

The FDA recently changed the pembrolizumab NSCLC monotherapy approval label to include PD-L1 expressers greater than 1% (from greater than 50%). However, without adequate head-to-head studies, pembrolizumab may not provide optimal patient outcomes compared to other approved treatment options in patients with PD-L1 expression between 1 and 49%.

With the rapid developmental pace in the field of molecular therapeutics for lung cancer, treatment decisions are becoming more personalized and sophisticated. Therefore it will be of great importance to have support systems to help thoracic oncologists stay up-to-date.
