Maternal VZV immune status should be determined before pregnancy by reviewing the varicella infection history or vaccination documentation with two doses of the varicella vaccine. If both are negative, a VZV IgG should be obtained. Women of childbearing age without immunity should be counseled about the risks of varicella during pregnancy. Women of childbearing age who are not immune and not pregnant should receive two doses of the vaccine, given four to eight weeks apart.

Because the effect on fetal development is not known, the varicella vaccine, which is a live vaccine, is contraindicated in pregnancy. Vaccination can be given in the immediate post-partum period, and breastfeeding is not a contraindication.
