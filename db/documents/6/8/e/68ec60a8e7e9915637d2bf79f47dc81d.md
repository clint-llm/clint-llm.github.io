Agricultural employees who handle organophosphates for a prolonged period should have medical monitoring. Appropriate testing is recommended to identify overexposure before the occurrence of clinical illness. Both serum and RBC cholinesterase must be determined. Baseline blood samples may be obtained and compared with the samples according to one of the following schedules:

- On a routine 30-day basis

(or)

- Within three days at the end of each qualifying period where the employee meets the exposure threshold.

If an employee's RBC or serum cholinesterase concentrations fall more than 20% below the baseline, evaluate the employee's work practices to identify and correct potential sources of pesticide poisoning.
