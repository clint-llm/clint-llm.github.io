Heroin use, abuse, overdose, and addiction have had many discussions in the professional and lay press of the United States, which intensified in the 2000s and 2010s. After around 2012, the United States government began to shift the prioritization of money from interdiction and law enforcement to treatment programs to treat drug addicts, including those addicted to heroin.

A growing body of evidence began to show more clearly that medication-assisted treatment when added to traditional abstinence efforts, suppressed relapse risk more effectively than abstinence efforts alone. As of 2016, there was ongoing, sometimes heated debate regarding if medication-assisted treatment was exchanging one drug for another, as was asserted by some addiction treatment leaders of the time, and if that were true, what ethical ramifications that presented to the practitioner. The trend of consensus, where that could be obtained, was that the benefits of harm reduction with the initiation of medication-assisted treatment outweighed the risks in someone verified to be a patient with recurrent, problematic, accelerating use of opioids.
