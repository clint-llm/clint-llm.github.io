Dysbaric osteonecrosis is a type of avascular necrosis of the bone that is most commonly found in undersea divers and workers that breathe compressed air or gas. This condition can lead to increased risk of fractures and of total joint arthroplasty. The most commonly involved region is the hip joint, specifically the proximal femur, with bilateral involvement not being uncommon. This activity describes the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of dysbaric osteonecrosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the pathophysiology of dysbaric osteonecrosis.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with dysbaric osteonecrosis.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for dysbaric osteonecrosis.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of dysbaric osteonecrosis and improve patient outcomes.
