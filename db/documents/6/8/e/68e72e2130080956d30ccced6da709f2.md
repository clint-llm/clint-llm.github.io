Masticatory muscle disorders include myofascial pain and dysfunction, myositis, and neoplasms.

Myofascial pain and dysfunction may result from several etiologies. The most common ones are nocturnal bruxism, habitual clenching of the mouth, and whiplash injuries during a trauma. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction can result from an imbalance of forces within the muscles of mastication.  Grinding of teeth at night (bruxism) is a common cause of TMJ dysfunction secondary to a resultant imbalance in the muscle of mastication forces from excessive grinding of the teeth.

Muscle spasm of the muscles of mastication (trismus) can be a symptom of tumor or infection. An infection like tetanus may present with "lockjaw" or trismus. Other infections or inflammation of the muscles may present as myositis or pain during the movement of the jaw.

Tumors, although rare but may present in the masticator space, which is enveloped by the deep cervical facia. These tumors may have an extension from adjacent regions. The medial side of the fascia is attached to the skull base, and the lateral side extends to the temporalis muscle. Anteriorly it is attached to the body of the mandible at the level of the oblique line, and posteriorly it is attached to the ramus of the mandible.
