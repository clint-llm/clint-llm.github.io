Fosphenytoin has a black box warning due to its activated form of phenytoin. In adults, exceeding 150 mg phenytoin equivalents per minute may lead to severe cardiac outcomes, particularly hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias. Therefore, clinicians should perform cardiac monitoring up to 30 minutes after IV infusion. In the case of cardiac abnormalities, the discontinuation or reduction of the drug dosage may be necessary.

Fosphenytoin has the same warning signs as phenytoin. The first to manifest during an acute overdose are nystagmus, ataxia, and dysarthria. The calculated doses appear to differ from patient to patient; however, nystagmus is evident at as little as 20 µg/mL doses, with lethargy and dysarthria presenting at upwards of 40 µg/mL. The Lethal dose of fosphenytoin is 2 to 5 grams in adults. In acute overdosage, the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be considered.

Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote to fosphenytoin or phenytoin overdosage. The clinicians should examine the adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems and ensure relevant supportive measures. According to product labeling, in severe intoxication in the pediatric population, total exchange transfusion is used. Nephrologists should consider hemodialysis in severe cases.
