Histidineâ€™s importance to the human body derives from the properties determined by its distinctive structure. Its side-chain is composed of an imidazole ring that is heterocyclic and contains nitrogen atoms at position 1 (pi) and 3 (tau). It is ionizable and exists both in neutral and protonated forms in the body, which gives histidine a pK one pH-unit below neutrality, allowing it to be both acid and base at physiologic pH. The imidazole ring of histidine is aromatic, which confers stability and makes it apolar at physiologic pH.

Histidine is also a good chelator of metal ions like copper, zinc, manganese, and cobalt.
