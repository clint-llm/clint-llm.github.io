Patients should maintain proper health etiquette and receive routine physicals, making clinicians aware of any perceived changes in health, weight, body composition, or function. Additionally, patients should be made aware of the potential dangers of sarcopenia and how it may affect them and their loved ones, especially in those with multiple comorbidities.

Prevention appears to be the most effective way to deal with the potential issues that sarcopenia presents in the elderly. Nonetheless, prevention, management, and treatment of sarcopenia are most effectively achieved by maintaining physical activity andÂ increased protein intake. Specifically, patients should be educated on the daily and per meal basis protein recommendations. Furthermore, patients should be educated on the benefits of resistance training, in combination with the aforementioned recommendations, to avoid developing or treat or manage sarcopenia.
