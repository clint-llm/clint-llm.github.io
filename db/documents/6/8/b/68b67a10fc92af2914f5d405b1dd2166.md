Lumbosacral radiculopathy is very common. On average, 3 to 5% of adults will experience symptoms in their lifetime.

Between 63 and 72% of patients with lumbar radiculopathy will experience paresthesia, 35% will experience radiation of pain in the lower limb, and 27% of patients will endorse numbness.

Disc herniation is the underlying etiology of less than 5% of patients with acute low back pain.

In patients presenting with a positive Romberg test with a wide-based gait, there is over a 90% chance of possible lower spine syndrome.

Electromyography (EMG) has a sensitivity between 50 and 85% for radiculopathy.
