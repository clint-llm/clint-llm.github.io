The management of West syndrome is with an interprofessional team that includes neurology nurses and pharmacists. The treatment of West syndrome is not satisfactory and most infants have severe developmental delay and neurological deficits. Many therapies have been tried but none has so far been shown to work with any consistency. Because the infants are frail, surgery should be a last option. Surgery is also associated with many serious complications, which add further morbidity.
