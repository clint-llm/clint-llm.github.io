Nuclear medicine (NM) imaging uses intravenously injected radioactive tracers that provide diagnostic data according to the metabolic activity of differing tissues. The radiotracers are attached to specific carrier molecules to target different areas and activity levels in the body. Areas of increased bone remodeling at fracture sites, cancerous overgrowth, and active infection can be targeted in this manner. Bone scintigraphy is the most widely used NM technique for bone imaging. Radiotracers with avidity to osteoblastic activity show increased areas of uptake and thus point to areas of increased turnover such as fractures and neoplasms. Other radiotracers with avidity for leukocytes aid in the detection of infectious and inflammatory processes, including characteristic findings in complex regional pain syndrome or hardware complications.

Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT) is another NM option for musculoskeletal imaging.

Perhaps the largest disadvantage of NM is the poor quality anatomic resolution provided by the detection of the radiotracer. NM images do not show sharp osseous details. Another disadvantage of NM includes the radiation dose to the patient and persons within close proximity. Unlike other modalities that pass ionizing radiation through the body to form an image, nuclear medicine detects the amount of radiation that emanates from the radiotracers that are delivered within the body. The patient then becomes the source of radiation and continues to have low levels of radioactivity after the imaging is complete. Radiation dose differs according to the half-life and amount of the specific radiotracer used and the physiologic elimination through urine or stool. In NM techniques such as bone scintigraphy, the entire body receives a radiation dose, not just the imaged area, as in CT and radiographs. The radiotracers are created in laboratories, both on and off-site of most imaging facilities, and the associated costs and availability can be prohibitive. Radiotracer uptake in the areas of interest also increases the procedure time. Patients usually end up spending several hours at the facility for a single NM study and, in some cases, may require further imaging several days after radiotracer administration. Another time-based constraint is the delay needed to adequately allow for the physiologic healing process, osteoblastic activity, to initiate. For example, an acute fracture will not be evident on bone scintigraphy until the healing response has been initiated.

Examples of appropriate uses of NM for wrist pathology may include:

- Assessment of osseous metastasis (osteoblastic neoplasms more than osteolytic)

- Occult fracture (subacute to chronic)

- Stress fracture

- Osteomyelitis

- Bone lesion characterization (aggressive processes tend to be more metabolically active, thus higher uptake of radiotracer)

- Avascular necrosis

- Complex regional pain syndrome
