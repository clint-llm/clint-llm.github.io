Klippel Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a vascular malformation syndrome comprising varying involvement of cutaneous capillaries, veins, and lymphatics with hypertrophy of soft tissue and bones of the affected limb. This syndrome is also referred to as capillary-lymphatic-venous malformation (CLVM), reflecting the changes seen in those vessels. This condition was first described in 1900 by two French physicians, Maurice Klippel and Paul Trenaunay. KTS is a clinical diagnosis made by the presence of at least two of the three classic findings of localized cutaneous capillary malformations, venous abnormalities, and limb hypertrophy. The presence of arteriovenous malformations is now considered a separate entity named as Parkes-Weber syndrome, distinct from KTS.
