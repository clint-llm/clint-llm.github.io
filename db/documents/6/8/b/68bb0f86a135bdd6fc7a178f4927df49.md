The exact etiology of clear cell acanthoma is unknown. It is unclear whether clear cell acanthoma represents a benign neoplasm or a reactive inflammatory dermatosis. For those that consider this entity to be a tumor, there is further disagreement whether this is a tumor of epidermal, pilar, or sweat gland origin. Most experts maintain that clear cell acanthoma is an epidermal tumor, as originally described.
