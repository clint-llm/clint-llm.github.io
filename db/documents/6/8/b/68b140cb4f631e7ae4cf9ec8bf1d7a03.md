Nurses often perform initial interviewing of a patient in both inpatient and outpatient settings and ask patients questions about their medical history, medication history, and in many facilities are required to screen patients for self-harm or intent to harm others. Patients or their families may share with nurses that they are feeling down or depressed. Nurses have the opportunity to notify the healthcare team to assess the patient's mental health further. The nurses can also provide support and education on MDD. If a patient expresses suicidal ideations, the nurse should stay with the patient and notify a healthcare provider. The patient should not be left alone.
