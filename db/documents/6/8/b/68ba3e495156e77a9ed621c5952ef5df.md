Albright hereditary osteodystrophy is an inherited disorder. Once the disease is developed, there is no cure. However, regular screening for the associated manifestations, irrespective of the symptoms, helps to identify them early and helps in initiating timely treatment. In addition, testing for GNAS1 mutations and counseling are useful for patients planning to have children to know the risk of passing on their disease. Children born to affected males usually develop skeletal abnormalities only, whereas those born to affected females also develop hormonal abnormalities.
