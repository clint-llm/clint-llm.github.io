The large intestine is the portion of the digestive tract where water is absorbed from indigestible contents. The large intestine includes the cecum, appendix, entire colon, rectum, and anal canal. It begins at the terminal ileum with the cecum. Unlike the small intestine, it has a shorter length but a much larger lumen. It is distinguished further from the small intestine by the presence of omental appendices, haustra, and teniae coli.
