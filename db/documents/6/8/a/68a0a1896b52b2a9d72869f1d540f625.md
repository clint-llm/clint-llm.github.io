Lacrimal gland masses can have many etiologies, including neoplastic and non-neoplastic causes. Of the neoplastic causes, benign etiologies are more common than malignant. However, since they are still rare, they can present a diagnostic challenge. The following reviews the evaluation and treatment of benign lacrimal gland tumors and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with these conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the presentation and appropriate clinical evaluation for a patient with a suspected lacrimal gland mass.
- Review the benign causes of lacrimal gland tumors.
- Identify factors of the patient history, physical examination, and imaging modalities that guide management and treatment.
- Summarize the treatment options for the various benign lacrimal gland lesions.
