Before starting any ultrasound examination, the sonographer should confirm the correct patient, the scan to be performed, and the reason for the scan. For transabdominal ultrasounds, the patient should ideally have a full bladder for resolution enhancement of surrounding structures. For a transvaginal approach, the bladder should be empty for optimalÂ visualization.
