Hereditary angioedema is a complex disorder best managed by an allergist, immunologist, pulmonologist, and internist. Once treated, these patients may be followed by the primary care provider and nurse practitioner. An interprofessional team approach will provide the best patient outcome.

Treatment is unique from angioedema associated with histamine since antihistamines, corticosteroids, and epinephrine have little effect on the swelling. Instead, medications that either inhibitor production of bradykinin or compete with the receptor are utilized.

The primary care providers should educate the patient on avoidance of triggers and consider long-term prophylaxis. Most patients should be taught self-treatment to enhance freedom and quality of life. Serial assessment is essential to ensure that morbidity is minimal and therapy is effective.
