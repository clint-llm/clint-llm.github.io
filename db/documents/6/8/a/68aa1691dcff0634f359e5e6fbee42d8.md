Of the diseases that afflict the ANS, orthostatic intolerance, neurogenic bowel, and erectile dysfunction are the important topics of the discussion below.

Orthostatic intolerance (OI) is a condition characterized by the onset of symptoms on standing that improve by lying down. An upright position is a stressor on the circulatory system that requires a healthy functioning heart, adequate blood volume, and functioning vascular tone to maintain appropriate blood pressures and cerebral blood flow. Without any one of these factors, symptoms of dizziness and loss of consciousness can occur on standing. The sympathetic nervous system exerts its influence to increase heart rate and cause vasoconstriction and venoconstriction. Without this feature of the sympathetic nervous system, OI will occur.

Neurogenic bowel results from destruction or disease processes that damage nerves controlling bowel function and results in fecal incontinence or constipation. Parkinson disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injury are all causes of neurogenic bowel due to autonomic dysfunction.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) can result from dysfunction in the parasympathetic nervous system. Parkinson disease, encephalitis, and stroke are known to be neurogenic causes of ED.
