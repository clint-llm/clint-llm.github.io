Ocular melanoma is diagnosed from ultrasonography, fluorescein angiography, enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography, and fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Treatment depends on the extent of disease, condition of the eye, spread to distant sites of metastasis. Surgical options include enucleation, orbital exenteration, endoresection, and exoresection. Prompt evaluation for ocular melanoma is essential to prevent metastasis, which leads to a fatal prognosis. This activity will discuss how an interprofessional team can improve outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology and epidemiology of ocular melanoma.
- Review the pathophysiology and histopathology of ocular melanoma.
- Outline the evaluation and treatment of ocular melanoma.
- Outline the prognosis and complications of ocular melanoma can be improved by utilizing an interprofessional team.
