Usually, for locally advanced lung cancer, the tumor or lung lesion extends into a portion of the main bronchus. After resecting the bronchial portion, there must be sufficient disease-free bronchial tissue to be re-anastomosed to preserve lung parenchyma on the affected side. Pulmonary sleeve resection (PSR) can be performed for central tumors, benign or low-grade.

Lung cancer staging has evolved over the past decade. The most current edition is the 8th edition with the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and Union Internationale Contre le Cancer (UICC) published in 2017. The TNM classification (tumor[T], lymph node[N], and metastasis[M]) describes a specific classification of lung tumors based on location, lymph node involvement, and areas of metastasis.

Examples of pathologies requiring PSR include carcinoid tumors, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Other pathologies may also be indicated as squamous cell carcinoma, myofibroblastic tumor, adenoma, metastatic sarcoma, or granular cell tumors.
