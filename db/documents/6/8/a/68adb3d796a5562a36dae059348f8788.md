- Lhermitte's sign generally occurs with pathologies involving the cervical spinal cord but is not specific to etiology.

- It often occurs in patients with multiple sclerosis, cervical spondylotic myelopathy, chemotherapy, radiation myelopathy, and B12 deficiency, among others.

- Increased spinal cord metabolic activity and positive positron emission tomography (PET) imaging have been described in association with Lhermitte's sign.

- The overall incidence and prevalence of Lhermitte symptoms are difficult to estimate but more studied in MS patients.

- Patients can experience Lhermitte's sign intermittently as it does not have to always happen with the same degree of neck flexion. It may be infrequent or occur with slight to dramatic flexion of the head or neck as well as with extension of the neck.

- Delayed onset Lhermitte's sign has been reported following head and/or neck trauma. This occurs several months following injury, without associated neurological symptoms or pain, and typically resolves within 12 months.

- As a misnomer, Lhermitte's "sign" is not truly a sign, at least in the traditional medical terminology. Rather, it is a symptom.
