Lesions appear as asymptomatic or pruritic annular erythematous or brown circular macules, papules, or plaques with a raised hyperkeratotic border surrounding the lesions. It can occur bilaterally. Lesions most commonly present in the third or fourth decade and occur in areas exposed to sunlight. The legs, forearms, shoulders, and back are the areas most commonly affected. The face can rarely be involved. The palms and soles are spared. Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis usually worsens when it is exposed to sunlight, and pruritus can intensify.
