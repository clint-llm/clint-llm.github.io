Physical examination should include a general assessment of the severity of illness, abdominal distension, evidence of peritonitis, respiratory compromise from aspiration or splitting of the diaphragm, signs of dehydration, jaundice, and congenital anomalies down syndrome, congenital heart disease, and anorectal malformation.
