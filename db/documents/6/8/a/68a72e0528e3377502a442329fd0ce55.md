In addition to the pathologies that affect all of the dural structures (e.g., bacterial meningitis), the falx cerebri is clinically significant in two common scenarios.  First, the falx cerebri is the site of falcine meningiomas which account for approximately ~8.5% of intracranial meningiomas. These meningiomas are benign and form well-circumscribed, usually round masses attached to the dura.  Meningiomas primarily arise from arachnoidal cap cells and can cause seizures. Headaches, nausea, and vomiting are common manifestations due to increased intracranial pressure following its significant growth.  Biopsy findings will show tumor cells depending on the grade of the tumor and also showing syncytial nests, which may calcify into psammoma bodies.

The second common clinical scenario occurs in traumatic brain injury leading to a substantial anterior cranial fossa extradural hematoma or the frontal contusions. They can cause significant mass effect forcing the ipsilateral cingulate gyrus to herniate under the falx cerebri leading to subfalcine herniation.
