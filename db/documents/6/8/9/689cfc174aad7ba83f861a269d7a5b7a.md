Four stages of the disease process have been identified on the microscopic evaluation. In the early stages of the disease (Stage I) the thickness and architecture of GBM and podocyte under light microscopy are normal with no GBM thickening. Under electron microscopy, the sub-epithelial deposits are seen confluent to specific locations and are not widespread. As the disease advance (stages II and III), GBM extends around the deposits, eventually encircling immune globulin deposits. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain under light microscopy shows the thickening of the GBM and Silver methenamine stain shows characteristic spike-like formations.

Immunofluorescence microscopy shows a granular pattern with IgG and c3 staining. For primary MN, the predominance of IgG4 is seen, as compared to secondary MN where IgG1 predominates.
