When a patient describes symptoms such as paresthesias, pain, or weakness in more than one extremity, which cannot be explained by a focal mononeuropathy, such as a nerve entrapment neuropathy, the clinician may turn to electrodiagnostic (EDX) testing to identify whether a peripheral neuropathy may be present. A thorough history and physical examination will typically reveal a specific risk factor for peripheral nerve damage, such as toxic, metabolic, hereditary, microangiopathic, or autoimmune exposures or disorders. The electrodiagnostic testing may also help narrow the differential diagnosis based on the diseaseâ€™s common electrodiagnostic features.
