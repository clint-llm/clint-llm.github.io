The primary blood supply to theÂ lower limb arises from the femoral artery and the inferior gluteal artery. The femoral artery is a continuation of the external iliac artery as it passes under the inguinal ligament. The femoral artery branches into the deep femoral artery. The inferior gluteal artery branches from the internal iliac artery to supply the proximal portions of the muscles.
