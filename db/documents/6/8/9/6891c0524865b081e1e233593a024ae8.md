Infiltration of the vascular wall by inflammatory infiltrates like neutrophils, eosinophils, histiocytes, lymphocytes, and giant cells. Presence of organized thrombus within the lumen in the initial phase, which is replaced by recanalization and fibrosis later. Orcein staining reveals the absence of the internal elastic lamia.

The primary histopathological differential diagnosis of superficial migratory thrombophlebitis (SMT) is polyarteritis nodosa, a condition in which arteries are involved, recognized by the diameter of the lumen, the thickness of the wall, and presence of an internal elastic lumen.

In Trousseau syndrome, there is no invasion of the affected vein by tumor or tumor emboli, and there is usually a little inflammatory reaction.

Buerger disease demonstrates characteristic inflammation and thrombosis of small and medium-sized arteries and veins and the presence of giant cells and microabscesses within thrombi.
