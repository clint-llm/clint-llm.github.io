Interprofessional teamwork is the backbone in all the specialties of dentistry. A well-planned, harmonious, and coordinated dentist, dental nurse, and technician effort is essential to guarantee the best treatment. The aforementioned dental professionals need to thoroughly understand the different features, setting reactions, and manipulation requirements of the impression material chosen for each clinical case, avoiding the complications and delays that a wrongly selected material will cause.
