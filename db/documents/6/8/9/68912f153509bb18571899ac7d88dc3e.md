Apneic episodes may sometimes be categorized to have an Apparent Life Threatening Event (ALTE). The term ALTE describes an acute event that appears frightening to the caregiver and includes some combination of apnea, bradycardia, color change (usually cyanosis or pallor, occasionally plethora), and choking or gagging. In 2016, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended discontinuing the use of ALTE as a diagnosis and recommended an alternate term. Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE).
