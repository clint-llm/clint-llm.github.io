Diagnosis of parvovirus B19 infection is usually not warranted due to the self-limiting progression of the disease and typical mild symptoms. Testing can be obtained via bloodwork for specific antibodies. Testing for specific parvovirus B19 IgM antibody can confirm acute infection on serology. IgM antibodies can usually be found within 7 to 10 days of virus exposure. These can remain measurable for 2 to 3 months after exposure to the virus. IgG antibodies will start to rise about 2 weeks after viral exposure, and the patient will confer immunity as these will then be measurable for life.

This testing can be useful in patients with aplastic crisis diagnosis to confirm and help support causation from acute parvovirus B19 detection. Testing for IgG antibodies can be common in prenatal testing for women to look for immunity status to parvovirus B19 to access the risk of potential congenital disabilities.
