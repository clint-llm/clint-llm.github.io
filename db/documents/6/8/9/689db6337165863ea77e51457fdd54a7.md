Simulation-based education (SBE), when used under the right conditions, correlates with significant effects on knowledge, skills, and behaviors and moderate effects for patient-related outcomes. Post simulation debriefing is one of the most effective components of SBE and the cornerstone of the learning experience in the medical simulation setting.

Training facilitators in debriefing techniques is critical to ensure effective debriefing among simulation faculty.

With the vast amount of published literature regarding debriefing, it may be challenging for simulation educators to gain an overarching understanding of various techniques and methods. This article briefly summarizes the most common debriefing methods and techniques. Additionally, it highlights the prevailing rules and essentials of effective debriefing.
