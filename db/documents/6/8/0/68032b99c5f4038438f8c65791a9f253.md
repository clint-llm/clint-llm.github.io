Prothrombin time (PT) measures coagulation throughout the extrinsic pathway and common pathway. A normal PT time is between 11 to 15 seconds; however, this time may vary slightly in the healthcare setting. The international normalized ratio (INR) is used to mitigate the slight discrepancies in PT and also is the test of choice when a patient is on warfarin therapy. A therapeutic INR is usually considered between 2 to 3 (for most clinical situations requiring anticoagulation with warfarin).

Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) measures coagulation throughout the intrinsic pathway and common pathway. A normal PTT time is 25 to 40 seconds. PTT is the test of choice when monitoring a patient on unfractionated heparin. Of note, routine PTT surveillance is not necessary for patients on low-molecular-weight heparin.

Bleeding time (BT) is a measure of platelet function and how well platelets can form a clot. Normal bleeding time is 2 to 7 minutes. BT time is typically elevated in conditions of platelet dysfunction.
