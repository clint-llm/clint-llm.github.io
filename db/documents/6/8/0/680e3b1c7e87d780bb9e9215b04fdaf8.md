Leiomyoma of the esophagus is known to be a slow-growing tumor with low malignant potential. Occasionally these leiomyomas grow larger and present as tumors greater than 10 cm in diameter, and then they are called giant leiomyomas of the esophagus. Giant leiomyomas of the esophagus may present as a mediastinal mass. The most frequent site of occurrence of this tumor is the lower two-thirds of the esophagus, and this distribution reflects the relative amount of smooth muscle cells present along the wall of the esophagus. When the leiomyomas situated in the distal esophagus reach a large size, they can press on the cardia of the stomach.
