Unintentional falls, collisions, and leisure activities are the most common reasons for TDIs.

Various studies have examined the risk factors that increase the likelihood of TDIs in the primary dentition. Children with increased overjet and inadequate lip coverage have a higher incidence of dental injuries.

It is important to remember that traumatic dental injuries and facial trauma can occur in cases of non-accidental (intentional) injuries. The head and neck region is frequently a target of abuse, with injuries occurring in 59-76% of physically abused children.

Clinicians should assess whether the injuries sustained correlate and are consistent with the history of the accident. Repeated injuries, multiple bruises, delayed presentation, or injuries with unclear explanations may raise suspicions of abuse.
