Blood vessels derive from mesenchyme tissue during development. The blood vessels of the face and head originate from the mesoderm of the brachial arches. The labial artery arises from the third brachial arch. The third branchial arch forms the common carotid artery. The common carotid artery goes on to divide into the internal and external carotid arteries. As the external carotid artery ascends the face, it branches into the facial artery. The facial artery will give rise to the labial arteries. The labial arteries will develop from the angiogenesis effects exerted on the maxillary and mandible regions. The maxillary processes migrate to fuse with the intermaxillary process. During the migration, the blood supply will form and migrate with the maxillary processes. After the fusion of the maxillary processes, the anastomosis of the superior labial arteries eventually follows. The inferior labial artery migrates as the mandible migrate to fuse with the contralateral side. After the mandible fuses to form the mandibular symphysis, the inferior labial arteries eventually anastomose together.
