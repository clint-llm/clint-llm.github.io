There are very few contraindications for TKIs. Considering the use of TKIs in life-extending cancer therapy, the benefits associated with TKI use generally outweigh the risks.

Data on TKI use during pregnancy is still lacking in most cases. As a result, TKIs are typically co-prescribed with an effective contraception method during therapy and several weeks after discontinuing the TKI. Other limitations to using TKIs include severe adverse reactions. Patients at particular risk for one of the known adverse effects of the TKIs about to be prescribed, such as hypertension, interstitial lung disease, and long-QT syndrome, should receive an alternative therapy if possible.
