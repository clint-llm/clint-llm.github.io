A good history and physical exam are key and often lead to the diagnosis. The following are the main items that should be addressed in the patient interview and physical examination.

**History**

A detailed history should be taken, including dietary history. The focus should be on the history of food consumption with high carotene with the estimation of the amount taken and duration. In addition, screening should be done for other conditions that could present with carotenemia, such as diabetes, anorexia, hypothyroidism, and liver and kidney diseases.

Metabolic carotenemia with no history of surplus carotene intake could be because of a genetic abnormality in the metabolism of carotenoids. Amenorrhea is also found to be associated with carotenemia. This is seen in vegetarians mainly. Patients may present with pruritus, abdominal pain, fatigue, and weight loss due to one of the rarer causes of carotenemia.

**Physical Examination**

Yellow-orange skin pigmentation is the hallmark of the condition. Pigmentation spares the sclera and mucous membranes (unlike jaundice) and concentrates in the palms, soles, forehead, tip of the nose, and nasolabial folds.
