Historically, references to mechanical back pain have used many other vague terms like "non-specific back pain," "lumbar strain," or "lumbago." This terminology was due to the absence of proper diagnostic methods in the past. However, more recent advances in imaging technology and a better clinical understanding of spinal anatomy and the body's innervation have allowed more accurate terminology and diagnoses, depending on the underlying cause. Hence, more specific diagnoses are made based on the etiology of mechanical back strain, which is typically due to pathology involving the spine's anatomy. While the lower back is usually affected the most, mechanical back pathology may involve any part of the bones, spinal ligaments, intervertebral discs, facet joints, spinal cord, spinal nerves, or paraspinal muscles. Common examples of pathology involving these structures include the following diseases

- Spinal foraminal stenosis

- Herniated discs

- Spinal stenosis

- Degenerative disc disease

- Vertebral fractures

- Sacroiliac joint dysfunction

- Facet joint syndrome

- Ligamentous and muscular injury

- Myofascial pain syndrome
