The prognosis of anteroseptal myocardial infection has not been the object of research as a separate entity. In general, survivors of a myocardial infarctionÂ face a substantial excess risk of further cardiovascular events, including an increase in mortality. However, the prognosis for an individual varies markedly according to the presence or absence of adverse risk factors and measures for secondary prevention. Short and long-term death rates following MI have fallen substantially in the past few decades with improvements in medical care, particularly the widespread use of reperfusion techniques and the adjunctive use of multiple medical therapies for primary and secondary prevention.
