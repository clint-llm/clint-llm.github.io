The exact cause of dissociated vertical deviation is not well understood. However, a few of the important theories explaining the underlying mechanism include:

- Bielschowsky’s theory – He proposed alternating and intermittent excitation of subcortical vertical divergence centers as the cause of DVD.

- Later it was thought of as a dorsal light reflex that modulates the central vestibular tone. Any fluctuations in the binocular visual input were supposed to stimulate the visual-vestibular reflex.

- Guyton described it as a nystagmus blocking mechanism.

- Spielmann suggested an imbalance of binocular stimulation.

- Few authors have also postulated an imbalance between the cortical input and subcortical pathways as the underlying pathology.
