The landmarks need to be palpated prior to cleansing the skin. The joint space can be palpated distal to the distal radius and ulnar to the anatomic snuffbox, making sure to avoid the associated extensor tendons. For the radial approach, the needle should be inserted dorsally perpendicular to the skin. If the needle hits the bone, then it should be withdrawn and redirected towards the thumb.

The ulnar approach uses the same positioning. The joint space in this approach is identified by palpating distal to the distal ulna. The needle is inserted dorsally in a radial direction.

Upon entering the joint space, a pop or give is felt. The synovial fluid can now be withdrawn. Some resistance might be noted determined by the needle size, viscosity of the fluid, amount of fluid, and presence of fibrin clots. If resistance is noted, rotating the needle or withdrawing it slightly could be helpful. If medication is to be injected, the syringe has to be removed while keeping the needle secure and the medication injected. Once completed, the needle should be removed, and light pressure should be applied to the insertion site.Â The synovial fluid obtained should be transferred to specimen tubes testing for cell count, glucose, protein, LDH, lactate, crystals, and culture.

Ultrasound is a helpful tool to identify joint effusions and perform arthrocentesis.
