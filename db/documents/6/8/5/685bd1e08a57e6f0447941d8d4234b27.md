For the limb escharotomy, most of the literature suggests performing the incision along the longitudinal axis of the limb either in the mid-lateral or mid-medial line (e.g radial border and ulnar border for the upper limb). The incision can be done either by a scalpel or cutting cautery and hemostasis can be maintained by coagulation cautery. Ideally, the incision should extend between two unburnt skin areas and should be down to but not including the muscle fascia. Care should be taken not to injury any of the deep structures especially nerves and not to cross any of the flexural creases. Escharotomy should be done in a stepwise fashion by doing one incision either mid-lateral or mid-medial and then reassessing the limb condition. If there is no improvement, another opposing incision can be made.

Continuous evaluation and monitoring of the adequacy of escharotomy are crucial. Limb elevation, regular assessment of perfusion, and compartment pressure if possible are important as some patients may need a further extension of the escharotomy incisions or even fasciotomy. On the contrary, chest and abdominal escharotomy need adequate assessment of respiratory effort, circulatory status, and bladder pressure if needed. Some of these patients may develop intra-abdominal hypertension which may necessitate paracentesis or even decompressive laparotomy.
