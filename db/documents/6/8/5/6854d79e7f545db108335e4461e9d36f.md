Clinically, the musculature and kidneys are connected primarily through creatinine. Creatinine is a muscle breakdown product that has been used clinically to evaluate kidney function for decades. In damaged muscles (e.g., rhabdomyolysis), myoglobin can enter the bloodstream and exert nephrotoxic effects. On the other hand, healthy muscles are believed to protect against inflammation-mediated kidney deterioration through several mechanisms. Macroscopically, the kidneys are anterior to the psoas muscles within Gerotaâ€™s fascia.
