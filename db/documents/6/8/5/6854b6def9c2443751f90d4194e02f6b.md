The urothelium transforms from five to seven layers thick in a relaxed state to two or three layers thick in a distended bladder. This functional modification of the epithelium does not cause any damage - resulting in the name "transitional epithelium" – and allows for urine storage. In its superficial layer, umbrella-shaped cells are connected by tight junctions and covered by uroplakin, thus making it a barrier preventing injury to the tissue below.

The lamina propria acts as the bladder's "functional center" because of the presence of many specialized cells. It serves as a capacitance layer of the bladder that determines its compliance. The detrusor muscle of the muscularis propria is under autonomic nervous control. Sympathetic stimulation relaxes the detrusor muscle and contracts the urethral sphincter to allow urine filling, while parasympathetic stimulation contracts the detrusor and relaxes the urethral sphincter to allow micturition.
