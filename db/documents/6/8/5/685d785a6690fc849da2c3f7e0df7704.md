Botfly myiasis frequently poses a diagnostic dilemma. Botfly myiasis is often misdiagnosed as a more common cause of furuncular skin lesions. Patients will often receive antibiotics from a primary care physician or an emergency medicine physician without improvement. When a patient comes back to the primary care office or emergency room, it is essential to seek consultation from specialists to make an appropriate diagnosis. Infectious disease physicians should be consulted to rule out more common infectious etiologies. General surgeons should consult on these cases to discuss surgical removal of the botfly larva.
