The onset of pseudocholinesterase deficiency may occur through either inheritable (genetic) or acquired pathways.Â Regardless of its etiology, pseudocholinesterase deficiency usually does not result in clinically significant effects until the enzyme activity decreases to less than 75% of normal activity levels.

The genetic inheritance of pseudocholinesterase deficiency occurs through an autosomal recessive pattern, with frequencies of approximately 1 in 50 to 1 in 3000 individuals for heterozygotes and homozygotes, respectively.

Acquired conditions that decrease the activity of the BuChE enzyme include malnutrition, advanced age, malignancy, liver/kidney disease, pregnancy, burns, and organophosphate poisoning. In contrast, obesity and chronic alcoholism are suspected to increase pseudocholinesterase activity levels. Medications such as aspirin, metoclopramide, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, oral contraceptives, and anticholinesterase agents may also influence the enzyme's activity.
