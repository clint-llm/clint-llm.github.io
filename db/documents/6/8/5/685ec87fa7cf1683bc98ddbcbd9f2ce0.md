Chapel et al. have delineated five clinical phenotypes for CVID. Around 80% of their patients had only one of these phenotypes, and 12.6% had criteria for two

- Uncomplicated (patients usually suffer only infections)

- Autoimmunity

- Polyclonal lymphocytic infiltration (this includes lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis, unexplained granulomas, unexplained hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy)

- Enteropathy (biopsy-proven lymphocytic infiltration in lamina propria and interepithelial mucous with villous atrophy)

- Lymphoid malignancy

In any patient with newly diagnosed CVID, two complications have to be considered when assessing the clinical presentation: infectious and non-infectious.

Patients may suffer the following clinical manifestations at disease onset or throughout life

- **Infections**: common organisms likeHaemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus; and uncommon organisms like Pneumocystis jirovecii and Mycoplasma pneumoniae:

- Sinopulmonary infections that can be recurrent and result in bronchiectasis: pneumonia, bronchitis, sinusitis
- Otitis
- Conjunctivitis
- Septic arthritis
- Bacterial meningitis
- Sepsis
- Cutaneous infections

- **Lung Disease**
- Obstructive lung disease, generally because of bronchiectasis (resulting in chronic productive cough and dyspnea, especially in flares)
- Restrictive lung disease: normally due to diffuse interstitial lung disease or organizing pneumonia
- Primary malignancy (lymphoma) or metastatic gastric carcinoma
- Granulomatous disease: manifested as parenchymal nodules and/or ground glass abnormalities

- **Autoimmune disorders**(hematologic disorders are the most common form of autoimmunity, with a prevalence of around 20%)

- 
              
- Immune thrombocytopenia (10 to 12%)
              
              
- Coombs-positive autoimmune hemolytic anemia (5 to 7%)
              
              
- Evans syndrome
              
              
- Others:

- Rheumatoid arthritis: 1% to 10% of patients - usually, with negative antinuclear antibodies or rheumatoid factor due to lack of antibodies production.
- Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): a very uncommon finding (less than 1% of patients) but with a curiously predisposal to clinical remission due to loss of B cells or functional antibodies in almost 70% of patients.
- Sicca syndrome, Sjogrenâ€™s syndrome, autoimmune thyroiditis, vitiligo

- **Gastrointestinal (GI) infections and other GI disorders**
- Persistent diarrhea and malabsorption caused by giardiasis, Clostridium difficile infection, bacterial enterocolitis, CMV (cytomegalovirus) colitis, Helicobacter pylori infection
- Severe diarrhea caused by other infections and autoimmunity (inflammatory colitis)
- Inflammatory bowel-like disease, sprue-like illness, pernicious anemia (10% of patients),
- Malignancies (the risk of gastric carcinoma is almost 50 times greater in patients with CVID)
- Liver disease

- **Dermatologic manifestations**
- Alopecia areata or alopecia universalis
- Atopic dermatitis
- Cutaneous vasculitis (including polyarteritis nodosa)

Physical examination may be normal in these patients. However, there could be signs and symptoms of chronic illness like

- Nasal congestion due to chronic sinusitis.

- Scars in the tympanic membranes due to recurrent otitis

- Weight loss, nocturnal fever, and sweats (B symptoms) due to lymphoid malignancy

- Digital clubbing, chronic productive cough, and dyspnea due to chronic pulmonary disease

- Lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, arthritis, conjunctivitis, oral thrush, etc.
