Strategies to tackle this problem broadly group into preventive and therapeutic.

1. Preventive strategies

a) Increasing work engagement among residents by identifying factors that enhance dedication, vigor, and absorption at work.

b) Building resilience among residents. Resilience is defined as the "ability to bounce back or recover from stress" and consists of four main aspects- positive attitude and perspectives to work, work balance and prioritization, good practice management styles, and supportive relations.

c) Promoting a positive work environment through practices such as flexible working hours, enhanced job security, parental leave, and providing protection from exposure to occupational risks; this will ultimately improve the fit between the organization and the individual and lead to decreased rates of burnout in the long term.

2. Therapeutic strategies

a) Stress management programs with more than six hours of contact over a month-long period, along with regular booster sessions, have demonstrated benefit in reducing workplace stress and burnout.

b) Participation in "wellness programs" has been suggested to lower the risk of burnout among doctors.

c) A study conducted in the U.S. examined the effect of an intensive teaching program in mindfulness, communication, and self-awareness on the incidence of burnout. The research found that an eight-week intensive phase of 2.5 hours/week followed by a 10-month maintenance phase of 2.5 hours/month helped improve all three components of burnout.

d) General measures, such as conferences, retreats, participating in group discussions, providing contact information of experts trained in combating burnout, having a professional body to deal with resident burnout, reflective writing, music, massage, spiritual activities, and spending time with family are all effective in combating burnout.

The ACGME, in 2003, introduced the following reforms in resident schedules to effectively tackle the problem of resident burnout:

a) A weekly limit of 80 hours of duty per week, averaged over four weeks.

b) Ten hours of rest between duty periods.

c) A 24 hour limit on continuous duty, with up to six extra hours for education and continuity of care. Additionally, no new patients to be accepted after a 24-hour shift.

d) One day off every seven days, averaged over four weeks, inclusive of call days.

e) In house call, no more than once every three nights averaged over four weeks.

These restrictions did not result in a decrease in emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, or personal accomplishment scores in surgical residents who took the MBI approximately one week before and six months after these came into effect, as reported in a study conducted by Gelfand et al.

In summary, it would be fair to say that the phenomenon of burnout among medical residents is an emerging problem and can have adverse effects not only on the individuals involved but also on the health care system. Programs need to recognize this as a valid problem and institute measures to prevent and cope with the same. The ACGME has included a subsection on resident well-being in its common program requirements, which requires programs to allow residents to attend medical, dental, and mental health appointments, including those scheduled on working days. Such measures, along with the numerous methods cited above, will go a long way in reducing resident burnout and preserving patient safety.

The following quote beautifully sums up the message that needs to be conveyed, " If all of the knowledge and advice about how to beat burnout could be summed up in one word, that word would be a balance - the balance between giving and getting, the balance between stress and calm, the balance between work and home."Â  - Maslach.
