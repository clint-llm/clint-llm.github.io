The exact etiology of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is unknown. It is thought to be secondary to alveolar epithelial injury due to an unknown insult. Various etiologic agents have been suggested to cause organizing pneumonia including viral infections, toxic gases, medications, gastro-esophageal reflux, radiation therapy, and connective tissue disorders. Smoking is not considered a risk factor for the development of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. In fact, most patients with cryptogenic organizing pneumonia are non-smokers.
