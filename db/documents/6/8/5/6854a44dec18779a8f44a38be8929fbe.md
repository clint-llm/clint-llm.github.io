**Biology**

Leptin is a peptide hormone synthesized by white adipose tissue. The leptin gene (LEP or ob) is on chromosome 7q31.3.

**Mechanism**

The LR belongs to the glycoprotein 130 family of cytokine receptors and comprises 6-isoform. Of these isoforms, isoform-b is the most characterized. Its long-form is the receptor subtype that principally mediates the activation of critical second messenger pathways and normal leptin action.
