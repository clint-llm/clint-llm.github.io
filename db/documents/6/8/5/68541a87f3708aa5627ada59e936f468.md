Acromegaloidism: This is a condition where the patients have acromegaloid facial features or tall stature; however, laboratory assessments of GH and IGF-1 are normal. Imaging of the pituitary in these cases is unremarkable.

Soto's syndrome: This is a congenital overgrowth syndrome characterized by tall stature, acromegaloid facies, intellectual disabilities, macrocephaly,Â and advanced bone age. Other clinical features include neonatal hypotonia, congenital heart defects, strabismus, scoliosis, and a predisposition to cancer. Soto syndrome is due to the haploinsufficiency of the NSD1 gene on chromosome 5. Laboratory assessment of IGF-1 and GH levels is normal. Genetic studies are needed to differentiate it from acromegaly.
