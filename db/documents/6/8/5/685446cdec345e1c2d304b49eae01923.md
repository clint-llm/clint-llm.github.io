Imaging the endometrium for diagnostic purposes is done on days 5-10 of the patientâ€™s cycle. Endometrial hyperplasia can be reliably excluded if the endometrium measures less than 6 mm in thickness in pre-menopausal women and less than 5 mm thick in post-menopausal women.

In pre-menopausal patients who present with abnormal bleeding, a pregnancy test should always be done to exclude pregnancy. In all patients (pre- and post-menopausal) with abnormal vaginal bleeding, assessment of the coagulation profile with total platelet counts, prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time should be done to exclude coagulation and platelet disorders. A complete blood count should be ordered to assess anemia resulting from excessive blood loss (both chronic and acute).

The final diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia is usually made by hysteroscopy and direct biopsy sampling of the endometrium. Obtaining tissue via biopsy ideally needs to be done when the patient is not taking progestin-based hormones. If a patient is currently on hormonal therapy, a biopsy should be obtained 2 to 4 weeks after stopping therapy. Assessment of premalignant etiology may include molecular analysis (see etiology section).
