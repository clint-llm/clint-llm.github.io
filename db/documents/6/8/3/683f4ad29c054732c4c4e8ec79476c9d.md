Birdshot is an eye disease that should be followed by an ophthalmologist. Sudden changes in vision or symptoms should prompt an evaluation by an ophthalmologist. Even if the vision is fine, an eye exam can be needed to detect low levels of inflammation. Discuss plans for care and follow up with a local ophthalmologist.
