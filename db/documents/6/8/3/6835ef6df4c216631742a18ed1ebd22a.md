In the bloodstream, dissolved CO2 is neutralized by the bicarbonate-carbon dioxide buffer system where it forms a weak acid, carbonic acid (H2CO3). H2CO3 can dissociate into a hydrogen ion and bicarbonate ion. This buffer system allows the body to maintain physiologic pH.

- CO2 + H2O --> H2CO3 --> H+ + HCO3-

When CO2 levels are high, there is a right shift in the reaction mentioned above. As a result, the concentration of H+ ions in the bloodstream rises, lowering the pH and introducing a state of acidosis. In contrast, when CO2 levels are low, there is a left shift in the reaction, resulting in an alkalotic state.

Carbonic anhydrase catalyzes the conversion ofÂ CO2 and water to H+ and bicarbonate.

- CO2 + H2O --> H+ + HCO3-

Carbonic anhydrase helps to maintain the acid-base balance in the bloodstream and is present in high concentrations in erythrocytes. As levels of CO2 in the blood begin to rise, the body can respond through hyperventilation or hypoventilation, respectively.

The CO2 that is bound to hemoglobin forms a carbamino compound. In circumstances where the CO2 and H+ concentrations are high, the affinity of hemoglobin for O2 is decreased. When CO2 concentrations are low, the affinity of hemoglobin for O2 is increased. This is known as the Bohr effect. Conversely, if O2 concentrations are high, there is increased unloading of CO2 from the tissues. This is known as the Haldane effect.
