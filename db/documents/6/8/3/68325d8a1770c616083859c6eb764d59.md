Congenital disorders are present at the time of birth, and history is often not practicable. However, history is important as a child grows up and can talk. When possible, patients should be asked for clinical symptoms, including dyspnea, exercise capacity, recurrent infections, skin discoloration, hemoptysis, presyncope or syncope, and pedal edema. Physical examination is critical and often is the only indication of the disease. It should include thorough inspection, palpation, and auscultation. Inspection should particularly be done for cyanosis, nail clubbing, growth stunting, jugular venous distension, pedal edema, and breathing difficulty. Palpation should be done to notice any thrill, heave, or displacement of the apex beat.

Characteristic murmurs are present in different types of shunts at different locations, which aid in diagnosis. Typical murmurs heard are fixed widely split S2 with ejection systolic murmur at the pulmonary area in ASD, holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border in VSD, and continuous machinery murmur in PDA. The murmur in TOF would be due to the pulmonic stenosis and not due to the concomitantly present VSD, and systolic ejection sound will be heard at the left upper sternal border.
