Intensive care physicians can initiate appropriate ventilatory settings to prevent ventilator-induced lung injury in ARDS and non-ARDS patients. A cardiology and pulmonology consults may be required to rule out cardiogenic pulmonary edema and pulmonary infections, respectively. Lung biopsy is rarely performed to prove ventilator-induced lung injury.
