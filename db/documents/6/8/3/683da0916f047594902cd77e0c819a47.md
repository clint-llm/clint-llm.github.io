Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis is potentially very serious with high mortality, predicted by the extent and severity at presentation (see SCORTEN and ALDEN above).

Mean adjusted mortality reported for the Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2009-2012 (US) was 4.8% for SJS, 19.4% for SJS/TEN overlap, and 14.8% for TEN.

In Créteil, France, 66 of 361 patients diagnosed with Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis died (18%): 2% with SJS, 12% with SJS/TEN overlap, and 26% with TEN.
