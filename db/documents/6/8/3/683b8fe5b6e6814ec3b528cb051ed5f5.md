It has been inferred that Asherman’s syndrome has a constitutional component, explaining why it occurs only in a fraction of the individuals undergoing endometrial instrumentation and also explaining its occurrence in individuals without any preceding endometrial trauma. Besides, there appears to be a vulnerable time in the postpartum period when the process of curettage is likely to incite maximal damage to the endometrium, especially the basalis layer, resulting in a higher rate of adhesion formation. This period includes the second, third, and fourth postpartum weeks.

Although Dilatation and curettage (D&C) being the most frequently used intervention for removing Retained products of conception(RPOC), hysteroscopic resection, in comparison, is associated with lower rates of intrauterine adhesion formation. Hysteroscopic resection gives the advantage of direct visualization of the uterine chamber, thus allowing the removal of RPOC with minimal damage to the endometrium.
