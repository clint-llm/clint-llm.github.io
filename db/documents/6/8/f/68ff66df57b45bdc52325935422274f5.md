The following parameters are set by the VNS nurse, in conjunction with the neurologist, after the insertion of the VNS by the surgeon

- Pulse width (microseconds) - length of time of a square pulse of current

- Current intensity (milliampere) - amplitude, or strength, of the electrical pulse. VNS is most often delivered as current-controlled, rather than voltage-controlled.

- Frequency (Hertz) - total number of cycles (the beginning of a pulse to the beginning of the next pulse) in a second.

- On-Off Time - "On-time" is the time period in which the stimulation is delivered above an intensity of 0 mA (active stimulation) and the “off-time” is the time period when no stimulation is delivered (0 mA) (rest period).

- Duration of stimulation - cumulative time of VNS treatment.
