The modern anesthesia machine implementing a closed-circuit system allows for recycling inhaled gases (i.e., oxygen, nitrous oxide, isoflurane, sevoflurane, etc.), resulting in a significant reduction in environmental pollution.  Advances in carbon dioxide absorbents have allowed carbon dioxide to be absorbed and filtered out from exhaled gases so that oxygen and volatile anesthetics can be re-used.  The effectiveness of recycling gases can be compounded by utilizing the practice of low-flow anesthesia (gas flows less than alveolar ventilation).  Anesthesia circuits without a closed-circuit system may be used to administer anesthesia; however, at a significant financial cost to administer anesthetic and significant environmental impact when implemented widely.
