DT has a varied pattern of clinical presentation, characterized by a slow-growing tumor, that can stabilize and can even undergo spontaneous remission. DT commonly occurs in the rectus abdomins muscle, head and neck region, pelvis, and in the extremities. DT is also known to occur in association with pregnancy and with the use of oral contraceptive pills; and it is known to regress with menopause, indicating a potential influence of the female sex hormonal environment. Breast desmoid can be associated with surgery or implants. One in four cases has a history of trauma or surgery at the site of desmoid. DT also has a propensity to recur in the same area causing a lot of local destruction; however, it has no capacity to metastasize.Â Patients with FAP are at a much higher risk of developing DT (Up to 25% higher than the general population). In patients with DT, FAP can be diagnosed in up to 5% of patients. The peak incidence is in the late second decade of life, although, it can occur at any age.

The physical exam is usually benign unless the tumor causes pressure symptoms. They can certainly mimic cancer of the respective organ (for example; a DT occurring in the breast can mimic breast cancer), hence a biopsy is mandatory to accurately diagnose a DT.
