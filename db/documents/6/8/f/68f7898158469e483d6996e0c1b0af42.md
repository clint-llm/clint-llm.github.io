The patients and their families should be informed that the disease is generally mild and self-limited. They should be told about the appropriate management strategy that includes supportive care with pain control, adequate hydration, and a healthy diet. The patients should be managed at home but should be monitored closely for the development of any complications, such as difficulty in eating or drinking, or worsening of lesions. The patients and their families (especially in the case of young children) should be in regular contact with the primary treating physician. The patient should also be educated about the recurrence of the oral lesions (herpes labialis or cold sores) that may develop in one-third of the patients who develop primary herpetic gingivostomatitis.
