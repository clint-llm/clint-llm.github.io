The AchA is the most distal branch of the ICA, before its bifurcation, and supplies several vital structures in the brain that are responsible for vision and motor function. The AchA arises from the posterior wall of the ICA and commonly originates 2 to 5 mm distal to the Pcom.

During its course as the cisternal segment, the AchA provides its most prominent vascular supply to the posterior limb of the internal capsule,Â  the optic tract, and the lateral geniculate nucleus.
