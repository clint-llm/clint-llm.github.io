Tracheoinnominate artery fistula is a rare disorder but if not recognized is fatal. Besides the physician, all nurses who look after patients with a tracheostomy must be aware of the condition. The key is prevention. Both the nurse and respiratory therapist must ensure that there is a long flexible tube connected to the tracheostomy tube, which allows for flexibility is motions. Anytime the nurse visualizes bright red blood around the tracheostomy or can fell pulsations of the tracheostomy tube, the surgeon should be immediately notified. The tracheal cuff pressure must be regularly monitored, and bleeding from the tracheostomy site must be reported to the critical care specialist. If the diagnosis is suspected, the nurse, the respiratory therapist and the physician must know how to protect the airway and manage the bleeding, until a thoracic surgeon has been consulted.

**Outcomes**

For patients with Tracheoinnominate artery fistula who do not undergo surgery, death is inevitable. Even those who undergo surgery do not have a prolonged lifespan.Â Survivors often have residual neurological deficits when the innominate artery is ligated. Many of these patients often have other comorbidities which also do not tolerate this insult.
