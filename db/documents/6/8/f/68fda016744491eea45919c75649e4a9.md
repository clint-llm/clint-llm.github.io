Treatment depends on the disease stage.

Primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis is treated with a single dose of intramuscular (IM) penicillin G benzathine 2.4 million units. Alternative therapies include doxycycline 100 mg orally (PO) twice daily for 14 days or ceftriaxone 1 to 2 gm IM or intravenously (IV) daily for 10 to 14 days or tetracycline 100 mg PO 4 times daily for 14 days.

Late latent syphilis is treated with IM penicillin G benzathine 2.4 million units once weekly for three weeks. Alternative therapies include doxycycline 100 mg PO twice daily for 28 days or tetracycline 100 mg PO four times daily for 28 days.

Tertiary syphilis is treated with IM penicillin G benzathine 2.4 million units once weekly for three weeks.

Neurosyphilis is treated with IV penicillin G aqueous 18-24 million units daily for 10 to 14 days.

Patients with a high titer of secondary syphilis can develop Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, which is an immune-mediated self-limited reaction that occurs within 2 to 24 hours of treatment and is characterized by high fever, headache, myalgias, and rash.
