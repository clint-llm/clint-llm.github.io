A 2016 study evaluated the role confidence plays in overall arithmetic in drug calculation skills. Study participants attended remedial math classes from a wide range of educational backgrounds and age dynamics seeking a first degree in nursing, a foundation degree, or post-registration courses (Shelton, 2016). The study revealed one-third of students feel a lack of confidence, which originated in an earlier stage of education, dating back to a primary school environment (Shelton, 2016). The study concluded that confidence plays a role in dosage calculations and the overall performance of mathematicalÂ calculations and can be improved in an environment that fosters a deep-learning approach (Shelton, 2016).
