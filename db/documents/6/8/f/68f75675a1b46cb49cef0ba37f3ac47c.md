If menopause occurs at 45 years of age or older, a diagnosis of menopausal can be made clinically with no testing. In younger women, it is necessary to exclude other diagnoses that cause secondary amenorrhea. The most common cause of amenorrhea is pregnancy, and it should be ruled out first.

- **Anatomic defects:**Other causes of amenorrhea can be from anatomic defects, such as Asherman’s syndrome, the scarring of the uterine cavity after a dilation and curettage (D and C) procedure. Obstruction of the uterine outflow tract is another anatomic defect. In addition, infections and scarring (i.e., tuberculosis) can cause anatomic defects.

- **Hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis:**Amenorrhea can also result from a dysfunction in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. For this reason, hypothalamic dysfunction should be examined. Obesity, malignancy, and anorexia nervosa should be considered as they can cause hypothalamic deficiency. Pituitary dysfunctions, such as hyperprolactinemia, Sheehan syndrome (necrosis of the anterior pituitary), and pituitary adenoma should be worked up. Ovarian dysfunctions like ovarian tumors, polycystic ovarian disease, and premature ovarian failure.

- **Endocrine gland disorders:**Amenorrhea can also result from other endocrine gland disorders, such as thyroid dysfunction, which is the most common endocrine gland disorder. Also, consider adrenal gland disorders such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia and Cushing disease/syndrome.
