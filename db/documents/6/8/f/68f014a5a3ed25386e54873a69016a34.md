The diagnosis and management of St Louis encephalitis are best in the presence of an interprofessional team that includes a neurologist, internist, infectious disease expert, emergency department physician, nurse practitioner, and an intensivist. There is no effective antiviral therapy for St. Louis encephalitis. Management is limited to supportive care with intravenous (IV) fluids and antipyretics.

Patient education in preventing the transmission of the disease via mosquito avoidance is an important intervention to avoid the morbidity associated with SLEV infection.

In terms of mortality, the overall outlook for most patients with St Louis Encephalitis is good. However, residual neurological sequelae have been reported.
