Vernal keratoconjunctivitis is a ubiquitous clinical entity in tropical climates. Thus, all ophthalmologists and trained health workers must know this common entity's common presentations and management. Any patients suspected of VKC who are not responding well to antihistaminic or mast cell stabilizers should be referred to an ophthalmologist for consideration for starting a short course of steroids. Recurrent or recalcitrant cases should be considered for long-term use of immunosuppressants and advised regular follow-ups.
