The dizziness resulting from a stable vestibulopathy (such as loss of a vestibular organ, or one-time damage to a vestibular organ) can typically be alleviated by central compensation, which can be facilitated by physiotherapy and rehabilitation. Diseases that cause unstable vestibulopathy (a progressive or otherwise changing abnormality of the vestibular apparatus, Meniere disease being the prototypical example) are less likely to be centrally compensated. Failing medical therapy and an extended course of vestibular rehabilitation, unstable vestibulopathy may need to be addressed by vestibular ablation.

Labyrinthectomy is one option for the surgical ablation of the affected organ(s) of the vestibular system, essentially converting an unstable vestibulopathy to a stable one. Other options include intratympanic gentamicin (otherwise described as chemical labyrinthectomy, intentionally introducing a vestibulotoxic agent to the affected vestibular apparatus), or a vestibular nerve section.
