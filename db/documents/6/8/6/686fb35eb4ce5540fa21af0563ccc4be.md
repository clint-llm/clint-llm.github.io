La Crosse encephalitis can present as a diagnostic challenge due to its nonspecific constellation of symptoms and low index of suspicion. Management of La Crosse encephalitis can involve coordination between numerous interprofessional providers, including nurses, emergency medicine clinicians, primary clinicians, infectious disease specialists, neurologists, neurosurgeons, and intensivists/neurointensivists. For patients requiring critical care, in addition to clinicians and nurses, an interprofessional care team involving respiratory therapists, nutritionists, and physical and occupational therapists plays an integral role in management. Given the possibility of long term sequelae such as cognitive delay, personality changes, and behavioral changes, social workers, as well as mental health and developmental specialists, can provide essential support.

Epidemiologists and public health specialists are also essential in providing educational support and public health services to populations affected by this disease. The overall burden of La Crosse encephalitis, considering health care costs and long term medical expenses ranges from $49,000 to $3 million dollars. The functional cost for individuals severely affected by La Crosse encephalitis is estimated to impact 18% to 92% of productive life years.
