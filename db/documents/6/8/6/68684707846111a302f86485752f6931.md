The exact etiology of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is complex and often results from an interplay between genetic, environmental, and psychosocial factors.

**Genetics**

It is estimated that heritability of ODD is around 50%, and there is a substantial genetic overlap with conduct disorder (CD).

**Environmental Factors**

Childhood maltreatment and harsh, inconsistent parenting are commonly found in families of children with ODD.

**Psychosocial Factors**

Temperamental factors such as irritability, impulsivity, poor frustration, tolerance, and high levels of emotional reactivity are commonly associated with ODD. While not all children diagnosed with ODD show callous and unemotional traits, it has been shown that such traits are highly heritable and may be seen more frequently in a subset of children with more significant disruptive behaviors. In addition, peer rejection, deviant peer groups, poverty, neighborhood violence, and other unstable social or economic factors are known to exert significant negative effects on childrenâ€™s behaviors and may contribute to the development of ODD.
