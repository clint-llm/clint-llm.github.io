Fuchs uveitis syndrome (FUS) is a chronic form of unilateral uveitis manifesting as heterochromia, a unique clinical presentation. The exact etiology of FUS is unknown. Fuchs has had many theories about what caused this unique pathology; however, many of these have been largely disproven over the years, with the infectious theory remaining one of the more probable causes. Most patients with FUS experience changes in vision mainly due to secondary complications, such as cataracts and glaucoma. This activity will focus on an interprofessional team's etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and management of FUS.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of Fuchs uveitis syndrome.
- Outline the theorized pathophysiology of Fuchs uveitis syndrome.
- Review the findings that differentiate Fuchs uveitis syndrome from other common causes of uveitis. 
- Summarize the prognosis of Fuchs uveitis syndrome.
