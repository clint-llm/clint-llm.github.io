A fracture of the cribriform plate is a potentially serious injury that can be easily overlooked. When present, it is typically indicative of severe head or facial trauma. Fractures of the cribriform plate can be associated with septal hematoma, olfactory dysfunction, cerebral spinal fluid leak, or infection, which can progress to meningitis. Avoiding potentially high morbidity sequela requires a high index of suspicion and prompt diagnosis. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of cribriform plate fractures and explains the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of cribriform plate fractures.
- Summarize the appropriate evaluation process for cribriform plate fractures.
- Review the treatment considerations for a patient with cribriform plate fracture.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team in order to improve outcomes for patients with a cribriform plate fracture.
