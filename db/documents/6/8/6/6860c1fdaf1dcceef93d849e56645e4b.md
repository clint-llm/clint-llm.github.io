All personnel working in EMS should have at least basic levels of knowledge and training in airway management. Those expected to provide advanced interventions such as intubation should have adequate background training and experience and ongoing mentoring and maintenance of skills. Advanced techniques generally require the presence of more than one trained responder and should not be undertaken solo if possible due to the need to provide multiple interventions to such patients simultaneously.
