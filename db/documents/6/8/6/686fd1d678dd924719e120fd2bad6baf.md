There are, in effect, three different operations to be performed:

- 1. Donor procurement

- 2. Recipient explanation

- 3. Recipient implantation

The **donor procurement**technique varies somewhat between institutions.

Cold organ preservation solution is delivered to the heart via an aortic cannula proximal to the aortic clamp and delivered to the lungs via a pulmonary artery cannula. The absence of aortic insufficiency is confirmed to ensure preservation solution coronary flow. To decompress the heart, the left atrial appendage is amputated and allowed to drain, as ice saline is applied to the organs. After administration of preservation solution, the heart and lung are removed en bloc. The inferior vena cava is divided, leaving enough cuff for the liver team; the superior vena cava is divided with a more generous cuff to avoid damage to the sinoatrial node. The pericardium is separated from the diaphragm. The aorta is divided at the level of the innominate artery. The anesthesia team is asked to pull upward on the endotracheal tube then mildly inflate the lungs and maintain them inflated at low pressure as the trachea is stapled with a thoracoabdominal stapler. Some surgeons will dissect the trachea from the esophagus in the donor's chest; others perform this maneuver on the back table. The organs are then packaged for transport.

The**recipient explantation**(cardiopneumonectomy) proceeds through a median sternotomy, with careful dissection into the pericardium and bilateral pleural spaces, especially in patients with a prior thoracic surgical history. Dissection is often more complicated in patients requiring heart-lung transplants, particularly those with Eisenmenger syndrome on account of their large mediastinal venous collaterals. During dissection, it is important is to avoid injury to the phrenic, vagus, and recurrent laryngeal nerves. Once dissection is complete, the patient is cannulated through the aorta, superior vena cava, and inferior vena cava, and is placed on cardiopulmonary bypass and cooled. The heart is resected, dividing the aorta just distal to the aortic valve and the pulmonary artery just distal to the pulmonic valve. When the right atrium is entered to divide it, some teams will divide at the level of the atrium to leave a cuff of atrial tissue around both the superior and inferior venae cavae; however, other teams will divide at the level of the cava proper, to avoid incorporating arrhythmogenic tissue in the anastomosis.

The left atrium is divided at the level of the atrioventricular groove. Having removed the heart, the lungs are then explanted by clamping or stapling each mainstem bronchus and dividing the bronchi and hilar vessels distally. The lungs are then removed en bloc from the chest. With the heart and lungs no longer obscuring the field, the mediastinum can be prepared. The remnant pulmonary arteries are excised, excepting at the ligamentum arteriosum, to provide a buffer for the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The trachea is prepared by dividing it at the level of the right mainstem bronchus. Many centers will implant the new donor hila anterior to the phrenic nerve pedicles for improved mobility to inspect the posterior mediastinum, but some centers still implant the hila posterior to the phrenic nerve pedicles for improved exposure if reoperation is required. Whichever strategy is chosen, the dissection is completed without phrenic injury, and mediastinal hemostasis is achieved before the donor heart and lungs are implanted and again obscure the exposure.

The **recipient implantation**procedure begins with the preparation of the graft on the back table. Non-essential mediastinal tissue is resected. Any atrial defects present in the heart are closed. The donor trachea is trimmed to the level of the first or second cartilaginous ring above the carina. Generous saline irrigation and a dedicated suction catheterÂ are used to clear the donor lungs of mucus. When all is ready, the graft is lowered into the recipient's chest and kept cold with periodic cold irrigation or cold gauze pad wrappings.

The anastomoses begin with the trachea; the recipient trachea at the former level of the right mainstem is sutured to the donor trachea at the level one or two rings above the carina. Some surgeons use only running permanent suture; others use running suture on the membranous trachea and interrupted suture on the cartilaginous trachea. The tracheal anastomosis is covered with nearby tissue, either lymphatic or pericardial, to give a buffer against erosion into the neighboring great vessels. Once this anastomosis is complete, the chest is irrigated to dilute potential tracheal contamination. Then attention is turned to the blood vessels. Different surgeons prefer differing orders of anastomoses of the aorta, superior, and inferior venae cavae. The prior left atrial appendage defect created as a vent during donor procurement may be used again as a vent before it is then sutured closed. Once all anastomoses are complete, and the circulation is aspirated for air, attention is turned toward meticulous hemostasis. During hemostasis, the grafts may need to be gently rotated to achieve adequate exposure.

Finally, the patient's anticoagulation is reversed, cardiopulmonary bypass is weaned, chest tubes and pacer wires are placed, the patient's chest is closed, and the patient is brought to recover in the intensive care unit.
