Alzheimer disease is the most common cause of dementia, as it is responsible for 70 to 80% of all cases of dementia. It can occur sporadically or be familial.

Vascular dementia accounts for approximately 15% of all dementia cases. Its incidence increases with age and doubles every 5.3 years. Risk factors for vascular dementia include hypercholesteremia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and smoking.

Lewy body dementia accounts for approximately 5% of dementia cases. The epidemiological data may not be completely accurate because the diagnosis of Lewy boy dementia is often missed.

Parkinson disease dementia accounts for approximately 10% of cases of dementia.

Frontotemporal dementia is attributed to 25% of dementia cases in patients older than 65 years of age. It is, however, the second most common cause of dementia in patients younger than 65 years. There are, however, many limitations in the epidemiological studies of frontotemporal dementia, in part due to the inherent difficulty in identifying frontotemporal dementia.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is rare and occurs in about 1 to 2 cases per million per year globally.

Mixed dementia is a condition in which patients have more than one type of dementia. In this condition, Alzheimer disease with vascular dementia is the most common coexistent dementia.
