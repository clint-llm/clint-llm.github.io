The type II hypersensitivity reaction develops in response to cell surface modifications or matrix-associated antigens generating antigenic epitopes that are regarded as foreign by the immune system. The most common causes include medications like penicillin, thiazides, cephalosporins, and methyldopa. TheÂ drug molecule either binds to the surface of cells resulting in a neoantigen or alters the epitopes of the existing self-antigen on the cell surface. This directs the immune system to recognize modified antigens as foreign, with the breakdown of the immune tolerance and the production of antibodies directed to self-antigens.

Immune tolerance is the phenomenon by which the immune system recognizes its antigens and does not generate an antibody response against its antigens. Factors that contribute to the breakdown of tolerance promote the production of antibodies against self-antigens.
