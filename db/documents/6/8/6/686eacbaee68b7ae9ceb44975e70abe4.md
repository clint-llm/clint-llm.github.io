Aneurysms are divided according to their morphology into:

i) S**accular aneurysms**that are pouch-like protrusions of the vessel wall, usually arising in cerebral artery bifurcations (A);

ii) **Fusiform aneurysms**that are dilatations of the vessel wall that do not lead to the formation of a separate saccular pouch (B); and

iii) dolichoectasias are elongated, tortuous, and sometimes dilated vessel segments (C).

Furthermore, a rare fourth type of cerebral artery aneurysm is the dissecting aneurysm that usually has a fusiform shape (B), but originates from acute dissection or tearing of the arterial wall layers.
