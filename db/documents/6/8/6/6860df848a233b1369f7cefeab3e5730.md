The risk factors for varicose veins include female sex, multiparity, body weight, constipation, and history of venous thrombosis.

In one of the recent studies, researchers applied machine learning to probe the potential risk factors of varicose veins in almost 500,000 individuals in the UK Biobank.

Recent mendelian randomization studies unveiled the positive and inverse association of genetically-predicted factors. Accordingly, it has been demonstrated that height, body mass index, smoking, and circulating iron levels were positively associated with the risk of varicose veins. However, circulating minerals, including calcium and zinc levels, showed an inverse association with varicose veins development. Several putative predictors that have been variably reported in the literature, including hypertension, age at menopause, and smoking, were not reported among the top predictors with machine learning approaches.

Some uncertain risk factors, including oral contraceptive pills use, are less likely to correlate independently.CASZ1Â gene, a well-established blood pressure locus.
