Scapholunate advanced collapse (SLAC) is a characteristic degenerative clinical wrist condition of progressive deformity, instability, and arthritis that affects the radiocarpal and mid-carpal joints of the wrist. Characteristically, the arthritic deformity and progressive instability occur due to a long-term, chronic dissociation between the scaphoid carpal bones and the lunate bone. This condition is the result of an untreated scapholunate interosseous ligament (SLIL) injury. Patients will have a history of trauma, and some degree of pain made worse by heavy use. The mild disease needs only non-operative treatment such as NSAIDs, wrist splints, and corticosteroid injections with operative management indicated for more complicated cases. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of scapholunate advanced collapse and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the common mechanisms of injury and types of activities that lead to scapholunate advanced collapse.
- Review the examination and evaluation process for diagnosing scapholunate advanced collapse, including any imaging.
- Describe the appropriate treatment and management options for scapholunate advanced collapse.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to manage mild cases using wrist splints and anti-inflammatory drugs, which will improve outcomes for patients with scapholunate advanced collapse.
