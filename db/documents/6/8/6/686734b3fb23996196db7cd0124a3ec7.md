Non-nutritive sucking habits such as thumb sucking can be a risk factor for the development of malocclusion or, specifically, anterior open bite. Finger sucking has been known to cause an asymmetrical anterior open bite, worst the side where digit sucking happens, and also to be dependant on the duration and frequency of the habit.

There is also a positive association between severe malocclusion and prolonged duration of thumb sucking.

Some other of the proposed negative associations with thumb sucking include delayed development of oral functionality. Regarding speech disorders, there is limited research, and the association with this behavior is uncertain. There have been several studies, like the one done by Baker et al., where it was reported that of the 15% of Australian preschoolers engaged in thumb or finger sucking, there was no association noted with the presence or severity of phonological impairment.
