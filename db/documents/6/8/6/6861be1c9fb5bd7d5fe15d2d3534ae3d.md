Blood supply to the arms is carried by the left and right subclavian arteries, which arise from the arch of the aorta - the left directly and the right via the brachiocephalic, or innominate, artery. The subclavian arteries then run beneath the clavicle and become the axillary arteries as they pass the lateral margins of the first ribs. From there, the axillary arteries become the brachial arteries after passing the teres major muscles; they then supply blood to the upper arm, continuing distally to the antecubital fossa, where they divide into the radial and ulnar arteries. The radial and ulnar arteries supply blood flow to the forearm and eventually to the hand. The radial artery runs along the lateral aspect of the forearm between the brachioradialis and flexor carpi radialis muscles. Just distal to the wrist, it splits into superficial and deep palmar branches. The ulnar artery runs along the medial aspect of the forearm and at the wrist runs through Guyon's canal, where it splits into its deep and superficial palmar branches. These arches form the basis of collateral blood flow to the hands.
