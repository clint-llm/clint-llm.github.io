There are anatomical variances in the points of entry and exit, paths, and locations of veins, arteries, and nerves in the axilla; this is of importance during surgical procedures in the axillary region like axillary lymph node biopsies. The medial cutaneous nerve is the smallest branch of the brachial plexus that passes through the axilla and runs alongside the axillary vein. When it enters the arm, it descends along the medial side of the brachial vein. In the mid-portion of the arm, it pierces the deep fascia and branches into its terminal cutaneous branches. The medial cutaneous nerve innervates the skin of the medial arm down to the medial epicondyle of the humerus. A study of 100 patients identified the medial cutaneous nerve of the arm in 22% of the cases evaluated. When found, the medial cutaneous nerve of the arm most commonly penetrated the axilla through the apex and crossed the axilla alongside the axillary vein. In 36.4% of cases that identified the medial cutaneous nerve, the nerve deviated from the path of the axillary vein during its path through the axilla, and, in 13.6% of cases, it split into two branches during its path through the axilla.
