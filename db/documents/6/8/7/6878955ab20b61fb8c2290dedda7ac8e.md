- The "blue dot sign" is a classic physical exam finding unique to testicular appendix torsion. However, it is often absent in the setting of testicular appendix torsion and can be falsely positive in cases of true testicular torsion.

- Because of their lack of function and potential to torse, the appendix testes and epididymal appendix are commonly removed if encountered during an elective scrotal exploration for other purposes.

- Often, testicular appendage torsion in prepubertal boys gets misdiagnosed as epididymitis based on scrotal ultrasound imaging, as both can demonstrate epididymal hypervascularity. Epididymitis should be considered highly unlikely in a pre-sexual boy with no urologic abnormalities, recent catheterization, or history of urinary tract infections.

- If a testicular appendage is more than 5.6 mm on ultrasound, it should be considered suspicious for torsion of the appendage.

- Patients with testicular appendage torsion are likely to be younger than those with testicular torsion. They also will lack the "angel wing deformity" and not demonstrate the "high riding" testicle position usually associated with testicular torsion.

- Rare causes of an acute scrotum can include incarcerated hernias and traumatic testicular ruptures.

- There have been reported cases of simultaneous testicular torsion with testicular appendage torsion.

- It is possible to have torsion of a testicular appendage in an undescended testicle.
