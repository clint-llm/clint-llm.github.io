The umbilical cord is the lifeline between the baby and mother during pregnancy and is cut after birth. The umbilical cord stump then gradually dries and typically falls off within 5 to 15 days. Both skin and enteric bacteria may colonize the devitalized tissue of the stump and lead to infection. Omphalitis is, therefore, a polymicrobial infection and the most common pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. If maternal infection with chorioamnionitis is suspected, anaerobic bacteria such as Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium tetani can also contribute to infection.
