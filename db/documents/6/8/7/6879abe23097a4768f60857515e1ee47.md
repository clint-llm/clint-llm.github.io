Ever since the first intraocular lens was implanted in 1949, cataract surgery has continued to advance, and patient expectations continue to rise. Accurate biometric readings are crucial for achieving the best refractive outcome. An interprofessional team of ophthalmologists and ophthalmic technicians may play a role during the cataract pre-operative assessment.

A detailed medical and ophthalmic history is essential, as certain conditions may affect the choice of biometer used or the accuracy of the results. All members of the practice should understand the advantages, limitations, and clinical indications for each modality. Understanding the technical factors that contribute to inaccurate readings, such as corneal compression and probe misalignment, is especially important for technicians.
