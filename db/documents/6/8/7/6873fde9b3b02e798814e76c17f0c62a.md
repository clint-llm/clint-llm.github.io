Hypersensitivity reactions are experienced immediately after starting the drug. Minor reactions are observed in 40% of cases and cause urticaria or skin rash. Significant reactions comprise nausea, vomiting, flushing, urticaria, shortness of breath, wheezing, tachycardia, hypotension, and abdominal or chest pain.

Neuropathy presents as a tingling sensation in hands and feet with numbness. Rarely, the patient may also complain of motor weakness and urinary or fecal incontinence. Examination typically reveals sensory loss in gloves and stocking distribution. Motor and autonomic examinations are often unremarkable.

Mucositis can be caused by all the taxanes and is characterized by oral ulcers, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

Docetaxel-induced fluid retention is often characterized by pedal and ankle edema, weight gain, abdominal distension, shortness of breath, and facial swelling.

Skin toxicity is a common side effect of docetaxel. Most patients experience mild dermatitis, nail discoloration, and alopecia; however, the severe spectrum of toxicity results in hand and foot desquamation, onycholysis, and erythroderma.

Cardiac abnormalities with paclitaxel are benign, and bradycardia is the most common incidental finding.

Ophthalmic toxicity, though uncommon (1 to 2%), could come in many forms, including meibomian gland dysfunction, cystoid macular edema, and canalicular obstruction.
