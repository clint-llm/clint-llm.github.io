In addition to taking a good history, it is vital to perform a thorough evaluation. Ocular health exam should typically include visual acuity, visual field, extraocular muscles, pupil, binocular vision testing, intraocular pressure, anterior segment, and posterior segment evaluation with dilated fundus exams. Supplemental testing such as formalized visual field testing, color vision tests, contrast sensitivity tests, visual evoked potential, electroretinography, electrooculography, optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography, genetic testing may be necessary to help determine the etiology, monitor and properly manage the condition.
