Empiric treatment with acyclovir may be initiated in patients presenting with meningeal signs, fever, acute encephalopathy, and signs of inflammation in either the blood or CSF.

However, the mainstay of treatment for ADEM is immunosuppression with high-dose intravenous glucocorticoids. These can be started simultaneously with acyclovir or antibiotics on the initial patient presentation.
