There are no specific preoperative preparatory requirements for patients undergoing neck dissection other than planning of the incisions for neck dissection, particularly if the primary tumor is undergoing resection simultaneously. Also, preparation of the neck dissection incisions must take into consideration any reconstructive effort required to repair the surgical defect created after the excision of the primary tumor. General endotracheal anesthesia is essential for performing a neck dissection, and the use of paralytic agents should be discussed between the surgeon and anesthetist. The patient placement is in the supine position with the head elevated to 30 degrees. The neck is hyper-extended with the use of a shoulder roll, and rotated to the opposite side.
