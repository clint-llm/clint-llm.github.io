A German physician, Rudolf Virchow is the first ever to coin the term of thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in 1855. The **Virchow Triad**refers to hypercoagulability, stasis or turbulence in blood flow and endothelial dysfunction. Despite being flushed with anticoagulants such as heparin, catheter placement in the internal jugular vein not only causes changes in the blood flow but also causes injury to the endothelium of the vein. In a retrospective review by Major KM et al. showed that the presence of a central venous catheter was a significant factor for IJV thrombosis.
