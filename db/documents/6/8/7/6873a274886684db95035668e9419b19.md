The close differentials of intermittent exotropia include all other forms of exotropia, which can be distinguished based on history and clinical examination. These include

- Constant exotropia: This usually appears within the first 6 months of life. This is constant and does not resolve spontaneously.

- Sensory exotropia: This is usually seen in patients with poor visual function in one eye. This develops in an older child or an adult as the eye with defective vision starts drifting gradually.

- Consecutive exotropia: This refers to exotropia in a previously esotropic eye. This can result secondary to surgical overcorrection or spontaneous consecutive exotropia in a deviating eye with poor vision.

- Duane's retraction syndrome â€“ This condition is characterized by variable limitation of adduction or abduction and can present as exotropia or esotropia or an orthotropia. Ocular movements, palpebral fissure changes, and, if needed, electromyography can help differentiate this condition.
