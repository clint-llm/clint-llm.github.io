Bacterial: The most common etiology of corneal ulcers is infectious, with bacterial pathogens responsible for a majority of the cases.Staphylococcus aureus, coag negative staphylococcus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus fusarium species are the most commonly implicated in polymicrobial keratitis with trauma being the most common inciting factor.

Viral: HSV is a common cause of viral keratitis as well as the most common cause of unilateral infectious corneal blindness in the developed world.

Fungal: Fungal etiologies account for only 5 to 10% of all corneal infections. They are more common in warmer, humid parts of the country and are most often precipitated by trauma to the cornea with subsequent exposure to plant or vegetable material.Aspergillus, Fusarium, Scedosporium apiospermum, phaeohyphpmycetes, Candida albicans, and other Candida species.

Protozoan: Acanthamoeba is a free-living protozoan found in freshwater and in soil that can cause keratitis and corneal ulcers primarily in contact lens wearers.

Autoimmune disease: While most corneal ulcers are infectious it is important to be able to recognize noninfectious causes of corneal ulcers as well. Peripheral ulcerative keratitis (PUK) is a form of noninfectious keratitis found in association with many systemic diseases. After anterior uveitis, PUK is the second most common ocular complication of autoimmune disorders.
