Brain herniation can cause severe clinical disability or death. In some cases of subfalcine herniation, the patients are alert and can make their own decisions. Brain herniation is potentially reversible with appropriate and timely therapeutic interventions. The family members and the relatives should be thoroughly counseled about the patient's herniation syndrome and possible treatment protocols to help in shared decision-making. A timely diagnosis and management will ultimately benefit the patient and improve the clinical outcome.
