**Radiographic**

Patients deemed medically stable, awake, and symptomatic should proceed with a radiographic evaluation of the spinal cord and axial skeleton.

**Clinical**

Central cord syndrome is a clinical diagnosis with a presentation that includes disproportionate impairment of the upper limb motor function compared to the lower limbs, along with varying degrees of sensory deficits below the level of the spinal cord lesion and possibly urinary or gastrointestinal dysfunction. Pouw et al. proposed that a difference of 10 between upper and lower limb motor scores on the International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI (ISNCSCI) may be a more objective diagnostic criterion.

The gold standard examination tool for any spinal cord injury is the ISNCSCI. More severe findings on neurological examination should raise suspicion of a cervical vertebral fracture. When central cord syndrome is associated with a cervical spine fracture,Â it can prolong recovery.
