There are a number of treatments used to treat FED symptoms of blurry vision and ocular pain. Medical treatments such as hyperosmotic saline drops or ointment can facilitate corneal dehydration. For symptomatic blurry vision in the mornings, some patients find it useful to use a hairdryer to place warm, dry air gently onto the cornea. Other supportive treatments and surgical procedures such as phototherapeutic keratectomy, amniotic membrane transplants, anterior stromal puncture, and conjunctival flaps can be used to relieve painful symptoms, especially those associated with ruptured bullae in later stages of the disease.

FED is the primary indication for corneal transplantation in the U.S., and FED accounted for 36% of the nearly 47000 corneal transplants performed in the United States in 2016.

More recent potential approaches to managing corneal endothelial cell dysfunction include the use of Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632, which promotes cell adhesion and proliferation of endothelial cells.
