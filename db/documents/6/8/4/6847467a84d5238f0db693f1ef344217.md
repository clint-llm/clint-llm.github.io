Adenocarcinoma is a common diagnosis and the management of these invasive cancers is complex depending on the primary site, stage of cancer, performance status of the patient. Various healthcare providers are involved in the management of adenocarcinoma including pathologists, surgical oncologists, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, primary care physicians, radiologists, nurses, and pharmacists.

Effective management of the disease requires excellent interpersonal communication and collaboration between team members for providing improved patient-centered care. An interdisciplinary tumor board discussion is recommended in the management of these patients which helps with effective communication, timely treatment planning, and good outcomes. Involving the patients and their families in treatment decisions are improves outcomes in these patient populations. Most importantly, screening and management guidelines exist as a result of various conferences and exhaustive research (clinical trials, meta-analysis, systematic reviews) where health care providers come and work together towards common goals and share their ideas.

Revision of guidelines is critical to incorporate better, practical, and more feasible methods. In situations where enough data isn't available, expert opinion from a specialist may be taken to help better guide management. All this is possible with effective communication and coordination of care amongst different health care providers.
