The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) is a load-bearing structure between the lunate, triquetrum, and ulnar head. The function of the TFCC is to act as a stabilizer for the ulnar aspect of the wrist. The TFCC is at risk for either acute or chronic degenerative injury. Forced ulnar deviation and positive ulnar variation carry associations with injuries to the TFCC. Patients with TFCC injury will present with ulnar-sided wrist pain that may present with clicking or point tenderness between the pisiform and the ulnar head. MRI imaging is useful as a preliminary diagnostic tool; arthroscopy is the diagnostic gold standard. Treatment options include conservative therapies such as rest, NSAIDs, corticosteroid injections, and operative management. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of TFCC injuries and highlights the interprofessional team's role in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe a patient history consistent with triangular fibrocartilage complex injury. 
- Describe the physical exam consistent with triangular fibrocartilage complex injury.
- Describe the role of imaging in triangular fibrocartilage complex injury.
- Describe the interprofessional team management of triangular fibrocartilage complex injuries, including the role of surgery and the importance of post-operative care in order to avoid complications.
