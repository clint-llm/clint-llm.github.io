Early communication with a hyperbaric specialist is essential to provide timely treatment of arterial gas embolism. While stroke like symptoms and chest pain both occur with overexpansion injuries, the diagnosis of cerebral arterial gas embolism is a clinical one. Communication with specialists in cardiac and neurological emergencies may be appropriate, but should be done after the initiation of recompression unless the picture is atypical for arterial gas embolism.Â  Inpatient services should be notified as patients will require inpatient observation and typically more than one hyperbaric treatment.
