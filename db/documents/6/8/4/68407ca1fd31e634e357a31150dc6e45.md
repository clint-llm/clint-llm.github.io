The swan neck deformity develops from either loss of extension mechanism at the distal phalanx or tightening or overpull of the extensor mechanism on the proximal phalanx.

Initially, swan neck deformity can develop from loss of the extensor tendon at the terminal tendon at the distal phalanx, which over time can progress to the characteristic deformity. Injury to the terminal tendon can result from the following:

- A traumatic laceration to the extensor mechanism

- Closed avulsion from a direct blow on the distal phalanx of an extended digit

- Attrition by weakening from chronic inflammation at the DIP joint along with extensor tendon subluxation due to rheumatoid arthritis or any other inflammatory process

Hyperextension of the PIP joint can be due to the tightness of the intrinsic muscles and increased pull at the central slip. This could be secondary to rheumatoid arthritis, spasticity from traumatic brain injury, or stroke and intrinsic tightness alone.

Laxity of the volar plate is also a cause of swan neck deformity and the hyperextension seen at the PIP joint.
