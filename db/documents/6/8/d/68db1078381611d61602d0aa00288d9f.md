Cryoglobulins are proteins that precipitate from an individual’s serum or plasma at temperatures lower than 37°C. They can be a mixture of immunoglobulin (Ig) and complement components or immunoglobulins alone. These cryoglobulins deposit in medium and large-sized blood vessels throughout the body, causing endothelial injury and end-organ damage known as cryoglobulinemia. This activity describes the evaluation and management of cryoglobulinemia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of cryoglobulinemia.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of cryoglobulinemia.
- Summarize the management options available for cryoglobulinemia.
- Describe the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance cryoglobulinemia care and improve outcomes.
