Traditionally, carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been the primary method of treating high-grade asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid artery stenosis. A carotid endarterectomy involves exposure of the carotid artery and removal of plaque, most typically from the carotid bulb and the proximal internal carotid artery, via a neck incision. However, in vascular surgery, as in many other surgical specialties, minimally invasive techniques have evolved over the years. This activity describes the technique of carotid artery stenting, its indications, contraindications and potential complications.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the technique of carotid artery stenting.
- Review the indications for carotid artery stenting.
- Summarize the potential complications of 
carotid artery stenting.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients undergoing carotid artery stenting
