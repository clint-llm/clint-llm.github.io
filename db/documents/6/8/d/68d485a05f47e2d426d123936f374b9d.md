Decompression sickness occurs as a result of gas bubbles, referred to as evolved gas emboli, forming in tissues that can exert pressure on nerves, block blood vessels, and interact with proteins. There are two basic gas laws that explain this phenomenon.  Boyle’s law states that gas volume is inversely related to the pressure to which it is subjected, explaining the etiology of air embolism and barotrauma.  Henry’s law states that the amount of gas dissolved in liquid is directly proportional to the gas’s partial pressure, explaining the mechanism of decompression illness and nitrogen narcosis. Decompression illness can result in varying severity of symptoms that include pain and skin changes as well as neurologic and cardiopulmonary symptoms. The gas emboli form as a result of inert gas (nitrogen) that is dissolved in tissues at ground level, becomes supersaturated at altitude, and develops into bubbles. One interesting factor is that not all tissue dissolves gas at the same rate, with fat dissolving at least fivefold the nitrogen dissolved in blood.

Secondary effects also can occur, which may in part be responsible for some of those with delayed development of certain symptoms. Bubbles can cause endothelial damage, resulting in a capillary leak, platelet activation; and deposition is possible, as are other processes such as leukocyte-endothelial adhesion.
