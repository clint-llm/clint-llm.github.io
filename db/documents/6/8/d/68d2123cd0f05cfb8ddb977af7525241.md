The cough reflex has three components: an afferent sensory limb, a central processing center, and an efferent limb. Cough receptors are present in the pharynx and larynx, up to the segmental bronchi. Many types of sensory receptors respond to mechanical, inflammatory, thermal, and chemical stimuli. These are connected to the vagal afferent nerves. The cough center is located in the medulla and receives signals from these cough receptors. The efferent fibers reach the various muscles that produce the forced expiratory effort. Since the higher cortical centers influence the cough center, it is possible to produce or suppress a cough voluntarily. The stimulation of a complex reflex arc is needed for each cough.
