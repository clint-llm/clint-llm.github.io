The clinical significance of aberration in DNA organization is broad-reaching. This is highlighted by many disorders of histone methylation, including alpha thalassemia X-linked intellectual disability syndrome, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, Coffin-Lowry syndrome, and Rett Syndrome.

DNA packaging around histones is directly related to gene expression and is the foundation of the field of epigenetics. The extent to which epigenetics contributes to clinical presentations is still actively being determined, but the present body of evidence suggests that variable gene expression contributes to a range of pathologic processes involved in cancers, neurological disorders, and even consciousness, among many other disease states.

Important to the field of epigenetics is the fact that the changes associated with disease states are reversible, unlike mutations in the DNA sequence itself. With this in mind, the increased understanding of epigenetics has elucidated the potential to treat certain conditions by preventing or reversing the post-translational modifications to histone proteins. For example, methylation of a tumor suppressor gene or deacetylation of a histone protein associated with an oncogene likely contributes to carcinogenesis, so drugs that inhibit these processes have been trialed as potential cancer treatments.
