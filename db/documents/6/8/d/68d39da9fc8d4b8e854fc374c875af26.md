The procerus muscle receives nervous innervation from branches of the facial nerve. Recall that the facial nerve innervates the muscles of facial expression (derived from the second pharyngeal arch). Not all sources agree on the exact branches innervating the procerus muscle. Research has found the buccal, temporal, andÂ zygomatic branches of the facial nerve innervate the procerus muscle.
