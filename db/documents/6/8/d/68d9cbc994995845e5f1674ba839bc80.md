According to the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), pain is defined as an unpleasant experience (sensory and/or emotional) related to a potential or confirmed tissue damage or described in such terms.

**Nonopioid analgesic agents**

- **Acetaminophen (paracetamol)**: Mild to moderate pain, moderate to severe pain (as adjunctive therapy to opioids), and temporary reduction of fever. Acetaminophen should not be used for neuropathic pain since there is no documented effect.

- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: These drugs are used for mild-to-moderate pain, pain associated with inflammation, and temporary reduction of fever. Similar to the previous medication, NSAIDs have no evidence for the management of neuropathic pain. Some NSAIDs have other non-pain-related indications (eg., aspirin use for secondary prevention of myocardial infarction), which will not be covered in this review.

- **Antidepressant medications**: Selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), particularly duloxetine,  and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), especially amitriptyline, have demonstrated efficacy in a variety of neuropathic pain conditions. Thus they are recommended as the first line of treatment.

- **Antiepileptic medications**: Several antiepileptic drugs are also known for their analgesic properties through their mechanism of action of lowering neurotransmitter release or neuronal firing. The most common antiepileptics used for pain treatment are gabapentin and pregabalin.
- Gabapentin: Postherpetic neuralgia in adults and neuropathic pain.
- Pregabalin: Neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy or spinal cord injury, postherpetic neuralgia, and fibromyalgia.
- Oxcarbazepine and carbamazepine: trigeminal or glossopharyngeal neuralgia

- **Local anesthetics**: Lidocaine is among the most commonly used medications in this drug class, which is FDA approved for postherpetic neuralgia and recommended for peripheral neuropathic pain.

**Opioid Agents**

Opioids are a broad class of medications with structural resemblance to the natural plant alkaloids found in opium, which was originally derived from the resin of the opium poppy, Papaver somniferum.****They are recognized as the most effective and widely used drugs in treating severe pain.
