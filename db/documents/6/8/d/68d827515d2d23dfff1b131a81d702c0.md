As stated above, the brachial artery passes through the cubital fossa, bifurcating into the radial and ulnar arteries at the distal apex of the fossa. These arteries then continue down into the forearm to supply the anterior and posterior aspects of the lower arm, ending with the deep and superficial arches of the hand.

The two primary superficial veins of the arm have an essential communication in the roof of the cubital fossa - the median cubital vein. The cephalic vein commences on the anterolateral surface of the wrist, and the basilic vein begins on the anteromedial aspect of the wrist. They continue up the forearm into the arm, connecting with the median cubital vein on the way. The basilic vein joins with the brachial vein to form the axillary vein (at the lower border of teres major), with the cephalic vein then draining into the axillary vein within the axilla region.
