Cerebellar infarcts are treated largely like other ischemic cerebrovascular accidents. Patients with acute events having a clear time of onset within 4.5 hours may be candidates for thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA). However, given the difficulty of diagnosing posterior infarcts, this is often not possible. As with other strokes, thrombectomy can be an option. Since structures in the posterior circulation may have greater white matter content

Cerebellar strokes after day one develop progressive edema and subsequent herniation. So, it is very important to admit these patients to ICU and monitor them very closely. The earliest symptoms are severe headache, altered mental status, vomiting, and drowsiness.Â Large strokes with significant cerebral edema, especially if the intracranial pressure is elevated, often require extraventricular drains, ventriculostomy, or decompressive sub-occipital craniotomy. Neurosurgical removal of infarcted tissue or hematoma is also occasionally necessary. In these cases, rapidly reversible agents such as intravenous heparin should be used. In the acute setting, mannitol, hypertonic saline, or hyperventilation can also be helpful to temporarily reduce intracranial pressure.
