As noted above in the prognosis of renal cysts and the complications that can occur secondary to cysts and their treatment vary widely with the etiology of the cyst. Bosniak type I cysts can be safely observed and thus pose no risk of complication whereas Bosniak type IV cysts may require a radical surgery that is accompanied by a significant risk of complications such as damage to surrounding structures like the liver, spleen, or stomach. Patients with recessive (pediatric) polycystic kidney disease that survive their first few weeks of life will require lifelong dialysis or kidney transplant as do patients with dominant (adult) polycystic kidney disease who progress to end-stage renal disease. Dialysis can be complicated by infections or damage to vascular structures. Patients who receive transplants are at higher risk for infections due to immunosuppression as well as the complication profile that accompanies the major surgery entailed during a transplantation procedure.
