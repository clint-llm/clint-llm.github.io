**Indirect Calorimetry**

To validate RQ, it is important to calculate heat production by measuring pulmonary gas exchange first; this is known as indirect calorimetry. The method for measuring inspired oxygen and expired carbon dioxide is to calculate the resting energy expenditure (REE) and respiratory quotient (RQ). REE allows the nutritionist to understand how much they need to feed their patients.

**Respiratory Quotient and Respiratory Exchange Ratio**

Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) directly measures Vol CO2 released/Vol O2 absorbed at the mouth and does not require invasive procedures. Respiratory quotient, on the other hand, measures directly at the tissue, requiring an arterial and venous catheter while monitoring blood pressure for optimal results.

Carbohydrates are oxidized through aerobic respiration using RER, resulting in an equal ratio of CO2 release and oxygen consumption; this implies that 100% of carbohydrates are consumed to produce ATP.

- C6H12O2 + 6 O2  -> 6CO2 + 6 H2O + Energy

-  RQ= 6 CO2 /6 O2 = 1.0

When fat is oxidized and measured using RER, the outcome is reduced CO2 production for every oxygen molecule consumed.

- C16H32O2 + 23 O2 -> 16CO2 + 16 H2O + Energy

- RQ= 16 CO2 / 23 O2 = 0.7

When protein is the respiratory substrate, it results in reduced CO2 production for every oxygen molecule consumed.

- C72H112N18O22 + 77 O2 -> 63O2 + 38 H2O + Energy

- RQ= 63 CO2 / 77 O2= 0.9
