Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative, aerobic, non-spore forming rod that is capable of causing a variety of infections in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts. Its predilection to cause infections among immunocompromised hosts, extreme versatility, antibiotic resistance, and a wide range of dynamic defenses makes it an extremely challenging organism to treat in modern-day medicine. This activity outlines the epidemiology and management of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the epidemiology of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections.
- Identify the wide array of infections that vary in severity caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 
- Review the antimicrobial options available for Pseudomonas infections.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas infections and improve outcomes.
