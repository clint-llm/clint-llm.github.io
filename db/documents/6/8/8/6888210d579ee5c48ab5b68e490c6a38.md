The toxicity of any drug depends onÂ its pharmacological activity. Since fludrocortisone works at mineralocorticoid receptors, toxicity will present as excess mineralocorticoid activities such as severe hypertension, not pitting edema, congestive heart failure, severe hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, rapid weight gain. Unfortunately, there is no antidote for fludrocortisone toxicity. So, conservative management is the mainstay. Reduction of dose, strict blood pressure control, potassium supplementation may be given.
