Bullous myringitis shares similar pathophysiology with AOM and although some aspects remain unclear. Inflammation of the tympanic membrane can occur as a direct result of trauma such as a foreign body, accidental trauma while cleaning the ear canal, sudden loud noises, changes in airline cabin pressure, and even an inflicted blow to the ear. Bullous myringitis can also occur as a result of viral or bacterial infections affecting the tympanic membrane as part of a respiratory infection or through the spread of fungal infection from the adjacent epidermis. Once inflamed, the enlarging bullae and inflamed tympanic membrane can cause severe pain until the blister ruptures, which can result in bloody ear discharge.
