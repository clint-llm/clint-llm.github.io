- Aniridic fibrosis syndrome is a fibrotic membranous overgrowth retrocorneally that may occur in patients with congenital aniridia, likely secondary to multiple intraocular procedures and intraocular implants

- Genetic testing can be done to assess for aniridia, but no test or presurgical imaging can assess for the likelihood of postsurgical fibrosis.

- The fibrosis begins at the rudimentary iris and extends over intraocular structures, including an IOL, if in the posterior capsule.

- If left untreated, the membrane may extend anteriorly (pulling the IOL forward into contact with the cornea) and posteriorly (potentially covering the ciliary body and anterior retina).

- Treatment is membranectomy, and consideration for a decrease in intraocular structures should be considered. Surgical intervention is generally successful. Recurrence is rare and associated with IOL replacement as opposed to removal.
