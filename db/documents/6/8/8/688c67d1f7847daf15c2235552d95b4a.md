The professional team in LASIK treatment typically consists of ophthalmic surgeons, optometrists, nurses, medical assistants, and technicians. Team members work together in the outpatient setting to determine the best candidates for LASIK to prevent unnecessary costs and complications to the patient. The team, on the day of surgery, is responsible for adhering to standard clinical protocols, including obtaining the patientâ€™s informed consent for the procedure, the correct marking of which eye will receive each specific treatment, the proper placement, and preoperative evaluation of necessary equipment for the procedure, a timeout called before the operation, and patient education throughout the treatment process. Communication among team members is vital, concerning any changes in patient status at any time before, during, or after the procedure and optimizes patient outcomes.
