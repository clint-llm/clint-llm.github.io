Osteoporosis is the most common precipitating factor for vertebral fracture. However, trauma, cancer, chemotherapy, infection, long-term steroid use, hyperthyroidism, and radiation therapy are also known to weaken bones that can lead to compression fractures. The etiology of lower bone density can be related to smoking, alcohol abuse, lower estrogen levels, anorexia, kidney disease, medications, proton pump inhibitors, and other medications. Risk factors include female gender, osteoporosis, osteopenia, age greater than 50, history of vertebral fractures, smoking, vitamin D deficiency, and prolonged use of corticosteroids.

Trauma is the second most common cause of spine fracture, and motor vehicle accidents are the number one cause of spinal cord injury. A spinal cord injury occurs from C1 to L2, the approximate level of the cauda equina. Injuries below the conus are cauda equina injuries. According to the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center, other high-ranking causes of spinal cord injury include falls and gunshot wounds. Osteomyelitis infection accounts for admission incidence of 4.8 of 100000 patients.
