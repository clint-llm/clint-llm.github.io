Pentobarbital is a drug within the barbiturate class that works primarily on the central nervous system. At low doses, indications include short-term sedatives to treat insomnia and as a pre-anesthetic for surgery.

Common off-label uses are for control of intracranial pressure in patients with severe brain injuries, cerebral ischemia, and those receiving treatment for Reye syndrome.
