The superior gluteal nerve is found in the lower pelvis and arises from the dorsal divisions of the L4, L5, and S1 nerve roots of the sacral plexus. The superior gluteal nerve is responsible for innervation of the gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and tensor fasciae latae muscles. The nerve exits the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen superior to the piriformis muscle and accompanies the superior gluteal artery and vein. The superior gluteal nerve further divides into a superior branch and an inferior branch, with each branch following the course of the superior gluteal arteryâ€™s upper and lower portions of the deep division, respectively.
