The long-term, negative outcomes from alcohol consumption have been well-studied and identified, but the specific causes for these outcomes are not well understood. Multiple components are responsible for the development of alcoholic neuropathy. The duration of alcohol abuse and the lifetime quantity of alcohol consumed are two key elements when studied among patients with chronic alcohol use disorder. One study suggested that a quantity more than 100 g/day over a number of years was likely to cause peripheral neuropathy.
