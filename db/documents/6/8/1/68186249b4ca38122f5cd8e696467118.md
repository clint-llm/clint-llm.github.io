- Stress fracture: Cortical disruption and/or weakening of bony architecture secondary to repetitive micro-trauma or overuse.

- Pagetâ€™s disease: Metabolic disorder resulting in mixed blastic/lytic lesions of bone.

- Avascular necrosis: Local ischemia to a region of bone resulting in tissue death.

- Benign fracture: Cortical disruption secondary to mechanical failure of bone without evidence of malignancy.

- Infection: The presence of foreign microorganisms invading and multiplying within a bone leading to bone erosion and damage.
