Pulmonary edema is an acutely decompensated state due to either cardiac or noncardiac etiologies. Temporizing measures such as supplemental oxygenation, diuretics, nitrates, and morphine help manage dyspnea, hypoxemia. However, definitive management of the underlying causes is necessary to prevent its recurrences. Prognostic predictions are difficult to quantify, given the vast number of cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic etiologies of pulmonary edema and their individual mortality data. Pulmonary edema's advanced state in ARDS has had progressively improved outcomes. Hospital mortality has decreased from 60% from 1967 through 1981 to the range of 30% to 40% in the 1990s.
