In the diagnosis and treatment of neurosyphilis, interprofessional team communication between providers may expedite the treatment process. Communication between the consulting provider, and specialties including infectious disease, and neurology, as well as laboratory technicians and pharmacists, helps guide the management of a patient with suspected or confirmed neurosyphilis. It is critical to arrange appropriate follow-up with patients being treated for syphilis/neurosyphilis to confirm complete resolution, which includes the reversal of symptoms and prevention of permanent disability.

For the best outcomes, neurosyphilis is best addressed via an interprofessional team approach that includes primary care clinicians, infectious disease specialists, a neurologist when appropriate, pharmacists, and nurses, particularly those with specialty training in infection control. [Level 5]
