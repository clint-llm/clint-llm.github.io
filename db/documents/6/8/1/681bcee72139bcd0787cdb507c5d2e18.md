Cryptosporidium is the second major cause of moderate to severe diarrhea in children younger than two and an important cause of mortality worldwide. It occurs most commonly during waterborne epidemics and in immunocompromised hosts. Cryptosporidiosis may be underrecognized and underdiagnosed. Additionally, treatments are suboptimum, and we do not currently have robust preventative measures.This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology and presentation of cryptosporidiosis and stresses the importance of a interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis.
- Review the presentation and examination findings of cryptosporidiosis
- Summarize the treatment options for cryptosporidiosis
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by cryptosporidiosis
