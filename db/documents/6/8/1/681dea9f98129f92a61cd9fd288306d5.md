The lungs do not follow Boyle’s law at all volumes.  In a resting state with a normal tidal volume, when the alveoli are not collapsed nor are the lungs at maximal capacity, the lungs follow proportional changes of volume and pressure in accordance with Boyle’s law. At low lung volumes, it takes a large pressure change to make small changes in the volume (low compliance of lung tissue). At high volumes within the lung, it takes a more negative pressure to expand the tissue, once again not in compliance with a direct relationship as Boyle’s law dictates. At low and high volumes, the lung has low compliance meaning that the ability of the tissue to expand or its elasticity decreases **(compliance = [change in volume]/[change in pressure])**.
