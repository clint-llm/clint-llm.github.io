The benefit to the monospot test is the rapid identification of the presence of heterophile antibodies and thus, the rapid diagnosis of IM.  Although IM is a self-limiting disease process, prompt diagnosis is essential to minimize complications and prevent unnecessary treatments.  IM may lead to the development of splenomegaly which can increase the chances of splenic rupture and hemorrhage.  Often, individuals with diagnosed IM will be held out of contact sports to decrease the potential of splenic rupture.

In addition to the minimization of complications, rapid disease detection may lead to reduced usage of antibiotics.   The symptoms of IM are very similar to pharyngitis and tonsillitis caused by Streptococcal species.  Many patients may be treated unnecessarily with antibiotic therapy for IM, and the rapid identification of the causative organism may help to bolster better antibiotic stewardship as well as prevent potential complications of antibiotic treatment such as rash, diarrhea, and allergic reaction.
