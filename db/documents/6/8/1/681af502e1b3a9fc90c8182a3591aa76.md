Every few years a new diet is introduced that is thought to be the panacea for good health. Clinicians should not fall into the trap of "diet mania' but should counsel patients to eat a healthy diet low in processed foods, to exercise regularly, and to discontinue smoking and other harmful habits. Like all diets, the paleolithic diet has its pros and cons. This was diet first used by our human ancestors out of necessity, and though it may have been good for the digestive tract it is unknown how it affects human health in the long term.

Physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and dietitians should all encourage a healthy diet to their patients low in processed foods and higher in fiber, with lean protein sources.
