Both oral and intravenous forms of iron have the potential to cause oxidative stress and damage. Iron-induced coagulopathy, liver damage, kidney failure, and cardiomyopathy may occur upon reaching toxic levels. The toxicity correlates with the amount of elemental iron within iron products ingested. Ingestion/administration of 20 mg/kg or more of elemental iron can result in symptoms of toxicity. Serum levels peak between 4 and 6 hours and can be used to assess the potential for toxicity. If a patient is symptomatic and hemodynamically unstable, they should be treated with IV fluids and potentially with deferoxamine â€“ a chelating agent that can bind to iron and be excreted renally, removing it from the body. Vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma are therapy options in cases of iron-induced coagulopathy. A toxicologist should be consulted for guidance when iron toxicity is suspected.
