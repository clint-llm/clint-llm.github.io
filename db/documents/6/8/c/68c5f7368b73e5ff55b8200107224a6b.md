Migraine is a fairly benign disorder, though it can affect the quality of life in some patients. With increasing age, the frequency and severity of migraine headaches tend to diminish. Though migraine is a chronic disorder, prolonged remissions are common. Menstrual migraine tends to get better after menopause in terms of the severity of symptoms and frequency of headaches. Patients who follow lifestyle changes, including meal schedules and good sleep hygiene, have a good prognosis.
