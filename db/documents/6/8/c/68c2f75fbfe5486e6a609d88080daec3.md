Tenecteplase is contraindicated in several conditions.

- Active internal bleeding

- Severe uncontrolled hypertension

- History of cerebrovascular accident

- Intracranial or intraspinal surgery within the last 2 months

- Head or spinal trauma within the previous 2 months

- Conditions that increase the risk of bleeding

Tenecteplase is an FDA pregnancy category C drug. No well-controlled studies evaluate the risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in tenecteplase. Whether tenecteplase is excreted in breast milk is unknown. Pregnancy is a relative contraindication to tenecteplase and should only be given after carefully considering the risks and benefits to the patient and fetus.

Significant drug-drug interactions that contraindicate tenecteplase use include defibrotide and mifepristone. Concurrent use of tenecteplase with defibrotide may increase bleeding risk due to additive effects and duplicate anticoagulation. Mifepristone and tenecteplase are contraindicated when using mifepristone for pregnancy termination; the combination may increase the risk of severe or prolonged vaginal bleeding due to additive effects.
