The discovery of benign bone tumors is often incidental. Symptomatic presentation of these tumors is dependent on size and location. Localized pain, swelling, deformity, and pathologic fracture are someÂ common symptoms of benign bone tumors. The diagnostic approach to these tumors revolves around radiographic imaging. More extensive, invasive diagnostic testing is not recommended.

The management of these conditions is conservative. Serial examination and radiographs are common practices. Curettage with bone grafting is the recommended treatment of choice for symptomatic or aggressive nonmalignant tumors. As the mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) and 2 (IDH2) genes are somatic, there is no genetic inheritance pattern for benign enchondromas, Ollier disease, or Maffucci syndrome.
