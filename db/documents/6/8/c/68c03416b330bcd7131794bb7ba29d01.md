Diagnosis of toxocariasis is difficult. While identification of the organism on microscopy is the gold standard, it is rarely achieved for practical reasons. ELISA assays are available and recommended; yet, they, unfortunately, have relatively poor sensitivity (approximately 80%).Toxocara, stool microscopy is ineffective. Other secondary indicators of infection include eosinophilia and hypergammaglobulinemia. However, these markers are not specific, and their sensitivities do not have extensive backing in the literature. Clinical diagnosis and presumptive treatment is an option to consider in the right clinical context.
