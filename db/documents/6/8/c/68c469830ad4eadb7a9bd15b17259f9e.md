The risk of complications is low; however, there are known potential problems, and no implant is considered a lifetime device.

- Infection

- Scarring

- Asymmetry

- Hematoma

- Seroma

- Breast pain

- Poor cosmetic outcome

- Nipple/breast sensation changes

Later complications include:

- Implant malposition or displacement

- Implant deflation or leak

- Capsular contracture which is tightening of the tissue capsule around the implant

Surgeons do not know the specific cause of contracture, but many suspect a sub-clinical or low-grade infection that can lead to inflammation and a capsule biofilm that may initiate the contracture. The most commonly isolated microorganisms from studies on breast implant capsular contracture are Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes
