Although no histologic features are pathognomic for necrolytic migratory erythema, some are very distinctive and help separate them from other dermatoses. It is important to recognize that the histopathologic changes are limited entirely to the epidermis and, particularly, the superficial epidermis.

Other prominent findings seen in NME include confluent parakeratosis and irregular acanthosis, with loss of the granular layer. Ballooning epidermal cells showing vacuolar degeneration, particularly in the upper spinous layer, are seen at higher power.
