Carney complex (CNC) is a rare genetic disorder associated with one of the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes. Carney complex affects multiple glands in the body such as such as thyroid, pituitary, and adrenal glands. It is also known to cause cardiac myxomas, abnormal pigmentation, myxomas of the skin, breast myxomatosis, melanotic schwannoma, and testicular tumors. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of Carney complex and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the types of endocrine disorders associated with Carney complex.
- Summarize the skin features in Carney complex.
- Outline the treatment options for Carney complex.
- Review the importance of optimizing care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by Carney complex.
