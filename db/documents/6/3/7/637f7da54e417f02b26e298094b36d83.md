The femoral artery travels in the lateral compartment of the femoral sheath. It is a continuation of the external iliac artery, commencing as it passes under the inguinal ligament.

The femoral vein occupies the intermediate compartment of the femoral sheath. It is a continuation of the popliteal vein and enters the femoral sheath before becoming the external iliac vein as it passes under the inguinal ligament.

The femoral canal contains deep inguinal lymph nodes and associated lymphatic vessels.
