Nocardia is extremely difficult to differentiate from other infectious etiologies. The differential diagnosis for primary sites of infection are outlined below:

Pulmonary disease

- Fungal infections – aspergillosis, mucormycosis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, and cryptococcosis

- Actinomyces infection

- Mycobacterial infections – including Mycobacterium tuberculosis

- Lung malignancy

Cutaneous disease

- Superficial cellulitis – group A strep (GAS), staph aureus

- Lymphocutaneous – sporotrichosis, Mycobacterium marinum

- Mycetoma (late-stage) – actinomycosis, fungal infections

- Other: cutaneous leishmaniasis, Cryptococcus

CNS disease

- Malignancy

- Bacterial abscess

- Vascular infarction

- Other: toxoplasmosis, mycobacterial tuberculosis, fungal infection, cysticercosis
