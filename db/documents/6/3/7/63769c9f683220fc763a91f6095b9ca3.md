Nurses should continue to monitor and treat the patient until the confirmation of brain death. No patient should experience deprivation of any treatment until this notification. Upon determining brain death, the appropriate provider should document their findings in the chart and relay them to the patient's family. AccommodationsÂ for religious preferences should be made if desired.
