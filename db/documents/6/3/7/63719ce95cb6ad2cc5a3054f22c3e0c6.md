# Introduction

The anterolateral abdominal wall is a layered structure composed of skin, fascia, muscles, extraperitoneal fat, and peritoneum that extends from the thorax to the pelvis and bounds the abdominal cavity and its associated organs.

# Structure and Function

There is no clear consensus on the precise boundaries of the anterolateral abdominal wall.

The anterolateral abdominal wall, from superficial to deep, consists of skin, subcutaneous fat and fascia (including Camper's and Scarpa's fascia), abdominal wall muscles and their associated fascias, transversalis fascia, and parietal peritoneum.

The thoracoabdominal nerves originate as branches of the ventral rami of the T7 to T12 spinal nerves.

The seventh through eleventh intercostal (T7-T11) and subcostal (T12) nerves give off lateral cutaneous nerve branches approximately at the mid-axillary line. The lateral cutaneous nerves arising from T7 and T8 predominantly return sensation from the inferior portion of the lateral thoracic wall, and the nerves arising from T9 to T12 predominantly return sensation from the lateral portion of the anterolateral abdominal wall. After crossing the subcostal line, intercostal nerves 7 to 12 and the subcostal nerve enter the abdominal wall and are referred to as the T7 to T12 thoracoabdominal nerves. The thoracoabdominal nerves travel within a neurovascular plane between the transversus abdominis and internal oblique muscles before piercing the posterior rectus sheath. They then travel anteriorly through openings in the linea semilunaris to return sensation from the skin overlying the rectus abdominis muscle.

The iliohypogastric nerve originates from the superior branch of the ventral ramus of the L1 spinal nerve, which commonly receives communicating branches from T12.

The ilioinguinal nerve originates from the superior branch of the ventral ramus of the L1 spinal nerve.

# Embryology

During human embryonic development, usually 38 to 39 somites arise from paired paraxial mesoderm masses on either side of the neural tube during Carnegie Stages (CS) 9 to 13.

The somites are the basis of the segmentation of the human body and produce the sclerotomes, dermatomes, myotomes, and syndetomes. The sclerotome produces segmental bony elements that develop adjacent to the notochord and result in the somites directing cellular migration of neural crest cells and spinal nerve axons and following the consequent development of the dermatome and myotome.

# Blood Supply and Lymphatics

The seventh to eleventh intercostal (T7-T11) and subcostal (T12) nerves travel with the corresponding posterior intercostal arteries and veins to form intercostal neurovascular bundles in the relevant intercostal spaces.

The structures of the anterolateral abdominal wall receive arterial supply from the superior and inferior epigastric, superficial epigastric, musculophrenic, posterior intercostal, and anterior intercostal arteries.

Venous drainage of the anterolateral abdominal wall consists of a large venous plexus that drains into the superior epigastric, internal thoracic, and lateral thoracic veins superiorly and the inferior and superficial epigastric veins inferiorly.

# Muscles

Muscles in the anterolateral abdominal wall include the transversus abdominis, internal oblique, external oblique, pyramidalis, and rectus abdominis muscles. The rectus abdominis muscle is enclosed by the anterior and posterior rectus sheaths formed by the transversus abdominis, internal oblique, and external oblique aponeurosis. The linea alba separates the left and right rectus abdominis muscles as a combination of the anterior and posterior rectus sheaths. The linea semilunaris forms the lateral enclosure of the rectus abdominis muscles formed by the aponeurosis of the transversus abdominis, internal oblique, and external oblique muscles. The transversus abdominis, external oblique, and internal oblique muscles are layered (deep to superficial, respectively) and extend from the lateral border of the rectus abdominis across the remainder of the abdominal wall. These muscles have attachments to the inguinal ligament and form the borders of the inguinal canal. The pyramidalis muscle is a physiological variant and is present in 80% of the population.

# Surgical Considerations

Specific nerve blocks in the anterolateral abdominal wall can provide regional anesthesia by infiltrating local anesthetic around the relevant nerve. As such, the transversus abdominis plane block (between the transversus abdominis and internal oblique muscles) is used to anesthetize the thoracoabdominal, iliohypogastric, and ilioinguinal nerves that run in this plane.

An indirect hernia repair may require the manipulation and visualization of the superficial inguinal ring, which puts the ilioinguinal nerve at risk. The nerve enters the inguinal canal here and can subsequently be damaged, resulting in a sensory alteration of the scrotum, root of the penis, labia major, and inner thigh.

The intercostal nerves can be crushed or severed during thoracotomies. This can result in subsequent thoracoabdominal nerve dysfunction, typically causing chronic pain and rectus muscle paresis.

Surgical incisions over the anterolateral abdominal wall pose the risk of nerve damage. Depending on the location of the incision, different nerves can be affected. Pfannenstiel incisions can damage the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves, while paramedian and subcostal incisions are more likely to damage the thoracoabdominal nerves.

# Clinical Significance

Dysfunction of the anterolateral abdominal nerves can potentially result in abdominal weakness, hernia, chronic pain, movement impairment, sensory loss, and sexual dysfunction. Each of these factors can implicate and reduce the quality of life of an individual.

Compression of the thoracoabdominal nerves most commonly occurs at the point where the nerves pierce the posterior rectus sheath, given that they turn 90 degrees to travel anteriorly through the linea semilunaris.
