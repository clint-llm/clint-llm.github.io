UCD being able to be eliminated with surgical resection has a good prognosis. However, since multiple systemic disorders involve MCD and sometimes concomitant diseases like HIV and HHV-8 can also be present, specific chemotherapy regimens have not been assigned, and better treatment methods still need to be explored. Moreover, along with the deficient treatment options, nonspecific clinical features that often go unnoticed with limited diagnostic measures also lead to delayed confirmation of its diagnosis. Its prognosis is, therefore, abysmal.

Both UCD and MCD can sometimes progress to non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).
