The term Rolando fracture was described for the first time in 1910 by Silvio Rolando, an Italian surgeon. The eponym is used to describe a comminuted articular fracture of the base of the thumb metacarpal, while partial articular fractures at the volar-ulnar base of the thumb metacarpal are referred to as Bennett fractures. The former describes more comminuted intra-articular patterns through the base, generating the classically described "Y" or "T" morphologies. The latter is distinguished by its 2-part articular fracture pattern including the nondisplaced volar-ulnar fragment which is held in place by its ligamentous attachment to the trapezium, known as the anterior oblique ligament. This activity reviews the classification, evaluation, and management of Rolando fracture, and also illustrates the evaluation and management of Rolando fracture and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of Rolando fracture.
- Describe the typical imaging findings associated with Rolando fracture.
- Review the treatment considerations for patients with Rolando fracture.
- Explain the importance of the interprofessional team as it pertains to improving care coordination among the interprofessional team members when treating Rolando fracture.
