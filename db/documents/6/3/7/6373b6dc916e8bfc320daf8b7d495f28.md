Orbital cellulitis is an inflammation of the contents of the orbit posterior to the orbital septum. The inflammation occurs secondary to an infection carried by the blood, from adjacent sinuses or even after trauma. This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment of orbital cellulitis and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the common causative organisms in the etiology of orbital cellulitis.
- Describe the pathophysiology of orbital cellulitis.
- Outline the differences between preseptal and orbital inflammation during the history and physical examination of patients affected by orbital cellulitis.
- Identify the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance delivery of care for patients affected by orbital cellulitis.
