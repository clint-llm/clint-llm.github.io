Advanced KCN often presents with breaks in Bowman’s layer (which are filled by eruptions of underlying stromal collagen) and deposition of iron (ferritin particles) in the corneal epithelium basal layers. The basal epithelium cells may show degeneration and epithelial infiltration into Bowman’s layer.

Stroma histopathology can be affected as well, mainly observed as scarring and opacity, compaction and loss of fibrils arrangement (stromal striae), decrease in collagen lamellae density, normal and degenerating fibroblasts in addition to keratocytes, and fine granular and microfibrillar material associated with the keratocytes.
