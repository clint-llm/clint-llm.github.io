Currently, the only FDA approved route of administration is oral.Â  Although not FDA approved, misoprostol may also be administered sublingually, buccally, vaginally, or rectally via digital placement of tablets or suppositories. Despite a plethora of studies comparing the efficacy and safety profiles of the different routes of administration for obstetric uses, there are no definitive conclusions regarding this use.

It is best to take medication at night time with meals to minimize GI upset when given orally. Do not take with magnesium-containing antacids, as this combination may contribute to misoprostol-induced diarrhea.
