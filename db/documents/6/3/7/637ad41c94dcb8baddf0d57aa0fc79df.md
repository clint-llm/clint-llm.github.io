A fully distended urinary bladder is required for adequate ultrasound assessment of pelvic organs in a female. It provides an acoustic window for adequate visualization of the pelvic structures. In non-emergency cases, patients with bladder control are advised to hold urine before scanning. The referring physician or assistant should be aware of this requirement and instruct the patients/parents accordingly. Interpersonal communication between the ordering physician and scheduling nurse can avoid unnecessary delays in scanning.

In an emergency or in patients who do not have bladder control, the urinary bladder is filled retrogradely with a catheter. Communication between ultrasound technologists, ordering physicians, and/or nurse catheterizing the patients enhances patient care by obtaining proper ultrasound images.

Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) performed by an emergency physician can diagnose an ectopic pregnancy in pediatrics with 100% sensitivity. Early and accurate diagnosis reduces time in the treatment of ruptured ectopic pregnancy.

Proper and timely communication of critical findings to the emergency physicians and gynecologists is required for speedy treatment. SPecialty-train ob/gyn nursing staff can also assist in the procedure. This type of interprofessional coordination will yield the best results. [Level 5]
