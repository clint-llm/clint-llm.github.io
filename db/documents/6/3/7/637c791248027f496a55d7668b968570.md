Given the various causes of falls, prevention, and management must be multidimensional and interprofessional. The Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is a multidisciplinary instrument used in the evaluation of elderly patients at risk of falling. In addition to the history and physical examination, assessment of pain with visual analog scale and pharmacological history should be completed as well. Evaluation scales included in the CGA assessment include the Berg Balance Scale to evaluate static and dynamic balance, the Falls Efficacy Scale to assess the fear of falling, and the Timed Up and Go Test to assess a patient's mobility. Other scales may include the 6 minutes Walking Test and the 10 meters Walking test when indicated.

While there is no standard diagnostic testing for an individual at high risk for falls, based upon the history and physical examination, laboratory tests such as electrolytes, hemoglobin, and glucose concentration may help determine causes of falling such as dehydration, anemia, and diabetes respectively. Serum vitamin D levels can help identify patients who may benefit from vitamin D supplementation.
