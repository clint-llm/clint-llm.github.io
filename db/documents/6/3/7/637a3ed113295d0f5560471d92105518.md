Heroin substance use disorder is a chronically relapsing disease that is often fatal. There has been a very gradual shift in thinking in the 2010s in the United States regarding what management method is best for managing heroin substance use disorder. The traditional method of focusing on having the patient remain chemical-free with the assistance of a therapeutic community model of support has unfortunately been plagued by rapid relapse once the intensity of care decreases, such as at the time of departure from inpatient rehab. Naltrexone has been used with varying degrees of success, with greater success seen in monthly intramuscular depot dosing (Vivitrol) compared to daily oral dosing.

Conversely, there is a growing body of data supporting the model of harm reduction with medication-assisted treatment with opioids such as methadone or buprenorphine. With harm reduction, patients are allowed to consume a version of opioids that is thought to be longer and slower acting than the heroin they became addicted to.
