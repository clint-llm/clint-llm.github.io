Based on animal and human studies with frontal lobe lesions, there has been added emphasis on lesions involving the dorsolateral convexity and ventromedial orbitofrontal cortex. Both lesions affect behavior however in different ways. As discussed prior, dorsolateral lesions may cause apathetic and abulic states. In contrast, ventromedial orbitofrontal lesions cause impulsive unrestrained behavior and possibly dangerous decisions. Usually, bilateral lesions produce more significant deficits. There has also been a distinction made between left and right frontal lesions. Left lesions are associated with depression-like symptoms, and right-sided lesions are associated with mania. However, frontal lobe syndrome comprises a variety of behaviors that do not fit into hard and fast rules.
