Worldwide, the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that over 5% of people have disabling hearing loss, defined as a hearing deficit of 40 dB in the better hearing ear in adults and a hearing lossÂ exceeding 30 dB in the better hearing ear in children. Only a fifth of people who would benefit from a hearing aid actually use one. Hearing loss is associated with social isolation and depression, which is suggested to be twice as prevalent in hearing loss.

Current estimates are that the prevalence of Alzheimer disease is doubling every 20 years due to an aging population. Furthermore, hearing loss is associated with lower employment rates and further societal and economic sequelae. Therefore, identifying and correctly treating patients with hearing loss is paramount. Conventional hearing aids are a cornerstone of management, and therefore familiarity with their selection and indication is important for healthcare professionals working in ear and hearing services.
