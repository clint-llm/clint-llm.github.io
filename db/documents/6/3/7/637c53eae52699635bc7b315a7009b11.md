The upper and lower branches of the subscapular nerve innervate the subscapularis muscle. The suprascapular nerve innervates the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles. The posterior branch of the axillary nerve supplies the teres minor. The axillary nerve also innervates the deltoid muscle. The nerve supply to the trapezius is by the spinal accessory nerve/11th cranial nerve with some direct branches from the cervical plexus. Innervation to levator scapula is by C3-C5. The nerve supply to the rhomboids is the dorsal scapular nerve. The nerve supply to the serratus anterior is the long thoracic nerve. The pectoralis major muscle receives its nerve supply via the medial and lateral pectoral nerves.
