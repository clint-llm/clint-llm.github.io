Histopathological features of pemphigus herpetiformis differ from pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceous because of the presence of spongiosis, mostly without acantholysis. The histological findings may vary among patients, and one patient can have various histological features at different times. Therefore, more than one biopsy may be necessary for the diagnosis of pemphigus herpetiformis. The main histopathological finding of pemphigus herpetiformis is eosinophilic spongiosis. Other reported features include neutrophilic spongiosis, mixed eosinophilic-neutrophilic spongiosis, subcorneal pustules and/or intraepidermal vesicles filled with neutrophils and/or eosinophils. Acantholysis is usually absent but may appear later in the disease process. Dermal papillary neutrophilic microabscesses also can be present. The pattern of immune cell infiltration may vary, being mixed eosinophil neutrophil in 60% of cases, eosinophil dominant in approximately 20%, and neutrophil-dominant in 20%.
