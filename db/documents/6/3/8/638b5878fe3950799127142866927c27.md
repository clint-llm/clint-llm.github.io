The patient usually presents with acute onset of testicular pain, which may initially involve one testis, and then may spread to include the whole scrotum. The patient may also complain of fever accompanied by malaise, fatigue, and chills.

Examination findings may include testicular enlargement, tenderness, and induration. Scrotal edema and erythema may also be present. The epididymis may also be enlarged if orchitis is accompanied by epididymitis. The cremasteric reflex is normal in affected individuals. Mumps orchitis may present with bilateral parotid enlargement and usually present 4 to 8 days after onset of parotitis.

When evaluating such patients, the clinician should also note various risk factors so that they can receive appropriate management.
