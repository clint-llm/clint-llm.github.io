Thorough knowledge of regional anatomy is crucial to operating safely, avoiding neurovascular injury, and correctly identifying intermuscular planes in the region. Knowledge of anatomy allows the surgeon to find the area of the pathology, and understanding of the origins and insertions of the muscles helps to find a tendinous portion appropriate for graft reconstruction. Identifying the correct nerves when performing peripheral nerve blocks is essential.

One of the most common surgical approaches in orthopedics involving the anterior compartment of the thigh is the lateral approach to the femur.

Alternatively, one can take a 'subvastus' approach by going posterior to the vastus lateralis and elevating it subperiostially off the bone.
