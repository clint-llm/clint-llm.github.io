Antipsychotics cause detrimental effects on bone growth. Antipsychotics negatively affect bone metabolism by blocking dopamine receptors, causing hyperprolactinemia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Hyperprolactinemia directly affects bone growth through prolactin receptors on the osteoblast, regardless of the gonadotrophic hormonal level.

The high prolactin levels can lower calcium absorption and activate parathyroid hormone-related peptides, which increase bone resorption. Antipsychotics can also delay bone maturation by modulating serotoninergic and adrenergic receptors on the osteoblast and osteoclast cells.

High cortisol levels are frequently seen in psychiatric patients on antipsychotics, adding another risk factor for impaired bone mineralization.
