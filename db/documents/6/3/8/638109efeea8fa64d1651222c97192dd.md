The diagnosis can often be made based on clinical exam. The distal phalanx may be erythematous and edematous with tense tissues and fluctuance.  The fingertip may be extremely tender to the touch. It is important to note any bony abnormalities and assess for signs of ischemia. Imaging should be performed if there is a history of a foreign body penetration. Imaging can also identify fractures, osteomyelitis, and gas formation in the tissues which may lead to an alternative diagnosis.  A gram stain and culture of any discharge or drainage should be obtained to help guide antibiotic therapy.
