Spermatogenesis is stimulated by luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) release from the anterior pituitary and inhibited by the negative feedback of testosterone and inhibin. AAS mimics testosterone, which creates an increase of inhibition of spermatogenesis and a marked decrease in levels of LH and FSH. Male androgenic-anabolic steroid users show severe to moderate oligozoospermia 5-20x106/mL. The percentage of motile sperm is also significantly impaired in AAS users. Those users who stopped taking AAS for more than four months showed sperm levels return to normal, even after years of taking AAS.
