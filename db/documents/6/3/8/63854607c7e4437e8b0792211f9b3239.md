The definition of mitral regurgitation is a retrograde flow from the left ventricle into the left atrium. Mitral regurgitation leads to left ventricular volume overload due to increased stroke volume, caused by an increase in blood volume within the left atrium and hence an increased preload delivered to the left ventricle during diastole. In chronic progressive MR, ventricular remodeling occurs, allowing maintenance of cardiac output, and an initial increase in ejection fraction (EF) is usually observed. However, depending on the regurgitant fraction, the effective EF can be considerably lower. Over time, there is a positive feedback loop by which volume overload from MR causes ventricular dilatation, widening of the mitral annulus, and diminished coaptation of leaflets, leading to further worsening of MR. Eventually, volume overload becomes so severe that excitation-contraction coupling becomes impaired and wall stress-related afterload on the left ventricle leading to dilatation and decreased contractility, resulting in a reduction of EF.
