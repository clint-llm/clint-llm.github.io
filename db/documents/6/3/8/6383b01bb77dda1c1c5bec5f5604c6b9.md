# Continuing Education Activity

Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a disease of retinal vascular and capillary proliferation affecting premature infants undergoing oxygen therapy. Screening guidelines for this leading cause of childhood blindness are based upon gestational age and birth weight, although numerous factors increase both the incidence and severity of disease development. Early treatment of disease with cryotherapy, laser photocoagulation, and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy has improved visual outcomes for patients; however, early recognition through screening is critical. This activity demonstrates the keys to the prevention of ROP, highlights the multidisciplinary approach needed before the infant is born, and continuing throughout childhood.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of retinopathy of prematurity.
- Summarize the evaluation of retinopathy of prematurity.
- Outline the management options available for retinopathy of prematurity.

# Introduction

Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a disease of retinal vascular and capillary proliferation affecting premature infants undergoing oxygen therapy.

Screening guidelines for this leading cause of childhood blindness are based upon gestational age and birth weight, although numerous factors increase both the incidence and severity of disease development.

# Etiology

In utero, the retina is in a state of physiological hypoxia. Elevated levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) facilitate retinal angiogenesis.

Because the nasal and temporal portions of the retina form late in pregnancy, 32 and 40 weeks respectively, preterm infants are born with incomplete vascularization of these portions. The physiologic hypoxia that was previously driving vessel development is replaced with a state of hyperoxia, as many premature infants are exposed to supplemental in addition to atmospheric oxygen.

# Epidemiology

Many important epidemiological risk factors for ROP were established in the Early Treatment for Retinopathy of Prematurity study. This randomized, prospective multicenter trial compared the safety of earlier vs. conventionally timed ablation of peripheral retina.

The two strongest known risk factors for ROP are gestational age (GA) and birth weight (BW). A multicenter study of over 4000 infants with birthweight ≤1251g found that for each 100g increase in BW, odds of developing threshold ROP decreased by 27%, and for each extra week in GA, the odds of developing threshold ROP decreased by 19%.

Another important risk factor is oxygen. As mentioned above, the use of supplemental oxygen in combination with atmospheric oxygen results in the reversal of physiologic hypoxia, which then contributes to retinal ischemia and subsequent overgrowth of retinal vessels in ROP.  Additionally, the concentration of oxygen delivered is an independent risk factor for ROP, whereby increased concentrations of O2 increase the risk of ROP.

# Pathophysiology

Events during the two phases of healthy vascular development, vasculogenesis, and angiogenesis underlie the zone 1 and zone 2 pathologies seen in ROP.

Vascular development in the retina is not completed in certain portions of the retina until after term. Specifically, the nasal and temporal portions do not complete development until 32 and 40 weeks, respectively. After birth, exposure to atmospheric oxygen and supplemental oxygen results in a rapid swing from relative hypoxia in utero to hyperoxia. Synthesis of IGF1, a vitally important hormone that regulates VEGF mediated vascular growth, is dependent upon adequate amino acid and energy supplies. A relative nutritional deficiency after birth in preterm infants results in depressed serum IGF1 levels. Together, hyperoxia and low IGF1 result in delayed retinal vascularization. Developing capillaries undergo vasoconstriction and eventual obliteration. These changes constitute phase 1 of ROP. Phase 2 of ROP consists of a decline of normal angiogenesis with predominant pathologic angiogenesis.

There is an increase of VEGF release into the vitreous, a drop of IGF1 levels, and peripheral avascular retinal neurons are damaged through hypoxic injury. High levels of VEGF in the vitreous results in the growth of pathologic vessels out of the retina.

# History and Physical

Screening for ROP is of crucial importance for premature or low birth weight (BW) infants. Guidelines from the American Academy of Ophthalmology, American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus state that infants born ≤30 weeks gestational age (GA) or ≤1500 g BW should be screened for ROP. Depending on the clinical course, larger infants May benefit from screening as well.

# Evaluation

A dilated fundus exam should be performed on all infants born at ≤30 week GA and infants with BW ≤1500g.

In an effort to limit the number of unnecessary screenings while capturing every case of ROP, the Postnatal Growth and Retinopathy of Prematurity Screening Criteria (G-ROP) was developed. In a validation study of 3981 infants, these guidelines were 100% sensitive and reduced infants screened by 30%.

Classification is described in terms of zone and stage of the disease.

Stage 1 is a thin but clear demarcation or structure that separates avascular retina anteriorly from vascularized retina posteriorly. The demarcation line is typically flat and white, with abnormal branching of vessels leading up to it.

Threshold ROP is diagnosed when 5 contiguous or 8 cumulative clock hours of stage 3 ROP, in zone 1 or 2, with plus disease.

# Treatment / Management

While early detection of ROP is crucial, not every case will require treatment. Based upon findings in the Early Treatment for Retinopathy of Prematurity study (ET-ROP), the decision to treat is dependent on the type of ROP. Type I ROP, including any stage zone I ROP with plus disease, zone I stage 3 with or without plus disease or zone II stage 2 or 3 with plus disease, should be treated. Observation is recommended for Type II ROP, including zone I stage 1 or 2 without plus disease or zone II stage 3 without plus disease.

Treatment of ROP is primarily surgical. The first surgical treatment considered both safe and effective for ROP was cryotherapy to the avascular retina. (CRYO-ROP study) In cryotherapy, the sclera, choroid, and full-thickness of the avascular retina are frozen from the surface of the eye.

Due to the role of VEGF in the development of ROP, the use of anti-VEGF agents is a possible treatment strategy. The Bevacizumab Eliminated the Angiogenic Threat of Retinopathy of Prematurity study (BEAT-ROP) randomly assigned infants with stage 3 ROP in zone I or posterior zone II to receive therapy with an anti-VEGF agent, intravitreal bevacizumab, or conventional laser. The primary outcome in this study was the recurrence of ROP requiring treatment before 54 weeks postmenstrual age. There was a statistically significant difference in recurrence with 19 cases in the laser-treated group and 4 in the bevacizumab group. The treatment effect was significant patients in the zone I but not zone II. Macular dragging and retinal detachment were seen more frequently after laser treatment for zone 1 disease.

The beneficial effects of VEGF, a hormone that is both neurotrophic and neuroprotective, should not be ignored as it helps to maintain the blood-brain barrier, generate surfactant in the lungs, create glomeruli in the kidneys and stimulate skeletal growth.

Retinal detachment confers a much higher risk of poor visual outcome.

# Differential Diagnosis

- Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy

- Persistent fetal vasculature

- Incontinetia pigmenti

# Prognosis

Advances have improved outcomes in treatment; nonetheless, many treated patients have adverse results in visual acuity. One of the goals of treatment is the avoidance of unfavorable retinal structural outcomes, defined by the ETROP study as a posterior retinal fold involving the macula, a retinal detachment involving the macula, retrolental tissue or mass obscuring the view of the posterior pole or vitrectomy or scleral buckling procedure. A follow up to the ETROP study found that at 2 years, unfavorable structural outcomes had been reduced to 9.1% in high-risk pre-threshold eyes treated early.

The 6-year follow up of the same sample found that 34.6% of children had a visual acuity (VA) of 20/40 or better, 40.3% had an acuity greater than 20/40 and less than 20/200, and  23.7% had an acuity worse than 20/200 including light perception and blindness.

# Complications

Retinal detachment is the most frequent complication of ROP and is strongly associated with a poor visual outcome.

Low vision secondary to retinopathy of prematurity is associated with higher rates of developmental, education and social challenges. A followup to the CRYO-ROP study evaluated a cohort of children born at a weight of <1251 g and threshold ROP at 5 and 8 years. Children in this cohort with unfavorable visual status, classified as vision limited to light perception or no light perception, had significantly higher rates of developmental disability, epilepsy, special education and below-grade-level academic performance.

# Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care

Postoperatively, premature infants require ventilation, either mechanical or positive pressure ventilation, parenteral feeding, and antibiotic treatment. Patients should be monitored via pulse oximetry, neurologic screening, ultrasounds screening, and assessment for bronchopulmonary dysplasia and patent ductus arteriosus.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

The role of oxygen therapy in the prevention of ROP is of crucial importance. There is a history of targeting SpO2 to reduce rates of ROP. In 2001, an observational study suggested that rates ROP could be decreased by using a lower SpO2 target without increasing the risk of death.

With such strong data suggesting that lowering SpO2 is an unacceptable solution for the problem of increasing rates of ROP, other solutions have been suggested. International data networks that monitor neonatal outcomes have demonstrated that Severe ROP is associated with financial investment, both within and between countries. Best practices in neonatal care include improved nutrition, infection control, pain control, temperature control, and supportive developmental care. These basic neonatal best care practices were outlined by Darlow et al. in 2019.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Antenatal, delivery suite, and NICU personnel have a role in preventing ROP. Antenatal prevention includes the use of corticosteroids prior to preterm delivery, a treatment shown to reduce morbidity and mortality.

NICU interventions to prevent ROP are of critical importance and have been discussed above.
