For prophylaxis of VKDB, parents should be made aware of the importance of vitamin K supplementation at birth and why the intervention is necessary. There should be discussion regarding intramuscular injection having greater efficacy in theÂ prevention of early, classic, and late VKDB compared to oral supplementation and that it is a one-time dose versus repeated doses.

Patients with chronic conditions may benefit from vitamin K supplementation, and the discussion of the research available should take place with interested patients.
