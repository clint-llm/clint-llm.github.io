Ulnar nerve injury is one of the most common peripheral nerve injuries, likely due to the superficial nature of the nerve near the medial condyle. Extreme elbow flexion in a prone position or direct nerve compression may be common modes of injury. Common complaints include numbness to the little finger and wrist. Claw hand deformity is also seen with ulnar nerve injury (flexion at the distal phalangeal and interphalangeal joints and hyperextension at the metacarpophalangeal joints).
