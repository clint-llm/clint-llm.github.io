There is wide variability in susceptibility to oxygen toxicity. Increased seizure risk is linked to retention of carbon dioxide, underwater immersion, exposure to cold, and exercise.  Scuba divers use breathing gases containing up to 100% oxygen (e.g., enriched air nitrox, closed circuit rebreathers) and should have specific training in safe use. In recent years, oxygen has become available for recreational use in oxygen bars. The FDA warns those suffering from problems such as heart or lung disease not to use oxygen bars
