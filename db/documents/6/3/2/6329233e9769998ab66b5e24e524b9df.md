Following induction and intubation (an oral Rae tube is often helpful), the patient is laid supine with an appropriately-sized shoulder bolster placed to facilitate neck extension. If myringotomy and grommet insertion are to be performed concurrently, this usually precedes adenoidectomy, whereas concurrent tonsillectomy can be performed either before or after adenoidectomy.

A Crowe-Davis gag is inserted and opened to achieve good visualization of the oropharynx, the gag is suspended to maintain an optimal position. The McIvor mouth gag may be used in edentulous patients. This can be achieved via a rolled towel, a Mayo stand eedge, or Draffin rods. The soft palate should always be palpated for a submucosal cleft, and the postnasal space may also be palpated to assess adenoid size and to evaluate fo pulsations that can indicate aberrant medialization of the carotid arteries.

A nasal suction catheter is introduced, and its tip is withdrawn from the oropharynx. The 2 ends are then clipped under moderate tension adjacent to the alar cartilage to retract the soft palate anteriorly.Â A tonsil swab may be positioned between the catheter and nose to prevent pressure necrosis.
