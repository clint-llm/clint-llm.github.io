The development of catheter-basedÂ treatment for cardiac structural defects has introduced new complexity to the field of cardiology. The need for interprofessional communication has become increasingly more vital than ever to optimize patient-centered care and improve outcomes. Percutaneous transcatheter interventions require care coordination by physicians in specialties, including cardiac imaging, interventional cardiology, pediatric cardiology, anesthesia, cardiothoracic surgery, and radiology.

To provide the best outcomes, an interprofessional team perioperatively should include specialty-trained: clinicians, pharmacists, and nurses. Team coordination of patient and family education and monitoring prior to and after the procedure should occur. The pharmacist should assist with evaluating for potential drug-drug interactions and any drug-induced complications. The clinical team should provide open lines of communication. An interprofessional approach will lead to the best outcomes. [Level 5]
