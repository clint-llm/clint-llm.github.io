The internal jugular vein (IJV) originates at the jugular foramen, tracks down to the lateral neck and ends at the brachiocephalic vein. The IJV is one of the four components of the carotid sheath, along with the common carotid artery, internal carotid artery, the vagus nerve, and the deep cervical lymph nodes. It courses medially to the sternocleidomastoid muscle at the carotid triangle. Studies have suggested significant variations in individuals, such as the IJV is anterior, lateral or anterior and lateral to the common carotid artery in the majority of the general population; whereas, for the remaining population, the IJV is medial to the common carotid artery.**Virchow triad:**increased blood coagulation, altered blood flow (stasis) or endothelial dysfunction which lead to thrombosis.
