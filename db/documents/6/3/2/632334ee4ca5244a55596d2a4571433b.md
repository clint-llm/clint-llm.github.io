Idioventricular rhythm is mostly benign, and treatment has limited symptomatic or prognostic value.

Management principles of idioventricular rhythm involve treating underlying causative etiology such as digoxin toxicity reversal if present, management of myocardial ischemia, or other cardiac structural/functional problems.

Rarely, a patient can present with symptoms and may not tolerate idioventricular rhythm secondary to atrioventricular dyssynchrony, fast ventricular rate, or degenerated ventricular fibrillation of idioventricular rhythm. Medical therapy may also be beneficial in patients with biventricular failure to restore atrial kick with mechanism, including to increase sinus rate and atrioventricular (AV) conduction. Atropine may be trialed in such scenarios.

Antiarrhythmic agents, including amiodarone and lidocaine, may also be potentially used along with medications such as verapamil or isoproterenol. Very rarely, atrial pacing may be an option.

However, in reperfusion post-myocardial ischemia and cardiomyopathy, the use of beta-blockers has not shown to decrease the risk of occurrence of idioventricular rhythm.
