The entire human body initially derives from the embryonic ectoderm, mesoderm, or endoderm. Muscles, connective tissue, bones, blood vessels, and more form from the mesoderm. The posterior muscles of the thigh are no exception to this rule and can be traced back embryologically to their origin from the mesoderm. Specifically, the posterior thigh muscles derive from the paraxial mesoderm (somites) of the lower limb buds (L3 to L5) on the anterior surface of each bud. Around weeks 7 to 8 of gestation, the lower limbs begin to rotate medially to their final position resulting in the posterior location of these muscles.
