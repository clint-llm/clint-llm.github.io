The underlying etiology of ARDS divides into pulmonary and extra-pulmonary pathologies. Common causes include bacteremia, sepsis, trauma, burns, reaction to massive transfusion, pneumonia, aspiration, severe pancreatitis, near drowning and fat embolism. Patients with increased severity scores for critical illness (e.g., Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score) are more prone to develop ARDS manifestations.

Several risk factors correlate with an increased risk of development of ARDS including female sex, advanced age, cigarette smoking, and alcohol abuse. Around 40 genes have links with ARDS, including genes encoding for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 10, and others. However, the correlation between these genes, susceptibility for ARDS and its effect on clinical outcomes remained limited.
