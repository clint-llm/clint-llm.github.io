Diplopia refers to seeing two images and is due either to ocular misalignment, in which case it disappears when either eye is occluded or to an optical problem, in which case it is termed monocular diplopia and does not disappear with monocular viewing. Patients with ocular misalignment can harbor serious pathology and should be evaluated in a systematic and thorough manner in order to uncover all potentially serious cases. This activity will present an approach to diplopic patients that will assist providers in evaluating the condition, making a diagnosis early, and improving outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Review of the approach to the patient with diplopia.
- Describe the evaluation process for a patient with diplopia.
- Summarize the treatment of diplopia.
- Outline the evaluation and management of a patient with diplopia and the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance patient outcomes.
