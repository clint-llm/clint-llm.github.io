Microalbuminuria develops from a dysfunction of the GBM permitting albumin to enter the urine. The enzyme N-deacetylase is necessary to form heparan sulfate, which is how the GBM derives its negative charge. Furthermore, inadequate control of blood sugars inhibits this enzyme, reducing the negative charge on GBM and allowing excessive amounts of albumin to leak out.

The current hypothesis, known as the ‘Steno hypothesis,’ is that systemic vascular endothelial dysfunction initiates the development of microalbuminuria and cardiovascular disease, as there is a strong correlation between these three variables.
