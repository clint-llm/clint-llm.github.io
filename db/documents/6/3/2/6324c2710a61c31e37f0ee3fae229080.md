The overall prognosis of C1 fractures is favorable, and on most occasions, conservative management provides adequate fracture healing. These fractures are associated with a very low incidence of neurological deficit, as the fracture fragments tend to be outwardly displaced rather than encroach on the neural canal. The spinal canal is also very spacious at this level. Associated bony and ligament (transverse ligament) injuries predominantly determine the prognosis and healing of these fractures.
