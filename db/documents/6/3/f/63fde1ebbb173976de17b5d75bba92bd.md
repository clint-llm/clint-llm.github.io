Constipation is a common disease that affects children and adults, especially the elderly. Unmanaged constipation can progress to fecal impaction, which further impairs patients' quality of life and increases healthcare costs. Constipation is one of the most prevalent outpatient diagnoses among gastrointestinal disorders.

It can be challenging for the healthcare team because there are no accepted guidelines for choosing the best agent. The clinician should discuss all problems with the patient and coordinate with nurses or the caregiver to maximize the quality of service, thus increasing the patient's quality of life. The provider should consider all risks and benefits of using a laxative, especially a bisacodyl, in the management of constipation to minimalize the adverse effect. Besides using bisacodyl as a stimulant laxative, it is also essential to focus on individual therapy based on the symptoms and pathophysiology of the patient's disease to make a better follow-up to improve the outcome of this disorder. Pharmacists need to be engaged with both the patient, nursing staff, and the clinician. These products are available OTC, and the burden of counseling and making recommendations may fall 100% to the pharmacist. The pharmacist should contact the patient's physician if there are any concerns over the patient's use of bisacodyl. Nurses should also understand the ramifications and potential adverse effects of these agents, and take a thorough medication history, including OTC agents, so the treating clinician has a clearer picture of the patient's case. This approach represents the type of collaborative interprofessional team approach necessary to drive an optimal outcome for the patient. [Level 5]

Despite being used for symptomatic relief, laxatives are also misused by individuals who present with eating disorders like anorexia nervosa or bulimia, individuals who engaged in certain types of athletic training, including sports with set weight limits, and surreptitious laxative abusers who use the drugs to cause factitious diarrhea and may have a medical disorder. The first step in treating laxative misuse is to determine what may be promoting the behavior. The individual who misuses the laxative has to stop the stimulant laxatives and replace them with osmotic supplements to establish regular bowel movements. Education and further treatment are required to maintain a healthy bowel program. Referral for psychiatric treatment is essential in the case of eating disorders such as bulimia or anorexia nervosa to lessen the reliance on laxatives as a method to alter perceived weight and shape.
