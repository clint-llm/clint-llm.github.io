Patients suffering from GLPLS require a thorough explanation of prognosis and treatment options to lead them towards realistic expectation for the management of their disease. With current therapy often not affecting the alopecic portion of the disease, many patients forego treatment. While treatment modalities cannot cause improvement towards the prior cicatricial damage, early initiation of a therapeutic agent may lead to a reduction in further progression of the non-cicatricial alopecia, cicatricial alopecia of the scalp, and hyperkeratotic papule formation. Giving patients a clear insight into the goals of GLPLS therapy can improve compliance and lead to better patient-physician relationships.
