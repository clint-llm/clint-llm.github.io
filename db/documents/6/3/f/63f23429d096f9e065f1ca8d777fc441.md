Alzheimer's disease is a gradual and progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by neuronal cell death. It typically starts in the entorhinal cortex in the hippocampus. There is a genetic role identified for both early and late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Trisomy 21 is a risk factor for early-onset dementia. Several risk factors have been associated with Alzheimer's disease. Increasing age is the most important risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Traumatic head injury, depression, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, higher parental age, smoking, family history of dementia, increased homocysteine levels and presence of APOE e4 allele are known to increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Higher education, use of estrogen by women, use of anti-inflammatory agents, leisure activities like reading or playing musical instruments, healthy diet and regular aerobic exercise is known to decrease the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Having a first-degree relative with Alzheimer's disease increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease by 10% to 30%. Individuals with 2 or more siblings with late-onset Alzheimer disease increase their risk of getting Alzheimer's disease by 3-fold as compared to the general population.
