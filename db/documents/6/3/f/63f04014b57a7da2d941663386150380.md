LS affects most commonly the genital site and less often the extragenital area. Typical lesions begin as a sharply demarcated erythema that becomes thin, hypopigmented, ivory-white, porcelain-like, and sclerotic plaques. Plaques may become later thickened due to repeated excoriations. Itch is the main symptom and is often worse at night. Other lesions may include telangiectasias, purpura, fissures, ulcerations, and edema. Typical complaints commonly include significant pruritus, local burning sensation, pain, painful defecation. Constipation is frequent in children but rarely seen in adults. However, lesions can be asymptomatic. Genital lesions begin around the periclitoral hood. The affected area varies from a small and single area to large area involving the entire region of the vulva, perineum, and perianus assuming a typical aspect of ‘keyhole sign.’

However, LS usually spares the vagina and cervix. In girls, LS presents commonly with irritation and soreness although it can mimic sexual abuse. However, LS and sexual abuse can coexist. Visual lichen sclerosus exhibits the Koebner phenomenon at sites of trauma; sexual abuse can aggravate lesions of LS.
