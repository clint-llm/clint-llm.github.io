If trinucleotide repeats exist in exonic sequences, an increasing number of copies can have an effect on transcription and translation of proteins contributing to pathology. However, many also occur in UTRs, and, while it would appear not to affect pathology, they actually can still contribute to disease.

The mechanism by which trinucleotide repeats cause disease is still under extensive study, but some theories have emerged about what contributes to trinucleotide repeat instability. One study points to mismatch repair (MMR) proteins and their role in promoting instability through overexpression.
