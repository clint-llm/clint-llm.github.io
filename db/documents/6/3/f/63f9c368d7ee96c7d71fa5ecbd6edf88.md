Iontophoresis is a method of transdermal drug delivery wherein a clinician uses an electric current to promote localized, superficial permeation of a therapeutic agent through the skin. Among the earliest applications of electrical current for medical therapy was by Pivati in 1740 to treat arthritis.

Nomenclature notwithstanding, the indications for iontophoresis are numerous and may involve local, regional, or systemic delivery. Localized delivery of therapeutic agents includes local anesthetics (e.g., lidocaine) andÂ fentanyl for analgesia, retinoids, and corticosteroids to treat scarring from acne, and antiperspirants for palmar and plantar hyperhidrosis.

This activity will explore the indications, mechanisms, and benefits/risks of iontophoresis in the context of analgesic medication delivery and pain relief both locally and systemically.
