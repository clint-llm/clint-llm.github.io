Hypermagnesemia can be diagnosed relatively quickly if there is a high index of suspicion. This can be done by obtaining a measurement of the concentration of magnesium in the blood. Levels that are greater than 2.2 mEq/L (or greater than 1.1 mmol/L) are diagnostic for hypermagnesemia. When suspicion for magnesium toxicity is high, workup including an initial ECG as this can be readily done and can identify lethal dysrhythmias that may require emergent treatments. In addition to an ECG, a clinician should also order a complete metabolic panel, including magnesium and phosphorus, to rule out additional electrolyte abnormalities as well as evaluate the patient's renal function as magnesium is excreted by the kidneys.
