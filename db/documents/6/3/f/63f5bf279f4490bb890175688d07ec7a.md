Double aortic arch is the commonest form of a group of defects that affect the development of the aorta. This defect causes an abnormal circular formation of blood vessels, called a vascular ring, that can result in life-threatening airway obstruction. To avoid the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition, it must be thought of and promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of a double aortic arch and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the embryological etiology of a double aortic arch.
- Explain the evaluation process in cases of a double aortic arch.
- Outline the surgical management of a double aortic arch.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication in the management of a double aortic arch.
