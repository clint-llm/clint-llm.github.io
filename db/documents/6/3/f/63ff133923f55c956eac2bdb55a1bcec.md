The pathophysiology of DMI is related to the number of CTG repeats, with more repeats correlating with more severe disease. Those with less than 35 repeats are considered normal, and those that manifest with clinical symptoms typically have greater than 50. Maternal transmissions will often result inÂ greater CTG expansion.
