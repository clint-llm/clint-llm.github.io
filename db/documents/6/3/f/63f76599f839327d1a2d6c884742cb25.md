If a patient's dizziness or difficulty with balance is secondary to an ischemic CVA, then neurology should be consulted. Neurology and Neurosurgery should be contacted in cases involving intracranial hemorrhage. Otolaryngologists should be consulted for most peripheral causes of dizziness. Dizziness from cardiovascular etiologies needs further evaluation and workup from a cardiologist and/or electrophysiologist.
