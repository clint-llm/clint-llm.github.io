The prognosis for most patients is excellent. Except for critical stenosis during the neonatal period, most patients will live a typical life.

For patients undergoing balloon valvotomy, a better prognosis was seen with dome-shaped valves over dysplastic valves. After the procedure, at years 1, 3, and 6, the reintervention rate was 0%, 3.5%, and 3.5%, respectively.

Patients suffering from pulmonic stenosis can also undergo virtually all dental procedures. Antibiotics are only recommended with a history of prior endocarditis or a prosthetic valve placement.
