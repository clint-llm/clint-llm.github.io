The exact etiology of specific phobias is not known. However, some theories suggest that specific phobia may also develop due to an association of a specific object or situation with emotions such as fear and panic. Two theories have been proposed to show this pairing. The most common theory--classical conditioning model--postulates that a phobia precipitates when an event that provokes fear or anxiety is paired with a neutral event. An example of this would be in which a specific event such as driving is paired with an emotional experience such as an accident. As a result, the person is susceptible to a chronic emotional association between driving and anxiety. Although a person may not experience a panic attack or meet the criteria for a panic disorder, they may develop a fear that is expressed as having a specific phobia. Another mechanism of association is through modeling, in which a person observes a reaction in another person and internalizes that other person’s fears or warnings about the dangers of a specific object or situation.
