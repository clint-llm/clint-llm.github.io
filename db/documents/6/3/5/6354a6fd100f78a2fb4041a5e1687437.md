Healthcare professionals (pharmacists, nurses, mid-level practitioners, and doctors) who prescribe and distribute this medication should be aware of the side effects and sound-alike look-alike issues between the verapamil brand names; these concerns require monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure. Pharmacists should educate patients regarding the drug's side effects and how to identify and what to do if they experience them. Further, they should keep track of other medications that the patient is taking to avoid drug-drug interactions. Pharmacists should also educate doctors and nurses on the differences between oral and IV dosing and exercise caution when converting from one route to another. When a clinician decides to switch from oral formulation to intravenous formulation, the total daily dose of verapamil will remain the same unless the strength of the formulation does not allow for direct mg for mg conversion. Therefore, nurses and clinicians should engage the pharmacist when prescribing or counseling on the dosing and administration of the various formulations, and nursing should understand this information for their counseling. This type of interprofessional communication among healthcare team members will improve outcomes using verapamil. [Level 5]
