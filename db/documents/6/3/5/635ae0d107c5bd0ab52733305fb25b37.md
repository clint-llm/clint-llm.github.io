A good history and physical examination can help in differentiating trigeminal neuralgia from other similar conditions.

- Postherpetic neuralgia: This is secondary to acute Herpes zoster. This usually presents with a severe preceding rash. Often involves the first division of the trigeminal nerve, and the pain is usually continuous. TN pain is intermittent and lasts a few seconds.

- Dental pain: This is usually continuous and intraoral pain, which can be dull or throbbing. TN pain is usually sharp, intermittent, and electric-shock like. Also, abnormalities are found on oral examination if the pain is from a dental source.

- Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks (SUNA) and short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT): These present as sudden, brief attacks of unilateral pain in orbital, periorbital, and temporal regions. Ipsilateral autonomic symptoms also accompany these.

- Trigeminal neuropathy: This condition presents with persistent pain and can be associated with sensory loss.

- Temporomandibular joint syndrome: This condition presents with persistent pain. Localized tenderness and jaw abnormalities can be demonstrated.

- Glossopharyngeal neuralgia: Patients present with pain in the tongue, mouth, and throat. The pain is triggered by chewing, talking, and swallowing.
