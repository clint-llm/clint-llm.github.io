Interprofessional communication is required when using mass spectrometers. For example, if a patient has ingested a certain unknown compound and presents it to the emergency department, lab technicians and pathologists can take the patient's sample and acquire results for the components present in the compound. This allows for support from individuals in laboratory settings to healthcare workers, such as nurses and other physicians,Â who may be present in the hospital or clinic settings. Physicians in the emergency room can contribute to the interprofessional environment by discussing the patient's history and physical examination outcomes to help further narrow down the compounds in the patient's sample.
