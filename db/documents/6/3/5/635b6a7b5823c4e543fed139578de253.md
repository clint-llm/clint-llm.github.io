Primary ciliary dysfunctionÂ (PCD), first described in 1976, is a disorder of the structure and function of motile cilia that results in chronic oto-sinopulmonary disease.

This abnormal function impairs the ability of cilia to function in a coordinated manner, impairing mucociliary clearance and causing chronic upper and lower respiratory inflammation.
