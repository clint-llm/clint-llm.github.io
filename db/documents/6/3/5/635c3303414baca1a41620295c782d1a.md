Actinic purpura results from the fragility of the skin, which occurs due to long term sun exposure leading to ultraviolet-induced dermal atrophy. The dermal connective tissue is not able to support microvasculature adequately leading to extravasation of the blood into the dermis after a minor trauma that is often neglected in medical history. It is one of the signs ofÂ dermatoporosis, which indicates skin fragility as well as skin atrophy and stellate pseudo scars.
