There are various explanations about the pathophysiology of presbyopia. Among all the concepts, increased stiffness of the crystalline lens is the most popular and widely accepted. Presbyopia is a physiological condition wherein there is a progressive functional decline in the accommodative capacity of the crystalline lens. Clinically, it manifests as progressive difficulty in reading at the usual reading distance. In an in-vitro study by Glasser and Campbell, they noticed no change in focal length, with simulated zonular tension and relaxation.

Normally, the nucleus is stiffer than the cortex in the older lens, whereas, among young individuals, the cortex is stiffer than the nucleus.
