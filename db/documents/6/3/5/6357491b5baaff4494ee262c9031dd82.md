Photosensitivity refers to various symptoms, diseases, and photodermatoses caused or exacerbated by exposure to sunlight. Photosensitive conditions are classified into five categories, which include primary or autoimmune photodermatosis, exogenous or drug/chemical-induced photodermatosis, photo-exacerbated or photo-aggravated dermatoses, metabolic photodermatosis, and genetic photodermatosis. This activity illustrates the evaluation, treatment, and potential complications associated with photosensitive conditions and the importance of an interprofessional team approach to the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the classifications of photosensitivity and the diseases associated with each.
- Review typical presenting features of photosensitive conditions.
- Summarize the special precautions that photosensitive patients should take.
- Explain the importance of enhancing coordination among the interprofessional team in managing those with this condition.
