As the information provided in this article suggests, the majority of viral infections of the oral mucosa are benign and self-limiting. However, some conditions may progress and lead to potentially life-threatening complications. Moreover, the development of specific oral lesions of viral nature may suggest undiagnosed immunodeficiency and increase the risk of malignancy.

For this reason, patients should be discouraged from disregarding benign-appearing lesions or mild symptoms. This will allow for adequate treatment initiation, appropriate specialist referral, and optimal disease prevention as warranted.
