Ultrasound as part of follow up imaging for masses reported as breast imaging reporting and data system (BI-RADS) 2 or 3 (probably benign) has shown great value in assessing morphological changes to the sonographic appearance.

Through the use of ultrasound as a standard follow up imaging tool, it could promote recharacterization of lesions during initial imaging assessment.

Full ultrasound examination requires the recording of results in a standard breast report, including the patient indications, findings, and results with differential diagnosis.

Any lesions noted during the examination should be measured in both transverse and longitudinal planes. Location, measurement, echogenicity of all masses should be described as either hypoechoic, hyperechoic, or heterogeneous.

The various mass descriptors are used according to the ultrasound breast imaging and reporting system (US BIRADS) lexicon which includes six main morphological descriptors for breast masses:

The most common morphologic features associated with benign sonographic findings are:

- Smooth and well-circumscribed margins

- Hyperechoic, isoechoic or mildly hypoechoic in echogenicity

- Thin echogenic capsule or well-defined capsule border

- Ellipsoid shape, wider than tall appearance

- Macrolobulated; less than three lobulated margins

- Posterior acoustic enhancement

The most common morphologic features associated with malignant findings are:

- Hypoechoic mass, on occasion, hyperechoic in appearance

- Spiculated margins

- Ill-defined borders, architectural distortion of surrounding soft tissue

- Posterior acoustic shadowing

- Taller than wide appearance

- Microcalcifications present
