Although rTMS is a non-invasive technique and its side effect profile is rare, but it may induce seizures. Hence, it is not recommended for patients with epilepsy. Pre-existing neurological disease, adolescents, change in medication regime, substance use during the rTMS course (especially during HF-rTMS)should also be taken into account as they lower the seizure threshold. It is, therefore, necessary that services, where rTMS is being provided, should be well equipped to deal with any seizure episode in patients.

rTMS is relatively a well tolerable treatment but may present with pain at the stimulation site, posttreatment headaches, neck pain, or toothache. Muscle twitching during treatment can also occur. Transient changes in the auditory threshold, hyperacusis, have been demonstrated due to the loud clicks produced during TMS pulse. Hence, hearing protection is mandatory. Metallic/electronic implants or cochlear implants that are in close contact with the TMS coil serve as an absolute contraindication.
