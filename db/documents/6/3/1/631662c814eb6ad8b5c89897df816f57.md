As with most elements of this disease, histopathologic findings vary widely. Ig deposition may occur intracellularly or extracellularly and has been seen in limbal vascular endothelium, corneal stroma, corneal keratocytes, and conjunctival fibroblasts. An immunohistochemical evaluation may be the most specific histopathological assay, as these deposits are usually reactive for Ig light chain, Ig heavy chain, or both. They are eosinophilic on H&E stain and fuchsinophilic with Masson trichrome.

Electrophoresis performed on the deposits will also reveal immunoglobulin deposits, which can distinguish paraproteinemia from other disease processes causing protein deposition, such as cystinosis.

The corneal copper deposition may be seen on histology as well due to the high affinity of some types of immunoglobulin for copper. While this does occur in monoclonal gammopathies and is also mediated by immunoglobulin deposition, it occurs via a separate mechanism and presents differently than PPK. Copper deposition disease and will not be addressed at length in this article.
