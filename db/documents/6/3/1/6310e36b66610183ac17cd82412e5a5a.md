The spleen, lymph nodes, thymus, lymph channels, adenoids, tonsils, and thymus make up the lymphatic system.

- Lymph nodes – The average adult has roughly 700 lymph nodes, which are spread out throughout the body. These nodules produce and store white blood cells and function to filter lymph fluid.

- Tonsils and adenoids – Closely packed lymphatic cells in the posterior of the oropharynx and posterior to the soft palate, respectively

- Thymus – The cite of T-cell maturation sits just posterior to the manubrium. This organ is most active in the early stages of life.

- Spleen – Largest of the organs involved in the lymphatic system, the spleen holds white blood cells to fight infection and filters the blood.

These organs share connections via small lymph channels similar to capillaries, which mimic the circulatory system. Lymph vessels form a one-way system to transport fluid and leukocytes that have extravasated from blood vessels.
