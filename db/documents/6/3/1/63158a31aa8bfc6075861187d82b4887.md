Systemic chemotherapy has demonstrated objective response rates; however, a complete pathological response is rare. There is no consensus in the literature regarding the optimal duration of chemotherapy, but a minimum of three to six months on a select regimen is advocated before changing agents. When offering non-first-line chemotherapy agents that include biologic medications, the morbidity of side effects must be weighed against the patient's clinical status. Careful monitoring must be employed, as there have been mixed data on their success rates in treating hepatic metastases.
