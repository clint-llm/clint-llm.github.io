Wheezes are thought to be the product of fluttering vibrations of narrowed airway walls, induced by a diminished airflow velocity. The characteristics of their sound include how loud they are (i.e., the amplitude), how long they last and how intense (i.e., high pitched) they sound. A physiologic trial done in the 1980s identified the determinants of the pitch of a sound generated within collapsible tubes. It was determined that the pitch of a wheeze is a reflection of the stiffness, thickness, and longitudinal tension of the airway's wall. Subsequent clinical studies have shown that the pitch and, more so, duration of wheeze are the only two characteristics that correlate well with the severity of airway obstruction. The degree of bronchial obstruction is also proportional to the number of airways that are producing wheeze. And so, the amplitude of auscultated wheeze has no bearing on the severity of airway obstruction. At the very severe end of airway obstruction, if there is very little to no airflow, then no wheeze will be heard despite severe airway obstruction.
