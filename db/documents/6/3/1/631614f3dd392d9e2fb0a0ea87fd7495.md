Fetal hemoglobin is useful in evaluating various conditions in pregnancy and the neonate. The hemoglobin alkaline denaturation test (Apt test) can help to differentiate maternal and fetal blood. In this test, a blood sample of 0.1 mL is added to a glass tube with an alkali reagent containing potassium hydroxide, and the solution is shaken gently for 2 minutes. HbA will bind hydroxide to form hematin, turning the sample a dark-green brown,Â which indicates the presence of maternal blood in the sample. If only fetal blood is present, the solution will remain pink. The Kleihauer-Betke test assesses the extent of maternal-fetal hemorrhage and the required dose of RhoD immunoglobulin for Rh-negative mothers, for the prevention of maternal Rh antibody formation leading to Rhesus disease in the fetus/neonate. The test utilizes HbF's property of acid resistance. A blood smear taken from the mother is exposed to an acidic pH solution; maternal red blood cells become "ghost cells," as HbA is unstable at a low pH, and the cell membrane is denatured. Since fetal blood cells contain HbF, they remain pink, as HbF is stable at this pH range. The appropriate dose of RhoD immunoglobulin is calculated based on the percentage of fetal blood cells in the maternal blood.
