This procedure is typically performed in an outpatient setting. Before the procedure, written informed consent should be obtained after the risks, benefits, and alternatives have been discussed with the patient.

The site of treatment should be marked. The skin should be prepped using an aseptic technique and draped in a sterile manner.  Before the start of the procedure, a “time out” should be performed to verify patient identity, procedure, allergies, relevant laboratory results, and correct treatment site.
