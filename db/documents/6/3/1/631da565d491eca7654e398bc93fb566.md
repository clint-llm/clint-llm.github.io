Osteitis fibrosa cystica is the result ofÂ the overproduction of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the setting of primary, secondary, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism. PTH attaches to receptors on osteoblasts, which results in the expression of RANK ligand-receptor activator. RANK ligand attaches to RANK on precursors of the osteoclasts, promoting osteoclast formation. Activated osteoclasts cause bone resorption, cortical bone destruction, and fibrous cysts formation. Osteoclast-like giant cells and vascularized fibrous tissue might replace bone marrow resulting in Brown tumors, which are non-neoplastic lesions. During the Brown tumor process, bone demineralization promotes osteoclast activation. Eventually, bone resorption can cause microfractures and microhemorrhages.
