Breast ultrasound is performed due to the high incidence rate of breast cancer amongst women globally. Ultrasound is typically used as an adjunct to mammographic imaging, which remains the gold standard for breast cancer diagnosis. The main indications include palpable mass, dense fibroglandular breast tissue, and pregnant/lactating women. This activity reviews the evaluation and technique of breast ultrasound and highlights the role of the interprofessional team evaluating for and referring to this procedure.
