Each Schwann cell makes up a single myelin sheath on a peripheral axon, with each ensuing myelin sheath made by a different Schwann cell, such that numerous Schwann cells are needed to myelinate the length of an axon. This arrangement is in contrast to oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cell of the central nervous system (CNS), which form myelin sheaths for multiple surrounding axons. Schwann cells are surrounded by a basal lamina, while oligodendrocytes are not. Between adjacent myelin sheaths, there are gaps of approximately 1 micrometer, called nodes of Ranvier. There is a concentration of voltage-gated sodium channels at the node, which is the site of saltatory conduction.
