Histologically, the skin biopsies of pancreatic panniculitis have distinct features. There are descriptions ofÂ 2 types of pancreatic panniculitis histologically, septal panniculitis and lobular panniculitis.

Lobular fat necrosis is predominant with adjacent neutrophilic infiltration.

A digital bone biopsy from a pediatric case of PPP syndrome demonstrated the destruction of bone structure with fatty tissue saponification and the absence of inflammatory cells, indicating the relationship between fatty acids and increased cytokine production leading to joint inflammation.
