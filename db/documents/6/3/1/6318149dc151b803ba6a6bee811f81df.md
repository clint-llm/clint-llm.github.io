Lumbar stabilization is the natural ability of the spinal column to maintain its anatomical structure on physiological loading. The stability is maintained by the interaction between the bony structure with ligaments, the attached muscles, and the nervous system that connects the above two. Natural disc degeneration combined with sedentary behavior can lead to weakness of the muscles, which can then cause segmental instability. Back pain is the largest cause of disability-adjusted living years based on the WHO survey of the global burden of disease. This article reviews the components that contribute to stability, details how the lack of interaction between the various elements can cause abnormal mobility and pain, details the clinical tests required to identify lack of strength and endurance of the lumbar muscles and provides one of the standard methods (motor control exercises) available to increase muscle strength and regain stability.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures contributing to lumbar stability.
- Describe the tests required to determine the strength and endurance of the lumbar muscles.
- Review appropriate therapeutic exercises to rectify low back pain from segmental instability.
- Outline simple exercises to retrain the muscles that surround the lumbar spine to activate in the right sequence to provide stability and thereby pain-free movement.
