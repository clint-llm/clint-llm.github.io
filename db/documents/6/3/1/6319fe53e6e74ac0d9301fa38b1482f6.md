Prognosis varies based on risk factors for thrombosis and the percentage of vein occlusion. If untreated, residual venous obstruction in patients with Paget-Schroetter is present in 78%, with persistent symptoms. Disability occurs due to thrombosis in 41% to 91% of cases. If treated appropriately with conservative measures or surgical intervention, the prognosis of effort-induced SCVT is excellent.

The prognosis of idiopathic SCVT depends on the presence or absence of malignancy or thrombophilia. Cancer patients with SCVT have rates of complication as high as 50%. Complications of pulmonary embolism are about 9.2%, superior vena cava syndrome is 14.9%, and post-thrombotic syndrome is 26.4%. The risk of thromboembolism following idiopathic UEDVT is lower than the secondary type.
