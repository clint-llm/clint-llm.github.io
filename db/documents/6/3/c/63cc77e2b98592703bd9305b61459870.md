The area postrema may be damaged by lesioning or ablation, which prevents its normal functions, including its variety of physiological reflexes. These reflexes include taste aversion, gastroparesis, and homeostatic functions. Many of them rely on the brain’s ability to monitor the body’s physiologic status through the use of the vagus nerve; thus, lesions to the structure sometimes carry the name of ‘central vagotomy.’

The structure also clinical importance with regards to Parkinson disease. Dopaminergic drugs serving as treatment agents for the disease strongly affect the area postrema, which has a high density of dopamine receptors. As it is a very sensitive chemoreceptor, it senses the foreign poisonous substance, causing it to react defensively and induce nausea and vomiting to prevent further intoxication. Accordingly, a common side effect of antiparkinsonian drugs is nausea.
