Infective endocarditis classification is by The Modified Duke Criteria, which is useful in the evaluation of patients suspected of IE. Three categories include definite IE, possible IE, or rejected IE.

a) Definite IE by pathological criteria: whereby there is evidence of microorganisms on excised vegetation or an abscess specimen or vegetation or abscess demonstrate active endocarditis and

b) Definite IE by clinical criteria: defined by presence of two major criteria, one major criterion plus three minor criteria, or five minor criteria in The Modified Duke Criteria.

Major clinical criteria are defined as follows: multiple positive blood cultures, single positive culture for Coxiella burnetti, endocardial involvement (presence of new valvular regurgitation, or presence of vegetation, abscess or dehiscence).

a) Predisposing heart condition or use of intravenous drug use

b) Fever with body temperature greater than 38 degrees C (100.4 degrees F)

c) Vascular phenomena, arterial emboli, septic pulmonary infarcts, mycotic aneurysm, intracranial hemorrhage, conjunctival hemorrhages, and Janeway lesions

d) Immunologic phenomena: Osler nodes, Roth spots, and rheumatoid factor

e) Positive blood culture that does not meet the major criteria.

Possible IE is when there are one major criterion and one minor criterion or three minor criteria present.

A transthoracic echocardiogram should be corroborated by transesophageal echocardiogram in the evaluation for patients with suspected IE. Sometimes no definitive diagnosis is established until the patient has an operation upon at that time tissue specimens should be obtained for histological analysis.
