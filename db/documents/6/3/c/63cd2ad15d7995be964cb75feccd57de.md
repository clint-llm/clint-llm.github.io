The formation of the cerebral circulation begins with the development of six pairs of branchial arch arteries. The third branchial arch arteries contribute to the formation of the ICAs early in embryonic life. The second branchial arch arteries help form the ventral pharyngeal arteries, which fuse proximally with the ICAs to form the common carotid arteries (CCA). Around 28 days of development, the ICA branches into anterior and posterior divisions. The anterior ICA gives rise to the ACA, MCA, and anterior choroidal artery; the posterior division gives rise to the PCA and the posterior choroidal artery.

The growth of the occipital lobe and brainstem trigger the development of the posterior circulation. Early in development, the hindbrain receives vascular supply from the carotid-vertebrobasilar connections via the trigeminal artery (TA), the otic artery (OA), the hypoglossal artery (HA), and the proatlantal artery (ProA). When the PCom forms and connects to the distal BA, the TA, OA, and HA regress. The ProA remains until the VAs develop.

The development of the MCA begins around 35 days from the anterior division of the ICA. Meanwhile, the ACAÂ grows medially, leading to the development of the ACom. The formation of the ACA and ACom marks the full development of the CoW, typically occurring at 6 to 7 weeks of development.
