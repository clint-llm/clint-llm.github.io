Severe burns cause not only significant injury at the local burn site but also a systemic response throughout the body. Inflammatory and vasoactive mediators such as histamines, prostaglandins, and cytokines are released causing a systemic capillary leak, intravascular fluid loss, and large fluid shifts. These responses occur mostly over the first 24 hours peaking at around six to eight hours after injury. This response, along with decreased cardiac output and increased vascular resistance, can lead to marked hypovolemia and hypoperfusion called burn shock. This can be managed with aggressive fluid resuscitation and close monitoring for adequate, but not excessive, IV fluids. This activity reviews the importance of burn fluid resuscitation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing burn patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the parkland formula and its use in resuscitation of burn patients.
- Review complications of major burns.
- Summarize the types of fluids used to resuscitate burn patients.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by burns.
