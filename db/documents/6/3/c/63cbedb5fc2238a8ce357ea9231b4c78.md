SUDEP is the most catastrophic complication of epilepsy. Other complications include injuries related to seizures, aspiration pneumonitis, drowning, status epilepticus, and anti-seizure medication toxicity.Â Patients with epilepsy are also at risk for neuropsychiatric disorders, including learning disabilities, and mood disorders, including depression. Furthermore, patients are at risk of decreased physical activity and social stigmatization.
