Because initially, the cause of angioedema is likely to be unknown, the mainstays of initial medical management include supplemental oxygen, a parenteral H-blocker, a parenteral steroid, and intramuscular epinephrine. Unfortunately, in AAE standard regimens of epinephrine, corticosteroids and antihistamines do not have much effect and are not recommended for AAE. Administration of plasma-derived or recombinant C1-INH can resolve acute attacks, but some patients will become non-responsive

Icatibant, a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, has been shown to provide symptoms relief in AAE and was well tolerated

The emergency department course is varied and clinical evolution may reflect the natural course of the illness rather than an actual response to medical management. Therefore, frequent re-evaluation is essential to monitor for any sudden deterioration in clinical status. If a patient has persistent involvement of the tongue, intraoral cavity, or throat, if they have persistent or recurring airway edema, or if they have persistent signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis (e.g., hypotension, cardiovascular compromise, altered mental status) then they require admission to the hospital in an intensive care setting. However, if the angioedema is limited to the face and lips or there is localized tongue involvement with a fully visible soft palate, patients may be observed in the emergency department for four to six hours before discharge home if they are reliable with a good support system at home.
