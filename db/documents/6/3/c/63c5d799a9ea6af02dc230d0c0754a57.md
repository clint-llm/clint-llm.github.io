Renal osteodystrophy is a broad term that incorporates all the biochemical abnormalities and skeletal manifestations in patients suffering from chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease. The derangements in the serum levels of calcium, phosphorous, PTH, vitamin D, along with their effects on bone turnover, mineralization, and extraskeletal calcifications, are all important components of this condition. Reports suggest these abnormalities are most likely to be seen at a GFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2.

The histopathological findings of renal osteodystrophy are commonly used to further classify this condition into:

- High bone turnover states like osteitis fibrosa and hyperparathyroidism

- Low bone turnover states, such as adynamic bone disease or heavy metal-induced osteomalacia

The development of renal osteodystrophy as a complication of end-stage renal disease has also influenced changes in the treatment protocols and dialysis regimens in patients.
