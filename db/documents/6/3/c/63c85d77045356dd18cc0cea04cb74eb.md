Distal clavicular osteolysis (DCO) is an overuse injury most often seen in athletes and weight lifters that causes pain in the AC joint. This is an atypical injury with multiple effective treatment modalities. Distal clavicular osteolysis results from repetitive excess load to the AC joint, typically through horizontal adduction, adduction, internal rotation, and forward/lateral flexion of the shoulder, such as bench pressing or overhead lifting. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of distal clavicular osteolysis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of distal clavicular osteolysis.
- Describe the typical patient history and presentation for distal clavicular osteolysis.
- Explain treatment considerations for patients with distal clavicular osteolysis.
- Review the diagnostic imaging findings associated with distal clavicular osteolysis.
