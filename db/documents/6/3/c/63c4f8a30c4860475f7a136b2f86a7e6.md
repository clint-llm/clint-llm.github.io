A significant number of women are seeking labiaplasty. Often, they first present to theirÂ obstetrician, gynecologist, or primary care provider for advice. These patients should be referred to a surgeon who specializes in labiaplasty. Educating the patient that labiaplasty is generally an elective procedure done primarily for cosmetic reasons is essential. The procedure is relatively simple but also associated with a number of serious complications.

These procedures require an interprofessional healthcare team approach. This team can include the woman's family clinician, the specialty surgeon, the nursing staff, and a pharmacist. Nurses will play a crucial role in helping prepare the patient for the procedure, assisting during the operation, and providing post-procedural care, monitoring, and patient education. Pharmacists can assist with appropriate post-operative pain medication recommendations. Of course, the surgeon will determine the overall direction of care, but this should be done with open communication with the patient's other clinicians. All team members should reach out and communicate any concerns they may encounter during the case. The interprofessional paradigm will lead to better patient outcomes and greater patient satisfaction. [Level 5]
