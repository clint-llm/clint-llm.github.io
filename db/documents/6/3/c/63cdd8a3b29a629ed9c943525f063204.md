With the increasing demand for rejuvenation procedures of the face and neck, neck-lifts are in demand as many patients perceive them to be less invasive and scarring than face-lifts. It is essential that when treating such patients, an interprofessional team approach is followed in order to avoid troublesome postoperative complications and litigation. TheÂ interprofessional team for a neck-lift patient should include a plastic surgeon, who is assisted by other specialists, including an internal medicine physician, anesthetist, psychiatrist, financial counselor, nurse, pharmacist, and dermatologist.

Each member of this team has a specific and important role to play to deliver holistic care to the patient and to ensure that the process is smooth, without any undue complications. For example, patients with psychiatric problems are not absolutely contraindicated for surgery, and if they are willing to acknowledge the limitations of the procedure, have realistic expectations, take appropriate medications, and undergo preoperative and postoperative counseling, surgery may be undertaken without an elevated risk of adverse outcomes.

Another important contributor to better outcomes is the experience level of the surgeon, who should be fellowship-trained and board-certified in plastic or facial plastic surgery, but the surgeon is only part of the interprofessional team. An interprofessional team with experience working together to provide cosmetic surgical care will further reduce complications and increase the chance of a safe, smooth, and successful operation.
