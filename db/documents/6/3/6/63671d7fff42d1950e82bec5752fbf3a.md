The key points to remember for subungual melanoma are:

- It has the same histopathological process as cutaneous malignant melanoma.

- Some studies suggest it is more aggressive than cutaneous malignant melanoma, but this is likely due to late presentation.

- It should be diagnosed using an excision or an incision biopsy.

- The excision margin is determined by the depth of the tumor and may lead to the amputation of part or all of the digit.
