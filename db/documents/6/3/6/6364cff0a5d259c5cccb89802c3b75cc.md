The medical history of CSH patients might show hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and neurodegenerative disorders (Parkinson and Alzheimer). Physical exams might be normal except for the clinical manifestations of the previously mentioned disorders.

Symptomatic CSH mainly present with the following:

**Signs and Symptoms**

- Presyncope or syncope.

- Unexplained falls.

- Visual changes before consciousness loss (i.e., darkening visual field).

**Physical Examination**

- Hypotension.

- Pallor.

- Bradycardia.

- Bruises related to fall injury.

It is very important to determine the cause of falls or syncope in the elderly, as it is very likely to miss an important and critical condition (severe aortic stenosis, arrhythmias) or neurologic conditions (seizure or stroke). Such a miss can lead to critical results, especially if the patient has recurrent episodes of syncope while driving, during sea activities (swimming and diving), parachuting, or running heavy machinery. On the other hand, CSH can be asymptomatic and only happens during a carotid massage. It is worthy to re-mention that CSH diagnostic criteria during carotid massage might happen without symptoms.

It was mentioned in the medical literature; that in rare cases of the head and neck tumors, there has been a hyper-response of the carotid sinus to the tumor burden pressing over baroreceptors (the management depends on the primary tumor, stage, age, and prognosis).
