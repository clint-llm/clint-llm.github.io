The primary blood supply to the lower limb is via the femoral artery. The deep femoral artery is the main blood supplier to the thigh. The medial circumflex artery and the lateral circumflex artery are the main branches of the deep femoral artery. The medial circumflex artery supplies the hip joint, while the lateral circumflex artery supplies the soft tissues surrounding the hip joint.

Distal to its branching point, the lateral femoral circumflex artery courses laterally between the divisions of the femoral nerve. It then travels inferiorly into the septum between the sartorius and rectus femoris muscles, where it further divides into the ascending, transverse, and descending lateral femoral circumflex arteries.

**Ascending Branch**

Approximately 11 cm distal to the anterior superior iliac spine, the ascending branch of the lateral femoral circumflex artery bifurcates into muscular and capsular branches. These branches supply the femoral neck at the level of the intertrochanteric line, the anterior hip capsule, and the anterior portion of the femoral neck.

The ascending branch of the lateral femoral circumflex artery supplies approximately 18% of the blood supply to the femoral head with a higher percentage of the vascularity being within the anterior portion of the femoral head.

One anatomical study found that while the medial femoral circumflex artery dominates the majority of the blood supply to the femoral neck, about one-third of the femoral neck gets supplied by the lateral femoral circumflex artery. In the same study, researchers determined that the lateral femoral circumflex artery largely supplies the anteroinferior femoral neck.

**Descending Branch**

Distal to its branch point, the descending branch of the lateral femoral circumflex artery courses down medial to the vastus lateralis muscle.
