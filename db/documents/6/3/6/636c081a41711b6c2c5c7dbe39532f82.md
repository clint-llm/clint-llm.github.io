In the presence of joint effusion, joint pain of unknown etiology, or suspected infection within a joint space, arthrocentesis can aid in diagnosis. In settings in which intra-articular injection is a consideration, aspiration should be performed before injection as the aspirated fluid should first undergo inspection for any gross abnormalities or signs of gross infection. Arthrocentesis can also be performed therapeutically for pain relief in a painful joint in which case an effusion or hemarthrosis is preventing a full range of motion of the involved joint. Aspiration should be performed by a trained physician under sterile procedural protocol to prevent the risk of infection and contamination of the aspirate.
