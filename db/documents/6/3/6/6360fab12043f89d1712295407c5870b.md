As previously stated, prescribing MAOIs with any sympathomimetic agent may precipitate a hypertensive crisis. For that reason, it is contraindicated to co-administer these agents. Moreover, preparations containing ephedrine, phenylephrine, phenylpropanolamine, or pseudoephedrine such as cold and nasal decongestion remedies should not be given concomitantly with MAOIs for the same reason. Similarly, levodopa should be utilized with caution in patients on MAOIs as it increases the levels of circulating noradrenaline.

Serotonergic antidepressants cotemporally administered with MAOIs increase the chances of serotonin syndrome precipitation, so it is generally advised against the co-prescription of those agents. If utilized in cases of treatment-resistant depression, rigorous monitoring is necessary.

For the sake of avoiding a hypertensive crisis, or the so-called “pressor response” of tyramine found in some foods, dietary restrictions require implementation. Classically, all aged cheeses are absolutely contraindicated, as well as all aged, smoked, pickled, or cured meats, fish, and poultry. A variety of other foods, including over-ripened fruit, are also contraindicated.

It also goes without saying that patients’ refusal to take the medication or severe allergy to MAOIs are absolute contraindications to their administration.
