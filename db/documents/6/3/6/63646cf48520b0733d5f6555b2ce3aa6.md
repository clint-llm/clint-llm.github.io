The femoral quadriceps muscle has more superficial anaerobic fibers while going to the depth, and there will be more aerobic fibers. The first fibers are less vascularized than the oxidative fibers; the white fibers will be activated after the activation of the red fibers. During a contraction, there will be slower deoxygenation of the deeper fibers.

Men express a greater percentage of contractile strength and speed than women, probably because men have greater muscle mass for men and hormone levels. Testosterone facilitates the speed of the motor unit's electrical impulse, promotes a greater amount and speed of calcium release within the fibers (faster contraction), and stimulates a faster repair process and a larger hypertrophic response. In men, the percentage of white fibers is higher.
