ONSUS is safe and benign in the absence of an open globe. However, if an open globe injury is suspected, there is potential for further ocular injury, and the study should not proceed without consultation or assistance from an ophthalmologist.

Copetti et al. challenge that conventional views of the optic nerve sheath in several studies are more likely to be an artifact (potentially acoustic shadow cast from the lamina cribrosa) rather than the optic nerve itself. False positives, created by artifacts or excessive pressure on the globe itself, could result in unmerited treatment, invasive monitoring, or additional unindicated studies. Copetti suggests utilizing color doppler to identify the retinal artery and measuring the optic nerve from the lateral position.
