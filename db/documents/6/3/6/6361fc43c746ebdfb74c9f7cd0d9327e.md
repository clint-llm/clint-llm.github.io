The extrinsic muscles of the back have multiple surgical considerations. Latissimus dorsi has utility asÂ a flap for a multitude of reconstructive surgeries.

Injury to the accessory nerve for trapezius in greater than 80 percent of cases is unrepairable. Often that surgery is forgone. However, like the latissimus dorsi, the trapezius muscle plays a role in reconstructive surgery. The trapezius muscle is used in flap procedures for lateral craniofacial and lateral basilar skull defects.
