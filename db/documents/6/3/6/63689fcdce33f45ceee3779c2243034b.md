The median sternotomy approach to the aortic valve is associated with an increased risk of perioperative complications; thus an alternative surgical approach to the aortic valve, such as a mini-thoracotomy or a left lateral thoracotomy, may be safer sometimes. Other relative contraindications to median sternotomy include COPD, obesity, or prior radiation exposure to the anterior chest.
