An interprofessional healthcare team including clinicians, mid-level practitioners (NPs and PAs), nurses, and pharmacists is optimal for managing treatment with fenofibrate. Medical professionals should be aware of the signs and symptoms accompanying fenofibrate toxicity. The involvement of other specialized professionals, including a nephrologist or toxicologist, should be considered to ensure an optimal patient result. Clinicians must counsel patients regarding any symptoms associated with liver damage (weakness, weight change, abdominal pain, jaundice). Interprofessional care coordination with open communication among team members will result in the best possible outcomes with the fewest adverse events. [Level 5]

Pharmacists should actively monitor drug interactions before dispensing medication and notify the prescriber or nurse of potential issues. In addition, the medical care provider should advise the patient on the importance of reading labels pertaining to the medication to avoid drug misuse or overdose. An interactive team dynamic for fenofibrate therapy is essential in managing any adverse effects and providing successful patient care for an optimal therapeutic outcome.
