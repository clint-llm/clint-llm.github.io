Since excimer laser coronary angioplasty (ELCA) is still a relatively new procedure, there are no evidence-based guidelines currently to ensure optimal outcomes. A "5**S**approach" has been suggested to achieve the best results from ELCA, which are

- **S**election of patient

- **S**ize of the laser catheter

- **S**ettings (fluence and pulse rate)

- **S**aline infusion protocol

- **S**low advancement
