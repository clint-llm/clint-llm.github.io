Clonorchis sinensis is also known as the Chinese liver fluke and is a fish-borne trematode causing the disease clonorchiasis. Low-income areas of Asian countries such as China, South Korea, and northern Vietnam are especially affected. The World Health Organization (WHO) therefore listed C. sinensis among the most neglected tropical diseases globally. C. sinensis is a common parasite of fish-eating mammals, including cats, dogs, and humans. Humans become infected by eating raw or undercooked freshwater fish in the form of fillets, sashimi, or congee that contain C. sinensis metacercariae. When infected, C. sinensis lives within the biliary system of humans. These parasites can cause serious complications if not found and treated early. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of liver flukes and addresses the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition

**Objectives:**
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with Clonorchis sinensis infection.
- Review the evaluation of Clonorchis sinensis, identifying risk factors associated with the infection.
- Outline the treatment options for patients suspected of harboring C. sinensis.
- Explain the importance of the interprofessional team in identifying C. sinensis and providing the best possible care and education of the patient.
