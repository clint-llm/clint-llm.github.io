Fetal harm was observed in animal trials during the administration of lenvatinib at a dosage below the recommended range. Currently, no reproductive studies have been done to analyze the toxicity in humans. Pregnant women should be counseled and advised of possible toxicity to the fetus. Lenvatinib may also be present during lactation, and it is recommended to halt breastfeeding for possibly one week following the last dosage.
