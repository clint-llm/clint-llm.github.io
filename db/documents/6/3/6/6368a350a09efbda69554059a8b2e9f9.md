- Hypersensitivity to any component in albumin preparations or excipients is a contraindication.

- Contraindications include clinical situations that present with volume overloads, such as severe anemia, congestive heart failure, or renal insufficiency, at high risk of hemodynamic instability when treated with albumin solutions.

- Do not dilute any albumin solution with sterile water because it may cause hemolysis and acute kidney injury (AKI) in the recipient.
