Any case of blunt or penetrating trauma presenting to the routine outpatient should be evaluated meticulously to rule out lenticular trauma and the development of an abscess. All patients should be dilated for lenticular examination, and the clinician should be able to differentiate between traumatic cataracts and lens abscesses. These cases should be referred to the cornea clinic or the available cornea consultant for expert inputs and targeted management. A retina specialist should also evaluate all lens abscess cases to rule out posterior segment involvement and prevent the development of any complications.
