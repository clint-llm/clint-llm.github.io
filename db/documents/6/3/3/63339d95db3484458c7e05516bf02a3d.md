One of the most serious complications is respiratory distress occurring from bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. However, this is rare, as unilateral RLN injury is much more common. Aspiration with resulting aspiration pneumonia is a substantial complication to consider in susceptible patients. In addition, the resulting dysphagia or voice changes from unilateral injury can still pose substantial morbidity to patients and affect the overall quality of life. This is especially true for patients who have a career based on the use of their vocal cords, such as speakers or singers.
