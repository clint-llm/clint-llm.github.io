In the last phase of a Six Sigma project, the control phase, the project management team monitors how the Six Sigma solution affects the interprofessional teams and patient outcomes and care. The monitoring is tailored to the goals of the project and the root causes identified. The control phase may monitor care delivered by specific team members such as physicians, nurses, lab technicians, or any other healthcare team member. However, a Six Sigma project may involve several teams and various aspects of patient care. In these projects, the solutions and the processes to achieve those solutions are monitored more holistically to verify the project's success.

Significant components of any quality assurance project are reducing error rates to enhance patient safety and improving patient care. Six Sigma is a method used to set the standard of zero errors, and Six Sigma limits are 3.4 errors per million events. The five main steps of a DMAIC Six Sigma project used to improve an existing process or service are to define, measure, analyze, improve, and control. With the use of DMAIC, the root causes of errors and deficiencies in patient care can be determined; process improvement strategies can then be executed.
