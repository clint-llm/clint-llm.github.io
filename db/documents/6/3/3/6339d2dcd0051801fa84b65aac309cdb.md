The highest incidence of testicular cancer is observed in Western and Northern Europe (8.7 and 7.2 per 100,000 men, respectively).

In the United States, testicular cancer is most frequently diagnosed among men aged 20 to 34 (51% of all cases). 22.9 % of the cases are diagnosed in the age group of 35 to 44, 12.9% between 45 to 54, and the rest in other age groups. The mean age of diagnosis is 33 years. It is more commonly seen in White race men with an incidence rate of 7.1 per 100,000 persons, compared to 5.4 in Hispanic men and 1.7 in African American men.

The overall incidence in the United States increased gradually over the last 4 decades (6.3 per 100,000 persons in 2017 compared to 3.7 per 100,000 in 1975).  Testicular cancer incidence is higher in industrialized countries than in developing countries and, while higher incidences are seen in Caucasian men, the incidence of testicular cancer among non-white and immigrant men within the United States is increasing for unknown reasons.
