The most common mechanisms of injury vary depending on the patient population. In the pediatric and young adult population, most Barton fractures result from sporting activities and motor vehicle accidents. The most common reason for it to happen is a direct, traumatic wrist injury. Young male workers or motorcycle riders account for 70% of Barton's fracture cases. However, in the elderly, particularly women, decreased bone density from osteoporosis means that less force is needed to cause this injury.
