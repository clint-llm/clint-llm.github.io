Health information technology (HIT) is the hardware, software, and systems that comprise the input, transmission, use, extraction, and analysis of information in the healthcare sector. The end-users of this technology include not only patients, physicians, and other front-line healthcare providers, but also medical researchers, healthcare insurance companies, public health agencies, regulatory and quality assurance entities, pharmaceutical and medical device corporations, and various levels of government. Because these entities assume a huge range of roles and have such varied needs and goals, the technology and systems that underlie HIT are, at the societal scale, critical to the delivery and advancement of healthcare.
