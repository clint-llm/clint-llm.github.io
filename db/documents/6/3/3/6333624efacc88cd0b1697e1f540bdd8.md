An interprofessional approach to Prinzmetal angina is recommended.

Prinzmetal angina is not an easy diagnosis to make and may require tests including cardiac catheterization with provocation. An interprofessional team of healthcare workers best manages the disorder.

In general, the long-term prognosis for vasospastic angina is good if patients get adequate treatment. Overall, 75% of patients can be free of myocardial infarct at 5 years. The factor that might independently determine the free infarct survival includes the presence and severity of pre-existing coronary stenosis, the number of vessels with hyperreactivity or spams, and the use of calcium channel blockers. Half of the patients with angina will have persistent symptoms.

Half of the patients with vasospastic angina will have recurring symptoms, even during treatment, within the first 3 years after onset. The development of arrhythmias with the episodes of vasospastic angina has been associated with a poor prognosis, with the main association with ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death.
