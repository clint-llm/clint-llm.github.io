• Rolando fractures are intra-articular fractures of the base of the first metacarpal with the detachment of several fragments - typically three. • Rolando fractures account for 21% of fractures of the base of the first metacarpal.• The pathogenetic mechanism is the same as that of Bennet fractures, but the damaging force is of greater magnitude.• Diagnostic imaging uses specific radiological projections and thin layer CT.• In fractures with a few large fragments, the treatment is preferentially surgical.• Ligamentotaxis with percutaneous traction may be preferred in markedly comminuted fractures but may lead to a poor quality restoration of the articular surface, and may suffer exposure to infectious complications.• Multi-fragmentary forms are more at risk of articular stiffness and osteoarthrosis.

An interprofessional team of orthopedic surgeons, orthopedic nurses, and specialist orthopedic physical therapists will result in the best outcomes. [Level 5]
