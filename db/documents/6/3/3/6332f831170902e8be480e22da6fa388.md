The phrenic nerve is accompanied by the pericardiophrenic artery and superior phrenic vein throughout its course. The nerve, artery, and vein originate at the neck root and descend, parallel, along the lateral aspects of the pericardial sac, ultimately terminating at the superior aspect of the diaphragm. The pericardiophrenic artery is a branch of the internal thoracic artery. The superior phrenic vein drains into the azygos vein on the right and left.
