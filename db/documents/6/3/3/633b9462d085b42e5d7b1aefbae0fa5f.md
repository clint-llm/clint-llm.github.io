After branching off of the deep femoral artery, the medial circumflex artery courses along the posterior aspect of the femur and supplies blood to the thigh adductors (longus, magnus, and brevis), gracilis, pectineus as well as the primary blood supply to the hip joint.[7][9] The lateral circumflex courses laterally and supplies oxygenated blood to the major knee extensor group including vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius, and rectus femoris. Vastus medialis is supplied in part by both the superficial femoral artery and deep femoral artery. The perforating arteries of the deep femoral artery supply the four hamstring muscles (semitendinosus, semimembranosus, short and long head of biceps.
