Whenever a patient receives propranolol therapy, it is beneficial to routinely monitor their blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate. It is especially important in those with coronary artery disease, COPD, or any other condition that beta-blockade might negatively affect. Regular monitoring is possible at home with portable blood pressure and pulse monitors or routinely scheduled visits to primary care physicians. Physicians should also adjust doses as needed to achieve desired therapeutical outcomes.

Patients receiving propranolol therapy parenterally for conditions such as thyroid storm will need continuous cardiac monitoring in the inpatient setting, typically achieved with the patient connected to constant cardiac monitoring devices.
