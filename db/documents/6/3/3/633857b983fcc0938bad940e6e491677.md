**Clinical Goals**

- Increase the movement capacity of a confined joint

- Realignment of skeletal components to recover natural joint receptor function at the treated level

- Reduce the hypertonicity of muscles and/or spasms to restore equilibrium to the joint-related muscles

- Extension of the joint-related reduced connective tissue

**Research —**HVLA thrust techniques are commonly considered potentially riskier than other techniques because of their accelerated thrust and force operation.  As a result, the bulk of research focuses on the adverse HVLA effects.  The most important side effects associated with HVLA are those that combine high-velocity thrusts with rotational techniques or anesthesia. Self-rotation or involuntary turning of the head has also been associated with sudden and unintended injuries. In a study that looked at 283 reviews, only 118 produced adverse results. Strokes, headaches, and vertebral artery dissection were the most commonly described adverse effects. Of the 118 investigated, 46% indicated that HVLA is safe, 13% indicated that HVLA was harmful, and 42% were neutral or unknown to the effects of HVLA.

The American Osteopathic Healthcare Association focuses on the continual investigation of patient treatment, hospital visits, chronic pain, women's chlamydia infection, deep venous thrombosis, and elderly fall prevention, in addition to the many above conditions.
