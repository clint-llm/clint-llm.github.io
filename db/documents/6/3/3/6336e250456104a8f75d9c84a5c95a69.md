Porphyrias are generally considered to be genetic diseases. Most types are caused by a mutation in a gene that produces heme and depends on which enzyme is deficient. The various porphyrias are inherited from an individual's parents and may be inherited in an autosomal dominant (AD) manner, an autosomal recessive (AR) manner, or an X-linked manner. For example, acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), variegate porphyria (VP), and hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) are AD conditions and affect men and women equally.
