As discussed above, temporal bone fractures have been historically classified using the transverse vs. longitudinal scheme with limited success. Currently, most clinicians classify these fractures as otic capsule sparing or otic capsule disrupting.

- Type 1: A fracture line travels across the mastoid process.

- Type 2: A fracture line travels across the mastoid process and extends to the external auditory canal.

- Type 3: A fracture line extends across the mastoid cortex and the external auditory canal to the pyramidal or horizontal portion of the facial nerve.

- Type 4: A fracture travels across the tegmen of the middle ear and the antrum with the involvement of the geniculate ganglion. The facial nerve between the labyrinthine segment and the horizontal segment is involved. Type 4 is further subdivided into types 4A and 4B:

- Type 4A: No direct injury of the inner ear or internal auditory canal.

- Type 4B: The inner ear and/or the internal auditory canal are directly violated. The typical type 4B corresponds with the classic transverse fracture.
