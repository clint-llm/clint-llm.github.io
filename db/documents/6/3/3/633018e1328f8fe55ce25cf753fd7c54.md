The patient’s vital signs - blood pressure, pulse rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, height, and weight- are part of the routine physical examination. The more important concern is the presence of foot drop, which is a consequence of weakening or denervation of the muscles of the anterior crural compartment:  tibialis anterior (the most important one), extensor hallucis longus, and extensor digitorum longus.

The severity of weakness can be assessed by having the patient sit on the examining table with the foot off the edge. The examiner then holds the ankle with one hand and the foot with the other. The examiner then pushes the foot downwards into plantar flexion and notes the resistance the patient’s foot offers to this maneuver. The other foot is tested for comparison purposes.

One should also observe the patient’s gait, being careful to support her as she attempts to walk, so she doesn’t fall. If a foot drop is present, the patient will scuff the toes of the affected foot and will have to lift the foot off the floor higher than normal so as not to scuff the toes (steppage gait, as in a Tennessee walking horse).

Another indication of foot drop occurs when the patient places the heel on the ground when walking and the foot slaps the floor (slap foot). Patients with a foot drop have difficulty walking on the heels because this requires active dorsiflexion of the foot.

The patient should be examined for other motor losses. In true foot drop, these should be limited to the dorsiflexors (but see the description of tests because the tibialis posterior is not involved in a common fibular nerve lesion but will be involved in the lesion involves the L5 nerve root, as in a herniated lumbar disc, lesion of the lumbosacral plexus or lumbosacral trunk).

The course of the common fibular nerve should be examined. Tinel’s sign performed by tapping over the lateral part of the neck of the fibula to stimulate the common fibular nerve can elicit a sense of tingling that radiates from the site of the tapping.

If positive, the Lasegue straight-leg raising test indicates a proximal lesion such as a herniated lumbar disc.

The presence of a herniated lumbar disc can be confirmed by an MRI.

The Achilles tendon reflex should be normal (unless the lesion also involves the S1 nerve root).

One should then obtain a neurological consultation to determine the precise localization of the patient’s lesion.

It is important to reassure the patient that she did nothing wrong and that an obstetrical foot drop should respond well to treatment if she follows the treatment plan.
