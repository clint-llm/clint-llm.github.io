The cervical sympathetic chain has three adjacent ganglia: superior cervical ganglion, middle cervical ganglion, and inferior cervical ganglion. However, in most (80%) patients, the inferior cervical ganglion is combined with the first thoracic ganglion, forming the cervicothoracic ganglion, commonly referred to as the stellate ganglion.

**Superior Cervical Ganglion**: The superior cervical ganglion (SCG) has been demonstrated in cadaveric studies to be a fusiform/cylindrical structure that is the largest of the cervical ganglia and most often appears embedded within soft tissue anterior to the transverse processes of the C2-C3 vertebrae.

**Middle Cervical Ganglion**: The middle cervical ganglion (MCG) is the smallest of the cervical ganglia and is often absent.

**Stellate Ganglion**: The stellate ganglion is a fusiform or bilobed structure located anterior to the transverse process at the level of the C6 vertebra, superior to the subclavian artery & the posterior aspect of the pleura, and posterior to the vertebral vasculature.

Though all of the cervical ganglia supply postganglionic fibers to the head and neck region, the SCG is the primary contributor via the oculosympathetic pathway (OSP)

- First-order neurons descend from the posterolateral hypothalamus to the initial synapse in the intermediolateral (IML) gray substance of the spinal cord at the levels C8-T2 (known as the Ciliospinal Center of Budge-Waller)

- Second-order neurons exit the Ciliospinal Center of Budge-Waller via white rami communicantes (only present between levels T1-L2), followed by ascension through the stellate and middle cervical ganglia (without synapsing) and culminating with synapse in the superior cervical ganglion

- Third-order neurons exit the superior cervical ganglion as postganglionic fibers that travel with either the internal or external carotid artery to reach their final destination (the specific nerves that comprise these postganglionic fibers are covered below under "Nerves").

The anatomy of the sympathetic chain is demonstrated in **Figure 1**with its associated plexuses. This article covers the postganglionic fibers associated with each cervical ganglia in detail below under "Nerves." Ultimately, these sympathetic fibers serve key roles in the "fight or flight" mechanics of the autonomic nervous system in the head and neck through pupil dilation, inhibition of tear production, vasoconstriction of skin vasculature, and widening of the palpebral fissures.
