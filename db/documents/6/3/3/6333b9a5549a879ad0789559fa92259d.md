All imaging modalities should be analyzed for the specific pattern, shape, size, and location of the different fragments.**Plain radiographs**should include anterior-posterior, lateral, and intercondylar notch views. The anteroposterior views may show sclerotic bands suggestive of compression, joint malalignment, or depression of the articular surface. The lateral views can be useful in spotting posteromedial fracture lines. Other additional views can include oblique views and tibial plateau views (10 degrees caudal tilt), which can be helpful in determining the amount of articular surface depression. However, these views are becoming less important in the presence of CT scans. Also, tibial plateau fractures can be difficult to see on plain films, with a sensitivity of 85%.

**CT scan**assessesÂ articular surface depression and comminution. Also, it delineates fracture pattern, size of fracture fragment, shape, and location for surgical planning. A lipohemarthrosis is an indication of an occult fracture. CT scan can alter fracture classification and a treatment plan formulated based on the initial radiographs.

**MRI scan**would be indicated to evaluate meniscal and ligamentous pathologies.

The knee joint should be evaluated for fracture lines, displacement, depression of the tibial plateau, and associated ligamentous or meniscal injury.

None of the tibial plateau fracture classification systems are ideal.

- Schatzker I: Lateral plateau split fracture

- Schatzker II: Lateral plateau split-depressed fracture

- Schatzker III: Lateral plateau pure depression fracture

- Schatzker IV: Medial plateau fracture

- Schatzker V: Bicondylar plateau fracture

- Schatzker VI: Metaphyseal-diaphyseal dissociation

10% of all tibial plateau fractures can not be classified based on Schatzker classification. Especially fractures associated with dislocations or knee instability. Hohl and Moore suggested an alternative classification of tibial plateau fractures as per the following:

- Type I: Coronal split fracture

- Type II: Entire condylar fracture

- Type III: Rim avulsion fracture of the lateral tibial plateau

- Type IV: Rim compression fracture

- Type V: Four-part fracture

Either CT or MRI can better demonstrate the extent of plateau depression and comminution than plain radiographs, and may be helpful in surgical planning should this management be indicated. CT scans are typically faster and easier to obtain in an acute setting. However, MRI can identify meniscal and ligamentous injuries.
