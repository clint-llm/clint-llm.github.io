Interprofessional communication and teamwork are vital in preventing any untoward effects from desflurane. The earlier identification of the signs and symptoms of a complication occurs, the better is the prognosis and outcome. The anesthesiologist/nurse anesthetist must make the surgeon aware and all other staff in the operating room if any complication is suspected. OR nurses can assist with patient monitoring. One particular example is in the case of malignant hyperthermia; given the high-risk outcome of patients with suspected malignant hyperthermia, corrective action must take place immediately. Offending agents must be discontinued, and immediate enactment of treatment algorithms for malignant hyperthermia should supersede the continuation of the surgical procedure until the restoration of hemodynamic stability. Such an event will also require intervention from clinicians and nursing staff should it occur. This is why the interprofessional model is the best approach for all anesthesia agents, including desflurane. [Level 5]
