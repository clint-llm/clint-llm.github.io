The diagnosis of a herpetic infection can be made by performing a microscopic examination of the margin of the vesicles in a Tzanck test. After unroofing and swabbing vesicles to obtain a sample, it is stained (commonly with Giemsa) and shows characteristic multinucleated â€œballoon" giant cells. The nuclei of herpes simplex virus (HSV)-infected cells appear blue and homogenous. Negative staining of vesicle fluid may show herpes virus by electron microscopy. Monoclonal antibodies or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirm the diagnosis by immunofluorescence and also differentiate type 1 from type 2 herpes simplex virus.
