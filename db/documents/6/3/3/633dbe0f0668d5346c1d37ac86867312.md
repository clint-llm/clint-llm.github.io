Medical knowledge and treatment advances have led to increased survival of extremely premature neonates. Prematurity increases the incidence of having a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus requiring pharmacologic, surgical, or device closure. These premature patients will often have to undergo a surgical procedure requiring anesthesia. It is essential for the anesthesia provider to have an understanding of the cardiac defect and the effects that ventilation, oxygenation, and anesthetics will have on pulmonary and systemic blood flow.

**Objectives:**
- Review the anatomy and function of the ductus arteriosus.
- Explain the effects of FiO2, PaCO2, and anesthetic agents on systemic and pulmonary blood flow with a patent ductus arteriosus.
- Outline clinical challenges when providing anesthesia to a preterm infant.
- Summarize some of the treatment options for a patent ductus arteriosus.
