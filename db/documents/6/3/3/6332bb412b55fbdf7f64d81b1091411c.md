History and physical exams of patients with greenstick fractures are no different from patients with other types of fractures. Age, gender, anatomic location, soft tissue involvement (assessment of open versus closed), and mechanism of injury are all important features of the history. Location, soft tissue involvement, and neurovascular status are important aspects of a physical exam. Furthermore, the joints below and above the site should be evaluated for occult fractures or multiple fractures.

Findings on the history commonly include accidental trauma like FOOSH but can include history like being hit with a baseball bat or other item and other forms of accidental trauma.

Common physical findings include decreased range of motion, pain to palpation, and ecchymosis over the injured area.
