Since the discovery of grotesque teratoma lesions which resembled deformed fetus, several theories emerged based on concepts from religious to scientific assumptions. Some of the interesting ideas involved the likely cause of witchcraft, perverted gestation, immoral acts, and ingestion of hair and bones embedded in the ovaries. It was later believed that these tumors originated from degenerated ova, in situ impregnation of ovum within the ovary (fetus in the fetus). Evidence of dermoid cyst in virgins, post-menopausal women, males, and extra ovarian sites (stomach, mediastinum) convinced the biologists that structures like bone, teeth could develop within a tumor instead of its origin as a result of aberrant fertilization.

Analysis of biochemical and cytogenetic data showed that cystic teratomas of the ovary are parthenogenetic tumors formed by spontaneous asexual development of an unfertilized ovum after the first meiotic division. Another explanation is the alteration of blastodermal elements in a fertilized ovum. Despite all these theories, the pathophysiology of teratoma formation isÂ still obscure and the focus of many experimental studies.
