Inhalation anesthetics (nitrous oxide, halothane, isoflurane, desflurane, sevoflurane, most commonly used agents in practice today) are used for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia in the operating room. The volatile anesthetics (halothane, isoflurane, desflurane, and sevoflurane) are liquids at room temperature and require the use of vaporizers for inhalational administration. Nitrous Oxide is already under normal conditions of temperature and pressure. All inhalational anesthetics provide amnesia and immobility, except for nitrous oxide, which also provides analgesia. Inhaled anesthetics are commonly used in combination with IV anesthetic agents. These agents have FDA approval for use as a general anesthetic and sedation agent in the operating room. Inhaled anesthetic agents have also had use in the intensive care unit, but this is not an FDA-approved indication. The primary applications of inhaled anesthetic agents in the ICU are sedation, refractory bronchospasm, and control of status epilepticus unresponsive to anticonvulsant medications.
