The diagnosis of gyromitra syndrome relies on associating the patient’s liver, renal, or CNS findings with a history of ingestion of the gyromitra mushrooms. Common lab findings in patients with gyromitrin toxicity include elevated transaminases, lactate dehydrogenase, and total bilirubin within 1 to 2 days of ingestion.  Liver transaminases (particularly AST) usually peak around 4 to 5 days post-ingestion. Elevated BUN and creatinine may also occur, reflecting acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to vomiting and volume depletion. While CNS signs may vary from confusion to seizures, there are no findings on imaging modalities such as CT or MRI. However, should the patient experience status epilepticus, neuro-imaging would be warranted after the seizure is controlled.
