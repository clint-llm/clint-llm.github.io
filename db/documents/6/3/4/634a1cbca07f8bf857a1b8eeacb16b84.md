The universal feature of patients with chorea is that they exhibit uncontrolled motor impersistence such that they are not able to maintain a steady posture, position, or movement. For example, when asked to grip an object, they will alternately continue to release and squeeze. Another feature is the constant dropping of objects.

Chorea can involve both the distal and proximal muscles. While most patients do have normal muscle tone, a few may have hypotonia

Most commonly, excessive unintentional movements of parts of the body lead to medical consultation. These choreiform movements are clearly visible on observation. Other common findings are motor impersistence of the tongue, where the patient displays an inability to keep the tongue protruded when asked to stick their tongue out. The tongue will dart into and out of the mouth. MRI will display caudate atrophy, exemplified by the widening of the lateral ventricles. Later findings of the disease include cognitive and behavioral symptoms.
