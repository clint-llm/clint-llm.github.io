FDA-approved Indication: Mesalamine is useful in the induction or maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis. It is usually used in mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis.

Off-label indication: Clinicians may use mesalamine in Crohn disease after surgical resection of the affected bowel.

The first-line treatment for mild to moderate ulcerative colitis is topical mesalamine.

Mesalamine is also used in maintenance therapy for patients with more than one episode or flare-up per year, patients with ulcerative proctosigmoiditis, or ulcerative colitis extending into the sigmoid colon. The use of topical mesalamine significantly decreases the risk of relapse.
