The link between these clinical syndromes (GPA, EGPA, and MPA) and antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) was established in 1988 when the sera of patients having crescentic glomerulonephritis were found to bind to neutrophils in two recognizable patterns; **perinuclear**or diffusely throughout the**cytoplasm**. Further examination revealed that those patterns were found to reflect two types of antibodies; P-ANCA antibody is against neutrophil myeloperoxidase (MPO) and C-ANCA against neutrophil proteinase 3 (PR3).
