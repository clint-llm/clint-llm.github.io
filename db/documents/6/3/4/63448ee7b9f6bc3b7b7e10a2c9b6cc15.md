Due to the variable symptoms, it is important to rule out other conditions which cause tear flow obstruction and tear film instability, such as lid laxity or malposition disorders (e.g., ectropion, entropion, and floppy eyelid syndrome), trichiasis, punctal stenosis, conjunctivitis (viral/allergic) and nasolacrimal obstruction. A thorough history and physical examination will help differentiate CCh from other diseases that may generate similar symptoms.

InÂ  CCh, the symptoms worsen in downgaze and frequent blinking (because the folds increase or spread). In contrast, patients with dry eyes have worsening symptoms when looking up (e.g., at a computer), as the interpalpebral exposure zone widens and also improves with increased blinking. Superior CCh is often misdiagnosed as superior limbic keratitis (SLK). Clinical features such as micropapillary reaction in the upper tarsal conjunctiva, keratitis, and corneal erosions point towards the diagnosis of SLK, in addition to the presence of increased inflammation (e.g., hyperemia, eyelid edema).
