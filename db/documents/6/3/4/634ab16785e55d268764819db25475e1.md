Researchers estimate that congenital syphilis is a complicating factor in about 1 million pregnancies every year worldwide.

Significant racial disparity is seen in the incidence of CS, and in 2014 the CDC reported that CS was 10 times more prevalent in mothers who were black compared to mothers who were white (38.2 versus 3.7 cases per 100,000 births). They also report a 3-times higher prevalence in black mothers compared to Hispanic mothers (38.2 versus 12.2 cases per 100,000 births).
