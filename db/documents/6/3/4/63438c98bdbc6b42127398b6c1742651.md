Chronic fatigue syndrome has no cure, and the symptoms can persist for years. Its clinical course fluctuates between remissions and relapses. According to one prospective study, around 50% of patients with CFS may return to part-time or full-time work.

Favorable outcomes are associated with less severity of fatigue at baseline, a better sense of control over symptoms, and the absence of any attribution of the disease to a physical cause.
