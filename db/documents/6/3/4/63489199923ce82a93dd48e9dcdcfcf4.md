The area that mediates language in the brain is in the dominant hemisphere. In most people, this is the left hemisphere of the brain. Broca areas reside in the inferior frontal lobe in Brodmann areas 44 and 45. Wernicke area is in the region of the superior temporal gyrus in Brodmann area 22. The arcuate fasciculus connects these two regions. The classical explanation for conduction aphasia is that damage to the arcuate fasciculus impairs the transmission of information between the Wernicke area and the Broca area. This injury leads to impaired repetition. Thus, the patient can comprehend the speech but cannot transmit the information to the speech production centers in the Broca area to allow repetition to occur. Recent research based on the anatomically distributed modular networks model shows that patients with conduction aphasia clinically often have lesions in the supramarginal gyrus or deep parietal matter, which suggests that damage to anatomically related structures may also lead to a disconnection between Broca and Wernicke areas.
