While arthrocentesis is well tolerated with minimal complications, obtaining informed consent is a must before performing the procedure. Details of the procedure, risks and benefits, potential complications, and alternatives to therapy/diagnosis should be explained. Patients should understand and be able to verbalize the indications for their own procedure as well as be familiar with the previously discussed complications. Patients must have an opportunity to ask questions, and have those questions answered by the performing physician. Keeping patient safety in mind, previously discussed sterile procedural technique should be used every time to minimize potential risks of infection. The patient's chart should undergo a thorough review prior to undergoing arthrocentesis to ensure the patient has no significant allergies to any medication, material, or chemical that may be in use during the procedure.
