The prognosis of type III hypersensitivity reaction depends on the disease and the underlying comorbidities. Serum sickness has an excellent prognosis. The symptoms usually resolve 1 to 2 weeks after the withdrawal of the offending agent. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis can have long-term morbidity with progressive symptoms. Poor prognostic indicators include prolonged or a higher intensity of exposure, older age, digital clubbing, and fibrotic changes in the lung.
