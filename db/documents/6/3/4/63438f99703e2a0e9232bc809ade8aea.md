Like many procedures, required equipment starts with adequate space to support necessary material and personnel. Large items include a procedure table/bed that will comfortably support the patient while minimizing positioning injury, fluoroscopic imaging equipment, and a table to place surgical instruments sterilely. Monitors to assess the patient’s oxygenation, ventilation, circulation, and temperature should be used, especially if sedation is considered. Further, if deep sedation or general anesthesia is required, a certified anesthesia provider must be present. For the procedure itself, introducer needles, catheters with electrodes, and an equipment interface are used. Emergency equipment such as supplemental oxygen, suction, and code cart should be nearby and accessible.
