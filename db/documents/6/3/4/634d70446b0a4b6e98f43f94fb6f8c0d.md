As previously stated, the normal human cell contains 46 chromosomes, except for enucleate cells (i.e., red blood cells), cell fragments (platelets), and haploid germline cells (eggs and sperm), which contain only 23 chromosomes.

Generally, an aneuploid chromosome set varies from the wild type by a small number of chromosomes (typically one). For example, trisomy (three copies of a specific homologous chromosome or 2N + 1) is the most frequent constitutional chromosomal abnormality in humans.

Regarding structural chromosomal abnormalities, there is one major mechanism of significant clinical importance called Robertsonian translocation. In this case, two acrocentric chromosomes break at the centromere, losing both of their short p arms and creating a new single chromosome containing one centromere and the q arms of both original chromosomes. Some individuals may have this kind of cytogenic aberration and appear phenotypically normal because only small amounts of genetic material are present in the short arms of acrocentric chromosomes. Thus, the two remaining long arms can compensate for this loss. However, in some cases, it can lead to genetic imbalances and the formation of zygotes with polyploidies (trisomies or monosomies) with significant phenotypical consequences (i.e., Down syndrome). The estimated carrier frequency for Robertsonian translocations in the general population is 1Â in 1000.
