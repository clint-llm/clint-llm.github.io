Most dementias are confirmed by finding abnormal proteins in brain sectioning. Alzheimer is defined by amyloid and Tau inclusions in the brain tissue, Parkinson and Lewy body dementia are supported by Lewy bodies and frontal dementias by Tau inclusions. Parkinson-like illness is also associated with synuclein inclusions. Prion diseases have abnormally folded proteins called prions in the brain tissue.
