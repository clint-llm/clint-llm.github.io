The pulmonary circulation has many essential functions. Its primary function involves the exchange of gases across the alveolar membrane which ultimately supplies oxygenated blood to the rest of the body and eliminates carbon dioxide from the circulation. The bronchial circulation provides oxygenated blood to the lung parenchyma. There is an overlap between the bronchial and pulmonary circulations in terms of oxygenating the lungs, especially near central regions. The peripheral aspects of the lungs becoming increasingly dependent on the pulmonary circulation and is more prone to infarction as a result. The low-pressure venous system and an intricate system of lymphatics ensure that there is no build-up of edema fluid in healthy lungs.
