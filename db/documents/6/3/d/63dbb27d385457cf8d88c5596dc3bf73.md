- Tensor tympani syndrome (tensor tympani myoclonus) is a type of middle ear myoclonus such as stapedius myoclonus.

- Tensor tympani syndrome is categorized as objective pulsatile tinnitus like stapedius myoclonus.

- Tensor tympani and stapedius myoclonus are most definitively diagnosed with direct visualization of muscle spasms.

- Sawtooth patterns on long-term tympanometry can indicate tensor tympani myoclonus.

- Medical therapy mostly involves inhibiting spasms of muscle, and tenotomy can be used after medical failure with current data indicating some promise.
