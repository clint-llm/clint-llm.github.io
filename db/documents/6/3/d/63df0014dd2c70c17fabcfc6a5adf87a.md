Each nephron in a normal kidney contributes to the total glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The decline of kidney function is gradual and may initially present asymptomatically. The natural history of renal failure depends on the etiology of the disease but ultimately involves early homeostatic mechanisms involving hyperfiltration of the nephrons. The kidney maintains GFR, despite the progressive destruction of nephrons because the remaining normal nephrons develop hyperfiltration and compensatory hypertrophy. As a result, the patient with mild renal impairment can show normal creatinine values, and the disease can go undetected for some time.

This nephron adaptability allows for continued normal clearance of plasma solutes. This adaptive mechanism will run its course and eventually cause damage to the glomeruli of the remaining nephrons. At this point, antihypertensives such as ACEs or ARBs may be beneficial in slowing the progress of the disease and preserving renal function. Plasma levels of substances such as urea and creatinine start to show measurable increases only after total GFR has decreased by 50%. For example, a rise in plasma creatinine from 0.6 mg/dL to 1.2 mg/dL in a patient, although within the normal range, actually represents a loss of 50% of functioning nephron mass.

Although hyperfiltration and hypertrophy of residual nephrons are beneficial for maintaining GFR, it is found to be a major cause of progressive renal dysfunction.

Factors that may worsen renal injury include:

- Nephrotoxins (NSAIDs)

- Systemic hypertension

- Proteinuria

- Dehydration

- Smoking

- Hyperlipidemia

- Uncontrolled diabetes

- Hyperphosphatemia

**Hyperkalemia**

Potassium excretion at near-normal levels is generally maintained in CKD as long as aldosterone secretion and distal flow are maintained. Hyperkalemia develops when GFR falls to less than 20-25 mL/min/1.73 m²; at this point, the kidneys have decreased ability to excrete potassium.

**Metabolic Acidosis**

Metabolic acidosis in stage 5 CKD is high anion gap metabolic acidosis but with the anion gap generally not higher than 20 mEq/L. In CKD, the kidneys cannot produce enough ammonia in the proximal tubules to excrete endogenous acid into the urine in the form of ammonium. In stage 5 CKD, the accumulation of phosphates, sulfates, and other organic anions is the cause of the increase in the anion gap.

Metabolic acidosis has deleterious effects on protein balance, leading to the following:

- Negative nitrogen balance

- Increased protein degradation

- The increased essential amino acid oxidation

- Reduced albumin synthesis

- Lack of adaptation to a low-protein diet

Metabolic acidosis also plays a role in the development of renal osteodystrophy because bones are buffers for excess acid, with a resultant loss of minerals. Acidosis also interferes with vitamin D metabolism.

**Salt and Water Handling Abnormalities**

Salt and water handling by the kidney are affected in CKD. Volume overload results from the failure of sodium and free-water excretion and occur when the GFR falls to less than 10-15 mL/min/1.73 m². This leads to peripheral edema, pulmonary edema, and hypertension. Tubulointerstitial renal diseases often cause fluid loss rather than overload. Thus, despite severe reductions in GFR, tubulointerstitial renal diseases may manifest as polyuria and volume depletion, with the inability to concentrate the urine.

**Anemia**

Normochromic normocytic anemia develops from the decreased renal synthesis of erythropoietin, the hormone responsible for bone marrow stimulation for red blood cell (RBC) production.

- Chronic blood loss: Uremia-induced platelet dysfunction enhances the bleeding tendency

- Secondary hyperparathyroidism

- Inflammation

- Nutritional deficiency

**Bone Disease**

Renal bone disease is a common complication of CKD. Different types of bone disease occur with CKD, as follows:

- High-turnover bone disease from high parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels

- Low-turnover bone disease (adynamic bone disease)

- Defective mineralization (osteomalacia)

- Mixed disease

- Beta-2-microglobulin–associated bone disease

Secondary hyperparathyroidism develops in CKD because of the following factors:

- Hyperphosphatemia

- Hypocalcemia

- Decreased renal synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, or calcitriol)

- Intrinsic alteration in the parathyroid glands gives rise to increased PTH secretion and increased parathyroid growth

- Skeletal resistance to PTH

Hyperphosphatemia develops from the inability of the kidneys to excrete excess phosphate. Hyperphosphatemia suppresses the renal hydroxylation of inactive 25-hydroxyvitamin D to calcitriol. Increased phosphate concentration also affects PTH concentration by directly affecting the parathyroid glands (posttranscriptional effect). Hypocalcemia results from decreased intestinal calcium absorption because of low plasma calcitriol levels.

Hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and low serum calcitriol levels stimulate PTH synthesis and secretion. With persistent stimulus in advanced CKD, parathyroid glands become hypertrophic and then hyperplastic.
