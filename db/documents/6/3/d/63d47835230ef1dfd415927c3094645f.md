Various hormonal systems regulate calcium absorption and metabolism.

The primary mechanisms responsible for malignancy-related hypercalcemia include the overproduction of PTHrP by the tumor, osteolytic metastatic disease, and the ectopic activity of 1-alpha hydroxylase leading to overproduction of 1,25-dihydroxy cholecalciferol; ectopic PTH production by parathyroid and extra parathyroid malignancies; and excess serum calcium secondary to paraprotein binding.

Mutations/Loss of function of the CYP2481 enzyme [24-hydroxylase], responsible for inactivating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D, can result in inappropriately elevated levels of 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D, leading to  Renal failure, hypercalcemia, and hypercalciuria while suppressing PTH.

The response of the parathyroid cells, thyroid c-cells, and renal tubular epithelial cells to changes in the extracellular fluid calcium levels is regulated by a G-protein coupled receptor called the calcium-sensing receptor (Ca-SR). This receptor also closely regulates calcitonin secretion and renal tubular calcium absorption. Abnormalities of the Ca-SR gene result in three rare disorders: familial benign hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, severe neonatal hyperparathyroidism, and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia with hypercalciuria.
