The HPA axis, a primary neuroendocrine system, helps maintain homeostatic function and the stress response.

Under basal conditions, only about 5% to 10% of circulating cortisol is free.

Unbound cortisol is filtered at the glomerulus and excreted. This fraction constitutes less than 1% of the total cortisol synthesized daily; the rest is excreted as soluble metabolites and glucuronide conjugates.

Serum cortisol, also called the stress hormone, exerts negative feedback on both the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary, inhibiting the secretion of CRH and ACTH, respectively. This positive/negative feedback mechanism helps regulate serum cortisol levels and the stress response.
