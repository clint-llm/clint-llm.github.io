Bismuth subsalicylate (BSS) exhibits many of its properties due to its formulation as an insoluble salt of salicylic acid and trivalent bismuth. The mechanism of action through which BSS works is complex. In the stomach, BSS hydrolyzes into two compounds, bismuth and salicylic acid.H. pylori.

It appears as though BSS does not alter the normal flora of the stomach; however, its antimicrobial and antisecretory properties play a significant role in combating diarrhea. The antidiarrheal effect of BSS is most likely due to:

- The reduction in prostaglandin formation, as BSS inhibits cyclooxygenase. Prostaglandin induces inflammation and hypermotility.

- The stimulation of reabsorption of fluids, sodium, and chlorideÂ - this action helps decrease fluid loss.

- The inhibition of intestinal secretions.

While, in peptic ulcer disease, the likely mechanism of BSS involves its cytoprotective and demulcent activity. In H. pylori specifically, BSS blocks the adhesion of the bacteria to the gastric epithelial cells. Additionally, BSS inhibits H. pylori's enzyme activities, including phospholipase, protease, and urease.
