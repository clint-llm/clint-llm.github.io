Like in any procedure, the insertion of pacemaker insertion should be chosen wisely for a particular patient. There are situations in which pacemaker insertion is not beneficial or is not enough data to support its use. These are sometimes also called class III indications in ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines or European Society of Cardiology guidelines.

- Sinus bradycardia without significant symptoms; asymptomatic first-degree AV block.

- AV block that is expected to resolve and unlikely to recur example drug toxicity, Lyme disease, or transient increase in vagal tone

- A pacemaker is not indicated for sinus node dysfunction in patients with symptoms suggestive of bradycardia that have been documented to occur even in the absence of bradycardia.

- Asymptomatic second-degree Mobitz, type-I block

- Asymptomatic prolonged RR interval with atrial fibrillation or other causes of transient ventricular pauses

- Hypersensitive cardioinhibitory response to carotid sinus stimulationÂ in the absence of symptoms or in the presence of vague symptoms such as dizziness, lightheadedness

- Asymptomatic bradycardia during the sleep

- CRT is not indicated in patients whose functional status and life expectancy are limited predominantly by non-cardiac conditions

- Right bundle branch block with left axis deviation without syncope or other symptoms compatible with intermittent AV block

- Long QT syndrome or Torsade de pointes due to reversible causes

- In the presence of an accessory pathway that has the capacity for rapid anterograde conduction

- Patients with NYHA class I or II symptoms and non-LBBB pattern with QRS duration less than 150 ms
