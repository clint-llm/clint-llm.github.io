Arcus senilis in of themselves do not warrant treatment, as they are clinically insignificant and asymptomatic; however, if after further assessment an underlying disorder is found to be the cause of the arcus the disorder should be treated, i.e. if a patient is found to have underlying hypercholesteremia this condition should be addressed through environmental, and pharmacologic treatment options.
