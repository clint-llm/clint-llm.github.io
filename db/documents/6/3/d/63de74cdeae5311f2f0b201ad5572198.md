Possible complications of infantile acne generally encompass residual changes to the skin that vary from reversible to permanent. Skin changes that usually resolve with both appropriate treatment and the tincture of time include residual erythema and, in patients with darker skin tones, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). It is essential to remind caregivers that even though the original acne has cleared, such complications can still take months to resolve.

With more severe forms of inflammatory infantile acne, the risk of permanent scarring and potential for resultant psychosocial issues is higher. This risk can be mitigated with timely and accurate diagnosis and initiation of the appropriate level of treatment. However, although not common, despite early diagnosis and timely, maximal-level treatment some infants may continue to have a protracted and recalcitrantÂ course. These particular patients may even experience active lesions for several years beyond infancy, possibly into the onset of puberty and progressing into a more form severe adolescent acne.
