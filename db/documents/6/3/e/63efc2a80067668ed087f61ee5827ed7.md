Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis is cancer involving the pia mater and arachnoid mater. Studies have shown that both solid tumors, including brain tumors and hematological cancers, can metastasize to involve the leptomeninges. Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis heralds a poor prognosis with limited treatment options. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis and stresses the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.
- Describe the presentation of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.
- Summarize the treatment options for leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve patient outcomes affected by leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.
