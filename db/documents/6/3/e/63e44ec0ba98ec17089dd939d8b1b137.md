Abacavir is an approved nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor used to treat human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection combined with other antiretrovirals. Adherence to antiretroviral therapy is one of the principal determinants of favorable HIV treatment outcomes and is necessary to decrease the occurrence of drug resistance. This activity reviews indications, dosing, contraindications, and adverse effects of abacavir and emphasizes the importance of an interprofessional team approach to caring for patients with HIV.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the contraindications to the use of abacavir. 
- Describe the screening that patients should undergo before beginning therapy with abacavir.
