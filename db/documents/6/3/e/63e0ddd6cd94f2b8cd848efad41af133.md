**Changes After Menopause**

In general, the same principles apply when imaging the postmenopausal pelvis in terms of anatomy.

**Uterus**

Excluding pathologies such as fibroids or adenomyosis, the postmenopausal uterus tends to be smaller in overall size (as measured by uterine length, uterine height, and uterine width) compared to the reproductive age uterus. The uterus can continue to decrease in size throughout menopause.

**Ovaries**

Postmenopausal ovaries will also appear smaller and more homogenous, with occasional small hypoechoic follicles on ultrasound compared to those found in reproductive-age women. Because of this, it can be common not to visualize the ovaries on ultrasound in a postmenopausal woman, and this should not lead to concern. Similarly to the uterus, the ovaries can continue to decrease in volume through menopause.
