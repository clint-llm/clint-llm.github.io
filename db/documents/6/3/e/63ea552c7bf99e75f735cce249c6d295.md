Nerve injury may occur in one to two percent of cases of a total hip arthroplasty (THA). Injury to the superior gluteal nerve may result in weakness with hip abduction and a Trendelenburg gait. Surgical exploration is indicated if the damage is due to compression of a large hematoma or direct laceration of the nerve.

Another potential complication clinicians must consider following a THA is heterotopic ossification (HO) of the gluteus minimus. Heterotopic ossification characteristically demonstrates ectopic bone forming in extraskeletal tissues. Patients typically present with stiffness and pain of the hip approximately a few months following the surgery. Surgical resection is the recommended treatment if there is a severe loss of range of motion.
