Aortic stenosis is a common valvular disorder, especially in the elderly population, causing left ventricular outflow obstruction. Etiologies include congenital (bicuspid/unicuspid), calcific, and rheumatic disease. Symptoms such as exertional dyspnea or fatigue gradually develop after a long asymptomatic latent period of about 10 to 20 years. Patients go on to develop chest pain, heart failure, and syncope. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of aortic stenosis and highlights the interprofessional team's role in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of aortic stenosis. 
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of aortic stenosis. 
- Review the indications for different types of management options available for aortic stenosis.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving communication and care coordination to advance the aortic stenosis condition.
