The terminal branches of the profunda brachii artery have been a topic of great debate.  Many sources make no mention of the posterior radial collateral artery or anterior radial collateral artery and list only the radial collateral artery and middle collateral artery as the terminal branches.  These sources state that the radial collateral artery anastomoses with the radial recurrent artery and the middle collateral artery anastomoses with the recurrent interosseous artery.
