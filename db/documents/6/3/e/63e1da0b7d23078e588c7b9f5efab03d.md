Preparing Fresnel prisms is done by placing the Fresnel prism lens in the desired direction on the carrier lens. The Fresnel prism is cut nearest to the size of the carrier lens. Final cuttings are done to match the Fresnel lens to the carrier lens in size and shape.

It is essential to check the optical center of the Fresnel lens with that of the carrier lens. The smooth surface of the Fresnel prism is placed facing the inside surface of the spectacles. These are available from powers ranging from 0.5 prism dioptres to 30 prism dioptres.

The flexible prism sheet is thinner than 1mm in thickness. The prism is cut in the spectacle glass's shape and stuck to it.

The prism is stuck to the spectacle lens with the help of water. If any air bubble gets entrapped, the air bubble enters, and the prism separates from the spectacle lens. Another entity is the hemianopic Fresnel prism which is used to treat patients with hemianopic visual field defects by putting a 30-diopter Fresnel plastic prism which is pasted on the glasses.
