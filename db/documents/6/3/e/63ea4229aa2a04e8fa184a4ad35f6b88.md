Although the earliest studies of Cushing syndrome reported a median survival of 4.6 years and five-year survival of only 50%, with recent advances in treatment, the standard mortality ratio is similar to the age-matched population.Â  The morbidity and mortality of Cushing syndrome are primarily due to the effects of related conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, obesity, and osteoporosis with fractures. The prognosis is worsened in the setting of an unresectable hormone-secreting tumor.
