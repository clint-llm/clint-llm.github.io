About 80% of the patients will develop either infusion-related or renal toxicity. Amphotericin B also interacts with cholesterol in human cell membranes, which is responsible for its toxicity. The most common side effects of amphotericin B include:

- Loss of potassium

- Loss of magnesium

- Anaphylaxis

- Fevers

- Nephrotoxicity: Renal toxicity correlates with conventional amphotericin B use and can lead to renal failure and requirement for dialysis. But the azotemia often stabilizes with therapy and renal damage is reversible after discontinuation of amphotericin B. Avoiding concomitant use of other nephrotoxic agents, and appropriate hydration with normal saline may significantly decrease the likelihood and severity of azotemia associated with amphotericin B.

- Other potential uncommon side effect includes demyelinating encephalopathy in patients with bone marrow transplant with total body irradiation or who are receiving cyclosporine.

- The long-term administration is associated with normochromic, normocytic anemia due to low erythropoietin concentrations.
