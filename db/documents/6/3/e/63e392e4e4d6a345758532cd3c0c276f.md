**Normal Body Core Temperatures******

- The normal core body temperature range can vary from individual to individual, and can also be influenced by age, activity, and time of day: 36.1 C (97 F) to 37.2 C (99 F).

- During strenuous exercise, the temperature can rise temporarily to as high as 40 C (104 F).

- When the body becomes exposed to extreme cold, the temperature can fall below 35.6 C (98 F).

- An unclothed person can be exposed to temperatures as low as 12.8 C (55 F) or as high as 54.4 C (130 F) in dry air and still maintain almost constant core temperature.

**Skin Temperature**

In contrast to the core temperature, the skin temperature (shell), falls and rises with the temperature of the surroundings.
