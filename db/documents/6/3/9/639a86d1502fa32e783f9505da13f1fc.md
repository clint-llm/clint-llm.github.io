The recommended dietary allowance of vitamin B12 for adults is 2.5 mcg per day. A higher dose of 2.6 mcg is required for pregnant women. Patients on strict vegetarian or vegan diets should be advised to take vitamin B12 supplements to prevent deficiency. This is especially important in pregnant and lactating women to prevent a deficiency in the neonate. Due to the high incidence of B12 deficiency in the elderly, patients older than 50 years should be advised to consume a diet fortified with vitamin B12. Indefinite routine supplementation is required for patients who have undergone bariatric surgery.

Screening for vitamin B12 deficiency should be considered in patients receiving chronic treatment with proton pump inhibitors, H2 antagonists, and metformin. Patients with atrophic gastritis, gastrectomy, and pancreatectomy may also benefit from routine screening. In addition, preoperative screening for cobalamin deficiency should be considered for patients requiring anesthesia with nitrous oxide.
