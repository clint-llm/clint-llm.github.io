Radial tunnel syndrome is best addressed through the efforts of an interprofessional team exercising open communication and coordinated activity. Proper communication between the peripheral nerve surgeon (neurosurgeon/orthopedic surgeon/plastic surgeon), physician (neurologist or general physician), radiologist, a neurophysiologist, and neuro/orthopedic nurse is mandatory for the diagnosis and management of this disease, as the differential diagnoses can be tricky at times. It is also essential to consider surgery, as many cases do not respond if the diagnosis is incorrect. Advanced imaging may be helpful in unclear cases, requiring radiologist input. Physical therapy can be an adjunct in both surgical and non-surgical cases. This interprofessional approach should improve patient outcomes. [Level 5]
