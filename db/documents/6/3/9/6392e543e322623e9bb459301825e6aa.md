Inadequate dosing of oximes can lead to the development of intermediate syndrome in patients poisoned with organophosphates. Intermediate syndrome occurs 24 to 96 hours after exposure and is characterized by hyporeflexia, respiratory depression, proximal muscle weakness, and cranial nerve abnormalities. Patients may also experience problems up to one to three weeks after exposure. Organophosphorous agent-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN) affects mainly distal muscle groups and is characterized by a painful stocking-glove paraesthesia and lower extremity weakness. OPIDN is independent of the initialÂ cholinergic toxicity. Neurology consultation and follow up is recommended if clinicians are suspecting OPIDN
