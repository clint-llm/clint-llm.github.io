Because neurothekeomas are benign entities that are curative with surgical excision, the best patient outcomes can be achieved with an interprofessional care team of radiologists, surgeons, pathologists, primary care providers, and nurses who are cognizant of the specific clinical presentation and characteristic patient demographics. This will aid in early recognition and proper management of this lesion. Furthermore, neurothekeomas can masquerade as other more aggressive malignancies. Thus, recognizing the morphologic and biologic spectrum of neurothekeoma and its variants helps the health care professional team render the most accurate diagnosis ultimately, and most importantly, for the patient's peace of mind.
