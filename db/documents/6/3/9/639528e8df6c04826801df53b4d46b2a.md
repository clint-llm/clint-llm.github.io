Complications as a direct result of arthrocentesis are rare, and those that doÂ occur are typically not severe. Potential complications include: seeding a cutaneous infection within the joint, cartilage damage from needle insertion (rare), pain at arthrocentesis site or local ecchymosis, bleeding and iatrogenic hemarthrosis, skin reaction to antiseptics or soft bandage adhesive. The most common complication reported is reaccumulation of the joint effusion.
