Cholinesterase inhibitors function to decrease the breakdown of acetylcholine. They SEe use in the treatment of Alzheimer and dementia symptoms. This activity describes the indications, action, and contraindications for cholinesterase inhibitors in treating dementia disorders and other uses within other specialties. Moreover, this activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the management of patients undergoing treatments requiring cholinesterase inhibitors.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for cholinesterase inhibitor use. 
- Describe the most common adverse effects associated with cholinesterase inhibitor use.

- Summarize the risks associated with initiating cholinesterase use. 

- Outline the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients receiving cholinesterase inhibitors.
