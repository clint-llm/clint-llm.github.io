Complete surgical resection (R0) of solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura is the primary treatment modality with primary curative mode. Generally, pedunculated tumors arising from the visceral pleura can be removed safely by video-assisted thoracoscopy surgery (VATS). For the resection of larger tumors with sessile morphology attached to the parietal pleura, thoracotomy might be required.
