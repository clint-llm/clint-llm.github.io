A long-term therapeutic dose of minocycline of up to 200 mg/day is generally safe and well-tolerated. Most adverse effects, such as nausea and dizziness, occur early after administration and disappear shortly after discontinuation of the medication. The recommendation is that after six months of minocycline treatment, all patients be monitored at three-month intervals for adverse effects such as hepatotoxicity, pigmentation, and SLE initiation or worsening.

Minocycline achieves peak serum concentrations ranging from 3 to 8.75 mg/L following 200 mg intravenous administration.

The anti-anabolic effect of minocycline may cause an increase in BUN. Patients with normal renal function don't get adverse effects, while in patients with significantly impaired renal function, it can lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and acidosis. Under these conditions, monitoring of BUN and creatinine is recommended.
