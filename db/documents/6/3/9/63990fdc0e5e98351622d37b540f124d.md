Conversion of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) to mevalonate by HMG-CoA reductase in the hepatocytes is the first and rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Statins competitively inhibit HMG-CoA reductase enzyme. Statins bind to the active site of the enzyme and induce a conformational change in its structure, thus reducing its activity. Also, the binding affinity of statins for HMG-CoA reductase is 10,000 times higher than the substrate (HMG-CoA), thus preventing the action of the enzyme and reducing the intracellular synthesis of cholesterol. Statins have a significant impact on lowering cholesterol since most of the circulating plasma cholesterol comes from the internal synthesis in hepatocytes rather than the diet.

The reduced intracellular concentrations of cholesterol in hepatocytes secondary to statin use activate the proteases that cleave membrane-bound sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP), which further migrate to the nucleus and bind to sterol response elements. This binding results in increased transcription of the LDL receptor, which translocates to the liver cell membrane. The LDL and VLDL particles in plasma bind to the LDL receptors and endocytose in hepatocytes, where their cholesterol component gets processed into bile salts, which are then excreted or recycled. This process increases the catabolism of LDL and VLDL cholesterol and results in further reduction of plasma cholesterol concentrations.

StatinsÂ reduce the plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, LDL-C, VLDL-C, triglycerides, apo-B, and increase the plasma concentrations of HDL-C.

Apart from lowering lipid concentrations, statins also have cardiovascular protective effects (pleiotropic effects), which are primarily because of the inhibition of the production of prenylated proteins (mainly farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate) in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Statins prevent cardiovascular disease progression via the following mechanisms

- Plaque stabilization: Coronary artery plaque rupture predisposes to acute coronary syndrome. Statins maintain the integrity of the fibrous cap of atherosclerotic plaque, inhibit the proliferation of macrophages, and decrease the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP).

- Reduces inflammation: Inflammation plays an essential role in atherosclerotic plaque rupture. Statins reduce the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, IL-6, IL-8) and decrease the concentration of CRP.

- Improve endothelial function: Statins increase eNOS activity within the endothelial cells resulting in vasodilation and thus improving myocardial blood flow.

- Decreased thrombogenicity: Statins decrease the activity of platelets and reduce thromboxane A2 synthesis.
