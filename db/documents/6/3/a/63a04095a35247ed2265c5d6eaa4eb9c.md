There are anatomical variants of the subclavian vein. The subclavian vein may run on a higher plane than usual, sometimes lying above the subclavian artery. The subclavian vein may also pass with the subclavian artery posterior to the anterior scalene muscle or can run behind the anterior scalene muscle with the subclavian artery anterior to the muscle. The subclavian vein may also split, forming a venous circle surrounding the clavicle, anterior scalene, and/or phrenic nerve, termed a "clavicular loop." Occasionally, the subclavian vein can pass between the clavicle and the subclavius muscle. A rare anatomical variant of the phrenic nerve crossing anterior to the subclavian vein, or the phrenic nerve traversing the anterior wall of the subclavian vein, can be present which could potentially cause phrenic nerve injury during subclavian vein catheterization.
