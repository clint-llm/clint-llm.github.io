The complications of angioid streaks include:

- Subretinal bleed due to choroidal rupture after trivial trauma

- Choroidal neovascularizationÂ causing subretinal hemorrhage, intraretinal or subretinal hemorrhage, or exudate, often leading to disciform scar- This can cause severe vision loss and early treatment with anti-VEGF usually stabilizes vision and may improve vision in some cases.

- Foveal atrophy/thinning
