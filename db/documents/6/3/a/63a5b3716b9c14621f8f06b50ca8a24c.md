An understanding of the anterior and posterior lamella of the eyelid is critical in eyelid reconstruction. The anterior lamella includes the skin and orbicularis oculi muscle, while posterior lamella includes the conjunctiva and tarsus. When reconstructing an eyelid, it is important to address reconstruction of both the anterior and posterior lamella. Free skin grafts or free tarsoconjunctival grafts can be used to replace either anterior or posterior lamella defects when they are attached to vascularized tissue, meaning free anterior or posterior lamella grafts can be performedÂ only when the opposite healthy, and vascularized lamella remains. Free anterior and free posterior lamellar repairs are not commonly performed together because the vasculature would be compromised.
