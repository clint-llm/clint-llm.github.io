Muslims constitute large portions of populations in many countries, both Muslim-majority and otherwise. Muslims are considered to be the fastest-growing religious group in the world. Caring for Muslims in the healthcare setting requires knowledge of their cultural and spiritual values. Important differences include diet, ideas of modesty, privacy, touch restriction, and alcohol intake restriction. A healthcare professional will likely care for a Muslim patient during his or her career. The Muslim faith encompasses several ethnicities with diverse views regarding illness and healthcare. As a result, the care of Muslim patients provides challenges for many non-Muslim healthcare providers. The Islamic faith can influence decision-making, family dynamics, health practices, risks, and the use of healthcare. This activity describes the care of Muslim patients taking into account their religious views on health and illness while at the same time maintaining confidentiality.
