Computer tomography (CT) is not typically used in the initial evaluation of the ankle. The utility of CT is to evaluate for clinically suspected radiographically-occult fractures, to evaluate displacement of fractures and associated dislocations, and to aid surgical planning. Retrospective reviews have demonstrated increased sensitivity of CT for evaluation of ankle and foot fractures as compared to radiography.

CT is obtained in axial projections, and standard coronal and sagittal reformations are performed in soft tissue and bone algorithms. Real-time multiplanar reformations can be performed at the workstation, and 3D surface renderings can now be easily created to further assist the surgeon in planning. These features also allow a better evaluation of severe polytrauma patients, as patient positioning is not as important in this modality. Intravenous or intraarticular contrast is rarely administered in these examinations but may be used when contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cannot be performed.
