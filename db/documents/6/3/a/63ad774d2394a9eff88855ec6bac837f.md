Prognosis is dependent on clinical and histopathologic staging, particularly the extent of disease. In general, younger patients have a better prognosis. It is possible that pediatric patients are better able to tolerate intense chemotherapy.

Poor response to cyclophosphamide, prednisolone, and vincristine are poor prognostic indicators, as well as detection of CNS disease at presentation. Elevated lactose dehydrogenase concentrations (twice the upper limit of normal values) is associated with poor outcomes. The finding of some additional cytogenetic findings beyond the MYC translocation, including deletion of 13q, a gain of 7q, or complex cytogenetics may portend a worse prognosis.

In developing countries, the stage of the disease and abdominal ultrasound are used to determine prognosis. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) scans are utilized to evaluate for residual or recurrent disease. The prognostic significance of early PET scans or CT scans to assess disease is an area of investigation. Research is being conducted to elucidate whether minimal residual disease (MRD) is a risk factor for worse prognosis in Burkitt lymphoma. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to assess MRD by detecting MYC/IgH fusion.
