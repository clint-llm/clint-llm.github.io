In case of a transfemoral approach, most physicians choose to perform CAS under local anesthesia with or without sedation to monitor the patient’s neurologic status. For the transcarotid approach, either local anesthesia with sedation or general anesthesia may be employed. If general anesthesia is employed, use of intraoperative EEG/brain mapping should be considered.

Regardless of the approach, patients should be closely monitored during the procedure. As with CEA, CAS can cause dramatic changes in the patient’s hemodynamics, leading to hypotension or bradycardia. Anesthesia personnel should have vasoactive medications available to treat such hemodynamically significant changes. It is also prudent to have an arterial line in place for invasive hemodynamic monitoring during the procedure. Patients should be on aspirin and Plavix preoperatively, and these should be continued in the postoperative period. All patients should be asked about aspirin and Plavix use in the preoperative holding area.

For the transfemoral approach, the patient should be supine and the neck should be turned to the opposite side. For the transcarotid approach, the patient should be supine with a shoulder roll placed underneath the shoulders and the neck turned to the opposite side. Full sterile precautions should be maintained throughout the procedure as with any invasive procedure. If the transfemoral approach is being used, both groins should be prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.

For the transcarotid approach, the neck should be prepped and draped in addition to the groins. Arms can be tucked for both approaches.
