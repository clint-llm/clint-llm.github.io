Transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) is a staple of prostate evaluation. The technique was first described in 1968 by Watanabe and colleagues. However, it did not obtain widespread use until a couple of decades later. It is now commonly utilized for imaging any prostatic pathology, especially prostate cancer, prostatitis, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

Prostate cancer is the most common new cancer diagnosis in men, and the incidence is only expected to increase as the population ages. The widespread routine monitoring of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has increased the overall diagnosis of cancer. However, these are mostly low-grade neoplasms. The most widely used diagnostic tool to evaluate prostate cancer is transrectal ultrasound, and it also serves as a guide for biopsy.

Prostatitis is a fairly common disease that was classically diagnosed on physical exam and laboratory findings alone. Still, imaging has played an increasing role with the more recent advancements of TRUS. BPH is extremely prevalent, affecting 20% of men aged 30Â to 79, with 80% of men being affected by age 70. Imaging is not required for diagnosis. However, the gland changes are easily recognized, and it is recommended if any surgical intervention is planned.
