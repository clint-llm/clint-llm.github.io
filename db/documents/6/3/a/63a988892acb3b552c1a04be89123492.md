Pacemakers have become an established modality for long-term management of life-threatening arrhythmias and improve the quality of life of affected patients significantly. Pacemakers have also become a cornerstone in the management of cardiomyopathies.

Conventionally, these devices pace the ventricle in isolation, often leading to improper or mistimed atrial and ventricular contraction causing a reduction in cardiac output. This may be due to mistimed atrial contraction occurring against closed atrioventricular (AV) valve or atrial contraction occurring too close to ventricular contraction, producing back pressure in venous circulation systems and loss of atrial contribution to the ventricular output.

Since the invention of this therapy in 1958, physicians have reported reductions in cardiac output as a response to ventricular pacing. Although baroreceptor reflexes do compensate for this by increasing peripheral vascular resistance, this is not always the case. In patients who fail to compensate for the loss of cardiac output with these mechanisms, a wide variety of symptoms are noted and mostly attributable to a loss in cardiac output and decreased peripheral resistance. This phenomenon and the resulting constellation of signs and symptoms is referred to as pacemaker syndrome.
