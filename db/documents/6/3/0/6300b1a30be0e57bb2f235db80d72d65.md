The vascular system is responsible for the distribution of oxygen and metabolites, removal of waste materials, and thermoregulation. Perfused by the pump function of the heart, blood vessels are the elastic conduits of the circulation and include three fundamental components: arteries, veins, and the microcirculation (arterioles, capillaries, and venules). The functional assessment of the vascular system refers to the hemodynamic state, which includes a series of clinically relevant parameters that stem from the intrinsic components of these blood vessels. These components include endothelial cells, elastic fibers, collagen fibers, and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) that vary in contribution across different vascular beds and govern the modulation of pressure, flow, and resistance.
