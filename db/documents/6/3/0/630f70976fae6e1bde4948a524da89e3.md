The importance of the HMP shunt is R-5-P and NADPH molecules that generated in the reaction. R-5-P undergoes a series of reactions to create the different ribose sugars that comprise the DNA and RNA molecules, required to carry genetic information. Moreover, R-5-P also converts into erythrose-4-phosphate for the synthesis of aromatic amino acids. As such, this pathway is an essential source of these ribose sugars.

NADPH is also an important molecule as it has a plethora of functions throughout the body. It takes part in anabolism processes such as that of synthesis steroids and fatty acids. NADPH is also important in the respiratory burst process, an essential component of the immune response within phagolysosomes. The NADPH is used to reduce oxygen into an oxygen radical that converts into hydrogen peroxide, which in turn, transforms into bleach. Bleach in the phagolysosomes is introduced to offending pathogens to cause death. NADPH is also required to reduce the molecule glutathione. Using glutathione reductase and NAPDH, oxidized glutathione is converted into its reduced form, and can detoxify free radicals and peroxides; this limits the possibility of any free radical injury in tissues with NADPH present, namely that the red blood cells.

Since this pathway creates NADPH, a reducing agent utilized in many anabolic processes, the HMP shunt is common in more tissues than others. These tissues are those with significant anabolic functions such as adrenal cortex (fatty acid and steroid synthesis), mammary gland (milk production), liver, and red blood cells.
