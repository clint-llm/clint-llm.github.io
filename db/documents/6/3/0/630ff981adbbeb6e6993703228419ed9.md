Posterior hip dislocation is rarely, if ever, an occult injury due to the amount of pain elicited as well as an inability to ambulate or bear weight on the affected extremity afterward. The patient's history will usually involve a description/experience in which there was a significant "clunk" or "popping" followed immediately by pain. A physical deformity with ipsilateral shortening/hip flexion, adduction, and internal rotation will be visible. It is also important to examine the pelvis and ipsilateral knee. If necessary, especially in the setting of native hip dislocation, ATLS principles of practice should be applied. A thorough neurovascular examination should be performed and documented at presentation, before and after reduction and serial examination thereafter.

The following can be suggestive signs of vascular or sciatic nerve injury:

- Local hematoma.

- Painful buttock, posterior thigh, and leg.

- Altered sensation in posterior leg and foot.

- Weakness or total loss of dorsiflexion (peroneal branch) or plantar flexion (tibial branch).

- Diminished or absent deep tendon reflexes at the ankle.
