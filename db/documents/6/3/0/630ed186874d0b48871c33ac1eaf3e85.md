Treatment with Sipuleucel-T requires a multidisciplinary team consisting of an oncologist, pharmacist, infusion room nurses, and a clinic nurse to coordinate the treatment. The process starts by collecting the patientâ€™s blood using leukapheresis. The blood sample then goes to the manufacturing facility where the harvested antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are incubated with recombinant prostatic acid phosphatase and GM-CSF leading to activations of APCs. The activated APCs are then packed and returned to the infusion center, where they are infused into the patient. The approved treatment regimen involves biweekly infusions. Treatment with sipuleucel-T for one month can approximate a 100K$, making it one of the most expensive cancer treatments in the market. Although Sipuleucel-T has shown superior efficacy to docetaxel, the cost difference may barely compensate for the added median life; therefore, funding will become an obstacle. Fortunately, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) cover sipuleucel-T treatments. Nonetheless, involving financial personnel and social workers in the process may facilitate the funding process. Also, exploring equally effective yet less expensive options is certainly warranted to decrease the economic burden on society.
