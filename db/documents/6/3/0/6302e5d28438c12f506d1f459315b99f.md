Carcinoid tumors are relatively common disorders and their presentation can vary. These tumors can occur in a number of organs and while they tend toÂ grow locally, metastases are not uncommon. Because of their diverse presentation, they are best managed by an interprofessional team. The survival of patients with carcinoids depends on the location, grade, metabolically active and presence of metastases. Localized lesions have a 5-year survival of 85-90%, and outcomes of functioning lesions are better than tumors that are non-functional.
