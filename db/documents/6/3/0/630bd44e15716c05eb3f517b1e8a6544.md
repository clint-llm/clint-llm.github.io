Rickettsial infections vary in severity based on the virulence of the Rickettsia species and host factors, such as the degree of immunocompetence. R rickettsii and R prowazekii are considered the most virulent species and are associated with significant mortality if the infected individual is not diagnosed and treated early. For example, patients with Rocky Mountain spotted fever have mortality rates are as high as 30% without prompt diagnosis and antibiotic treatment. Appropriate antibiotics started in the first week of the patient's illness are very effective and are associated with excellent outcomes.
