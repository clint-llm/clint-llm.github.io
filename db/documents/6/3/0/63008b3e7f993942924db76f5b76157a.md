All members of the healthcare team carry the same responsibility when it comes to protecting PHI. This includes clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, therapists, techs, office personnel, and even other staff such as housekeeping and nutrition. That is why training and refresher courses on the topic of PHI are critical to patient privacy so that all members of the team can recognize PHI, know the boundaries involved, and identify, and if necessary, report breaches of patient privacy to the proper authorities.
