The differential diagnosis for MALA includes other causes of hyperlactatemia and metabolic acidosis. MALA is a diagnosis of exclusion and investigation, and initial treatment should be aimed at excluding the etiologies mentioned below.

Other toxicological etiologies resulting in hyperlactatemia may include cellular asphyxiants, uncoupling agents, impaired hepatic clearance of lactate, and overdoses resulting in seizures. Examples include cyanide, isoniazid, antiretroviral drugs, linezolid, propylene glycol, rotenone, hydrogen sulfide, nalidixic acid, salicylate, propofol infusion syndrome, antiretroviral medications, ethylene glycol, and massive acetaminophen overdose.

Nontoxicological etiologies include sepsis, shock states, status epilepticus, liver failure, inborn errors of metabolism, mesenteric ischemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, thiamine deficiency, and alcoholic ketoacidosis.
