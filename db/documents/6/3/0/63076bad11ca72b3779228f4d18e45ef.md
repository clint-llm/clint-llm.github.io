The etiology of relapsing polychondritis is not known. It is suggested to occur in a genetically predisposed individual on exposure to a triggering factor. The triggering factor may be an infectious agent, chemical, toxic exposure, or direct trauma. Relapsing polychondritis cases have been reported after trauma occurring to the pinna. A possible explanation includes cryptogenic antigenic release after trauma and recognition of the antigen by the immune system. Genetic studies have shown an association between HLA-DR4 antigen and relapsing polychondritis.
