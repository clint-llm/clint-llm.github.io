The diagnosis ofÂ trochlear palsy should not be totally based only on the three-step test as a number of other clinical conditions can mimic the same. Bilateral fourth nerve palsy can be missed and wrongly diagnosed as unilateral palsy, only to manifest postoperatively. Any surgical intervention in acquired cases should be undertaken after a waiting period of 6 to 12 months as many patients show partial or complete recovery within this period.
