**Anatomical Features of an Umbilical Cord**

The umbilical cord is a soft, tortuous cord with a smooth outer covering of amnion. It extends from the umbilicus of the fetus to the center of the placenta. Its length ranges from 50 cm to 60 cm, with a diameter of about 1 cm.

**Function**

The umbilical arteries carry deoxygenated blood from fetal circulation to the placenta. The two umbilical arteries converge together about at 5 mm from the insertion of the cord, forming a type of vascular connection called the Hyrtl's anastomosis.
