In NF, tumors of the nerve sheaths develop. A mutation in the NF1 gene, on chromosome region 17q11.2, encoding neurofibromin, has been identified.de novo mutation.

The NF2 gene encodes a protein called merlin or schwannomin, located on chromosome 22q1.11.de novo mutation.

In a patient with TSC, a mutation in either the TSC1 (9q34.13) or TSC2 (16p13.3) gene is the underlying defect.de novo mutation.
