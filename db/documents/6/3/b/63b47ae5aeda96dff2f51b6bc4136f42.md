The mainstay of treatment for benign salivary lesions is complete surgical excision with negative margins. Radiation and medical therapy play little role in the treatment of benign salivary tumors. However, radiation has been utilized in cases of recurrent disease, extensive facial nerve involvement, and non-surgical candidates to improve local control. Repeated surgical interventions increase the risk of tumor spillage and facial nerve damage.
