Based on data from the American Heart Association (AHA), Emergency Medical Services assessed approximately 3628 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests involving individuals younger than 18 years of age.

Survival to hospital discharge after EMS-treated, non-traumatic cardiac arrest among youth (younger than 18 years) is 5.4%. Nearly 6000 hospitalized children in the United States receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) annually.

Of the cardiovascular deaths that occurred in young athletes (younger than 18 years), 29% were black, 54% were high school students, and 82% were physically exerting themselves during competition or training.

According to data from the AHA, the outcome of unwitnessed cardiopulmonary arrest in infants and children is poor. Only 8.4% of pediatric patients who have out-of-hospital cardiac arrests survive to discharge, and most are neurologically impaired, while the in-hospital survival rate is 24% with a better neurological outcome. The best-reported outcomes have been in children who receive immediate high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (resulting in ample ventilation and coronary artery perfusion), and in those with witnessed sudden arrest (presenting with ventricular rhythm disturbance) that responds to early defibrillation.
