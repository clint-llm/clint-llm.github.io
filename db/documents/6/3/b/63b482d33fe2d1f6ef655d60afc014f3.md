As previously noted, ocular neuropathic pain is a diagnosis of exclusion. The following are essential to rule out

- Trigeminal neuralgia

- Oculofacial pain

- Referred pain

- Ocular surface disease

- Sinus dysfunction

- Ocular medication toxicity

- Contact lens-related problems

- Corneal disorder (abrasion, erosion, infiltrate, ulcer, etc.)

- Chemical injury

- Trauma

- Uveitis

- Post-herpetic neuralgia

Take, for example,Â ocular surface disease. The mechanism is as follows: reduced tear secretion leads to inflammation. Inflammation causes sensitization of nociceptive nerve endings, which leads to feelings of dryness and pain. In the long term, inflammation and nerve injury alter gene expression within the trigeminal ganglion, propagating ocular dysesthesias and neuropathic pain.
