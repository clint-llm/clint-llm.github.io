Cells of the muscle tissue, vascular endothelium, heart, and liver carry out the insulin-dependent cascade. The response generated by insulin’s effects in these cells is tissue-specific. In adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and the heart, the result is glucose metabolism via glucose uptake into cells. Vasodilation via the production of nitric oxide (NO) is the result seen in the vascular endothelium and heart. The liver exhibits a decrease in gluconeogenesis and increases in glycogenesis in response to the presence of insulin. Insulin’s effect stretches to lipid and protein metabolism as well. It stimulates lipogenesis and protein synthesis and conversely inhibits lipolysis and protein degradation.
