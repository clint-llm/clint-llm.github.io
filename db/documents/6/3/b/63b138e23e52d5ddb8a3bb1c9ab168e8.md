Mediastinal germ cell tumors are very rare and represent 3% to 10% of all mediastinal tumors and are more common in men. Similar to gonadal germ cell tumors, mediastinal germ cell tumors are broadly divided into seminomatous and non-seminomatous germ cell tumors based on tumor histology. Yolk sac tumor, teratoma, choriocarcinoma, embryonal carcinoma are the common sub-types of mediastinal non-seminomatous germ cell tumors. When the tumor contains more than one cell line, it is referred to as a mixed germ cell tumor, and it is considered as a non-seminomatous germ cell tumor even if there is a component of seminoma. Mature teratomas are benign in nature. Among the various subtypes, the mediastinal yolk sac tumor is the commonest histological subtype (about 60%)
