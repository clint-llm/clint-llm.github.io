**Considerations for workup should include:**

Serum glucose:

- Relying on point-of-care blood glucose testing alone will yield erroneous results. A high blood glucose level must be verified by measuring the serum glucose level before starting treatment for neonatal hyperglycemia.

- Venous blood glucose measurement is a preferred sample compared to capillary blood glucose measurement. Capillary blood glucose (heel stick sample) is 15% lower, and the hematocrit value affects the levels.

Urine glucose 2+ or higher suggests osmotic diuresis.

Complete blood count and C-reactive protein will help in ruling out sepsis.

Monitor serum electrolytes levels in patients with hyperglycemia. The osmotic diuresis causes electrolyte loss in urine.

Measure the weight of the baby to determine hydration status.

If hyperglycemia is persistent, serum insulin level, serum, and urine C-peptide levels are used to rule out monogenic diabetes and Type 1 diabetes.
