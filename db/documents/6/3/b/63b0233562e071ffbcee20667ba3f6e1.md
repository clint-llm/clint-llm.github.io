The endosteal blood supply of the mandible is derived from the external carotid artery. The mandibular ramus, condyle, and coronoid have a blood supply from the intramedullary ascending artery (from the inferior alveolar artery), a direct branch of the maxillary artery pterygoid osteomuscular branches. The inferior alveolar artery supplies the mandibular angle and body. Finally, the mandibular symphysis has a rich blood supply consisting of contributions of the submental artery from the facial artery, the sublingual artery from the lingual artery, and the incisive artery from the inferior alveolar artery.

The maxillary artery, a branch of the external carotid artery, branches into the anterior, middle, and posterior superior alveolar arteries providing a blood supply to the maxillary dentition.

The oral cavity primarily has lymphatic drainage to cervical lymph nodes in levels I (submental and submandibular), II (upper internal jugular chain), and III (middle internal jugular chain).
