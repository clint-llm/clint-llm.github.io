**Outcomes**

A spinal abscess is rare in the US, but it may lead to significant morbidity when it occurs. The prognosis depends on the extent of the abscess, the neurological deficits present at the time of presentation, and the response to treatment. Even after treatment, most patients are left with some residual neurological deficit. Many patients require long-termÂ rehabilitation to regain function. During the recovery, pressure ulcers and deep vein thrombosis are also common occurrences.

The management of spinal abscesses mandates a multidisciplinary and interprofessional approach and involves a neurosurgeon, neurologist, intensivist, infectious disease expert, physical therapist, and nurse.
