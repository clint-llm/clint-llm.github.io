Nerves that course through and around the submandibular triangle are essential surgical landmarks to recognize as resection can lead to numerous adverse outcomes. The most superficial of these nerves include the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve superiorly and the cervical branch of the facial nerve inferiorly. Nerves that course deeper in the triangle include the lingual nerve; a division of the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (V3), and the hypoglossal nerve; cranial nerve XII. The mylohyoid muscle is supplied by theÂ mylohyoid nerve from the alveolar branch of V3, which lies on the inferior portion of the muscle.
