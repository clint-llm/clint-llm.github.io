The choice of perioperative antibiotic regimen is dependent on the type of injury, its mechanism, and the preferences of the surgeon. Contaminated wounds, exposure of the meninges, and/or evidence of CSF leakage are indications for prophylactic antibiotics to prevent wound infection and bacterial meningitis. Postoperative imaging may be indicated to ensure adequate bony reduction has been achieved, and a soft bolster is placed over the nasal root, covering the medial canthus, to stabilize the soft tissue contour and prevent accumulation of a fluid collection.

Monitoring airway, neurological, and ophthalmological status is important during postoperative hospitalization, especially for polytrauma patients. An outpatient follow-up to assess wound healing, soft tissue contour, and functional status should be performed regularly over the first several postoperative months. Eye drops are provided to maintain corneal hydration and stabilize the tear film layer, and intravenous maintenance fluids may be required until the patient can swallow safely; patients may require nutrition optimization with supplements.

Following corrective surgery, patients should be counseled to avoid nose blowing for at least ten days, which can insufflate the orbits and forehead. Heavy lifting, straining, and vigorous exercise should also be avoided postoperatively, as these will increase the risk of edema, ecchymosis, and bleeding. Pain and nausea should be controlled for similar reasons, and a stool softener is recommended in order to prevent straining.
