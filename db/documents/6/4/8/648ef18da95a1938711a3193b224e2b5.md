**Esophageal TB**

Esophageal involvement in TB occurs rarely. It has been seen to occur due to spread from adjacent tissues. It usually involves the middle one-third of the esophagus, at the level of the carina.

It may present with dysphagia and odynophagia.

**Gastric and Gastroduodenal TB**

Due to the protective fatty acid capsule of mycobacteria (as described earlier), proximal GIT lesions were thought to be rare. Additional factors that were thought to prevent TB in the stomach and duodenum were a high acid environment, rapid transit time, and a relative absence of lymphoid tissue.

It is reported to occur secondary to pulmonary TB.

Gastrointestinal (GI) tuberculosis in this anatomic location may lead to gastric outlet obstruction and surgical obstructive jaundice.

**TB of the Small and Large Intestine**

Four major forms have been reported:

- Ulcerative – the most common form. Usually presents with superficial transverse ulcers. It is more likely to be seen in the small intestine.

- Hypertrophic – occurs as a hyperplastic reaction around the ulcer, producing an inflammatory mass. It is more likely to be seen in the cecum.

- Ulcero-hypertrophic – a combination of ulcerative and hypertrophic forms may occur.

- Fibrous stricturing – may lead to fibrosis and stricture formation, resulting in intestinal obstruction.

**Rectal and Anal TB**

TB involving the rectal and anal areas may present as multiple fistulae (mimicking Crohn disease), a non-healing lesion after recent anal surgery or a circumferential mass resembling rectal prolapse.

(E) Solid Organ TB:

Solid organs may be involved by hematogenous dissemination or direct intra-abdominal spread.

**Peritoneal TB**

Peritoneal TB usually occurs with other forms of abdominal TB, with peritoneal involvement occurring after the rupture of necrotic lymph nodes. Lymph nodes in the small bowel mesentery and the retroperitoneum are commonly involved, and these may caseate and calcify. Ascites is the most frequent manifestation.

**Peritoneal Involvement**

TB peritonitis exists in 5 main forms:

- Ascitic

- Loculated (encysted)

- Plastic (fibrous)

- Purulent

- Nodular
