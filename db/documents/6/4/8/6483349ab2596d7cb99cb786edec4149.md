The differentiation of E. coli O157: H7 from other invasive intestinal bacterial pathogens inducing hemorrhagic dysenteries such as Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, and C. difficile has a meaningful clinical impact in that antibiotic therapy often aids in recovery from these other pathogens. Noninfectious etiologies of hemorrhagic diarrhea such as ischemic colitis, mesenteric ischemia, Crohn disease, and ulcerative colitis merit consideration as well.
