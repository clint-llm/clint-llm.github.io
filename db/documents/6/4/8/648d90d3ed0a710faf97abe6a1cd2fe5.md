Neurohypophysis is the center for the hormonal secretion of oxytocin and vasopressin. It is regulated by neurons that project from the hypothalamus. Disfunction in the neurohypophysis is related to disruption in the hypothalamus and neurohypophysis. Also, it can be caused by local pituitary tumors. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of disorders of neurohypophysis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of the neurohypophysis disorders.
- Summarize the evaluation of the neurohypophysis disorders.
- Summarize the different disorders of neurohypophysis.
- Outline the management options available for disorders of the neurohypophysis.
