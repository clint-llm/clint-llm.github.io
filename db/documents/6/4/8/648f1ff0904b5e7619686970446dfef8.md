The definite etiology of meningocele remains poorly understood. Most isolated neural tube defects appear to be caused by folate deficiency, likely combined with genetic and environmental risk factors. Folate deficiency may be related to inadequate oral intake, use of folate antagonist, or genetic factors causing abnormal folate metabolism. They may also be associated with chromosomal anomalies or single-gene disorders.

Genetic syndromes associated with meningocele include HARD (hydrocephalus, agyria, and retinal dysplasia), Meckel-Gruber syndrome, trisomy 13 or 18. Maternal factors allied with an elevated risk for neural tube defects include advanced and young maternal age, low socioeconomic status, maternal alcohol use during pregnancy, smoking, caffeine use, obesity, high glycemic index, or gestational diabetes. Maternal use of anti-seizure medications like valproic acid and carbamazepine may develop neural tube defects in the fetus. Amniotic bands are also another factor known to disrupt normal neural tube development.

The elevation of maternal core temperature in the first trimester from febrile illness or other sources may be associated with meningocele. The environmental factors like agrochemicalsÂ and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can cause neural tube defects.
