Patient education is a key factor in the management of hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Educating patients about their disease process and advising them to avoid the triggering factors through lifestyle and behavioral modifications can prevent future attacks, reduce recurrent hospital admissions, decrease patient morbidity, improve quality of life and also help to reduce the financial burden that occurs due to hospital readmissions.

The patient should be advised to pay close attention to identify the triggering factors in them as they can vary among individuals. Patients usually get attacks in the morning when they woke up or during midnight, so a safe bedside environment is essential to prevent falls and avoid its consequences. The floor of the room should not be slippery. The bed should be far from the cooler or windows, as patients may not be able to move themselves during the episode of paralysis, and they might become hypothermic during the cold. They should alert someone or call or 911 when they feel like or when they get an attack. Patients should be advised to keep their potassium tablets at multiple places like at bedside, office, pockets, in the car as they can take it when they get an attack.
