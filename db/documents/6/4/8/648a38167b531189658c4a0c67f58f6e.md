The most considerable complication of dizziness is secondary injury. Dizziness and difficulty with balance are closelyÂ linked with a greater risk of falls.

Unfortunately, older individuals more commonly suffer from dizziness, and older individuals are also more likely to suffer severe injuries from falls. A single fall can result in a disabling injury that can forever change an individual's life. Dizziness may also impair their ability to function independently and perform their activities of daily living (ADLs).
