Amiodarone is one of the most commonly used anti-arrhythmic drugs. While the United States FDA has labeled amiodarone for the treatment of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, the drug is commonly used off-label to treat supraventricular tachyarrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation as well as for the prevention of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTs) in high-risk patients. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, activity, adverse events, and other vital elements of amiodarone in the clinical setting related to the essential points needed by members of an interprofessional team managing the care of patients with arrhythmia.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of amiodarone.
- Outline the indications for amiodarone use.
- Summarize the adverse event profile for patients receiving amiodarone therapy.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the knowledge on amiodarone and improve outcomes.
