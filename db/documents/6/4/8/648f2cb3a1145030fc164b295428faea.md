Clinicians mainly manage myoclonus by treating symptoms. The previously mentioned classification of myoclonus into cortical and subcortical helps in the guidance of pharmacotherapy since spinal myoclonus fails to respond to medications effective for cortical myoclonus and vice versa.

In cortical myoclonus, first-line medications include valproate, clonazepam, and levetiracetam with topiramate and zonisamide used as second-class agents.

Botulinum toxin can be offered as a treatment option in focal peripheral myoclonus.

In regards to deep brain stimulation (DBS) in myoclonus, the most commonly reported indication is myoclonus–dystonia syndrome, and the target is usually both internal globus pallidus (GPi) and thalamic nuclei.
