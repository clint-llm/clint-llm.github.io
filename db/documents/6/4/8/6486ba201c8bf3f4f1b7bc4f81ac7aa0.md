The pathophysiology is related to alterations in bile flow suggested by the removal of the reservoir function of the gallbladder altering bile flow. Bile is thought to be the main trigger in patients with mild gastroduodenal symptoms or diarrhea. While our current knowledge about the pathophysiology of post-cholecystectomy syndrome has improved since the introduction of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and endoscopic sphincter of Oddi manometry (ESOM) in diagnostic circumstances, the pathophysiology is not yet fully understood. Post-cholecystectomy syndrome is thought to be caused by organic or functional disease of the gastrointestinal tract and can be further classified into patients with symptoms of non-biliary and biliary origin for systematic evaluation.
