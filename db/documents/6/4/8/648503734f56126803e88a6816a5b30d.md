The tracer may be administered via an intravenous route, orally or via inhalation. The tracer takes some time to distribute throughout the body. A contrast may be administered intravenously or orally if a PET-CT is to be done. Positioning depends upon the site to be scanned. The PET machine has a central hole through which the patient slides through. First images are generally scout images to assess whether the positioning is correct. Sometimes breath-holding maybe required. The scan takes anything from 30 minutes to 1 hour.
