- The definition of thrombocytopenia is when the blood platelet count is < 150x10^9/L. It may not be symptomatic until the platelet count falls below 10x10^9/L.

- ITP can be idiopathic, although it is often autoimmune-related.

- ITP can be secondary to SLE, HIV, and drugs (e.g., quinine).

- The antibody involved is not temperature-dependent and always directed against platelet-specific antigens.

- Corticosteroids work by decreasing phagocytosis of antibody-coated platelet by phagocytes in both the spleen and liver.

- Splenectomy removes the sites of autoantibody production and phagocytosis and is successful in most patients.

- In refractory patients, one can successfully use intravenous immunoglobulins. The IgG blocks Fc-receptors on macrophages and reduces platelet binding to autoantibodies.
