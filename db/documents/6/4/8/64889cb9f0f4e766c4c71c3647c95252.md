Myoglobinuria can lead to acute renal failure and can cause permanent damage if not managed appropriately and efficiently. In order to prevent morbidity and mortality, it is best managed by an interprofessional team. It involves the initial management by an emergency physician and a hospitalist so that appropriate earlier hydration can be managed.

Upon discharge, the patient should be educated about the causes of rhabdomyolysis. College students who present with frequent myoglobinuria due to their athletic activities should be educated about it and may be asked to change their exercise routine and intensity. They should also be advised to hydrate themselves regularly to prevent any renal damage. If the patients are on any prescription medications that can cause muscle breakdown, the pharmacists should also educate the patients about them. They may consult the physician to recommend any alternative drug without any such side effects.

The main goal is to identify the problem early and maintain communication among the team for early intervention. Early intervention and later on educating the patient about the problem yields the best clinical outcome.
