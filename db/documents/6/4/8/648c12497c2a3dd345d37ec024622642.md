Persistent air leak after pulmonary injury may represent either disruption of a bronchus or rupture of an overdistended alveolus. Several methods have been used to diagnose bronchopleural fistulas (BPFs), including the instillation of methylene blue into the pleural space and bronchography.

Radiological features that suggest the presence or the development of a BPF include an increase in the intrapleural airspace, the appearance of a new air-fluid level, changes in an already present air-fluid level, development of tension pneumothorax, and a drop in the air-fluid level exceeding 2 cm.

Using standard and thin section non-contrast CT scans, Westcott and Volpe. could demonstrate a fistula in 10 out of 20 patients.

Several authors have tried to localize a BPF using radiolabeled aerosol inhalation with planar and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) imaging.

Computed tomography bronchography (CTB) has been utilized in the diagnosis of a difficult BPF. Following bronchoscopy, Sarkar et al. injected 20 to 30 mL of a water-based nonionic low osmolar iodinated contrast medium iohexol at the suspected fistula site either through a catheter or directly through the working channel of the bronchoscope.
