Osteoblasts are cuboidal or polygonal cells that comprise only 4 to 6% of all bone cells and are predominately situated in matrix boundaries. These cells aggregate along bone surfaces, mostly in the periosteum or endosteum, and demonstrate the morphological characteristics of cells that synthesize an abundance of protein; this includes an extensive rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), Golgi apparatus, numerous secretory vesicles, and mitochondria.

Osteoblasts can secrete enzymes, pro-collagenases, which in contact with the matrix transform into collagenases by the action of osteoclasts; collagenase will be used by osteoclasts to disassemble collagen fibers.
