There are five main branches to the auriculotemporal nerve; the anterior auricular, articular, parotid, superficial temporal and branches to the external auditory meatus:

- The anterior auricular branch provides somatosensory innervation to the skin of the ear, including the tragus and part of the helix.

- The articular branch provides somatosensory innervation to the posterior temporal mandibular joint

- The parotid branch receives its preganglionic fibers from the lesser petrosal nerve of the tympanic plexus originating from the glossopharyngeal nerve, before sending postganglionic general visceral efferent fibers within the parotid branch of the auriculotemporal nerve. This branch provides secretomotor innervation via parasympathetic fibers to the parotid gland and vasomotor via sympathetic innervation.

- The superficial temporal branches run posterior to the superficial temporal artery. These branches provide somatosensory innervation to the skin over the temple. This branch also anastomoses with the facial nerve and zygomaticotemporal nerve, a branch of the maxillary division of cranial nerve five, the trigeminal nerve.

- The branch to the external auditory meatus provides somatosensory innervation to the skin of the meatus as well as the tympanic membrane.
