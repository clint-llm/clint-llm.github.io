Although there are no absolute contraindications to calcium supplementation, some conditions should merit special consideration regarding calcium supplementation. These conditions include patients with renal impairment or chronic kidney disease (CKD) and history of calcium-containing kidney stones.

The literature regarding the risks and benefits of calcium supplementation in patients with CKD is not robust, and more research is necessary to optimize calcium supplementation in this sub-population. Studies have shown that patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/minute/1.73m^2 may be at an increased risk of certain side effects of calcium supplementation. Firstly, research has shown that calcium supplementation between over 2000 mg per day can suppress PTH secretion in patients with advanced CKD.

In patients with a known risk or history of calcium-containing nephrolithiasis should avoid excessive calcium intake in the form of supplements. Of note, the risk of calcium-containing stones increases with oral calcium supplementation but is reducible with dietary calcium.
