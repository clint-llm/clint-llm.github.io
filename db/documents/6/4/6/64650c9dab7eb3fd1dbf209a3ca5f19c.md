Proper identification of stroke symptoms by the patients themselves or by individuals witnessing the patientâ€™s symptoms is vital for timely initiation of the emergency medical system (EMS). Stroke education campaigns targeting communities could influence the timely recognition of symptom onset. Once the EMS is triggered, healthcare professionals managing the patient should be well trained to identify stroke and manage accordingly. Stroke care, when strategically organized, can decrease the stroke burden considerably.
