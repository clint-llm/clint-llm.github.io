The paramedian forehead flap, as a workhorse flap, is commonly employed for the reconstruction of nasal defects in patients across the demographic spectrum. Nevertheless, there are a handful of situations in which the use of a paramedian forehead flap may not be ideal, including in patients who smoke (due to resulting small vessel vasculopathy), patients who will not accept a forehead scar, patients who have very low hairlines (and would therefore have substantial hair growth on the end of the flap), patients with wounds or lesions of the forehead (such as patients with multiple skin cancers), and patients with histories of forehead lacerations or prior surgery in the area that may have disrupted the supratrochlear blood supply.
