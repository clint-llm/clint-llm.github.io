Isolated PLD results from embryonic ductal plate malformation of the intrahepatic bile ducts and cilia of the cholangiocytes. In normal bile duct formation, there is a complex sequence of events that involves both growth and apoptosis. In patients with isolated PLD, there is a disruption in this sequence, and no apoptosis occurs. As a result, complexes of disconnected intralobular bile ductules known as “Von Meyenburg complexes” form. Cysts arise from these complexes and continue to grow with time.
