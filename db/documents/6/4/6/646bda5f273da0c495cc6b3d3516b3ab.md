Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide killing approximately 1.5 million people in 2012. In the United States, there are over 200,000 new cases per year and over 150,000 deaths per year attributed to lung cancer. SCLC comprises about 15% of cases.

Smoking is strongly associated with developing lung cancer and particularly with SCLC. The relative incidence of SCLC has decreased over the last 4 decades reflecting decreases in smoking prevalence, changes to cigarettes, and reduced occupational hazards.

There is a higher incidence of SCLC in males. However, the incidence gap between males and females has narrowed over the past 3 decades. Caucasians have had a higher incidence of SCLC than African Americans. Survival gaps between races and socioeconomic status (SES) have narrowed since 1983.

From 1983 to 2012, median survival and overall survival of SCLC patients have remained stable. Five-year survival rates have increased from 4.9% (1983 through 1993) to 6.4% (2002 through 2012). Median survival has remained stable at 7 months. Relative survival rates (RSRs) have remained stable. However, there have been greater survival improvements in younger patient groups.
