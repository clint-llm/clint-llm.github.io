COPD-OSA overlap syndrome may be similar in presentation to other overlapping respiratory diseases.  An example is an asthma-COPD overlap.  The COPD component will remain the same and can be further subdivided into phenotypic types.  Pulmonary function testing and symptomatology consistent with asthma will help differentiate these pathologies and the lack of OSA symptoms.

Regarding obstructive sleep apnea, there are several differentials to consider, including chronic insufficient sleep, dyspnea due to pulmonary edema, idiopathic hypersomnia, nocturnal panic attacks, nonobstructive alveolar hypoventilation, obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (Pickwickian syndrome), periodic limb movement disorder, and simple snoring.  Polysomnography and AHI are necessary to differentiate these other common presentations.
