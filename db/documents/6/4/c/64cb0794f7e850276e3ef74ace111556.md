The anterolateral abdominal wall is bound laterally by the posterior axillary lines, superiorly by the costal margin of the 7th to 10th ribs and xiphoid process, and inferiorly by the iliac crest, inguinal ligament, pubic crest, and symphysis. The muscles of the anterolateral abdominal wall, from superficial to deep, include the external oblique, internal oblique, and the transversus abdominis. The transversus abdominis plane is the fascial plane that separates the transversus abdominis muscle from the internal oblique muscle. Innervation of the anterolateral abdominal wall is composed of the thoracoabdominal nerves and the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves which communicate to form the upper and lower TAP plexuses. Therefore, to achieve full anesthesia of the abdominal wall, several injections must be made to cover the nerves of T6-L1.

Each TAP block generally provides analgesia to one quadrant of the abdominal wall. To block the L1 segment, an injection medial to the anterior superior iliac spine must be performed. A major limitation of the TAP block is that while it provides somatic analgesia, it fails to provide analgesia for visceral pain.
