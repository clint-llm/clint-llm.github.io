Injection of poly-L-lactic acid into the deep dermis or subcutaneous tissue may cause an immediate augmentation of the treated tissue. This is a temporary butÂ immediate response due to tissue edema and fluid from the reconstitution of the product. It will resolve within 2 to 3 days after injection. Once the carrier substance is absorbed, the poly-L-lactic acid particles induce an inflammatory response through phagocytosis by tissue macrophages. This is a similar process to suture reabsorption in the skin. The inflammatory response breaks down the poly-L-lactic acid into lactic acid monomers. It is then metabolized to carbon dioxide and water while stimulating the production of new collagen type-I fibers in the skin. Approximately half of the product is digested within six months. The duration of action is 12 to 24 months.
