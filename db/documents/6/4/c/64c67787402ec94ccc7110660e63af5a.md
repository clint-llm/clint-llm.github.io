To be the site of major absorption and digestion of nutrients, the small intestine must rely on enzymes supplied by multiple organs, including the stomach, gallbladder, pancreas, and salivary glands.Â Due to the involvement of these organs, malabsorption issues and clinical diagnoses may stem from regions other than the small intestine. For example, pancreatic insufficiency, pernicious anemia, and cystic fibrosis are all diseases involving malabsorption, yet they do not originate in the small intestine.
