Von Willebrand factor is an adhesive glycoprotein multimer synthesized by endothelial cells in Weibel-Palade bodies and megakaryocytes in alpha-granules.

These pleiotropic functions of von Willebrand factor can be tested with different laboratory assays. The deficiency or abnormality of vWF causes von Willebrand disease, which is the most common autosomal inherited bleeding disorder. Replacement therapy in vWD works by correcting the dual defect of hemostasis, i.e., the abnormal platelet adhesion–aggregation and the abnormal intrinsic coagulation due to low and unstable circulating FVIII. Replacement of deficient or abnormal vWF and correction of low levels of FVIII are both equally important in restoring normal hemostasis in patients with vWD.
