Between 20% to 40% of patients with solid tumors receiving chemotherapy develop mucositis, usually within five to fourteen days of starting treatment.

One study reported that patients who receive high doses of chemotherapy or undergo bone marrow transplantation have a 76% risk of mucositis. Radiation-induced oral mucositis (RIOM) occurs in 100% of altered fractionation radiotherapy head and neck cancer patients.
