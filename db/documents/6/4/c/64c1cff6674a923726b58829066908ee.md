**Bladder Injury**

- It can be avoided by using retractors to displace the bladder inferiorly.

- If distended, the bladder can be decompressed with needle aspiration or with the use of a Foley catheter, before initiation of the procedure.

**Injury to the Fetus**

- It can be avoided by creating a lower midline uterine incision to avoid placental injury.

- Also, by using scissors instead of a scalpel, to extend the incision superiorly.

**Arterial Injury**

- A midline abdominal incision will avoid major arterial bleeding.

- Avoid transverse of lateral uterine incisions as the uterine blood vessels run laterally along the uterine border.
