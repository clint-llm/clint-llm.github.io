Amniotic fluid is produced and processed largely by the fetus. Two main methods are used to communicate amniotic fluid levels: the amniotic fluid index (AFI) or the maximal vertical pocket (MVP). Adequate amounts of amniotic fluid are necessary for normal fetal development, and alterations can indicate an underlying disease process affecting the pregnancy. This activity reviews the sonographic evaluation and interpretation of amniotic fluid levels and highlights the inter-professional team's role in evaluating and treating abnormalities in amniotic fluid levels.

**Objectives:**
- Describe indications for obtaining sonographic estimations of amniotic fluid.
- Describe how to properly perform an ultrasound and calculate an amniotic fluid index (AFI) and maximal vertical pocket (MVP).
- Identify abnormal amniotic fluid parameters.
- Describe common etiologies associated with oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios.
