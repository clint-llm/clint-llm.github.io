The health hazards of radon come from its decay products. As radon decays, it emits alpha, beta, and gamma particles as well as x-rays. An alpha particle consists of a helium nucleus (two protons and two neutrons) and has the ability to transfer large amounts of energy into human tissue. Alpha particles are more biologically destructive than beta or gamma radiations, interacting much more readily with DNA and producing oxidative decimation through radiolysis. Ionizing radiation from alpha particles can cause chromosomal abnormalities, double-strand DNA breaks, and the production of reactive oxygen species, leading to carcinogenesis.

Ultimately, the decay products of radon (polonium-218, polonium-214, and lead-214) become charged and attach to aerosol particles. The charged aerosolized particles aggregate, forming clusters that readily attach to dust in the air, which is subsequently inhaled and deposit in the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles. Upon entering the respiratory epithelium, the alpha particles can cause DNA damage, ultimately contributing to tumor genesis and lung cancer.
