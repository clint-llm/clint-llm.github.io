A patient with refractive error needs correction in the form of spectacle or contact lenses to see clearly.

Subjective refraction may be performed after objective refraction or can be done without that. However, it should be carried out after the objective refraction to be more precise.

When the patient has been subjected to cycloplegic retinoscopy, it is better to perform subjective refraction once the drug effect wears off. It will be challenging to perform subjective refraction in very young children, mentally challenged patients, and uncooperative patients. Hence the prescription is given based on objective refraction in such cases.

This activity will describe the instruments required, procedure, indications, interfering factors, and clinical significance of retinoscopy.
