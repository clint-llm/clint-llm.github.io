The right anterior branch of atrial arteries originates within the first two centimeters of the RCA along the right atrioventricular groove just after the conus artery.

Like other blood vessels, the coronary arteries share the same characteristic layers, namely, the tunica intima, tunica media, and tunica adventitia.

The tunica intima is the inner-most layer of the ARAA and is composed of a simple squamous endothelium followed by a sub-endothelial layer and an internal elastic lamina. The multi-faceted endothelium functions as a selective barrier that can allow diapedesis of immune cells, the passage of chemical messengers, and the movement of fluid, electrolytes, and other molecules.

The tunica media is the next main layer of the ARAA. This portion of the arteries contains five layers of smooth muscle organized in a hexagonal arrangement and typically contains elastic fibers, proteoglycans, and collagen.

Lastly, the tunica adventitia is the outer-most layer, which is made up of fibroblasts and collagen. Within the tunica adventitia are vessels and nerves that supply and innervate the coronary arteries.
