The consequences of ocular trauma range from complete recovery to irreversible blindness, with or without loss of the eye. Trauma is the most common cause of non-congenital unilateral blindness in children.

Depending on the mechanism of injury, initial symptoms of ocular trauma vary and include pain, burning, acute loss of vision, diplopia, and physical disfigurement. This article will discuss the types of ocular trauma, epidemiology and risk factors, national trends, practice patterns, and prognosis and prevention with an emphasis on patient counseling. Understanding ocular anatomy, types of ocular trauma, and the variety of inciting events and sequelae is essential to assess appropriately, triage, manage, and ultimately reduce morbidity, blindness, and recurrence.
