Traditional treatment of opioid/opiate addiction focuses on self-help in counseling and mentorship by individuals with opioid use disorder already successfully in recovery, focusing on drug-free living. "Drug-free" in the minds of many in recovery and treatment involves an absence of any chemicals, including those prescribed by a medical provider. In the 2010s, the concept of harm reduction became increasingly accepted by mainstream addiction treatment providers, allowing for ingested medications to be taken, with an increased focus on objective patient outcome optimization.

Chronic treatment of patients with opioid use disorder using methadone (a full mu receptor agonist), buprenorphine (a partial agonist of mu receptors and Kappa antagonist), and naltrexone (an opioid receptor antagonist) became more accepted. Increasing numbers of studies comparing various strategies of recovery and relapse suppression appeared in the literature. Concurrently, depot naltrexone injection to enhance complete opioid avoidance became available. Each naltrexone injection lasts approximately 30 days. During that time, opioids are rendered ineffective by the effect of naltrexone on the target receptors.

Disadvantages of naltrexone include difficulties in controlling acute pain in the setting of trauma and other acute medical issues. Depot naltrexone injection is contraindicated in the setting of chronic pain. Oral naltrexone is taken daily but is nearly always ineffective if the patient controls their dosing schedule. Observed oral naltrexone administration controlled by a significant other may have a promise, given recent literature regarding disulfiram in treating alcoholism.

**Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment (MAT) Act**

The Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment (MAT) Act provision updates federal guidelines to expand the availability of evidence-based treatment to address the opioid epidemic. The MAT Act empowers all health care providers with a standard controlled substance license to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder (OUD), just as they prescribe other essential medications. The MAT Act is intended to help destigmatize a standard of care for OUD and will integrate substance use disorder treatment across healthcare settings.

As of December 2022, the MAT Act has eliminated the DATA-Waiver (X-Waiver) program. All DEA-registered practitioners with Schedule III authority may now prescribe buprenorphine for OUD in their practice if permitted by applicable state law, and SAMHSA encourages them to do so. Prescribers who were registered as DATA-Waiver prescribers will receive a new DEA registration certificate reflecting this change; no action is needed on the part of registrants.

There are no longer any limits on the number of patients with OUD that a practitioner may treat with buprenorphine. Separate tracking of patients treated with buprenorphine or prescriptions written is no longer required.

Pharmacy staff can now fill buprenorphine prescriptions using the prescribing authority's DEA number and does not need a DATA 2000 waiver from the prescriber. However, depending on the pharmacy, the dispensing software may still require the X-Waiver information in order to proceed. Practitioners are still required to comply with any applicable state limits regarding the treatment of patients with OUD.  Contact information for State Opioid Treatment Authorities can be found here: https://www.samhsa.gov/medicationassisted-treatment/sota.
