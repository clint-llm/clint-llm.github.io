Hyperacute lung rejection usually happens within 24 hours after the procedure with a rapid onset of respiratory distress and severe hypoxia resulting from acute pulmonary edema and diffuse alveolar damage. The clinical presentation is thus similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), carrying a high fatality rate. Imaging is significant for diffuse opacities in the transplanted lung.

Acute cellular lung rejection can present up to 2 years but is most prevalent in the first 6 months.

Bronchiolitis obliterans can present with an asymptomatic decline inÂ forced expiratory volume 1s (FEV1). Symptoms, if present, are non-specific and can range from upper respiratory tract infection symptoms, such as dry cough, dyspnea on exertion, occasionally a low-grade fever to a rapid decline in pulmonary function and respiratory failure.
