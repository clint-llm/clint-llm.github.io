Various adverse reactions can happen with aromatase inhibitors. (Seen in less than 1 in 10,000 patients). Some of them are as follows:

- Ulcers and blisters are the common skin manifestations;

- Allergic reactions, such as swelling of the face along with lips and tongue and occasionally throat; these reactions can result in difficulty swallowing and/or breathing;

- Liver function abnormality with or without jaundice due to inflammation of the liver;

- Bone loss due to estrogen deficiency with long-term use.

Common adverse reactions (10% incidence) include the following: hot flashes, asthenia, joint disorders such as arthritis or arthralgia, osteoporosis, fractures, bone pain, back pain, vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, sexual dysfunction, uterine atrophy, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, thromboembolic disease, cardiac and cerebrovascular events, insomnia, nausea.

The most common reason for discontinuing aromatase inhibitor therapy is the development of arthralgias, known as aromatase inhibitor-associated arthralgia syndrome. Patients will present with joint pain and mild swelling in the absence of other systemic diseases or other causes. The deficiency of estrogen causes a decrease in bone mineral density, which contributes to joint pain. Estrogen also shows links to the regulation of cytokine activity as well as the modulation of pain reception in the nervous system.
