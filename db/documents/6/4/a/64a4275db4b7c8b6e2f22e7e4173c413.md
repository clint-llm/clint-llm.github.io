Universal immunization of all susceptible individuals with rubella vaccines is the cornerstone to the prevention of rubella and, more importantly, congenital rubella syndrome.Â In the United States, the rubella vaccines consist of a live attenuated RA 27/3 strain. The vaccine is usually administered in combination with measles and mumps (MMR) or measles, mumps, and varicella (MMRV), with the first dose at ages 12-15 months and the second dose at ages 4-6 years.

Rubella vaccine should be deferred after recent use of high-dose corticosteroids, recent administration of immunoglobulin or blood products, and after another live vaccine has been given (if not given simultaneously).

Adverse effects of the rubella vaccine are uncommon in children. MMR administration is associated mainly with fever and rash in 15% and 5% of vaccinees, respectively. Arthralgia and arthritis can develop after vaccination, usually occurring in postpubertal women. ****

Passive immunization with immunoglobulin is not recommended for non-pregnant contacts. For susceptible pregnant women with known exposure to rubella in which termination of pregnancy is not an option, the administration of immunoglobulin within 72 h of exposure should be considered.
