Most patients with primary and secondary erythromelalgia are difficult to manage and are often resistant to treatment. One exception is secondary disease due to polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia, as these patient populations often have a favorable response to aspirin therapy. Currently, data is conflicting as to the severity and prognosis of primary versus secondary erythromelalgia. Some studies postulate that aspirin responsive patients have little morbidity, and complications occur more frequently in patients who have platelet-mediated disease.

Over time, ulceration, necrosis, and gangrene can develop in response to repeated ice water immersion or other forms of chronic cooling of the extremities. Quality of life has been shown to be dramatically affected and can lead to chronic depression due to fear of precipitating episodes.
