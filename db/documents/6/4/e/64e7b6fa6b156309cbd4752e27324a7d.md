Solitary fibrous tumors of the pleura (SFTPs) are a quiet entity and grow to a great size and extent before manifesting signs or symptoms. Solitary pleural fibrous tumors represent a rare entity of primary neoplasms originating from mesenchymal cells in the submesothelial layer of the pleura. Solitary pleural fibrous tumors represent less than 5% of primary pleural neoplasms. They are mostly benign in nature. A histopathological workup is required in diagnosing these tumors. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of solitary fibrous tumors of the pleura and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with the disease.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the clinical characteristics of solitary fibrous tumors of the pleura.
- Review the workup required for patients with solitary fibrous tumors of the pleura.
- Outline treatment modalities in patients with these tumors.
- Summarize recommendations for post-treatment surveillance.
