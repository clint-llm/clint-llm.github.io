As with many surgeries, biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch complications can be divided into early and late complications

Common early complications: anastomotic leak and hemorrhage

**Anastomotic Leak**

The incidence of a gastric or duodenal leak following biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch is 1.14% vs. 1.12% for Roux en-Y gastric bypass.

**Hemorrhage**

The reported incidence for a postoperative hemorrhage is less than 1% of all gastric bypass surgeries experience bleeding, which requires intervention or transfusion. This can present as intraluminal and extraluminal bleeding. This has likely improved due to improved staple technology. Hemorrhage is more commonly seen with laparoscopic gastric bypass over open procedures.

Common late complication: nutritional deficiencies

**Nutritional Deficiencies**

Biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch is the one bariatric procedure associated with the greatest perioperative malnutrition and metabolic-related complications. All patients need to begin supplementation postoperatively. Common nutritional deficiencies that can be seen are Iron deficiency anemia, protein-calorie malnutrition, hypocalcemia, deficiency of the fat-soluble vitamins, vitamin B1, vitamin B12, and folate. Close follow up, and laboratory studies are essential for these patients. If a nutritional deficiency is detected, dietary supplementation is extremely important.
