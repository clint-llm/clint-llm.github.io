- Hemicrania continua is a unilateral continuous headache for more than three months with episodic headache exacerbations.

- Ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms are usually present.

- Agitation and restlessness may occur during exacerbations.

- A complete response to indomethacin is one of the pathognomonic features of HC.

- A response to indomethacin does not exclude secondary causes of HC, which should be excluded by proper history, examination, and investigations that include at least an MRI brain with contrast studies and an angiogram.
