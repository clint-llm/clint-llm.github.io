The histologic examination can vary depending on the age of the lesion. A characteristic histopathologic finding is mild perivascular lymphocytic inflammation, extravasated red blood cells, superficial dermal vessels with thrombi, and hyalinized vessel walls. Biopsy of an active ulcer will show infarction of the papillary dermis, whereas biopsy of a healed lesion will show an atrophic epidermis and dermal sclerosis. Immunofluorescence examination is non-specific in early lesions. In later lesions, immunoglobulins, routinely IgM, and C3 are deposited within the vessel walls.
