On a macroscopic level, viral pneumonia can occur through one of three mechanisms:

- Direct inoculation of viral particle into the lung (e.g., RSV or influenza)

- Spread in a contiguous fashion from viral infections near the upper respiratory tract (e.g., measles)

- Hematogenous spread from a distant viral infection (e.g., CMV)

On a microscopic level, the general pattern of viral pneumonia pathogenesis is as follows. Note that individual viral species causing pneumonia will have some variation from this scheme.

- The target cell is the pneumocyte with resultant alveolar damage.

- The submucosa of the alveoli is targeted, causing inflammation and secondary edema, microhemorrhage, and cellular immune reaction.

- The cellular reaction consists of mononuclear lymphocytes and progresses to PMNs recruitment.

- Fibrin is released.

- Both CD4 and CD8 cells are involved, beginning a cascade of immune product secretion that can end in increased vascular permeability and resultant edema.

- This process may lead to intra-alveolar organization and an obliterans clinical picture.

- The far end of the spectrum of the process includes interstitial pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and cardiogenic shock.
