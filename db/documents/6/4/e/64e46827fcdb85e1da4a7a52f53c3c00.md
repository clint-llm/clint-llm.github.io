The diagnosis of hand, foot, and mouth disease is usually made clinically. The virus can be detected in the stool for about six weeks after infection; however, shedding from the oropharynx is generally less than four weeks. Light microscopy of biopsies or scrapings of vesicles will differentiate HFMD from varicella-zoster virus and herpes simplex virus. While serology is not sensitive to making a diagnosis of HFMD, levels of IgG can be used to monitor recovery.

In some centers, serology is used to differentiate enterovirus 71 from coxsackievirus, as this has prognostic significance. Today, polymerase chain reaction assays are available in most centers to confirm the diagnosis of coxsackievirus. A swab of the lesion can detect coxsackievirus or enterovirus using real-time PCR assays.
