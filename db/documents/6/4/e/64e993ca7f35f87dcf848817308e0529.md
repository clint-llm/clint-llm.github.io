Most cases of sciatica resolve in less than 4 to 6 weeks with no long-term complications even if no medical therapy is sought. In more severe cases or cases where the neurologic deficit is present, the patient may have a more prolonged course of recovery. However, recovery is still excellent. Some studies have shown that poor occupational mechanics, psychological depression, and poor socioeconomic situations lead toÂ an increased chance of chronic, recurrent sciatica.
