Sympathectomy and ramicotomy, the procedures of disrupting the sympathetic trunk and the communicating branches, can be conducted to attenuate the effects of conditions such as hyperhidrosis. Compared to sympathectomy, which has been considered the “gold standard” for the treatment of idiopathic hyperhidrosis, the procedure of ramicotomy requires a longer operation time. It can result in broader variability in the severity of compensatory sweating.
