A commonly cited general incidence of sympathetic ophthalmia is around 0.03 per 100,000 persons per year.

Repeated inciting events, especially patients with repeated traumatic injuries, are at the greatest risk of developing sympathetic ophthalmia.

The average age of presentation for sympathetic ophthalmia is usually between 40 and 45 years of age.

The timeline for the onset of inflammation after trauma or surgery can vary from weeks to decades after the inciting event, with the most significant risk period being within one year. 50% of patients have onset of symptoms within three months, and 90% of patients within one year.
