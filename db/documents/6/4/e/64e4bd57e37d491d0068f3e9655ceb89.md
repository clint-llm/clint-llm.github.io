Common clinical presentations of carcinoid syndrome include vasodilatory effects of biologically active amines, peptides and prostaglandins (flushing, wheezing), gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, malabsorption), Pellagra (secondary to niacin deficiency), cardiac symptoms (right-sided valvular disease, mostly tricuspid regurgitation), fatigue, and sometimes cognitive impairment.

Flushing is the most common presentation and occurs in about 85% of patience with carcinoid syndrome. It is paroxysmal and is described as salmon pink to dark red discoloration of the skin of the upper body such as the face, neck, and upper trunk, lasting anywhere from 30 seconds to 30 minutes. It occurs spontaneously, but it can also be precipitated by eating, drinking alcohol, stress, liver palpation, and anesthesia. It is mostly associated with midgut neuroendocrine tumors. The patient can also have tachycardia, peri-orbital swelling, and increased lacrimation.

Diarrhea occurs in about 80% of cases. Patients usually describe diarrhea as explosive, non-bloody, and watery. It can occur up to 30 times a day. Diarrhea is usually chronic in carcinoid syndrome. Abdominal cramping may occur. Diarrhea is not always associated with flushing.

Cardiac involvement occurs in up to 60% to 70% of patients. It can cause plaque-like deposits of fibrous tissue on the endometrium, valves, chambers, pulmonary and aortic arteries. Patients may present with signs and symptoms of heart failure or valvular heart disease. It usually affects the right side of the heart, unless it is right to left shunt or the neuroendocrine tumors are in the lungs.

Bronchospasm is not very common and occurs in about 10% to 20% of patients with carcinoid syndrome. It presents as wheezing and dyspnea associated with flushing episodes. It may get worse with beta-agonists.

Due to prolonged vasodilation, purplish rash (usually on the nose, upper lip, and malar area) tends to appear at the late stage of carcinoid syndrome.

Other less common manifestations include Pellagra, muscle wasting, ureteral obstruction due to retroperitoneal fibrosis.

There are some atypical symptoms that are caused by gastric and lung neuroendocrine tumors. Gastric neuroendocrine tumors can cause patchy, well-demarcated, serpiginous, cherry red flushing with intense pruritus due to the secretion of histamine. Lung neuroendocrine tumors can cause severe and prolonged flushing, lasting hours to days, associated with anxiety, altered mental status, and tremors. It may be related to histamine release, but the exact cause is unknown.
