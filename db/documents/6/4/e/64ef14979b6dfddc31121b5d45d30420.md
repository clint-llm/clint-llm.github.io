Hypocarbia, also known as hypocapnia, is a decrease in alveolar and blood carbon dioxide (CO2) levels below the normal reference range of 35 mmHg. CO2 is a metabolic product of the many cellular processes within the body involved in the processing of lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins. The primary organ systems responsible for regulating CO2 homeostasis are the pulmonary system and the renal system. Additionally, CO2 is regulated through the CO2/HCO3 pH buffering system. Aberrations that lead to hypocarbia typically also result in respiratory alkalosis. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of hypocarbia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in educating patients with this condition about follow-up care.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the potential differential diagnoses of hypocarbia.
- Outline the pathophysiology of hypocarbia.
- Describe the management of hypocarbia.
- Explain the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding the management of patients with hypocarbia.
