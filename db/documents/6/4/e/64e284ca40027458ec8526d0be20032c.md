Lipemia retinalis is sometimes transient and resolves within hours.

**Dietary Restriction and Primary Prevention**

Strict adherence to a low-fat diet without breast milk supplementation may be effective in treating infants with severe lipemia retinalis associated with HTG.

**Medical Treatment**

No treatment is required for the lipemia retinalis itself. However, LRÂ is an important ocular sign of a life-threatening but easily treatable metabolic disorder. The treatment is to reduce the serum triglyceride levels to below 500 mg/dl. This can be accomplished by a number of medical treatments for lowering triglyceride and cholesterol. Several lipid-lowering drugs are used to treat HTG. First-line triglyceride-lowering medications include fibric acid derivatives (fibrates) and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (i.e., fish oil).

**Surgical Treatment**

Surgery is not specifically indicated for the treatment of lipemia retinalis. However, exchange transfusion has been used in the setting of severe hypertriglyceridemia to reduce triglycerides in the acute setting.
