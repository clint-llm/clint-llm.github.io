**Common Postpartum Concerns**

- **Postpartum blues:**Transient depression (baby blues) is very common during the first week after delivery.

- **Intimate partner violence:**Use HARK (humiliation, afraid, rape, kick) or HITS (hurt, insult, threaten, scream) tools to evaluate for intimate partner violence.

- **Incontinence:**Stress incontinence occurs due to extensive stretch or injury to pelvic floor muscles during labor. Risk factors for urinary incontinence three months postpartum include obesity, parity, smoking, longer duration of breastfeeding, and use of forceps during vaginal delivery. Advise women to do Kegelâ€™s exercises regularly to strengthen pelvic floor muscles.

- **Hemorrhoids:**Caused by constipation and/or by pushing during the second stage of labor.
