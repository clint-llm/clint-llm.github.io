Molluscum contagiosum lesions have classic features under a microscope. The cup-shaped indentation of the epidermis into the dermis is usually seen. The proliferated rete ridges descend downwards and encircle the dermis. The epidermis is usually thickened and there is the presence of Henderson-Paterson bodies seen within the epidermis. It is these bodies that enclose the virus particles.
