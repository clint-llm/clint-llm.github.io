A physician is obligated by professional ethics to promote public health, safety, and welfare, and to avoid the improper, unprofessional, incompetent, and unlawful practice of medicine. To provide the best standard of care in New Mexico, it is necessary to provide laws and rules controlling the granting and use of the privilege to practice medicine by establishingÂ a medical board to implement and enforce these laws and rules. By being familiar with the Federal and the New Mexico Medical Practice Act, health professionals will provide better and safer patient care while decreasing negligence claims and ethics violations under the guidance of the New Mexico Medical Board.
