The diagnosis of infective endocarditis is contingent upon positive blood cultures. Persistent bacteremia is typical of this infection. However, 5% to 10% of infections are found to be culture negative. Several factors can influence this, including prior administration of antibiotics before culture, fastidious or hard to cultures infectious organisms such as HACEK organisms or fungal infection, or poor microbiologic technique upon collection and cultures. Administration of antibiotics before culture reduces the ability to accurately culture bacteria by 35% to 40%. The selection of antibiotic therapy in culture-negative patients is very challenging. Withdrawal of antibiotics and repeating blood cultures until an organism is isolated can be a consideration. Serology for a fastidious organism such as Coxiella, Bartonella, Brucella, Mycoplasma, or Aspergillus can also be an option.

The prognosis of endocarditis depends upon infecting organism, the presence of complications, echo findings, and patient characteristics such as age or comorbidities. Acute heart failure, staph aureus infection, and penannular complications convey the highest risk of death, and early urgent surgical consultation is strongly recommended.
