Bisphosphonates are synthetic pyrophosphate analogs used to treat hypercalcemia secondary to bone resorption conditions such as malignancy, osteoporosis, multiple myeloma, Paget disease, osteosclerosis, and fibrous dysplasia. Infrequent side effects associated with bisphosphonate use include pyrexia, renal function impairment, hypocalcemia, and, more recently recognized, avascular osteonecrosis of the jaw. According to the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research, bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) is described as exposed bone in the maxillofacial region that does not heal within 8 weeks of being identified by a healthcare provider in a patient that is currently or has been on bisphosphonates who does not have a history of radiation therapy in the craniofacial region. This activity describes the evaluation and management of patients with bisphosphonate-related jaw osteonecrosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathological mechanism of action involved in bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw.
- Describe the examination and evaluation procedures necessary to diagnose bisphosphonate-related jaw necrosis.
- Summarize the various treatment strategies available for treating bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw.
- Describe risk factors associated with bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw.
