Nevus flammeus or port-wine stain is a capillary malformation usually presenting as a unilateral pink or red patch anywhere on the body of a newborn. It is a benign condition that often occurs alone and is only of cosmetic concern. However, when it is a part of a combined vascular malformation or a syndrome, the patient will require further evaluation, including radiological imaging, to confirm the diagnosis. Initiating appropriate treatment is crucial to prevent the development/ progress of any disabilities and prompt diagnosis of any anticipated complications/ visceral anomalies. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of nevus flammeus and highlights the role of an interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of nevus flammeus.
- Outline the typical clinical presentation and syndromic associations of nevus flammeus.
- Review the management options available for nevus flammeus.
- Explain the importance of interprofessional team strategies for the holistic management of patients with nevus flammeus to improve outcomes.
