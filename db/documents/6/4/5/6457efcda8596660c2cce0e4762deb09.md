The pathophysiological basis for precipitation of thyroid storm in patients with thyrotoxicosis is unclear. But, as mentioned above, a precipitating factor is always required to cause thyroid storm. Several hypotheses have been proposed. One theory suggests the incidence of thyroid storm is due to the rapid increase in thyroid hormone levels rather than the absolute hormone level that occurs during thyroid surgery, following radioactive iodine treatment, after sudden discontinuation of the antithyroid drug, or after administration of the large dose of iodine in contrast studies. The hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system with increased response to catecholamine along with an increased cellular response to thyroid hormone during acute stress or infections, causing cytokines release and altered immunological disturbances, are other possible mechanisms of thyroid storm. Most studies have failed to relate higher thyroid hormone levels as a cause of thyroid storm, except for the study by BrooksÂ and others, which reported higher free thyroid hormone among the patients with thyroid storm.

The clinical features are due to the exaggerated effects of the thyroid hormone. There is an intense metabolic activity that increases oxygen requirements. The resulting tachycardia to meet the oxygen requirements can induce heart failure and predisposes the patient to arrhythmias. Similarly, CNS symptoms include irritability, seizures, delirium, and eventually coma.
