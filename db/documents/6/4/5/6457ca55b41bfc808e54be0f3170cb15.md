Cerebral palsy overall is the most common cause of childhood disability, occurring in 1.5 to 2.5 per 1000 live births.

Dyskinetic or athetoid type cerebral palsy, which we are discussing in this article, makes up 12% to 14% of the cerebral palsy cases overall. This calculates to around 1.8 to 3.5 cases per 10000 live births for dyskinetic cerebral palsy. The least common subtype of cerebral palsy is the ataxic subtype, making up 4% to 13% of the total cases of cerebral palsy.

As mentioned previously, dyskinetic cerebral palsyÂ occurs more commonly in term infants compared to the spastic subtype, which is more common and has a higher association with preterm birth.
