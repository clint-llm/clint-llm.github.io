Rickettsia rickettsii, the most well-described and most lethal of the spotted group rickettsiae, causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF). It is a coccobacillary, obligate, intracellular organism that accidentally infects human hosts after a bite with an infected tick vector. Transmission is believed to occur very quickly after a bite from an infected tick, with a rapid entry of the bacteria into human endothelial cells.
