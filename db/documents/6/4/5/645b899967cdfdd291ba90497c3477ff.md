Vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) is an IARC group 1 carcinogen known to cause hepatic angiosarcoma (HAS) in highly exposed industrial workers. VCM is a component in the production of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resins. VCM is a halogenated hydrocarbon with acute toxic effects, as well as chronic carcinogenic effects. This activity will review the historical significance of vinyl chloride as an industrial carcinogen, the etiology of exposure, its toxicity and metabolism, acute and chronic complications of exposure, and their management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of vinyl chloride-related hepatic angiosarcoma. 
- Describe the mechanism of both acute and chronic vinyl chloride toxicity. 
- Describe the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) mandated medical monitoring for vinyl chloride exposed workers. 
- Describe the importance of an interprofessional integrated team approach in detecting, preventing, and reducing ongoing vinyl chloride exposure.
