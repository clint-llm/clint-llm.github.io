Mantle cell lymphoma is typically an uncomplicated diagnosis, but morphologic variants may mimic other lymphoid neoplasms. Having a low threshold for ordering additional testing for cyclin D 1, SOX 11 immunohistochemistry, or confirmatory FISH studies will prevent misdiagnosis. The disorder is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a hematologist-medical oncologist, internist, radiologist, radiation-oncologist, bone marrow transplant team, experienced nursing staff, and clinical trial teams. It is important to recognize the indolent form of MCL that might require monitoring with aggressive forms that require immediate systemic treatments. With the availability now of multiple second-line treatments in relapsed settings including CAR T cell treatments recognizing the complications and side effects related to these treatments can help guide the management of MCL patients effectively.
