The lack of evident defining characteristics of uremia makes data difficult to interpret. However, severe encephalopathy seems to be an uncommon phenomenon in patients with progressive CKD, as most patients will start renal replacement therapy before severe encephalopathy ensues. This may be an uncommon phenomenon in the setting of acute kidney injury, where the decline in GFR is less predictable and more rapid.

Cognitive dysfunction can occur in up to 60% of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Cognitive dysfunction is multifactorial and may be due to vascular injury, endothelial inflammation, or direct effects of the neurotoxins. The cause and effect of the relationships between neurotoxins and cognitive dysfunction are uncertain. Therefore, it is difficult to estimate the prevalence of uremic encephalopathy. In one pediatric study, uremic encephalopathy was observed in 40% of the patients with a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of more than 90 mg/dL. As this level increased, the propensity of these children to develop convulsions increased.

Uremic encephalopathy increases the morbidity and mortality of CKD patients.

No racial predilection exists. There is no link between gender and the incidence of uremic encephalopathy. Uremic encephalopathy may occur at any age.
