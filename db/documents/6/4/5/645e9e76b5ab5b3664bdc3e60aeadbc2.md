Benzodiazepines are CNS depressants specifically inhibiting respiratory drive. Therefore, careful monitoring of all vitals, especially blood pressure and respiratory rate, should be performed after the administration of benzodiazepines. In addition, waveform capnography should be considered to monitor respiratory status. Though the therapeutic index of benzodiazepines is high, monitoring respiratory depression is critical. Respiratory arrest has been noted to occur with rapid injection of benzodiazepines via the intravenous route.

Monitor for alcohol withdrawal using clinical institute withdrawal assessment-alcohol, revised (CIWA-Ar) protocol, and adjust the dose of benzodiazepines according to the score.

Monitor Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale(RASS) in patients administered benzodiazepines in mechanically ventilated patients. According to the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) guidelines, an individualized patient-centered approach should be used to prevent oversedation.

Healthcare professionals can use prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMP) to identify benzodiazepine misuse.
