The origin of syphilis has been debated for centuries. There are two hypotheses: the first one hypothesizes that syphilis was carried to Europe from America by the crew of famous sailor Christopher Columbus while the second one proposes that the disease existed in Europe since the Hippocratic era but was often misdiagnosed and went unrecognized. These two theories are referred to as the "Columbian" and "pre-Columbian" hypotheses of the origin of syphilis.

The first documentation of an outbreak of syphilis occurred in the late 15th century in Italy. Syphilis continued to spread and was rampant in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries. The disease, however, declined rapidly during the early and mid-20th century with the widespread use of antibiotics. Since early 2000, rates of syphilis have been increasing in the U.S., Australia, and Europe, primarily among men who have sex with men.

In the U.S., approximately 55,400 people are infected newly each year. It was estimated that in 2018, men accounted for approximately 86% of all cases of syphilis in the U.S.
