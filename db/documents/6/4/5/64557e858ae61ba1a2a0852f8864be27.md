On electron microscopy, it is possible to visualize vessel features that are unobservable by other means. Endothelial cells, which are difficult to visualize at lower magnifications, can be readily seen on an electron microscope as can their morphological changes to mechanical stress. These morphological change of the endothelial cells is known to occur as a response to shear stress. As the shear stress on a vessel increases, its length increases, and its width decreases.
