Management of skin irritation from topical retinoids is accomplished with reduced medication volume of application, reduced frequency, and increased emollient use. Reassurance that this side effect will improve with continued use should also be provided.

For ophthalmologic dryness, artificial tears and lubricating eye drops, such as methylcellulose containing eye drops, can be helpful.

Oral retinoid administration discontinuation, dose reduction, or addition of fish oil or a fibrate medication may be considered with a fasting triglyceride level of 800 mg/dL or higher due to an elevated risk of pancreatitis. Milder elevations may be monitored or similarly treated.

For bexarotene, concomitant use of a statin or fibrate may be considered to treat retinoid-induced hyperlipidemia and reduce pancreatitis risk

Acute retinoid toxicity is rare, but in the cases that have been documented, recovery is rapid upon cessation of medication

In patients with pseudotumor cerebri syndrome, discontinuation of the medication containing vitamin A as well as treatment with acetazolamide has been effective in reducing intracranial pressure

Acute cases may require admission with close monitoring. The hypotension needs to be managed with fluids and the hypercalcemia may require calcitonin and/or corticosteroids.
