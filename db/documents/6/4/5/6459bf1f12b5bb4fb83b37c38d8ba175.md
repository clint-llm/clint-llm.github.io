Liposarcomas arise from lipocytes found in soft tissues such as the esophagus, retroperitoneum, and popliteal fossa. The cellular subtypes of liposarcoma reflect both tumor site and relative frequency of occurrence. Retroperitoneal locations are often undifferentiated, whereas myxoid liposarcoma occurs in the lower extremities. Esophageal liposarcomas are usually well-differentiated and slow-growing with a low risk of metastasis. However, the local recurrence rate remains high (10%) even up to 25 years post-resection. This activity reviews the treatment, management, and follow-up of esophageal liposarcomas and the importance of interprofessional care coordination in treatment and follow-up.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the histological diagnosis of liposarcoma.
- Review how the type of liposarcoma has an important impact on the prognosis and outcome of the patient. 
- Summarize the diagnostic evaluation required to make the diagnosis of liposarcoma. 
- Outline an interprofessional team's role in the treatment, management, and follow-up of patients with liposarcomas.
