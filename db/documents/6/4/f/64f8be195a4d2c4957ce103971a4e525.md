Pheochromocytoma (PCC) is a rare catecholamine-secreting tumor of adrenal origin. When it is extra-adrenal, it is referred to as paraganglioma. PCC is the cause of hypertension in 1 in 500 adults. These tumors are usually diagnosed by the 4th to 5th decade and are found equally in both genders. Hereditary pheochromocytoma usually presents at a younger age. This activity outlines the clinical presentation of PCC, its pathophysiology, and diagnostic tests used to diagnose pheochromocytoma. This activity entails pre-operative optimization of patients for resection of PCC. This CME educates on detailed intra-operative management, including hemodynamic monitoring and management of possible intra-op complications. Post-operative management of patients has been discussed. In addition, a small section on the surgical approach has been described.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the etiology of pheochromocytoma.
- Describe the clinical presentations of pheochromocytoma.
- Discuss the peri-operative risk in patients with pheochromocytoma and how to decrease the peri-operative risk and improve outcomes.
- Outline the intra-operative and post-operative complications in pheochromocytoma resection and their management.
