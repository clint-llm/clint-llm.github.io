The etiology of optic nerve drusen is considered secondary to the slowing of axoplasmic flow from blood supply compromise of the optic disc. This stasis in the axoplasmic flow then leads to the accumulation of calcified and degenerated mitochondria that create a nidus for nerve drusen to form. Compromise of axoplasmic flow has been theorized to be related to various factors, including an inherited dysplasia of the optic nerve head, errors in transcellular mitophagy, and small scleral canals.
