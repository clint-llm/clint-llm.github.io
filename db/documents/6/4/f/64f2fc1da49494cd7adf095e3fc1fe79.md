Brow lifting is helpful for patients with significant brow ptosis, which can cause visual field constriction and secondary dermatochalasis. In some patients, the brow droop may be limited to the tail of the brow, resulting in temporal hooding and eyelash ptosis. Cosmetically, brows are powerful indicators of mood, and some patients will benefit from changing the shape and curve of the brow to make the face look less tired, angry, sad, or quizzical. Patients with facial palsy may have denser brow ptosis, which also interferes with vision. Finally, some patients have undergone upper lid surgery with ptosis repair or blepharoplasty but still have underlying brow ptosis, which may be exposed or exacerbated by the lifting of the eyelids.

While mid-forehead brow lifting is not commonly performed, deep forehead lines commonly encountered in men are particularly useful for the placement of incisions comparatively close to the brows, which increases the mechanical advantage of the mid-forehead brow lift compared to endoscopic or coronal approaches. In some patients, the frontal hairline can be lowered appreciably using a mid-forehead incision and appropriate back elevation. Additionally, patients with high hairlines or baldness may not be good candidates for coronal, pretrichial, or endoscopic brow lifts because of the ensuing scars; in these cases, patients may prefer a scar in a forehead crease to scars above the brows from direct brow lifting. Many patients, particularly men, may not be bothered by the idea of a transverse forehead scar, provided it is well-hidden, but it can be challenging to avoid track marks from sutures or widening of the scar postoperatively. Having a plan for postoperative skin resurfacing and scar management may provide the patient some assurance preoperatively.
