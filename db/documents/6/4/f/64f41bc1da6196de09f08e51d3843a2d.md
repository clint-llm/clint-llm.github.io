Lumbar spinal stenosis is a common source of leg and back pain. It refers to a narrowing in the vertebra, in the areas of the central canal, lateral recess or the neural foramen. When Lateral recess and neural foramen are stenosed, symptoms of lumbar radiculopathy may also be demonstrated. Despite its prevalence, currently, there is no universally accepted definition of lumbar spinal stenosis, and there is also a lack of generally accepted radiologic diagnostic criteria. Lumbar spinal stenosis is a significant cause of disability in the elderly, and it is the most significant cause of spinal surgery in patients over 65 years of age. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of lumbar spinal stenosis, and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the various etiologies of lumbar spinal stenosis.
- Identify the steps in a diagnostic workup of suspected lumbar spinal stenosis.
- Review management strategies for lumbar spinal stenosis, based on the various etiologies.
- Summarize the significance of coordination among the members of the interprofessional team in providing improved care leading to optimal outcomes for patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.
