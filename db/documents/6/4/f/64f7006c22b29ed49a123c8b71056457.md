**Malignancy**

Draining the choledochal cyst without resecting it could be harmful because it carries a very high risk of malignant transformation. Even after cyst excision, there is a chance of malignancy, which warrants long term surveillance postoperatively.

**Stricture**

Postoperative stricture formation is associated with many complications, including bile stasis, stone formation, ascending cholangitis, acute pancreatitis, mucosal chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and eventual malignancy.

**Ascending Cholangitis**

Ascending cholangitis is a very common complication of choledochal cysts due to the reflux of the pancreatic juice and enteric content into the biliary tree. Even postoperatively, the formation of a stricture at the site of anastomosis or residual debris present in dilated intrahepatic ducts could cause bile stasis, cholelithiasis, and cholangitis.

**Sludge and Stone Formation**

Sludge and stone formation can occur after surgery due to either stricture formation at the site of the anastomosis or dilated hepatic ducts with residual debris. Chijiiwa et al. reported an incidence of postoperative choledocholithiasis of 25% and hepatolithiasis of 33%.
