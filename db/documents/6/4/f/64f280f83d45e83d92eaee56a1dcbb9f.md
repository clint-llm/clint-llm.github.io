The word "auricle" translates to a structure that looks similar to an ear. Cartilage comprises the entire auricular structure of the ear. The function of the ear is to funnel in sound, and then the sound is converted into various signals in the brain. Without the ear, sounds will be less amplified and seem to have lower volume.

The ear receives the majority of its blood from a branch of the external carotid artery. The external carotid artery gives off a branch called the posterior auricular artery. The meaning of the "posterior auricular" is an area posterior to the auricular structure; this is the exactÂ territory of the posterior auricular artery's perfusion. The posterior auricular artery is also the main blood supply to the external ear.
