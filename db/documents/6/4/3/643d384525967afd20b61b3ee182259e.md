The primary evaluation of DME, classically, involves slit lamp evaluation and stereo fundus photography; however, multiple new modalities are being used and developed for the evaluation of diabetic macular edema.  Fluorescein angiography (FA) involves the injection of fluorescent dye into the bloodstream. The dye can then be used to detect fluid accumulation qualitatively. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a high-resolution imaging modality that has been used to image the retina and detect the thickness of the retina. OCT is less invasive than FA and is subsequently better tolerated. Compared to slit lamp and stereo fundus photography OCT has been more accurate in the evaluation of macular thickness and identifying the location of retinal fluid. The retinal thickness analyzer (RTA) is another imaging modality that is used for assessing retinal thickness. The RTA projects a laser slit beam onto the retina and analyzes the backscattered light with a fundus camera. RTA has been shown to illustrate similar thickness to OCT; however, OCT requires a longer image acquisition time. OCT has better image resolution and is less influenced by ocular media opacities. Both OCT and RTA play an important role in the early detection of DME, while FA is useful in analyzing DME once the diagnosis has been made.

Early treatment diabetic retinopathy study criteria for clinically significant macular edema include retinal thickening within 500 µm of the macular center, hard exudates within 500 µm of the macular center with adjacent retinal thickening, or one or more disc diameters of retinal thickening, part of which is within one disc diameter of the macular center.
