Glatiramer acetate is an immunomodulating medication used in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and a clinically isolated syndrome. The diagnosis of relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis may be challenging; however, it remains clear there are few medications proven to decrease exacerbations and may even offer neuroprotection. It is essential to consider an interprofessional approach with coordination with clinicians, mid-level practitioners, neurologists, pharmacists, insurance companies, and other health care professionals to have this medication approved and accessible to patients. Patient education is also crucial, explaining how the medication works and the expected clinical treatment course with outcomes. Nursing will be responsible for monitoring therapy as it progresses, noting any adverse events, and answering patient questions, while alerting the prescriber of any concerns. The prescriber should consult with a pharmacist, verifying dosing, interactions, and other pearls to make therapy more successful.

Glatiramer therapy is best when the administration and follow-up are through an interprofessional healthcare team that includes physicians, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all working collaboratively to monitor treatment and ensure optimal patient therapeutic outcomes. [Level 5]
