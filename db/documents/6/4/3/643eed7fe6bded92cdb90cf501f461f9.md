The main target for HIV entry into the cells is through infection of cells expressing CD4 receptor and chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4.

Infants with HIV-1 infections have higher viral loads and a faster progression to AIDS than adults with HIV.

The mechanism of in utero transmission is predicted to be by transcytosis across placental cells. The placenta may also host the virus to replicate prior to moving to the fetus.

Intrapartum transmission is predicted to be the greatest risk of vertical infections. The risk increases with longer exposure to maternal cervicovaginal secretions and blood. Research also demonstrates that the chance of infection is greater with membrane rupture of more than four hours.

Postnatal MTCT occurs during breastfeeding. The mechanism of transmission through breast milk is not fully understood, however, multiple large prospective cohort trials have demonstrated a greater risk of spread of the HIV virus with breast-feeding. In addition to breast milk, studies have also confirmed that HIV RNA can also be found in colostrum.
