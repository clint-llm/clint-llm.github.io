A major concern is RNA mutations, which can disrupt the normal functioning of RNA and cause potentially life-threatening diseases. RNA errors can be the result of defects in the ribonucleoprotein complex, RNA itself, RNA binding proteins, or any RNA assembly factors. Myotonic dystrophy is a neuromuscular disease that is caused by a CTG nucleotide repeat on the DMPK gene resulting in a pathogenic RNA gain-of-function.

The mutation rates of RNA viruses that cause various illnesses in humans are very high. It can be up to 1 million times higher than the mutation rate of their hosts

Additionally, RNA viruses can also recombine and reassort with DNA and RNA from the host or other viral strains, potentially generating a newer strain. Influenza viruses have a very high ability to reassort; for example, the H1N1 influenza strain recombined with the RNA segments from birds, humans, and pig viruses to generate the H1N1 strainÂ that caused a pandemic in 2009.
