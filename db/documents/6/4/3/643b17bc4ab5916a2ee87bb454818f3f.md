Differential diagnosis of Schatzki ring includes other causes of dysphagia, which can be extensive. Important differentials to keep in mind are eosinophilic esophagitis, reflux esophagitis, esophageal strictures other than Schatzki ring, extrinsic esophageal compression, motility disorders, and malignancy. If in combination with chest pain, then clinicians need to consider esophageal infections like candida esophagitis, pill esophagitis, radiation-induced esophagitis or stricture, or esophageal rupture, especially if the symptoms are acute.

The timing of symptoms is importantÂ if there is more progressive dysphagia of solids to eventual liquids. This is concerning for worsening obstruction, and clinicians should have a high suspicion for malignancy. With such an extensive differential, any new-onset dysphagia should be evaluated further, especially to rule out more concerning causes like malignancy.
