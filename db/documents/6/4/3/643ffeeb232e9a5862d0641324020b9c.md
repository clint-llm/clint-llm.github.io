- Consider benign and more serious conditions when evaluating a child with an antalgic gait.

- History and physical examination will guide the workup of a child with an antalgic gait.

- Laboratory studies that may be useful, especially when there is an infectious or oncologic etiology under consideration, include a CBC, ESR, CRP, creatinine kinase, and a blood culture. It is not necessary to obtain two separate blood culture sets in pediatric patients.

- Always consider the developmental abilities of a child who has a fracture as the cause of their pain. If the fracture is present in a child who is not developmentally capable of ambulation or activity that may cause such an injury, non-accidentalÂ trauma must be considered.

- Be sure to consider an abdominal or back etiology as the cause of an antalgic gait in children; extremity pathology is not always the source.

- The proper imaging technique is essential.
