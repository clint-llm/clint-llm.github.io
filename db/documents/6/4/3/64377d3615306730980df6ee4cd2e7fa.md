Symptoms that mandate an ear examination include otalgia, otorrhea, vertigo, tinnitus, aural fullness, hearing loss, and facial weakness. Careful history taking should differentiate between true vertigo (sensation of the room spinning, indicating vestibular system dysfunction) and the sensations of faintness (usually due to a pre-syncopal episode), light-headedness (a non-specific symptom), or disequilibrium due to cerebellar or gait disturbances. Patients often use the word ‘dizzy’ to describe all of these sensations, and the astute historian must elicit more specific symptom descriptions.

Less common prompts for ear examination include patients with postnasal space disease, such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, to exclude sequela resulting from an occluded Eustachian tube orifice. Patients with sustained trauma to the head and neck may have reduced consciousness, and an ear examination may be required if there is any concern regarding the lateral basal skull injury. This may be prompted by the presence of CSF otorrhoea or CT scan evidence of temporal bone fracture.

If any hearing impairment is identified during routine hearing screening (such as during the NHS Newborn Hearing Screening Program in the UK), a formal ear examination must follow.
