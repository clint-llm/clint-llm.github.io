The deficiencies or mutations in the POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR have been shown to cause hyperphagia resulting in severe childhood-onset obesity leading to multiple endocrinopathies, including adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, hypopigmentation, hypoglycemia.

Setmelanotide can bind to and activates multiple melanocortin receptors, including melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R), melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3R), and melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) selectively over melanocortin-2 receptor (MC2R) and melanocortin-5 receptor (MC5R).

Setmelanotide is a type of MC4R agonist with 20-fold less activity at the melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3R) and melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R). The MC4R can be endogenously activated by the binding of melanocyte-stimulating hormones (MSH), which are involved in responding to acute signal regulations of hunger and satiety.

The effectiveness of setmelanotide was assessed in phase 3 clinical trials in which 80% of the patients with POMC deficiency and 46% of the patients with LEPR deficiency lost at least 10% of their body weight.
