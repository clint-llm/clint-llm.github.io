**Contamination of PCR**

Conventional PCR is the gold standard for screening and detecting a wide scope of scientific areas of interest due to its promising results. Adequate handling following PCR procedure is imperative for proper assessment of amplicon.

To prevent contamination of PCR, it is crucial to have a designated area of the laboratory exclusive for PCR testing to limit unnecessary turbulence within the area.

A specific section in a freezer, that is closest to the laminar flow hood, should contain enzymes and buffers.

Automatic pipettes are known to cause contamination, thus, positive displacement pipettes should be employed for proper handling of the reagents.

Prior to using microcentrifuge tubes consisting of reagents exclusively for PCR, centrifugation is necessitated for approximately 10 seconds to allow the fluid to settle at the bottom of the tube preventing the occurrence of contamination.
