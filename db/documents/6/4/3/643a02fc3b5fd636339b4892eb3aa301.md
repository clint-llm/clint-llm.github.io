Insulin aspart regulates the metabolism of glucose. It promotes the storage and inhibits the breakdown of glucose, fat, and amino acids. Insulin lowers blood glucose by increasing peripheral glucose uptake, particularly in the skeletal muscle and fat. Insulin enhances the storage of fat (lipogenesis) and protein synthesis. Insulin aspart also inhibits gluconeogenesis (hepatic glucose production), lipolysis (breakdown of fat/lipids to fatty acids), and proteolysis (breakdown of proteins into amino acids). Maximum glucose-lowering effects are seen within 1 to 2 hours and endure for 3 to 5 hours. Insulin aspart is equipotent to regular insulin with a faster onset and shorter duration of action. Thus insulin aspart is preferred for mealtime insulin coverage as it can be administered up to every 4 hours.

Endogenous insulin is naturally produced by the pancreas, and insulin apart is manufactured through recombinant DNA technology using Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression system. Insulin aspart differs from endogenous insulin by containing aspartic acid instead of proline at position B28. Insulins as medications can be categorized as rapid-, short-, intermediate-, and long-acting depending on their pharmacologic effects, e.g., onset, peak, and duration.
