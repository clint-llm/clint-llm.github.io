The evaluation should include:

- A focused, but thorough history and physical

- A search for reversible causes

- Medication reconciliation

Very little laboratory testing or imaging is required for evaluation. Most laboratory and diagnostic tests are for ruling out harmful conditions and sequelae.

- Urinalysis should be performed on all patients to assess for urinary tract infection, glycosuria, proteinuria, hematuria.

- Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine can be performed if an obstruction is suspected, so that renal function can be assessed.

- Post-void residual volume can be done if overflow urinary incontinence is suspected.  Bladder ultrasound is performed after a patient voids. Detection of greater than 200 mL of urine remaining in the bladder after voiding is suggestive for overflow urinary incontinence.

- Renal ultrasound can be considered to assess for hydronephrosis in cases suspicious for obstruction.

- Urodynamic testing is not necessary except for complicated cases or if surgery may be considered.
