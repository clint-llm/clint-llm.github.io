Individuals who abuse substances for a chronic period develop extreme dependence on them. If the individual attempts to stop using it, their withdrawal symptoms become severe enough for the individual to restart the abuse cycle. There are predicting factors that influence the outcome for the individual; the degree of relationship between the predictor factor and the outcome varies from person to person. Some of the predicting factors include but not limited to are the degree of dependence and withdrawal, the motivation to be committed to abstinence, treatment timeframe, genetics, the severity of cravings, and how the individual copes during stressful situations.
