**Patient Confidentiality**

Similar to individual treatment, the provider or group leader in group therapy sessions are bound to the laws of confidentiality concerning patients' medical history, diagnoses, and other personal information. The other group members, however, are not bound to these same laws and face no legal consequences for sharing information from sessions. As a result, individual patient confidentiality can be difficult to maintain, especially in larger groups where leaders have less control over what information gets shared within the group.

The ability to share personal information can play a positive role in the treatment process. Some patients may feel uneasy sharing certain details for fear of who may repeat them, which can cause harm to patients' mental wellbeing as they struggle to contribute while maintaining their confidentiality. To reduce this tension, providers should adopt a set of confidentiality/sharing guidelines that the group agrees to and discuss with members the limitations of confidentiality before the first session.
