Management of patients with chronic headaches will require the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team. The interprofessional care provided to the patient must use an integrated care pathway combined with an evidence-based approach to planning and evaluating all joint activities. Primary care clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs) obtain the assistance of an internist, a neurologist, or a headache specialist if there's any doubt about the diagnosis. Nurses and psychologists can assist team management by teaching lifestyle changes, mental health supervision, drug overuse detoxification, and medication use recommendations.

Pharmacists can aid the team in checking for appropriate dosing and determining drug interactions, especially if the patient is treated for chronic migraines. Nursing must coordinate activities between the various disciplines and often serve as initial contact points for patients and other team members. All interprofessional team members must document any changes in patient status as they observe them and notify the appropriate other parties on the healthcare team so additional diagnostic and/or therapeutic measures can occur if necessary. Open communication among team members is crucial to optimal patient care.

An interprofessional team that provides an integrated approach to patient care can help achieve the best possible outcomes. Collaboration, shared decision-making, and communication are crucial for a good result. [Level 5]
