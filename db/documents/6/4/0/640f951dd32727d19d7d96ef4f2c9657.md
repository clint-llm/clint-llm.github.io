The recurrence of signs and symptoms of cardiac ischemia in a patient with a history of coronary artery disease and prior stent implantation could result from incomplete revascularization at the time of initial stent implantation, in-stent thrombosis, disease progression in other arterial territories, orÂ restenosis. Patients with incomplete revascularization usually experience residual cardiac ischemic symptoms from the time of revascularization, and it may appear as a 'geographic miss' on repeat angiography. In-stent thrombosis will present as an acute event, resulting from sudden in-stent thrombus formation and acute occlusion. The pathogenesis of neoatherosclerosis after drug-eluting stent implantation carries associations with increased risk of late in-stent thrombosis. Most patients with coronary artery disease requiring revascularization have coexisting multivessel disease at varying levels of severity.
