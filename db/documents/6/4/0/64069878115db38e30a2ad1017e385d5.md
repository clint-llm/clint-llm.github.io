Bezold's abscess is a deep neck abscess resulting from a complication of coalescent otomastoiditis. Bezold's abscess is not a common condition and is unlikely to be seen by most surgeons in their practice. However, even though rare, it has to be considered in the differential diagnosis of neck abscesses and otologic pathologies. If the diagnosis is delayed, the abscess can extend both extracranially and intracranially, causing significant morbidity.

The diagnosis of a Bezold abscess can be missed if it is simply considered to be just another neck abscess. For this reason, an interprofessional team with a systemic approach to neck abscesses is recommended. Once a neck abscess around the ear is noted, the following should be consulted:

- Radiology to obtain imaging tests to determine the origin, location, and extent of the abscess

- ENT for debridement and drainage of the abscess and mastoidectomy/tympanostomy tube placement

- Laboratory technologists to determine the type ofÂ bacterial growth

- Pharmacists to recommend the most appropriate antibiotics and manage the emesis

- Nurses to monitor vital signs and presence of altered mental status

- Neurologist to monitor the patient for neurological deficits (e.g., facial paralysis)

- Neurosurgeon if there is an intracranial extension of the abscess.

**Outcomes**

Outcomes reports of Bezold's abscess and its management are in the realm of case reports and series, owing to its rarity. There are no randomized clinical trials that have evaluated treatment or outcomes. The few isolated reports indicate that when the condition is diagnosed promptly and treated with drainage, the prognosis is good. The key is prompt drainage.
