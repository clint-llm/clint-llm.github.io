Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous group of hematologic neoplasms classically described as a clonal disorder of hematopoietic stem cells leading to dysplasia and ineffective hematopoiesis in the bone marrow. Some patients with MDS may have a transformation into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). MDS is usually diagnosed in older patients over the age of 65. Clinical manifestations include a decrease in the number of red blood cells (RBC), platelets, and white blood cells (WBC). The disease course is variable. Not all patients require treatment initially, as there is no survival benefit with the treatment of asymptomatic, low-risk patients. Treatment is reserved for symptomatic patients, such as those requiring frequent blood transfusions. Prognosis and overall survival depend upon multiple factors such as the severity of cytopenias, the percentage of blasts in the peripheral blood and bone marrow, and karyotype.
