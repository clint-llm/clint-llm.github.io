The function of the Orphan Drug Approval Law is to encourage pharmaceutical developers to increase research efforts focused on treatments for rare diseases, specifically those for which a current drug treatment does not exist. The FDA may award orphan drug approval for new molecular entities (NMEs), formerly approved drugs for which a secondary indication has been determined, and new formulations of existing or established drugs.

During market exclusivity periods, the FDA cannot award approval to any other treatments for the same disease indication, ensuring that the pharmaceutical company that developed the initial drug retains the opportunity for profit. Some critics of the ODA state that the existence of market exclusivity, while important in garnering interest on the part of pharmaceutical companies, discourages further research initiatives and provides those living with a rare condition minimal (and often costly) options for treatment.

In recent years, some parties have raised concerns about the orphan drug approval process and unfair practices of some pharmaceutical companies, including concerns regarding manipulating the approval process to maximize the individual profits of pharmaceutical companies while monopolizing the production of medications for niche, specialty markets.

The results of the investigation surrounding FDA approval of orphan drugs yielded several conclusions, the most notable of which indicated many orphan drug applications were incomplete even upon approval and lacked necessary information such as the number of individuals who might benefit from an orphan drug as well as scientific evidence of the drug's efficacy. Also noted was the concern that while the FDA was responsible for investigating each application with staunch diligence, it appeared that the organization instead trusted the information provided to them in several situations.
