Alveolar osteitis (AO), most commonly known as "dry socket," is one of the most common complications after exodontia. The incidence is most commonly reported between 0.5% and 5%, but some studies have noted it as high as 68%.

The condition is characterized by prolonged moderate to severe pain at the site of tooth extraction. This can result in multiple visits for management and symptom relief. The cause is widely believed to be the fibrinolytic theory. The extraction socket is characterized by an area of the exposed bone secondary to the absence of a fibrin clot or loss of clot after formation.

Although alveolar osteitis is a common complication, there is still some uncertainty about the pathophysiology. This has led to several proposed prevention and management strategies, but there is currently no evidence-based consensus.
