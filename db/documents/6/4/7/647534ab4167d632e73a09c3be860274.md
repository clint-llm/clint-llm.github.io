A nuclear stress test is a relatively non-invasive diagnostic procedure that involves the injection of a small quantity of radioactive tracer into the bloodstream, administered in conjunction with myocardial perfusion imaging and a stress test, which challenges the functional capacity of the heart.

One of the most commonly performed stress tests, which accompanies nuclear-based perfusion imaging, is exercise-based.

**Mechanism of Action**

Dipyridamole is a phosphodiesterase enzyme inhibitor. It indirectly increases myocardial perfusion by inhibiting the degradation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate and by blocking the cellular reuptake of endogenous adenosine. Subsequently, the concentration of circulating adenosine increases by 3- to 4-fold.
