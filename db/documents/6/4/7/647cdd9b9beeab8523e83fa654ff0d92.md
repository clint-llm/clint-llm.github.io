**Long-Term Monitoring**

Post-treatment monitoring is necessary for premature infants. Complications to monitor are periventricular leukomalacia, intraventricular hemorrhage, and developmental delay. Infants can develop chronic lung disease and need to follow a pulmonologist. Literature is unclear regarding if chronic lung disease will benefit from bronchodilator treatment.
