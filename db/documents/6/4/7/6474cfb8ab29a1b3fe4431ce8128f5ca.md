The inferior gluteal artery, a branch of the internal iliac, accompanies the inferior gluteal nerve as it innervated the gluteus maximus. The superior and inferior gluteal lymph nodes supply the gluteal region of the pelvis. These superior and inferior gluteal lymph nodes are parietal progressions of the internal iliac lymph vessels.
