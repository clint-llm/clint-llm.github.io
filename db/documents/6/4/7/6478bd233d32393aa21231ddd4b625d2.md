**Clinico-Radiological Staging of Pott Spine (Prognostic Staging)**

- I: Predestructive stage; straightening of curvature, perivertebral muscle spasm, hyperemia on scintiscan (Duration fewer than 3 months)

- II: Early destructive stage; disc space reduction and paradiscal erosion, knuckle less than 10 degrees, MRI demonstrates marrow edema, and CT shows erosions or cavitations (Duration 2 to 4 months)

- III: Mild angular kyphosis; 2 to 3 vertebrae involved and kyphosis 10 - 30 degrees (Duration 3 to 9 months)

- IV: Moderate angular kyphosis; 2 to 3 vertebrae involved and kyphosis 30 to 60 degrees (Duration 6 to 24 months)

- V: Severe angular kyphosis; more than 3 vertebrae involved and kyphosis greater than 60 degrees (Duration more than 24 months)

Early diagnosis and treatment are of utmost importance in ensuring a good outcome in Pott spine.

In general, complicated tubercular spine disease (with associated deformity, instability or neuro deficit) has a poorer prognosis as compared to an uncomplicated disease. Other important prognostic factors include age (poorer outcome in extremes of ages),

**Poor Prognostic Factors in Pott Paraplegia**

Level of disease (junctional vertebral levels), pan-vertebral involvement, long duration of neuro deficit, rapidity of progression of neuro deficit, the severity of deficit, nature of compression (abscess versus granuloma) and presence of spinal cord changes

**Poor Prognosis for Deformity Progression**

Age less than 10 years, Kyphosis angle greater than 30 degrees, three or more vertebrae involved, greater than or equal to 1.5 vertebral body loss, pan-vertebral disease, and evidence of instability
