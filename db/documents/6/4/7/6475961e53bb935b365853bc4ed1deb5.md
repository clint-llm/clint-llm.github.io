The nerves of the arm are considered a part of the peripheral nervous system. As such, they are derived primarily from neural crest cells. During embryogenesis, the upper limb derives from the developing limb bud starting at approximately 26 days after fertilization. Motor axons from the spinal cord enter the limb buds first during the fifth week of development followed shortly afterward by the sensory axons.Â  Each of these preliminary nerves is then surrounded by primordial Schwann cells derived from neural crest cells, ultimately forming the myelin sheath. As the limb buds elongate and rotate, they carry their corresponding nerves leading to the classic dermatomal pattern seen in a fully developed human.
