Performing electrodiagnostic studies in patients with fibular neuropathy have few absolute contraindications. Needle electromyography (EMG) should not be performed on patients with severe bleeding disorders. Needles should not be inserted into areas with active soft tissue infections.

Nerve conduction studies are contraindicated in patients with external cardiac defibrillators or implanted cardiac defibrillators. Before conducting electrodiagnostic studies, patients should be screened for pacemakers. It is essential that electrical stimulation not be performed directly or near the device itself.
