There are many approaches to integrating crisis intervention, and a member of the healthcare team can complete each step. First responders can triage and assess the situation and administer psychological first aid as needed to victims of a traumatic event to prevent any long-term mental health problems.

This approach allows immediate access to crisis intervention, which will facilitate care and lead to improved outcomes. In a hospital setting, the needs of a patient in crisis should be well communicated throughout the management team. As one study suggests, in times of crisis intervention, health professionals should discuss in advance and agree on a plan of care to better facilitate the recovery of the patient.

Nurses are also crucial to crisis management teams as they are at the forefront of patient care. They can notice declining mental health and promptly distribute crisis intervention resources. Crisis intervention is a technique that should be available to all healthcare professionals and requires productive communication to be an effective use of care.
