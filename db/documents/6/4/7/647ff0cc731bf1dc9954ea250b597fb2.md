Hydrocodone is one of the most common pain medications prescribed by clinicians and one of the most abused by patients. It is a relatively potent drug for moderate-to-severe pain control in postoperative patients, patients with trauma, and patients with cancer.Â The combination of hydrocodone with acetaminophen is much more efficacious than placebo in several randomized studies without any significant changes in adverse effects.
