Oral paraesthesia as a result of third molar surgery is preventable in most cases. Thorough assessment and surgical planning are important steps to minimize the possibility of inferior alveolar or lingual nerve damage. Although relatively uncommon, IAN or lingual nerve paresthesia can profoundly affect a patient's quality of life. As of yet, very few cases report complete resolution of permanent paraesthesia. As a result, good knowledge of head and neck anatomy, surgical technique, and pre-operative planning are critical to successful patient outcomes.
