Seizures may be either provoked or unprovoked. Provoked seizures, also known as acute symptomatic seizures, may result from electrolyte disorders, toxins, head injury, infectious processes, vascular anomalies, tumors or other mass lesions, and many other causes. A listing of provoked causes of seizures is lengthy and could include complications of almost any disease process. Some common causes are listed below:

- Electrolyte disturbances (hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hypernatremia, hypocalcemia, others)

- Acute toxic effects (antidepressants, sympathomimetics, others)

- Withdrawal syndromes (ethanol, benzodiazepines, others)

- Irregularity with prescribed antiepileptic medications

- Sepsis

- CNS infections

- Hypoxic brain injury

- Traumatic brain injury

- Stroke ischemic or hemorrhagic

- Neoplasm

- Inflammatory (lupus cerebritis, anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, others)

- Fever

- Sleep deprivation

Epilepsy occurs because of a predisposition to seizures from genetic susceptibility or a chronic pathologic process. By definition, unprovoked seizures occur in the absence of provocative causes or more than seven days after an acute injury or insult such as stroke or brain hemorrhage. Recurrent unprovoked seizures define epilepsy.

Of patients in United States general hospitals presenting with generalized convulsive status epilepticus, roughly one-fourth are patients with epilepsy with breakthrough seizures, medication irregularity, or new-onset epilepsy; one-fourth are patients with ethanol-related seizures, and one-half are patients with seizures that are provoked by a variety of medical conditions.
