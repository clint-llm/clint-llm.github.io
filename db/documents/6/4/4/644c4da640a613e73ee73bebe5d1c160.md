**Evolution of Surgical Strategies**

In 1939, Chamberlain first described suboccipital craniectomy, cervical laminectomy, and dural opening to manage BI. However, significant morbidity and mortality were reported following the procedure, especially by Barucha Dastur and Sinh, including the risk of intramedullary hemorrhages.

Sekir advocated the use of traction. For the few patients without any neurological disturbances, clinical and radiological preoperative traction for the progression of the disease has been described as a reasonable alternative to operative stabilization.

In 1980, Menezes et al. divided craniocervical abnormalities into reducible and irreducible groups. Posterior fixation was recommended for reducible variants. Transoral decompression was followed by posterior occipitocervical fixation for stable ventral lesions, whereas dorsal decompression with or without stabilization was carried out for dorsal pathologies. Transoral surgery, first used by Kanavel, was popularized by Crockard et al.with the application of retractor systems and a microscope for managing the BI. BI is the most common indication for Occipitocervical fixation (OCF).

The surgical strategies have slowly evolved from only bone overlay to sublaminar wire fixation and, subsequently, screw plate/rod fixation. From midline fixation strategies, now the notion has shifted to facet fixation, as described by Goel and Laheri.

A reduction via anterior transoral or posterior C1–2 facet distraction is necessary for irreducible deformity.

Ultimately, the approach should be made on a case-by-case basis after a thorough evaluation of clinical findings and radio-imagings. There has been a paradigm shift from anterior and combined anterior-posterior approaches to a stand-alone posterior surgical strategy whenever feasible.

**The aims of surgical interventions include:**

- Foramen magnum decompression,

- Restoring and stabilizing the alignment at the CVJ, and

- Restoring normal cerebrospinal fluid flow dynamics.

Traditionally, basilar invagination can be treated with cervical traction and posterior stabilization. However, anterior decompression via a transoral or endonasal approach may be necessary in irreducible cases.

Recently Endoscopic endonasal approach (EAA) has been postulated.

- Minimal stay in ventilator/earlier extubation

- Minimized need for tracheotomy

- EEA, negating prolonged tongue retraction and splitting of the soft or hard palates, reduces the risk of postoperative upper airway edema, velopalatal insufficiency, and dysphagia.

- Earlier postoperative oral feeds, and

- Reduced hospital stays.

Following EEA for BI, almost 90% of patients have shown neurologic improvement.

There is, however, a steep learning curve.

**Limitations of EEA include:**

- Limited surgical window

- A narrow surgical corridor hinders the manipulation of the surgical instruments

- Suturing, especially during primary closure following a cerebrospinal fluid leak, is very challenging

A recent study has validated the role of atlanto-axial facet distraction with fusion posterior only for the group A variant, whereas only suboccipital and foramen magnum decompression without need for duroplasty in the group B variant, even in the presence of syringomyelia.

Posterior C1-C2 distraction and fixation is a safe and effective technique for the treatment of basilar invagination.

The inter-articular cage causes a “folding chair” effect to reduce the dislocation.

Posterior decompression alone, without duroplasty, in type 2 BI releases local compression,  alleviates posterior crowding, and promotes ventricular flows.

A geometric model of the atlantoaxial dislocation and basilar invagination reduction is also developed.
