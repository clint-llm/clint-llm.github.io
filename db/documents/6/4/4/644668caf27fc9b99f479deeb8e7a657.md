Primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) is caused by Naegleria fowleri, a thermophilic, free-living ameba that lives in temperatures above 30 C and can tolerate temperatures up to 45 C. This protozoan parasite is found in the soil and freshwaters, such as ponds, lakes, rivers, streams, hot springs, and unchlorinated swimming pools. Risk factors for infection include swimming, diving, waterskiing, surfing, and exposure to hot springs. The use of tap water for nasal irrigation has also been reported as a risk factor for the disease.

Granulomatous amebic encephalitis (GAE) is a subacute to chronic infection of the CNS caused by Acanthamoeba species such as A.culbertsoni, A. polyphagia, A.castellani, A.astronyxis, A.hatchetti, A.rhysodes, A. divionensis, A.lugdunensis, A. lenticulata, and A. haely, and
B. mandrillaris. Acanthamoeba is found in soil as well as brackish water, sewage, and humidifiers.
