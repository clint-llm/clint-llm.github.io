Treatment for hemolytic transfusion reactions is mainly supportive care. Reactions can range from mild to severe. As mentioned before, the first step is always to stop the transfusion. If unsure of the diagnosis, then one should send the blood for testing as discussed previously. However, if clinical suspicion is high or symptoms are severe, e.g., hypotension, immediate resuscitation should be started. Ensure the patient has good intravenous access. Aggressive hydration is usually recommended with normal saline to maintain a urine output at least 1 ml/kg/hr. This is to reduce the likelihood of complications of free hemoglobin in the blood stream such as acute kidney injury or disseminated intravascular coagulation. Sometimes diuretics are used to achieve adequate urinary output. If the patient does have disseminated intravascularÂ coagulation (DIC), it will also need to be managed with appropriate blood products.
