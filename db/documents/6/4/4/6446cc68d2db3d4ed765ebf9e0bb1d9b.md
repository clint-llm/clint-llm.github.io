Cutis verticis gyrata (CVG), also known by the name paquidermia verticis gyrata, cutis verticis plicata, and "bulldog" scalp syndrome, is a rare benign cutaneous disorder that is characterized by convoluted folds and deep furrows of the scalp that mimic cerebral sulci and gyri. Primary non-essential cutis verticis gyrata can be associated with neuropsychiatric and ophthalmological abnormalities. This form now has the name cutis verticis gyrata-intellectual disability (CVG-ID).
