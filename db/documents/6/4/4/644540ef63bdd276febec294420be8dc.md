Ultrasound guidance may be indicated in any patient, though is typically prioritized for patients who have difficult IV access (either known previously or suspected), high-risk procedures such as internal jugular venous access, or patients who have already had failed attempts at IV access.

Patients with suspected difficult access may include IV drug users or hemodialysis patients, hypotensive/dehydrated patients, coagulopathic patients, pediatric patients, or obese/edematous patients.

The procedure may be required for imaging (use of contrast), delivery of medications/fluids/blood, or diagnostic purposes.

US guidance also can be used for arterial access for arterial blood samples for diagnostic purposes as well as lines for monitoring purposes.
