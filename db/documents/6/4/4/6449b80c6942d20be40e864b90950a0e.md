The microbiome impacts health through other mechanisms than gut permeability. Gut microbiota have also been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity through interaction with the central nervous system, inducing changes in appetite and satiety. One such mechanism is the development of leptin resistance. Leptin is a signaling protein that is made by adipose cells. As adipose tissue increases, more leptin is produced and released. Leptin acts on the central nervous system to reduce food intake. Neuropeptide Y is released from the central and peripheral nervous system, causing increased energy expenditure.

Leptin resistance in the central nervous system occurs as plasma levels increase, causing increased food intake and body weight.Bilophila wadsworthia, suggesting that this species may worsen leptin resistance. On the other hand, Bifidobacterium and other species are also associated with increased leptin sensitivity.
