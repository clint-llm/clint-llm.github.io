Phenobarbital is contraindicated in patients with known barbiturate sensitivity. Barbiturates, including phenobarbital, are contraindicated in a patient with a history/manifest or latent porphyria, liver impairment, and large doses in patients with nephritic syndrome. Phenobarbital should not be given to persons with a known history of addiction to sedative-hypnotic medicines. Injectable preparation should not be given via intraarterial or subcutaneous routes.

Phenobarbital is a cytochrome P450 inducer, so careful consideration is necessary when given concurrently with other medications. For instance, a woman with epilepsy who takes oral contraceptive pills and phenobarbital at the same time must be fully aware of the possible interaction between the medications. Phenobarbital is known to induce the liver's cytochrome p450 enzyme. The induction of this enzyme speeds up the metabolism of estrogens and progestins. Thus, a woman taking both antiepileptic medication and oral contraceptive pills can have an unexpected pregnancy due to the decreased efficacy of her oral contraceptive pills.

Patients with underlying obstructive lung disease will have an increased risk of complications.

It is imperative not to use alcohol while taking barbiturates because of the danger of severe respiratory depression when both drugs are in the patient's system. When taken simultaneously, both drugs' individual effects on GABA-A are additive, potentially resulting in a life-threatening scenario.
