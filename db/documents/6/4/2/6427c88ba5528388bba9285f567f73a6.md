There are currently several strategies in place to estimate lipolysis and these generally fall into two categories: non-activity-based methods and activity-based methods. The non-activity-based methods involve determining the quantity of the associated enzymes and regulatory proteins. The activity-based methods involve measuring the activity of the associated enzymes directly.

Over the last several years, new and updated information has come to light, and the opinions of lipolysis have changed. It is now known that the measurement of mRNA or protein expression used in the non-activity-based methods is often not enough to estimate the capacity of lipolysis. A combination of methods is necessary.
