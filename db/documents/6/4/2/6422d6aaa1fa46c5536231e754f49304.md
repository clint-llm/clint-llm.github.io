Ulnar nerve entrapment occurs most commonly in the cubital tunnel or the ulnar tunnel, i.e., Guyon's canal. At the cubital tunnel, compression between Osborne's ligament, defined as the fascia connecting the two heads of the FCU superficially and the MCL of the elbow deep, can lead to symptoms of compressive neuropathy in the forearm and hand.

In the ulnar tunnel or Guyon's canal, the zone of compression determines the physical presentation. Compression in zone 1 at the proximal end of Guyon's canal will result in a mixed motor and sensory deficit and is most likely caused by ganglia or hook of the hamate fractures. Compression in zone 2 after the bifurcation and surrounding the deep motor branch will cause an isolated motor deficit of the ulnar nerve, and as in the case of zone 1 pathology, is also most likely caused by ganglia or hook of the hamate fractures. Compression in zone 3 surrounding the superficial sensory branch of the ulnar nerve will result in an isolated sensory deficit in the distribution of the ulnar nerve in the hand and is most likely caused by an ulnar artery thrombosis or aneurysm.
