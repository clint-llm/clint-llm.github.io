As of now, no cure for multiple system atrophy exists. The combination of symptom management and emerging research of novel therapies can give affected patients hope for the future. Symptomatic management is targeted at the predominant features of how MSA or its subtypes manifest.

Midodrine and fludrocortisone have been used to treat orthostatic hypotension with physical therapy as a supplement for additional motor symptoms.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have also been explored in the treatment of MSA. A 2019 phase I/II clinical trial utilized intrathecal implantation of MSCs in 24 patients with MSA at quantities varying from 10-200 million. Derived from adipose tissue, MSCs use demonstrated a statistically significant decreased rate of disease progression.

The myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibitor verdiperstat was shown to decrease microglial activation and neuronal rescue in a mouse model of MSA. A phase 3 placebo-controlled human trial on the efficacy of verdiperstat in improving the quality of life for patients with MSA is currently underway.
