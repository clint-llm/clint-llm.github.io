# Definition/Introduction

High-risk behaviors are defined as acts that increase the risk of disease or injury, which can subsequently lead to disability, death, or social problems. The most common high-risk behaviors include violence, alcoholism, tobacco use disorder, risky sexual behaviors, and eating disorders.

# Issues of Concern

**Violence**

Interpersonal violence is the chief cause of death amongst children and young adults in the United States.

**Alcohol Use Disorder**

The American Medical Association defines alcohol use disorder as "a disease characterized by serious impairment that is directly linked to persistent and uncurbed consumption of alcohol," along with resultant harmful effects on physical health and social behavior. Consistent use of alcohol also leads to dependence, and subsequent withdrawal precipitates undesirable and harmful symptoms.

**Tobacco Use Disorder**

Tobacco use is a prevalent public health issue and is the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States.

**Risky Sexual Behaviors**

Risky sexual behaviors are defined as acts that increase the chance that a sexually active individual will contract a sexually transmitted infection, or become pregnant, or make a partner pregnant.

**Eating Disorders**

Eating disorders are a group of mental illnesses that have profound negative effects on a patient's physical and psychosocial health. They include anorexia nervosa (characterized by a fear of gaining weight, food restriction, and low body weight), bulimia nervosa (characterized by binge eating followed by purging), binge-eating disorder(compulsive overeating), pica (eating non-food items), avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (lack of interest in food), and a group of other specified feeding or eating disorders.

# Clinical Significance

**Violence**

Violence or witnessing violence can have both immediate physical and long-lasting psychiatric implications. While people who experience sexual abuse and intimate partner violence are at increased risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections like HIV, people who experience other types of violence like physical and emotional abuse and neglect are also more likely to develop risky sexual behaviors like engaging with multiple partners and not practicing safe sex.

**Alcohol Use Disorder**

Alcohol use disorder decreases an individual's life expectancy by approximately ten years.

**Tobacco Use**

Tobacco use is a major risk factor for the development of lung diseases like bronchitis, emphysema, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Smoking mediates atherosclerosis, which leads to a variety of cardiac and vascular pathologies like myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, and erectile dysfunction. Furthermore, cigarette smoke contains many carcinogens responsible for causing various cancers, particularly of the lung, mouth, larynx, esophagus, and pancreas.

**Risky Sexual Behaviors**

Unsafe sexual practices increase the risk of developing sexually transmitted infections like HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, trichomoniasis, etc.

**Eating Disorders**

Eating disorders can cause serious health problems if left untreated. Anorexia nervosa can cause cardiovascular problems like arrhythmias and hypotension, hypothermia, pancytopenia, amenorrhea, osteoporosis, hypoglycemia, hypercortisolemia, gastroparesis, constipation, xerosis, and lanugo hair. Bulimia nervosa can lead to dental erosions and gastroesophageal reflux, while binge eating disorder can cause diabetes due to obesity. Furthermore, refeeding after a period of under-nutrition can generate significant metabolic changes that can give rise to fatal consequences.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions

**Violence**

Given its serious implications, measures should exist to prevent violence and physical abuse. Primary physicians should identify risk factors for violence and offer interventions such as counseling and social worker support.

**Alcohol**

Patients with mild alcohol use disorder show a good response to alcohol-related counseling and participation in mutual-help groups. Interventions for moderate to severe alcohol use disorder include a combination of medications, psychosocial interventions, mutual help groups, and need-based social services. For medical management, naltrexone is preferable to acamprosate.

**Tobacco Use**

Treatment of tobacco use disorder is a significant public health priority. Many biological, environmental, and psychosocial factors impact their progression.

**Risky Sexual Behaviors**

Sexual health risk reduction should be a priority, and individuals, particularly adolescents and young adults, should receive education on safe sexual practices. Everyone should receive age-appropriate vaccinations that protect against sexually transmitted infections, particularly those people who are at risk. Infected patients and their partners should be thoroughly evaluated and should receive effective treatment and counseling on practicing safe sex.

**Eating Disorders**

Management of eating disorders requires a multidisciplinary team composed of a mental health expert, a general practitioner, and a nutritionist. Both anorexia and bulimia increase the risk of death; hence medical health professionals should focus on the prevention of disease.

High-risk behaviors require psychoeducation, behavioral modification, mental health, and substance abuse treatment. An array of professionals from health care and law enforcement can help notice these behaviors and assist the individuals concerned in receiving appropriate treatment. Clear and frequent interdisciplinary collaboration and communication go a long way in improving patient outcomes in individuals with high-risk behaviors.
