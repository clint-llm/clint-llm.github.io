The procedure is performed in the following steps:

- Place the ultrasound probe in a horizontal orientation over the medial aspect of the forearm just distal to the medial epicondyle

- The ulnar nerve should easily be identified as a white honeycomb-like structure deep to flexor carpi ulnaris

- Follow the ulnar nerve distally, about 3 cm to 4 cm away from the cubital tunnel

- Insert the block needle in-plane from lateral to medial, making sure to visualize the needle tip at all times

- Advance the needle tip just deep to the ulnar nerve

- Confirm that the tip is not in a vascular space by negative aspiration

- Inject 1 mL to 2 mL of local anesthetic, adjusting needle tip placement as needed

- Repeat steps six and seven until an adequate spread of local anesthesia around the nerve has been attained.

Be sure to avoid intraneural injection. If the needle tip appears to be within the nerve or if the patient complains of severe pain upon injection, stop the injection and retract the needle.
