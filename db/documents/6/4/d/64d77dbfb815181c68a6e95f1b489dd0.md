Thyroxine-binding globulin deficiency is a disorder that can often be misdiagnosed based on an inaccurate interpretation of thyroid hormone labs; this can result in inappropriate treatment of the patient. Sometimes this disorder can co-exist in patients with a history of other thyroid abnormalities, which can make lab results interpretation more complex. This activity describes the evaluation and management of thyroxine-binding globulin deficiency and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of thyroxine-binding globulin deficiency. 
- Outline the evaluation of thyroxine-binding globulin deficiency. 
- Review the treatment and management options available for thyroxine-binding globulin deficiency. 
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance thyroxine-binding globulin deficiency and improve outcomes.
