The patient will present with abdominal distension and bloating that is often a slow onset as opposed to the sudden onset usually seen with mechanical bowel obstruction. Pain is usually diffuse, persistent without peritoneal signs. Other common signs and symptoms include nausea and vomiting, as well as delayed or inability to pass flatus, and inability to tolerate oral diet. The patient is often distended and tympanic on physical exam with mild diffuse tenderness. Bowel sounds are usually sparse or absent as opposed to a mechanical obstruction where they are intensified in the early phase, although they may be absent in the late phase.
