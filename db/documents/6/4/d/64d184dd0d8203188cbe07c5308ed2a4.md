Naltrexone is an FDA-approved opioid antagonist used to treat alcohol use disorder and opioid dependence. Naltrexone blocks the effect of opioids and prevents opioid intoxication and physiologic dependence on opioid users. This medication is a mu-opioid receptor antagonist and also a weaker antagonist of the kappa and delta-opioid receptors. This activity is designed to improve the knowledge of competency of practitioners selecting naltrexone as part of the individualized approach for patients with alcohol or opioid use disorder. Naltrexone's indications, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, administration methods, significant adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, warnings, and toxicity are discussed.

**Objectives:**
- Select an individualized approach for planning therapy based on medical history and physical exam findings. 
- Interpret naloxone test results and plan care accordingly.
- Apply best practices when treating and monitoring patients with opioid or alcohol use disorders with naltrexone alone or in combination with buprenorphine. 
- Implement effective collaboration and communication among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes and treatment efficacy for patients who might benefit from naltrexone therapy.
