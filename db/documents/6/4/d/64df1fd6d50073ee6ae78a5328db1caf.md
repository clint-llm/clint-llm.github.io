Flaps, in the setting of reconstructive surgery, refer to tissue (generally including skin or mucosa) that is transferred into a defect to facilitate wound closure. They can be employed when closing wounds by second intention, primary linear closure, or when skin grafting would result in functionally or aesthetically unsatisfactory results. Transposition flaps, also called lifting flaps, recruit noncontiguous donor tissue that is incised and shifted to trade places with intact tissue in order to close a wound. Transposition flaps most commonly used in cutaneous surgery include the bilobed, rhombic, and nasolabial (melolabial) transposition flaps and z-plasties. These flaps allow the use of skin from areas of less tension and direct incision tension vectors more favorably. This activity describes the indications, contraindications, and techniques involved in using different types of transposition flaps and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients undergoing these procedures.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the techniques involved in rhombic, bilobed, nasolabial, and z-plasty transposition flap procedures.
- Describe the different types of transposition flaps.
- Identify potential complications of transposition flaps.
- Describe the importance of collaboration and coordination within the interprofessional team to facilitate the safe use of transposition flaps to minimize complications and improve patient outcomes.
