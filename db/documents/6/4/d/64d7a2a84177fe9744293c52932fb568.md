Pulmonary proteinosis is asymptomatic in one-third of the patients. In symptomatic patients, symptoms are non-specific consisting mainly ofÂ cough, dyspnea, fatigue, weight loss, hemoptysis, and chest pain. In very rare cases, patients may report an expectoration of 'chunky' gelatinous material. Physical examination is often normal. Auscultation of crackles may be a feature on chest examination, but lung auscultation is often normal because of the absence of gas movement due to the complete filling of distal airspaces.
