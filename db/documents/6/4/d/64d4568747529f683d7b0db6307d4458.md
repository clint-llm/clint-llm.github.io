A subfalcine herniation may not cause severe clinical symptoms initially. The initial presentation can be as benign as a headache. It is common to have headaches, nausea, vomiting, or altered mental status. When a patient develops a subfalcine herniation, the cingulate gyrus is forced under the falx cerebri and can compress the ipsilateral anterior cerebral artery resulting in contralateral leg weakness.

If the primary lesion becomes large enough, uncal or central herniation may develop. As the lesion grows and herniation becomes prominent, patients may develop anisocoria, a decreased level of consciousness, changes in respiratory pattern, changes in muscle tone, and abnormal motor posturing. Hypertension, bradycardia, and irregularly decreased respiration, comprising the classical Cushing triad, may be present, indicating imminent tonsillar herniation.
