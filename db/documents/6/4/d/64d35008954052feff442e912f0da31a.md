Although the posterior auricular nerve is thought to always run posteriorly to the external auditory meatus as it ascends the mastoid, a case report in a 2013 issue of British Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery by Colbert et al. demonstrated an anatomical variant in which the nerve ran anterior to the external auditory meatus.  The authors confirmed that the nerve in question was the posterior auricular nerve via intraoperative nerve stimulation during a Warthin tumor removal from the parotid gland.  They found that when the nerve in question was stimulated, there was a resultant contraction of the posterior occipitalis and auricular musculature. The authors determined that this was a previously unreported anatomical variation of the posterior auricular nerve, arguing that surgeons utilize every landmark available when considering the anatomy of the facial nerve intraoperatively.
