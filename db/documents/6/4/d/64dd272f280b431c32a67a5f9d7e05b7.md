As we advance into the 21st century, blood transfusion safety continues to improve given advances in laboratory testing of donor units; however, there will almost certainly be a non-zero risk that continues to exist given the background of bacterial contamination of blood products, viral window periods, lack of resources in developing countries, and emerging infections.

Clinicians should be aware of standard testing procedures of blood units before transfusion at their home institutions and the relative prevalence of disease to anticipate infectious complications of blood transfusions. Unrecognized TTIs may have significant morbidity and mortality associated with delayed diagnosis; careful considerations of the above entities should occur in the appropriate clinical context.
