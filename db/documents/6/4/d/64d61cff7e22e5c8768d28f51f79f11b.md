Human metapneumovirus carries a good prognosis. It does require the clinician to be attuned to a patientâ€™s underlying medical conditions as well as signs to determine the severity of infection, including dyspnea, hypoxia, and the use of accessory muscles. Typically, supportive care measures are sufficient, and patients undergo a full recovery. Reinfection can occur, demonstrating short-lived and incomplete immunity to HMPV.
