Practicing specific procedural skills is often deferred to task trainers. However, it may be appropriate to perform these training activities with manikins and/or standardized patients, especially when the training focuses on empathy and ergonomics for the skill itself.

Although uncommon, some medical schools and residency programs use SPs for invasive procedures for teaching, evaluating, and demonstrating the proper technique for female and male genitourinary (GU) examinations. These standardized patients are also known as Genital Teaching Associates or GTAs. It is the responsibility of the SP program director to ensure that these activities are performed in a clinical examination room that is appropriately equipped and under the supervision of a clinical instructor.
