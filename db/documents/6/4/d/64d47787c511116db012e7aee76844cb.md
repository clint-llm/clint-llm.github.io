All members of the interprofessional healthcare team may encounter non-odontogenic cysts in the oral cavity. It is important to note that most of these lesions are developmental in origin and have a low, if any, malignant potential. Treatment of these lesions is typically conservative surgical excision or self-monitoring. Lesions that have rapid growth, are fixed, and/or appear atypical should be referred immediately to the appropriate healthcare specialist for evaluation, biopsy, diagnosis, and management.
