The patient is instructed that the olfactory tests will measure the lowest concentration of an odor the patient can detect and how well the patient can identify and differentiate odors. Furthermore, the patient has informed the tests will most likely help identify the cause of the patientâ€™s olfactory disturbance, which in turn can lead to a specific treatment. Moreover, the patient will be educated that with some olfactory tests, an odor will not be consciously perceptible, but they will always be asked to answer, even if it is a guess.
