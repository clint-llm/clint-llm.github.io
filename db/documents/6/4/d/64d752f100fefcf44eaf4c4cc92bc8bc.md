An evaluation of a suspected case of aflatoxin toxicity can be done by measuring the aflatoxin level in food consumed by the patient or the aflatoxin metabolites in the patient's body.

Some popular methods to detect aflatoxin exposure in food and feed are:

- Thin-layer chromatography (TLC)

- High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)

- Liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LCMS)

- Enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA)

ELISA using AFB1-lysine (metabolite of AFB1) concentration in the patient blood can help detect aflatoxin.

Other techniques are used to detect levels of aflatoxin in the human body. One method is the measurement of the AFB-guanine adduct in the urine of patients.

Additionally, the assessment of liver function test include prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), albumin, bilirubin, aspartate transaminase, and alanine transaminase. Imaging the liver using ultrasonography and CT-scan may help further study liver involvement.

Other tests include the basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, and renal function, depending on patient presentation and features.
