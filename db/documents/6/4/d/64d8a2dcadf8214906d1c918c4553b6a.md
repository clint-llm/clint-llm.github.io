Diagnosis and management of patellar tendon rupture are bestÂ performed with an interprofessional team that includes therapists and orthopedic nurses. Clinicians should be aware that treatment of patellar tendon rupture depends on the integrity of the tendon. Treatment for complete patellar tendon ruptures involves surgical repair, as disability from a deficient knee extensor mechanism is high. Although not considered to be a surgical emergency, prompt surgical management of acute patella tendon ruptures is recommended to prevent the need for reconstruction. Nonsurgical treatment for patellar tendon ruptures is only indicated in those instances where the tendon tear is partial, and there is an intact knee extensor mechanism. Orthopedic specialty nursing staff can play an integral role in conservative and surgical treatment/management, monitor patient progress, coordinate medication with the pharmacist, and keep the clinicians informed of status changes.

All patients should be enrolled in rehabilitation to regain joint function and muscle strength. The outlook for most patients is excellent.
