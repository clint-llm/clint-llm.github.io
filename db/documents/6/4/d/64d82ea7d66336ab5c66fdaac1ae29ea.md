The pituitary gland, which is attached to the hypothalamus by the pituitary stalk, develops from two embryological sources known as the ectoderm diverticulum and neuroectoderm, as stated above. Adenohypophysis, or the anterior pituitary gland, develops from Rathke’s pouch, which grows superiorly from the roof of the stomodeum. Neurohypophysis, also called the posterior pituitary gland develops from the neuroectodermal layer called the infundibulum. This grows inferiorly from the floor of the diencephalon. In approximately 35 to 40 days of gestation, Rathke’s pouch transforms into a vesicle that flattens itself, surrounding the anterolateral surface of the infundibulum and eventually detaching itself from the stomodeum. The proliferation of the infundibulum diverticulum ultimately generates the cells that make up the neurohypophysis or posterior pituitary.
