Disease progression is described in three clinical phases.

- Phase 1: The painful phase. Development of diffuse and disabling shoulder pain is initially worse at night but then progresses to pain at rest. Associated with increasing stiffness. It can last from two to nine months.

- Phase 2: The frozen or adhesive phase. This period is characterized by progressive limitation in ROM in all shoulder planes but with the pain gradually becoming less pronounced. It can last from four to 12 months.

- Phase 3: The thawing or regression phase. During the recovery phase, there is a gradual return of the range of motion. It takes 12 to 24 months for the complete return of range of motion (ROM).
