The proposed common underlying mechanism among the causes of POVL is insufficient vascular perfusion to critical components of the visual pathway. In many patients, there is insufficient vascular perfusion to the essential structures of the eye itself. Insufficient vascular perfusion in the perioperative setting can be related to increased venous pressure with the subsequent development of interstitial edema. The prone position places patients at risk for decreased venous return and stroke volume secondary to increases in intra-abdominal and intra-thoracic pressure. Larger abdominal girth, as seen in obesity, can ultimately further increase central venous pressure due to increased intra-abdominal pressure.

In addition to body habitus, surgical positioning can also affect vascular perfusion to the visual pathways. The Wilson frame is used widely in lumbar spine surgery, positioning patients with the benefit of flexing the lumbosacral spine resulting in widening of the interspinous spaces, providing easier access to pathology.

Increased anesthetic time, particularly after five to six hours, leads to accumulated interstitial edema due to a prolonged decrease in venous return. POVL is also associated with higher blood loss.
