The condition known as cyclical vomiting syndrome (CVS) is characterized by recurrent episodes of intense nausea and vomiting that can last from hours to days without any functional or infectious illness. CVS was originally described in children in the late 1800s, but it is now well known that adults suffer from CVS as well. Often these patients have extensive workups over the course of months or even years. There is no specific test to diagnose CVS. Rather, it is a diagnosis of exclusion after multiple evaluations for the same recurring symptoms. Often these patients will undergo numerous tests, scans, and even surgical procedures. Significant laboratory finding are usually nonspecific, such as evidence of dehydration. There is an associated impressive economic impact with CVS to patients and caregivers. Children often miss many days of school per year. Adults often have multiple emergency department visits per year with associated time off work.
