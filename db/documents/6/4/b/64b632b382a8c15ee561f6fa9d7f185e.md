Adhesions secondary to radiation therapy are usually denser and blended with the normal tissue. The associated vasculitis makes adhesiolysis more challenging. Planes may not be easily identifiable. Injuries of normal tissue may not be tolerated well due to impaired healing of the radiated tissue.

Operating on fibrinous acute adhesions within the first 2 or 3 weeks of surgery imposes a significant risk of normal tissue distortion and multiple perforations of the gastrointestinal tract.

Adhesions secondary to malignancies typically have to be resected en-bloc, due to the high chance of local malignant invasion.
