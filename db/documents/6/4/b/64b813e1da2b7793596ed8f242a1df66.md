The TNM system helps to establish the anatomic extent of the disease, and the combination of the three factors can serve to define the overall stage of the tumor. This method allows for simplification, with cancers staged from I-IV, with stage IV being the most severe stage. Stage 0 is used to indicate carcinoma in situ, which is not considered cancerous but may become cancer in the future. Stage V is used exclusively in Wilms tumors and occurs when both kidneys have involvement at initial diagnosis.

- Stage 0 - Indicates carcinoma in situ. Tis, N0, M0.

- Stage I - Localized cancer. T1-T2, N0, M0.

- Stage II - Locally advanced cancer, early stages. T2-T4, N0, M0.

- Stage III - Locally advanced cancer, late stages. T1-T4, N1-N3, M0.

- Stage IV - Metastatic cancer. T1-T4, N1-N3, M1.

Progressive cancer staging is associated with disease severity and decreased survival rates. Anal squamous cell carcinomas demonstrated an observed 5-year survival rate of 77% for stage I and only 15% for stage IV.
