Inflammation of the urethra is most frequently due to an infectious etiology, with STIs being the most common cause. Sexually transmitted urethritis has two classifications: gonococcal urethritis (GCU) caused by infections with Neisseria gonorrhea or nongonococcal urethritis (NGU).

- **Neisseria gonorrhea**is the leading cause of urethritis.Neisseria gonorrhea is a gram-negative diplococci bacteria transmitted through sexual intercourse. The incubation period is 2-5 days. Patients are commonly co-infected with Chlamydia trachomatis.

- **Chlamydia trachomatis**is the most common nongonococcal cause of urethritis and is also transmittable through sexual intercourse.Chlamydia trachomatis is a small gram-negative obligate intracellular parasitic bacteria. The incubation period is usually 7-14 days. It is commonly co-infected with Mycoplasma genitalium and Neisseria gonorrhea.

Other infectious etiologies associated with urethritis include:

- **Mycoplasma genitalium**is a cause of recurrent or persistent urethritis and is commonly a causative agent in men with nongonococcal urethritis. This organism is small self-replicating bacteria lacking a cell wall. This organism can be difficult to detect, given its slow-growing nature.

- **Trichomonas vaginalis**, a flagellated parasitic protozoal STI, is a common infection affecting the urogenital tract of both men and women.

- **Herpes Simplex virus**, a double-stranded DNA virus, can cause a genital infection involving the urethra.

- **Adenovirus**is an uncommon cause of urethritis in men. However, it should be considered in all males presenting with dysuria, meatitis, and associated conjunctivitis or constitutional symptoms.

- **Treponema pallidum**may cause urethritis from an endourethral syphilitic chancre; uncommon.

- **Haemophilus influenzae**is an uncommon cause of urethritis transmitted through oral sex from respiratory secretions.

- **Neisseria meningitides**is a gram-negative diplococcus that colonizes the nasopharynx. Transmission of this organism is through oral sex and is a less common cause of urethritis.

- **Ureaplasma urealyticum**and**ureaplasma parvum**; some studies show ureaplasma has uncommon links to urethritis.  In patients that have tested positive, it is usually in younger men and men with fewer sexual partners.  This causative agent should be of suspicion when other identifiable etiologies of nongonococcal urethritis are absent.

- **Candida**species are a common fungal yeast that can cause infections and irritation to the urogenital tract.

Non-infectious etiologies associated with urethritis include:

- **Trauma**is less commonly the cause of urethritis. However, inflammation and irritation may occur with intermittent catheterization, after urethral instrumentation, or from foreign body insertion.

- **Irritation**of the genital area may also result in urethritis from:
- Rubbing or pressure resulting from tight clothing or sex.
- Physical activity including activities such as bicycle riding.
- Irritants including various soaps, body powders, and spermicides.
- Menopausal females with insufficient estrogen levels may develop urethritis due to the tissues of the urethra and bladder becoming thinner and dryer, causing irritation. This is a very common cause of urethritis in older women.
