With the head facing straight and the eyes facing straight ahead, the eyes are said to be in primary gaze. From this position, an action from an extraocular muscle produces a secondary or tertiary action. Although the globe can be moved about 50 degrees from the primary position, usually during normal eye movement only 15 degrees of extraocular muscle movement occurs before head movement begins. The rectus and oblique muscles are involved in the different gaze positions of the eye.

Each of the rectus and oblique muscles have a functional insertion point, which is at the closest point where the muscle first contacts the globe. This point forms a tangential line from the globe to the muscle origin and is known as the arc of contact. The common site of origin for the rectus muscles in the Annulus of Zinn is located at the orbital apex.

The levator palpebrae superioris does not contact the globe directly but instead elevates the eyelid.
