The pediatric age group is the most commonly involved in placing objects in the nasal cavities, as they are interested in exploring their bodies. It is unusual to see nasal foreign bodies in children younger than nine months of age, before developing a pincer grasp.

Children aged two to five years of age are the most likely to insert objects into their nasal cavities. The incidence is slightly higher in boys than in girls.

Unilateral foreign bodies are found on the right side twice as often as the left probably due to right-handedness.

Children with autism spectrum disorder commonly repeatedly insert foreign bodies into various orifices. They may also have multiple objects on multiple sites.

Children with younger siblings in the home are more likely to insert objects in the nose.

Repeated insertion of objects into the nose or other orifices can be associated with psychiatric illness.
