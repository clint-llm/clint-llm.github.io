When evaluating deep venous thrombosis, duplex ultrasound with segmental compression every 2 cm is the preferred modality. The patient is positioned supine with the patient's head slightly elevated to promote venous pooling. The patient's leg is externally rotated, and the knee is slightly bent (frog-leg positioning), optimizing the conspicuity of the femoral and popliteal veins. The exam should extend from the common femoral vein at the inguinal ligament to the distal calf veins (anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and peroneal veins).

Proper compression is paramount.

Only color and spectral Doppler are used at the proximal common femoral and popliteal veins since satisfactory compression is technically infeasible at these areas. At the common femoral vein, spectral Doppler evaluates for cardiac pulsatility and respiratory phasicity, which indirectly suggest patency between the common femoral vein and the heart as an occlusive disease would prevent the expected propagation of these cyclical changes. Similarly, augmentation of the calf veins by manual compression should manifest as a sharp peak in the popliteal waveform, indicating at least partial patency of the deep venous structures in the calf.

The upper extremity deep venous system can similarly undergo interrogation. The patient is positioned supine, with the patient's head rotated away from the side being evaluated to delineate the internal jugular and subclavian veins better. An infraclavicular approach often identifies the subclavian vein, while the central portion is often best seen from a supraclavicular approach. The arm is externally rotated and repositioned as needed to assess the arm veins. In areas where compression is not feasible due to overlying bony prominences such as the subclavian vein, the patient can be asked to take a sniff of air or Valsalva. The vein is watched in real-time during the maneuver to ensure a proper venous response (venous collapse during inspiration or sniffing and enlargement during Valsalva). It is helpful to distinguish between acute venous thrombosis and chronic postthrombotic change. Acute thrombus manifests as hypoechoic or anechoic material within the vessel lumen.

After an acute episode, the vein may completely heal and appear normal or scar down. Over time, the thrombus becomes more echogenic and adherent to the wall.

Several technical and interpretative errors require monitoring: lack of adequate compression, mislabeling of the venous structures by the sonographer, and incorrect ultrasound gain and color settings. While color flow is often absent in acute thrombus, flow can be seen in a partially occlusive or recanalized thrombus. Further, slow flow can appear as mobile low-level echoes that could be mistaken for thrombosis.

When evaluating venous insufficiency, an attempt is made to recreate the conditions contributing to venous insufficiency. The patient, if able to, is asked to stand with weight over the leg not being evaluated. The patient is asked to relax the musculature in the leg of interest. The knees are in slight flexion. The greater saphenous vein is best evaluated by first finding the saphenofemoral junction.

Average measurements are up to 5 mm for the greater saphenous and up to 3 mm for the smaller saphenous veins.

The saphenofemoral junction is assessed for reflux in longitudinal and short-axis views. The first competent valve can be identified by asking the patient to perform a Valsalva maneuver. The increased intraabdominal pressure will cause reflux past any damaged or incompetent valves. Each vein is then evaluated with color Doppler while sequential compression and relaxation are applied to a more peripheral segment. This can be performed manually or with a sequentially inflated and deflated blood pressure cuff. For example, one could position an automatic blood pressure cuff distal to the vein segment being interrogated, inflate the cuff to 80 mmHg, wait 4 seconds, and then deflate the cuff. The duration of reversed color flow after relaxation is measured. Pulsed Doppler helps quantify the reflux time and volume. Any reflux or reversed flow lasting longer than 0.5 seconds in the superficial system or 1.0 seconds in the deep system is considered clinically significant.

When monitoring for progression, it is essential to keep any confounding factors to a minimum and perform the exam with similar positioning, reflux-eliciting maneuver, and time of day.
