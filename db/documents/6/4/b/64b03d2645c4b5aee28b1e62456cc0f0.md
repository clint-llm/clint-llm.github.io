- Masses found in the anterior mediastinum should warrant tumor factor studies (AFP, B-hCG, LDH)

- Early recognition and treatment initiation can lead to better outcomes.

- Benign teratomas have a low propensity for malignant transformation and do not respond well to chemotherapy. Surgical resection is only recommended if they are symptomatic due to mass effect.

- Mediastinal non-seminomatous germ cell tumors are more common than mediastinal seminomatousÂ germ cell tumors.

- Non-teratoma non-seminomatous variants have the worst prognosis and require chemotherapy, followed by surgical resection.

- Relapses can occur after therapy, and second-line chemotherapy results in very low cure rates.
