Headaches and chronic pain are amongst the leading cause of morbidity and years lived with disability in the world.

Hypnic headache (HH) is a rare headache syndrome that occurs exclusively during sleep, usually at the same time at night. It also has been named before the clockwise headache or alarm clock headache. It is considered a primary headache, according to the international classification of headache disorders.

HH is characterized by attacks of dull headaches that occur after the age of 50 years, at least 15 times per month, and come only during sleep with no associated autonomic symptoms.Â The attacks wake the patient during sleep and usually last more than 15 minutes after waking.

Hypnic headache is a chronic disorder that can last for years, with no remission of headache.

Patients with migraines and hypertension are more likely to develop HH compared to others. Nearly all patients with HH had some type of motor activity, such as getting out of bed and eating, drinking, showering, or reading when awakened by the headache attack. Still, they did not typically have the restlessness that is seen with cluster headache and trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias.
