Fluphenazine is a typical antipsychotic used for the symptomatic management of psychosis in patients with schizophrenia. There is a long-acting fluphenazine decanoate formulation used primarily as maintenance therapy for chronic schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders in patients who do not tolerate oral formulations or in patients where medication compliance is a concern of the provider. It is a first-generation antipsychotic. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, dosing, significant adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of fluphenazine, so providers can direct patient therapy to optimize outcomes in patient management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of fluphenazine.
- Identify the indications, both approved and off-label, for fluphenazine.
- Outline the adverse event profile and necessary monitoring for therapy with fluphenazine.
