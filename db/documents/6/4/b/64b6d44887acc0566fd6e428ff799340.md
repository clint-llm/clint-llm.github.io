Prognosis depends on the patient's resulting condition. Many of the manifestations caused by hypothalamic dysfunctions are treatable, in particular, hormone deficiency or overproduction. In patients with a hormone deficiency, hormone replacement therapy is the primary treatment. In cases such as Prader-Willi syndrome, the resulting obesity caused by presumed dysfunction in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, treatment requires an interdisciplinary approach to control the patient's hunger and appetite bursts.
