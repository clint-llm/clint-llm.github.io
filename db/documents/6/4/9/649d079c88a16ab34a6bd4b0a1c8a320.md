Second impact syndrome (SIS), also known as repetitive head injury syndrome, describes a condition in which individual experiences a second head injury before complete recovery from an initial head injury. It is thought that athletes who sustain a concussion and return to their sport early are at particularly high risk. Though it is a relatively rare condition, clinicians should be aware of SIS and educate patients who have experienced or are at risk of experiencing a head injury, as the syndrome is often deadly. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of second impact syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the risks associated with second impact syndrome. 
- Identify the risk factors for second impact syndrome.
- Review the controversy surrounding the proposed mechanism of injury in second impact syndrome.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by second impact syndrome.
