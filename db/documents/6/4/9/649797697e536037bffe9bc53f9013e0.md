Keloids are benign raised scars that are formed after cutaneous insult. Normally, cutaneous injury results in wound closure and a flat scar. Some individuals are prone to alterations in the healing process that result in excessive tissue proliferation and excess collagen in the skin during the healing process and the formation of a keloid. The keloid can appear months years after the cutaneous insult and can continue to grow indefinitely. This activity details the evaluation and treatment of keloids and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management and education of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiology of keloid formation.
- Outline the rates of keloid recurrence after steroid injections versus after surgery alone versus after surgery followed by radiation.
- Describe the optimal radiation treatment plan for treating keloids after surgical resection.

- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients being treated for keloid scar removal.
