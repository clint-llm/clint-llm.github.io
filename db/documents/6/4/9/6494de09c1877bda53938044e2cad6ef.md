**Posterior Approach to the Hip Joint**

The gluteus maximus muscle is involved in many surgical approaches that affect the joints around the muscle.

**Other Approaches to the Hip Joint**

The anterolateral approach to the hip mainly involves retracting muscles such as the gluteus medius and tensor fascia lata to access the anterior capsule of the hip joint. During dislocation of the femoral head from the acetabulum, the fibers of the gluteus maximus are incised to gain greater access to the joint.

The posterior approach to the sacroiliac joint also involves the gluteus maximus. This specific approach allows for open reduction and internal fixation of disruptions of the sacroiliac joint. Although this approach is not used widely due to percutaneous screw fixation techniques, it becomes an important procedure if appropriate imaging is not needed.

The first step of this approach is to expose the gluteus maximus via an incision along the iliac crest. The muscle is detached from its origin on the ilium and reflected downward and laterally. Two structures at risk of injury in this approach are the inferior gluteal nerve and the inferior gluteal artery. Both neurovascular structures penetrate the gluteus maximus and are imperative for its function. Therefore, careful inferior mobilization of the muscle is warranted.

The gluteus maximus is also important during the posterior approach to the acetabulum. Much like the posterior approach to the iliac crest, this approach also involves retracting the gluteus maximus. However, when the muscle is exposed, the muscle is retracted superiorly by removing the insertion point on the proximal femur.

**Uses of the Gluteus Maximus During Reconstructive Surgery**

The gluteus maximus also plays an important role in reconstructive surgery, particularly when creating myocutaneous flaps to treat ischial and sacral ulcers. This allows for a simple procedure that provides adequate thickness to cover bony prominences and the lesion.

The gluteus maximus can be used when addressing surgical complications, particularly after hip arthroplasty. Indications for using the gluteus maximus advancement flap procedure include persistent wound breakdown due to infection leading to soft tissue deficiency, aseptic pseudotumor, and abductor insufficiency with recurrent hip instability. Results for patients that underwent this procedure correlated with no repeat infection or hip instability.

Arthroscopy is also important in the treatment of gluteus maximus dysfunction. For example, post-operative arthroscopic results for the treatment of femoroacetabular impingement have shown an improvement in the function and contraction of the gluteus maximus.
