During residency training, anesthesiologists have traditionally learned how to place DLTs and BBs on surgical patients under the direction and supervision of experienced faculty. However, more recently, simulators have become available for training in advanced airway techniques, including FOB and the placement of DLTs and BBs, such that trainees may have the opportunities to hone their skills outside the high-stakes environment of the operating room.

Because inexperienced practitioners attempting lung isolation with either a DLT or BB have increased rates of device malposition and complications, it has been suggested that a deliberate practice model be utilized to augment initial training and maintain expertise. A recent study showed that novices could acquire DLT and BB placement proficiency on a mannequin with 90 minutes of training using either video didactics or a simulator. The authors also found that proficiency declined two months after training, emphasizing the importance of continued practice in maintaining lung isolation airway skills.
