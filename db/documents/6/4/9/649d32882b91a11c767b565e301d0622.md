When combined with an accurately identified murmur, a patient history can provide critical details that lead to diagnosis

In addition to patient history, obtaining a detailed cardiovascular physical examination is paramount in identifying a murmur and its associated disease

Murmurs are critical physical examination findings in many patients. Many diseases have associated murmurs

The skill of accurately describing a murmur is just as important as gathering a patientâ€™s history. For example, the ability to accurately report whether a murmur is heard in systole or diastole in a healthy-appearing child is essential. The difference will determine whether or not to refer the patient to a pediatric cardiologist for further evaluation.
