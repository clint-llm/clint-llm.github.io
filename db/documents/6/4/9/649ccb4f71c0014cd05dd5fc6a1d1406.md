Low renin hypertension can be classified as follows:

- Low renin with low aldosterone

- Low renin with normal aldosterone

- Low renin with elevated aldosterone

Liddle syndrome is classified under low renin with low aldosterone. Others causes of hypertension which are classified under low renin with low aldosterone are as follows:

- Apparent mineralocorticoid excess

- An 11-beta-hydroxyl deficiency

- A 17-alpha-hydroxyl deficiency

- Gordons syndrome

- Mineralocorticoid receptor activation mutation

- Glucocorticoid resistance

- Ectopic ACTH

- Licorice use

Mineralocorticoid excess is an autosomal recessive syndrome due to 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 enzyme deficiency. This enzyme converts cortisol (active) into cortisone (inactive) form and this inactive form is unable to bind to the mineralocorticoid receptor.

Gordon syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition due to a gene mutation responsible for ion transport in the kidney which results in increased reabsorption of sodium and decreased excretion of potassium.
