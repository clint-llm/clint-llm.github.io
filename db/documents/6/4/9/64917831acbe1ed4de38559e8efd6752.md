No known contraindications exist, except for hypersensitivity to fludeoxyglucose or its formulation components. Caution related to radiopharmaceutical handling- Minimizing the overall dose of radiation to staff and other hospital patients requires specially covered facilities and a carefully designed workflow to confirm that the staff is not in contact with patients who have received an FDG for a more extended period than required. Similarly, ‘hot waiting rooms’ room facilities can separate FDG PET/CT patients from other hospital patients.
