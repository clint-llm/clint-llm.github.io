Rh immunoglobulins (RhIVIG), introduced about five decades ago, have proven to be extremely effective as a main prophylactic treatment in Rh-incompatibility. After this invention in the year 1968, a significant decline in the incidence of Rh-hemolytic disease has been observed along with a two-thirds decline in the mortality rate in nationwide surveillance.

Phototherapy can be used to treat jaundice. However, the use of a high dose of IVIG has significantly reduced the duration of phototherapy treatment.

Exchange transfusion is another effective therapy after phototherapy to treat neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, thus decreasing the chances of the infant developing kernicterus.

In-utero blood transfusion depends on the anemic severity of the fetus, which can be estimated precisely antenatally by PSV of middle cerebral artery Doppler, which has a sensitivity and specificity in predicting any degree of anemia of 88.46% and 98.27% respectively.
