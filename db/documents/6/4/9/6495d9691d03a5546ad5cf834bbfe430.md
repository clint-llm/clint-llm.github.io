Follicular adenoma is grossly described as a solitary, encapsulated nodule; the size can be extremely variable, ranging from a few millimeters to 10-15 cm. The color vary from tan to light brown with solid and fleshy appearance. It can resemble multinodular goiter due to secondary changes in hemorrhage and cystic degeneration.

Histological examination of the nodule reveals a follicular architecture present in the entire or nearly entire lesion

The two key characteristics that make the follicular lesion malignant is the evidence of capsular invasion and angioinvasion. There is much debate about the extent to which tumor cells need to invade the capsule to determine it's malignant potential.
