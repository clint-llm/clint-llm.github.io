The remainder of the objective patient assessment should include an examination of a patient’s vital signs to evaluate for fever or other abnormalities suggesting a systemic illness. Laboratory evaluation should include assessment of the white blood cell count. Other inflammatory markers, such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein test (CRP) can be collected to assess the systemic inflammatory response. It certain instances, it may be helpful to evaluate the CRP serially as a marker of the acute phase reaction, in order to monitor the patient’s response to therapy.

If they are determined to be clinically indicated, standard radiographs or other advanced imaging modalities may be used for diagnosis or therapy. Radiographs can be assessed for osteolysis or periosteal reaction if osteomyelitis is suspected.
