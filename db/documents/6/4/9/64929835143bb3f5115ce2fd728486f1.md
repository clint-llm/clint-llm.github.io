**Intrinsic Muscles Palsy**

Ulnar nerve dysfunction is the leading cause of intrinsic muscle palsy. Ulnar nerve injuries are divided into low and high injuries.

Low ulnar nerve injuries are those distal to the motor branch of flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor digitorum profundus. The sensibility of the volar aspect of the fifth and fourth fingers of the hand is impaired. The sensibility of the dorsal aspect of these fingers is also lost if the injury occurs proximal to the dorsal ulnar sensory nerve. The paralysis affects all interosseous muscles, two ulnar lumbricals, hypothenar muscles, adductor pollicis, and the deep head of flexor pollicis brevis.

Loss of intrinsic muscle contraction results in impairment of the MCP joint flexion and interphalangeal joint extension, leading to an MCP hyperextension and interphalangeal joints flexion of the fourth and fifth fingers (Duchenne sign). This posture is known as the intrinsic minus or claw posture. It has also been referred to as the benediction sign, which is more evident when the patient is asked to extend the fingers.

Intrinsic weakness leads to a 60% to 80% loss of pinch and grip strength. Performing a pinch with the thumb pulp to second finger pulp leads to excessive flexor pollicis longus contraction in these patients (excessive thumb interphalangeal flexion) due to weakness of the adductor pollicis (Froment sign). Thumb´s MCP joint presents hyperextension if there is an MCP joint laxity (Jeanne´s sign). The second finger presents proximal interphalangeal joint hyperflexion (>90°) because of the first interosseous muscle weakness; this has been referred to as the Mannerfelt sign.

Another sign of interosseous weakness is the Andre-Thomas sign, which is the tendency of a patient to adopt a wrist flexing position by increasing the pull on the extensor digitorum communis to gain better MCP extension. However, this posture increases MCP extension and ultimately worsens the deformity.

**Median Nerve Injuries**

Median nerve injuries are also referred to as high and low injuries. High median nerve affects volar extrinsic muscles, resulting in supination and ulnar deviation posture of the hand. The median nerve also innervates a small group of intrinsic hand muscles, which are: superficial head of flexor pollicis brevis, abductor pollicis brevis, opponens pollicis, and two radial lumbricals. Paralysis of this group of muscles leads to a weak flexion of the MCP joints with the innervated ulnar interosseous muscles. The second finger, third finger, and thumb´s interphalangeal joints cannot flex because of the paralysis of the flexor digitorum profundus and flexor digitorum superficialis. The thumb opposition is impaired, and the thumb lies in the same plane as metacarpals because of the paralysis of the abductor pollicis brevis and opponens pollicis. This characteristic posture is known as the benediction sign, which is exacerbated when the patient is asked to make a fist.

Low median nerve injury preserves the extrinsic muscle function. Thus, when the patient is asked to make a fist, the second and third fingers lag behind the ring and Little fingers due to lack of flexion at the MCP joints. However, the thumb also lies in the plane of the palm, and its opposition is impaired.

**Intrinsic Contractures of the Hand**

The intrinsic muscles of the hand flex the MCP joints and extend the interphalangeal (IP) joints. When there are normal muscle tone and adequate balance between intrinsic and extrinsic musculature, the explorer can passively extend the patient's MCP joints and simultaneously passively flex the proximal interphalangeal joint without any resistance or limitation in the movement. This maneuver is called the “intrinsic tightness test,” which was first described by Sterling Bunnell in 1948.
