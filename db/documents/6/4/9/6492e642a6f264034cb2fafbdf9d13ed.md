The most common source of DSN entrapment is a hypertrophied middle scalene muscle.  DSN compression/entrapment neuropathy can present with a spectrum of clinical conditions:

- Pain

- Muscle spasms/tightness (involving the levator and/or rhomboids)

- Midscapular dysesthesia

- In the chronic setting, scapular winging secondary to atrophic changes and muscle denervation

Having a stable scapula aids the entire upper extremity by being a solid base to pull against during functional activities such as raising the arm overhead. Normal functioning rhomboid muscles play a significant role in the securing the scapula. Several studies have found that a weakened rhomboid frequently results in slight scapular winging and inability to firmly hold the scapula. A common source of rhomboid paralysis comes as a result of dorsal scapular nerve entrapment. A lesion of the dorsal scapular nerve has most frequently been localized to an entrapment associated within the middle scalene muscle. A myofascial scapular pain syndrome is a frequent finding in the patient with dorsal scapular nerve pathology. These cases are frequently incorrectly diagnosed and present with pain on the medial border of the scapula and the possibility of radiating pain to the lateral arm and forearm. The lack of a sensory distribution associated with the dorsal scapular nerve contributes to the difficulty in associating the interscapular pain with this motor nerve.
