Treatment is directed to treat the underlying cause of nephrocalcinosis. Strategies to reduce the urinary concentration of calcium, phosphate, or oxalate are used. Fluid intake is increased to produce at least 2 Liters of urine a day.

Among patients with hypercalciuria, urinary calcium excretion can be reduced by restricting the amount of animal protein, decreasing the sodium intake to less than 100 milliequivalents /day, increasing the potassium intake, and using a thiazide diuretic to reduce the urinary calcium excretion. However, patients with hypercalcemia should not use a thiazide diuretic.

In nephrocalcinosis due to distal renal tubular acidosis, potassium citrate is used in patients with hypocitraturia and pH less than 7. This not only replenishes the potassium loss but also achieves a normal urinary citrate level, thereby increasing the solubility of calcium.
