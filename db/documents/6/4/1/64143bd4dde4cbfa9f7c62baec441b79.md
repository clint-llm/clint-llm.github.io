Breasts and nipples are an inherent part of the definition of feminity, in addition to functioning to allow breastfeeding. Nipple inversion can not only be functionally deterring to a patient but can have a huge impact on their confidence and self-perception. This can affect pre-teens, teenagers, and adults for varying reasons. Children will quickly realize their nipple(s) look different than their peers', and may become victims of bullying. As children mature and become sexually active adults, significant effects on intimacy can develop. Some patients are aware of, but not at all bothered by this condition. It is, therefore, important to determine the underlying motivations for a patient presenting for nipple correction. Are these the wishes of the patient, or is the patient feeling external pressure to undergo correction that they otherwise would not have taught is a question that should be addressed?
