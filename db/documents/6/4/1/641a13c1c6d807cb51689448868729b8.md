Intraventricular meningiomas show similar characteristics to those found in the extra-axial space. Their cells of origin are the same; however, extra-axial meningiomas are derived from the arachnoid cap cells, naturally occurring near venous sinuses and dural edges. Intraventricular meningiomas originate from the choroid plexus' stroma and arise at the tela choroidea. Here, arachnoid cells are found secondary to the embryologic origin of the choroid plexus. Most meningiomas are considered to be benign World Health Organization (WHO) grade I, slow-growing lesions. However, some may progress to atypical or anaplastic histopathological types.
