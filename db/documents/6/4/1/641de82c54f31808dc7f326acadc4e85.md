For the individual patient, the lowest effective dose and shortest duration are recommended for initial treatment. Sulindac is available as 150 mg and 200 mg oral tablets. The maximum recommended daily dose is 400 mg. Sulindac is recommended to take with food or milk to decrease GI side effects in adults and pediatric patients. Healthcare providers should carefully consider the potential risk to the benefit of sulindac and other relevant treatment options before determining to use the sulindac therapy option.

**Osteoarthritis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, and Ankylosing Spondylitis**

The initial recommended dose of sulindac is 150 mg twice a day. This dose can be increased or decreased based on the individual patient's response. The dose can be increased up to 400 mg daily. Half of the patient population may expect a prompt response within one week of treatment; other patients may require prolonged treatment.

**Acute Supraspinatus Tendinitis/ Subacromial Bursitis (Acute Painful Shoulder)**

The initial recommended dose of sulindac is 200 mg twice a day. This dose can be increased or decreased based on the individual patient's response. The dose can be increased up to 400 mg daily. An adequate response may be achieved from 7 to 14 days of therapy.

**Acute Gouty Arthritis**

The initial recommended dose of sulindac is 200 mg twice a day. This dose can be increased or decreased based on the individual patient's response. The dose can be increased up to 400 mg daily. An adequate response may be achieved within seven days of therapy.

**Specific Patient Population**

**Pregnancy Considerations**

NSAID treatment during pregnancy can lead to lower amniotic fluid and may cause complications like impaired lung maturation and limb contractures in newly born babies. However, if a healthcare provider likes to use NSAIDs during the 20 and 28 weeks of pregnancy, they should consider using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Using sulindac can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and fetal renal dysfunction, and, in some cases, neonatal renal impairment. Therefore, FDA recommends avoiding sulindac use at about 30 weeks of gestation and later in pregnancy.

**Breastfeeding Women**

It is unknown if sulindac is present in breast milk. Some NSAID agents with established safety data and short half-lives are considered compatible with lactating patients to treat rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases. Due to some potential side effects of sulindac in the breastfeeding infant, the manufacturer recommends discontinuing treatment or breastfeeding based on risk-benefit assessments.

**Hepatic Impairment**

Use sulindac with caution and monitor treatment closely in patients with hepatic impairment. Reduction of dose may be needed due to extensive metabolism in the liver.

**Renal Impairment**

Patients with impaired renal function should be used medication with caution and monitor treatment closely. Reduction of dose may be needed in patients with advanced renal disease.

- eGFR 30-60 mL/minute/1.73m: Discontinue the treatment temporarily in patients with acute kidney diseases.

- eGFR LT 30 mL/minute/1.73m: Avoid treatment.
