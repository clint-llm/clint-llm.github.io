The most common adverse reactions of salmeterol (incidence â‰¥3%) in asthmatics include upper respiratory infection or inflammation, oral candidiasis, pharyngitis, bronchitis, dysphonia, headaches, cough, nausea, and vomiting. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the most common adverse effects include pneumonia, throat irritation, viral respiratory infections, oral candidiasis, dysphonia, headaches, and musculoskeletal pains.

Immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur. Patients may present with urticaria, rash, angioedema, bronchospasm, headache, tremor, or anaphylaxis.

More severe adverse effects associated with salmeterol overdose are characterized by excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation to the heart. Although salmeterol is a highly selective beta-2 agonist, it still exhibits some beta-1 effects and can cause cardiac effects.

These symptoms include angina, tachycardia, hypertension, hypotension, arrhythmia, palpitation, and fatigue. These undesirable pharmacologic effects are predominantly a result of reflex activation in response to peripheral vasodilation, hypoxemia, hypokalemia, and direct stimulation of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors.

Paradoxical bronchospasm, laryngeal spasm, and throat swelling can occur. In COPD patients, long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) have been shown to increase the risk of cardiac failure.
