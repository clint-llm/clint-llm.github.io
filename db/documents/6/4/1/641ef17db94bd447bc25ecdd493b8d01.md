A good visual outcome is usually achieved with early diagnosis and prompt treatment. Untreated, long-standing inflammation has a poor prognosis for many reasons, including corneal edema, endothelial damage due to uveitis, rubeosis iridis, glaucoma, cystoid macular edema, vitreous traction bands, retinal vasculitis, and even phthisis.

Advanced cataracts may be challenging to operate by phacoemulsification due to the hardness of the nucleus, lax zonules, and friable capsules of the lens. Secondary glaucoma may persist after cataract extraction needing medical and sometimes surgical management.
