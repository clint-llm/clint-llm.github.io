Sotalol toxicity is inherent due to its mechanisms of action as both a potassium channel blocker and a non-cardioselective beta-blocker and mirrors its adverse effect profile. The most obvious and potentially problematic sign of toxicity is concentration-related QTc prolongation. If QTc is over 500 msec during initiation, the sotalol dose should be reduced or discontinued. If QTc exceeds 520 msec during the maintenance phase of dosing, the clinician should either reduce the dose or discontinue sotalol.

In addition, therapeutic measures may be required according to the manufacturer's labeling in case of massive overdose. Patients with bradycardia or cardiac asystole atropine or transvenous cardiac pacing are required. In addition, the bronchospasm associated with beta blockage requires higher than normal beta-2-agonist doses. Management of Torsade de Pointes is DC cardioversion, transvenous cardiac pacing, epinephrine, and magnesium sulfate. Hemodialysis can reduce sotalol plasma concentrations as sotalol does not bind to plasma protein. Due to the risk of TdP and asystole, patients should be closely monitored until QT intervals are normalized, and the heart rate is more than 50 bpm. A recent study evaluated the drug-specific risk of SQTP (Severe QT prolongation) after an acute drug overdose. Sotalol was one of the most common drugs implicated in acute drug overdoses related to SQTP.
