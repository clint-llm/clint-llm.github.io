Managing hATRR with inotersen therapy requires qualified healthcare practitioners workingÂ as a coordinated interprofessional healthcare team to provide optimal patient care. Healthcare providers should also be cognizant of potential risks of inotersen use, especially in populations with pre-existing conditions such as those patients with renal or liver dysfunction. Inotersen should not be used in patients with a platelet count below 100 x 10^9/L, history of glomerulonephritis with previous inotersen use, or history of hypersensitivity reactions to inotersen.

Additionally, patients should be assessed prior to treatment to ensure that eGFR, UPCR, AST, and bilirubin are within appropriate ranges. Further, close monitoring of platelet count, serum creatinine, eGFR, urinalysis, UPCR, ALT, AST, and total bilirubin is recommended during and up to 8 weeks after therapy to ensure patient safety. Healthcare providers must work in unison to communicate these salient concerns to prevent adverse reactions and poor healthcare outcomes.

Inotersen appears to be a relatively safe drug with a low toxicity profile, which can be used to manage polyneuropathy in patients with hATTR. When used properly, inotersen can effectively and safely manage patients suffering from the neuropathic manifestations of hATTR for at least five years.
