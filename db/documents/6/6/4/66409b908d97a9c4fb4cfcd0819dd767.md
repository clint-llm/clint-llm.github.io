Access to the cerebral ventricular system is one of the important approaches in neurosurgery.

**Ventriculostomy**

Ventriculostomy is one of the most common procedures in neurosurgery. It involves creating a hole in the ventricles for CSF drainage and monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP). It is also referred to by the term external ventricular drain (EVD). The commonest entry point on the skull is Kocher's point which is 11 cm posterior to the glabella and 3 to 4 cm lateral to the midline. This allows entry into the frontal horn of the lateral ventricle.

**Ventricular Shunting**

This is another procedure in which CSF is diverted to other body compartments like the peritoneal cavity (ventriculoperitoneal shunt), right atrium (ventriculoatrial shunt), pleural space (ventriculopleural shunt).

**Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy**

This is a modern surgical method performed endoscopically where an incision is made on the floor of the third ventricle to drain the CSF directly into the basal cisterns.
