The prostate is located in the pelvic cavity inferior to the urinary bladder surrounding the prostatic urethra. The gland comprises an apex resting on the urogenital diaphragm, a base attached to the bladder neck, and inferolateral surfaces resting on the levator ani facia above the urogenital diaphragm.

Anatomically, it is divided into two lateral (right and left) and one median lobe. Histologically, it has a central zone (CZ) comprising 25% of the prostatic mass that forms the base; a peripheral zone (PZ) surrounding the central part constituting 25% of the prostatic mass; and a transition zone(TZ) that surrounds the anterolateral portion of the urethra in a horseshoe-like fashion. It is essential to know these histological zones because 70% of the adenocarcinomas arise from the peripheral zone while 20% from the transition zone. Only 10% of adenocarcinomas arise from the central zone. Prostatitis more often occurs in the central zone. Benign prostatic hyperplasia typically expands the transitional zone creating adenoma.
