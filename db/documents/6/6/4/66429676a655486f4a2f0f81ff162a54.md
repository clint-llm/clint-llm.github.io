Some consider the adductor pollicis to be a member of the thenar eminence. This muscle consists of an oblique and transverse head. The oblique head originates from the capitate and the bases of metacarpals two and three.

The transverse head originates from the base of metacarpal three. The two heads combine and travel laterally to insert onto the base of the proximal phalanx of the thumb. It is supplied by the deep palmar arch and is innervated by the ulnar nerve. It functions to adduct the thumb and also assists in producing the movement of opposition.
