For thymic NETs, surveillance guidelines have not been established, and current recommendations are based on expert consensus. The North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network have released guidelines for post-treatment surveillance.Â There are no evidence-based guidelines for post-treatment surveillance, and the optimal post-treatment surveillance strategy is not established. Both societies recommend close follow up starting at 3 months post-resection, including a physical examination and cross-sectional imaging. The monitoring of tumor markers might be useful if they were initially elevated. Long-term surveillance is recommended for up to 10 years, given a high incidence of recurrence.
