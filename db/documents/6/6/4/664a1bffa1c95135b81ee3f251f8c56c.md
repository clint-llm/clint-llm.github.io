Scalp lacerations are traumatic injuries. It is essential to instruct patients to stay away or at least be careful when performing high-risk activities, especially given that injuries to the head and face can be severe with long-lasting morbidity.

After wound closure, it is essential to educate patients on how to deal with staples or sutures if they have them and schedule a proper follow-up to remove these sutures/staples. General instructions on keeping the wound clean and preventing contamination are also essential to avoid unnecessary and preventable infections of the injury.
