This activity reviews the presurgical cardiac risk assessment and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in optimizing presurgical fitness and management of patients and enhancing postsurgical outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify risk factors for perioperative adverse cardiac events. 
- Summarize preoperative cardiac risk using the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association algorithm.
- Outline situations when elective surgeries should be delayed.
- Explain the importance of the interprofessional team in communicating with patients with cardiac disease to optimize presurgical fitness and in turn enhance postsurgical outcomes.
