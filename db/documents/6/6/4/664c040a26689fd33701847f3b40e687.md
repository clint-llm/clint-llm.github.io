The flexor hallucis longus is located towards the fibular aspect of the lower limb. The fibers of the flexor hallucis longus run obliquely inferiorly and posteriorly, passing through the tarsal tunnel on the medial aspect of the foot. The distal end of the flexor hallucis longus muscle is composed primarily of the tendon. This tendon runs inferiorly to the sustentaculum tali of the calcaneus, where it is stabilized by the annular ligament, traversing through the sole of the foot in-between the two heads of the flexor hallucis brevis muscle, continuing to the base of the great toe’s distal phalanx. The tendon passes through the grooves of the talus and the calcaneus, where it is connected to the flexor digitorum longus by a fibrous slip.

Much like the other deep posterior compartment muscles of the leg, the flexor hallucis longus muscle assists with plantar flexion and inversion of the foot. The unique function of the flexor hallucis longus is the ability to flex the great toe through plantar flexion of the talocrural joint and the metatarsophalangeal and interphalangeal joints of the great toe while also aiding in supinating the ankle.
