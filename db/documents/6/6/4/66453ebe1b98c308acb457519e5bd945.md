Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) is autoimmune diabetes that begins in adulthood and does not need insulin for glycemic control at least in the first six months after diagnosis. It shares genetic, immunologic, and metabolic features with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). This activity reviews the management of latent autoimmune diabetes and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the epidemiology of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA).
- Describe the advances in the pathophysiology of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults.
- Review the evaluation and management of latent autoimmune diabetes of adults.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for adult patients with latent autoimmune diabetes.
