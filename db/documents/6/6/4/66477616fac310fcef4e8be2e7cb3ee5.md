**Adult Acquired Flatfoot Deformity**

Adult acquired flatfoot deformity (AAFD) most commonly results from a posterior tibial tendon dysfunction. This failure of the posterior tibial tendon leads to an inversion of the rearfoot that blocks the Chopart joint during the middle and late phases of the gait. Therefore, the triceps surae force of contraction inserts mainly on the talonavicular joint instead of the metatarsal heads. This condition causes the head of the talus to repeatedly act on the spring ligament that results in the lengthening of the ligament, and eventually generates the AAFD. Several potential causes that lead to a dysfunction of the posterior tibial tendon include acute trauma, impingement, compression by flexor retinaculum, an accessory of the navicular bone, hypovascularization of the tendon, arthritis, chronic mechanical load, and corticosteroid injection.

**Navicular Fracture**

While midfoot fractures are considered an uncommon injury, navicular stress fracture represents one-third of all stress fractures in the human body. Navicular fracture commonly happens as a consequence of either an acute traumatic injury or chronic overuse, due to high functional demands. It has a higher incidence in young individuals and athletes due to their repetitive high-force activities that make them susceptible to high-energy trauma and also musculoskeletal overuse. The Sangeorzan classification has been in wide use since its publication in 1989, for a grading system of navicular fracture. Patients with navicular fractures typically experienced pain in the midfoot area that could be associated with an inflammatory process. The navicular stress fracture could mostly be managed nonsurgically by immobilization and protected weight-bearing for a six to eight weeks period. However, in an athlete with a high functioning demand, operative intervention to repair by open reduction and internal fixation become a beneficial option. On the other hand, traumatic navicular fracture typically requires surgical intervention, especially if a displaced navicular body fracture occurred. Conservative treatment using a short-leg cast could become an option if the traumatic fracture is undisplaced or in the form of a small avulsion fracture.

**Kohler Disease**

Kohler disease is avascular necrosis (osteonecrosis) of the navicular bone that occurs in young children most commonly within 4 to 7 years old. This condition occurs more commonly in boys and can appear bilaterally. The navicular bone is the last bone in the foot to ossify, which occurs around the third year of life; therefore, the increasing weight of the child makes the navicular bone susceptible to compression by the talus and cuneiform bones during activity. The lack of vascularization in the central third portion of the navicular increases the vulnerability to this disease. Radiology examination often shows sclerosis, fragmentation, or flattening of the navicular bone. Since Kohler disease is a self-limiting condition, surgical intervention is rarely necessary. Anti-inflammatory medication and immobilization with a short leg walking cast often bring satisfying clinical outcomes.

**Mueller-Weiss Syndrome**

Mueller-Weiss syndrome (MWS), also known as Brailsford disease, is a rare disease that refers to a multifactorial spontaneous tarsal navicular osteonecrosis. Differ from Kohler disease pathology, MWS occurs in adults with the highest prevalence between 40 to 60 years of age. It is more common in women and frequently bilateral. Despite being idiopathic, some theories support the pathogenesis of MWS, including osteochondrosis, trauma, biomechanic alteration, migration of the accessory cuboid, dysplasia, and also congenital causes. The pathogenesis of MWS is considered multifactorial and related to a chronic overload to the lateral aspect of the navicular bone that is suboptimal ossified. Plain radiograph examination shows a comma-shaped deformity of the navicular bone, caused by the collapse on the lateral aspect. Non-operative treatment such as anti-inflammatory medications, orthotics, and immobilization by short-leg cast, should be attempted before considering surgical intervention. If symptoms persist after conservative treatment, then surgery may be indicated to relieve pain and to restore the plantar and medial longitudinal arch. Talonaviculocuneiform arthrodesis with bone grafting often gives a satisfying result. Other surgical procedures include the percutaneous core decompression of the navicular bone, isolated talonavicular arthrodesis, and also triple arthrodesis (fusion of the subtalar, talonavicular, and calcaneocuboid joints).
