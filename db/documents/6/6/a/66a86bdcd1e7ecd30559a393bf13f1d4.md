Understanding the anatomy of the thigh can assist the physician in identifying pathology during a physical exam. As part of the comprehensive history and physical examination, understanding specific muscle functions and actions aids the clinician in identifying and differentiating isolated/focal injuries from more widespread or systemic conditions. The latter ranges from peripheral nerve entrapment, spinal conditions and pathologies (i.e., radiculopathy with associated nerve root compression), and medically relevant medical conditions (i.e., genetic conditions, diabetes, neuropathy, or inflammatory conditions).
