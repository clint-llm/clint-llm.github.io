The frontal bone in an adult is an unpaired bone that is a part of the boney structure that forms the anterior and superior portions of the skull.  At the beginning of life, it is a bone separated by a temporary suture called the frontal suture. It then transforms into a singular front bone, absent the suture in most cases.  Throughout life, it plays a vital role in protecting important neural structures and forms the superior aspect of the orbit.  Frontal bone fractures occur in roughly 5% to 15% of all facial fractures.
