The management of the anemia of CKD is complex because it is not a simple matter of giving patients more blood transfusions or erythropoietin. Both these products have serious adverse effects when given chronically. One should never assume that anemia of renal disease is solely due to a lack of erythropoietin; it may be due to poor nutrition or chronic illness- so a thorough workup is essential to determine the cause.

Managing patients on dialysis with anemia requires an integrated approach by an interprofessional team consisting of the nephrologist, PCP including the nurse practitioner, physician assistant, physician, nursing, pharmacy, and occasionally also a hematologist may be necessary to help achieve the best possible outcomes. The dialysis nurse should monitor vital signs and obtain total blood counts to determine the level of anemia. In addition, pharmacists should educate the patient about the importance of iron supplements because, without iron, many patients develop resistance to erythropoietin.

Further, anemia of renal disease is also associated with adverse cardiac outcomes, so the patient's cardiopulmonary status has to be monitored for life.

Finally, a nutritionist's involvement is essential for avoiding and/or treating the deficiency of vitamins that can exacerbate the anemia of kidney disease.

**Outcomes**

The outcomes for patients with anemia of renal disease are guarded. Many develop adverse cardiac events that lead to a high mortality rate. Too much iron from blood transfusions also affects outcomes. Finally, chronic use of erythropoietin has been associated with severe hypertension, stroke, and heart failure. An interprofessional team approach will maximize positive outcomes and minimize adverse events. [Level 5]
