In recent years, atypical antipsychotics or second-generation antipsychotics have become the drugs of choice for acute psychoses. They are “atypical” as they are differentiated from “conventional” or first-generation antipsychotics based on their clinical profile. They have fewer side effects regarding extrapyramidal symptoms when compared to typical antipsychotics. Atypical antipsychotics have transformed the treatment of psychoses as they are prescribed for acute psychoses and in the management of schizophrenia, affective disorders (depression and mania), and geriatric agitation. They are becoming the treatment of choice for patients during their first psychotic break and indicated through their lifetime.
