In healthy individuals, the symptomatology of chromium deficiency has not been well identified. It has been mainly identified in patients on total parenteral nutrition with malnutrition and malabsorption.

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) provides insight into the dietary intake of individuals around the United States of America. Chromium has not been included as an item of measurement. Chromium was also not listed as an item of measurement on the World Health Organization's Vitamin and Mineral Nutrition Information System.

There have been multiple case studies reporting patients on long-term parenteral nutrition who suffered from new-onset metabolic and neuropathic derangements, which were relieved by the supplementation of chromium via their parenteral nutrition. Since the recommendation of the American Medical Association to supplement adequate amounts of chromium in parenteral nutrition solutions in the 1980s, there have been fewer published reports regarding the issue of chromium deficiency.
