A treadmill stress test is generally considered safe, and its complications are rare. However, the following are the possible complications of a treadmill stress test:

- Hypotension can happen during or immediately after exercise, potentially causing the patient to feel dizzy.

- Arrhythmias that occur during treadmill stress testing generallyÂ stop soon after the termination of the test.

- Although very rare, treadmill stress testing could possibly cause a myocardial infarction.

Patients should be instructed not to eat, drink, or smoke for at least three hours before the examination, as this maximizes exercise capacity. The patient should bring comfortable exercise clothing and walking shoes to the testing facility. The healthcare professional performing the test should explain the benefits, risks, and possible complications to the patient before testing.

Medications should be discussed with the patient beforehand, as some drugs such as beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, digoxin, and anti-arrhythmic medications can affect the maximal heart rate achieved. An ischemic response can also be affected if patients are taking nitrates. A thorough history and physical examination should be performed on all patients before referral for exercise stress testing.
