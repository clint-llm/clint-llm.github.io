Ocular tuberculosis is a rare extrapulmonary manifestation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Clinical symptoms primarily occur from hematogenous dissemination from the lungs to the uveal tract. Ocular tuberculosis is a great imitator of ocular pathologies and therefore requires a high index of suspicion before making the diagnosis. This activity reviews the fundoscopic signs most closely associated with ocular tuberculosis and the management of these lesions. It highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and administering treatment, specifically in human immunodeficiency virus-infected persons, as these individuals are disproportionately affected by M. tuberculosis.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the most common affected tissues of the eye.
- Describe the characteristic fundoscopic findings and be able to differentiate them from similarly appearing diseases.
- Describe the workup required to make a definitive or presumptive diagnosis of ocular tuberculosis.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care to patients affected by paradoxical worsening of symptoms after treatment initiation.
