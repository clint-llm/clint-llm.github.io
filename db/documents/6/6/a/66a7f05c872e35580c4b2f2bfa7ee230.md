Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is a surgical technique used for the treatment of osteoarthritis in one compartment of the knee, most commonly in the medial compartment. In contrast, a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is used for the treatment of osteoarthritis in all three compartments of the knee. UKA was first introduced in the 1970s. This activity reviews the indications for UKA and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with osteoarthritis.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.
- Review the contraindications for unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.
- Summarize the clinical relevance of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients undergoing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.
