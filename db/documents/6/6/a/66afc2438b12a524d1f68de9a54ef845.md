The pathophysiology of psychogenic polydipsia is poorly understood. In patients who drink large amounts of water, the kidneys compensate by excreting water up to a maximum of 12 L/day.

Anticholinergic effects of medications can cause an increased sensation of thirst. In psychogenic polydipsia, improper functioning of the dopaminergic and cholinergic system has been implicated, which results in dysregulation of the thirst center along with the involvement of the hippocampal region, leading to this behavior of constant drinking.

Many factors can influence the thirst center as well as the secretion of AVP. An increase in serum osmolality stimulates the secretion of AVP. Nausea, vomiting, hypotension, sepsis, exercise, and hypoglycemia can increase AVP secretion as well.

Dipsogenic polydipsia can be seen in patients who are affected by these processes of the hypothalamus. Habitual polydipsia or compulsory water drinking is present in people who have a constant motivation to drink excessive amounts of fluids, thereby resulting in a lower thirst threshold over time.
