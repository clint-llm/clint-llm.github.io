Patients with internuclear ophthalmoplegia report symptoms of varying severity. Some patients may report blurry vision or diplopia or dizziness on lateral gaze. Surprisingly, some patients may complain of vertical diplopia. Vertical diplopia in the primary position is due to skew deviation of eyes with the weak adducting eye being hypertrophic. Skew deviation is a vertical misalignment of eyes caused by asymmetrical disruption of supranuclear input from the otolithic organs of the inner ear.

The hallmark of internuclear ophthalmoplegia is impaired adduction in the eye ipsilateral to the affected medial longitudinal fasciculus, which can range from mild limitation to severe restriction of adduction. There is nystagmus in the abducting eye associated with this, which usually lasts for a few beats.

- A lesion involving the paramedian pontine reticular formation (horizontal gaze center) and the medial longitudinal fasciculus produces “one and a half syndrome.” This syndrome is characterized by the loss of all horizontal movements except abduction in the contralateral eye.

- Unilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia may be accompanied by vertical strabismus due to skew deviation or associated trochlear nerve palsy.

- Wall-eyed bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia (WEBINO) is a rare disorder in which bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia is associated with bilateral exotropia.
