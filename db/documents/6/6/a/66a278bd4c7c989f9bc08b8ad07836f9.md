When caring for patients suffering from bedbug bites, as with many other arthropod infestations, care providers may become reluctant to have contact with the patients. This comes from the misconception that skin-to-skin contact can easily spread the bedbug infestation. For an infestation to spread, bedbugs must transfer from the places where they nest to a new host. In hospital settings, bedbug infestations occur from a colony in a patient's clothing or personal articles. Hospitals control infestations with relative ease through the cleaning process that hospital linens undergo and the fact that potentially infested bedding can be easily removed and treated.
