A full history and physical exam are necessary.  Most cases of femoral pseudoaneurysm are iatrogenic.  Physical exam findings of a pulsatile mass in the groin carries a 92% sensitivity and 93% specificity in the diagnosis of a femoral pseudoaneurysm.

Visceral pseudoaneurysms can present with signs of bleeding and abdominal pain.  CT angiography or conventional angiography can help characterize the lesion.

The diagnosis of aortic pseudoaneurysms is most commonly via CTA or conventional arteriography. They may have a history of previous open repair of dissection or aneurysm, blunt or penetrating trauma, infection, or genetic disorders which predispose to aneurysmal degeneration of the aorta such as Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.
