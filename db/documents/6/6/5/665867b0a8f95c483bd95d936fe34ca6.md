Since gestational age is best determined in the first trimester, and particularly around week 7 of gestational age, these measurements must be documented for other providers and healthcare workers on the interprofessional team for use in the further care of the patient as the pregnancy progresses, to achieve optimal outcomes for both mother and child.

Point-of-care ultrasound is often utilized for this determination, and an ideal method of sharing the sonographer's finding is a transmission of the images to the patient's medical record as well as a procedure note with a detailed report of the findings.

Interprofessional healthcare team members need to communicate and coordinate activities to ensure proper follow-up or emergent consultation if there is a concern for an ectopic pregnancy.
