Famciclovir is a prodrug antiviral agent. It is modified by esterase and an oxidase, which converts it into its active antiviral agent penciclovir. Famciclovir is the diacetyl 6-deoxy analog of penciclovir. Famciclovir is used for the treatment of acute herpes zoster (shingles) caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and herpes labialis (cold sores) caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) in immunocompetent patients. Also, famciclovir is used to treat initial and recurrent genital herpes simplex virus episodes in immunocompetent and HIV-infected patients. Also, it is an agent for the treatment of genital HSV chronic suppressive therapy. There is also evidence that famciclovir may lower hepatitis B viral DNA levels in patients when used as a long-term treatment.

Famciclovir was introduced as a drug to increase patient compliance and ease in treating their zoster infections as it only needed to be taken three times daily as opposed to previously used medications.
