Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection of the cervix is a sexually transmitted disease and a significant risk factor for the development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.  However, only a relatively small percentage of women with the infection will develop severe CIN or invasive cervical cancer. Several factors determine whether the infection will progress to CIN or carcinoma, the greatest of which is the HPV genotype causing the infection. Although there are approximately 100 subtypes of HPV,  a small subgroup has a known association with cervical dysplasia and carcinoma.  HPV subtypes are considered either oncogenic or non-oncogenic.  Persistence of the virus in tissues is another critical factor in the development of CIN and ultimately, carcinoma.

HPV 16 is the most carcinogenic and accounts for 55 to 60% of cervical cancers worldwide. HPV 18 is the second most carcinogenic and accounts for 10 to 15% of cervical cancer. Risk factors such as smoking, immunocompromised state, or HIV infection likely lead to persistence of HPV infection and an increased risk for the development of CIN.

Although the terminology is changing, cytologic abnormalities on Pap smear are typically described as "squamous intraepithelial lesions" and further classified as "low-grade" or "high-grade."
