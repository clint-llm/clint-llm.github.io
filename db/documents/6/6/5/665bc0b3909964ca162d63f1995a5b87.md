An electroencephalogram (EEG) is an essential tool that studies the brain's electrical activity. Despite the development of more advanced imaging techniques, EEG remains the essential paraclinical tool for seizure evaluation. It is primarily used to assess seizures and conditions that may mimic seizures. It is also useful to classify seizure types, assess comatose patients in the intensive care unit, and evaluate encephalopathies, among other indications. The electrical properties of the brain were first discovered by an English scientist, Richard Caton, in 1875, and about 50 years later, the first human EEG was recorded by the German psychiatrist, Hans Berger.
