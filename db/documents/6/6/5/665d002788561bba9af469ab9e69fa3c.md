High-pressure injection injuries of the hand occur when the hand comes into contact with the nozzle of a high-pressure injecting system such as a paint gun or air compressor. The material injected can traverse from the hand to the forearm and upper arm. This injury commonly occurs in male construction workers. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of high-pressure injection injuries and highlights the importance of an interprofessional approach to reducing morbidity.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of high-pressure injection injuries of the hand.
- Describe the evaluation of high-pressure injection injuries of the hand.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for high-pressure injection injuries of the hand.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes for patients affected by high-pressure injection injuries of the hand.
