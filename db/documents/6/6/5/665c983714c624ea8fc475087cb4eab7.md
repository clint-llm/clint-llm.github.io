Improper placement of a splint may cause complications due to the straps or parts of the rigid structure of the splint causing local injuries. Once immobilization has been achieved, continually test distal circulation, sensation, and motor. Perform frequent interval reevaluation of the neurovascular status as changes often occur in the acute phase of the injury as swelling increases. Complications most commonly occur in relation to one of these areas.

Swelling may also cause local and distal complications, and the patient should be frequently evaluated for compartment syndrome.

Transfemoral/transtibial pins may have a localized infection or bleeding. Routine pin site care should address these to prevent these potential complications.
