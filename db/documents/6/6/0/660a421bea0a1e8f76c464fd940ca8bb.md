Gallstone ileus occurs in 0.3% to 0.5% of all patients with gallstones and is one of the rarest causes of gallstone ileus, occurring in about less than 0.1% of all mechanical obstruction cases and 1% to 4% of non-strangulating mechanical small bowel obstructions. Despite 350 years of medical advances, mortality remains high, ranging from 12% to 27%, partially because of non-specific symptoms, unremarkable biochemical investigations, high misdiagnosis rate, and delayed discovery.
