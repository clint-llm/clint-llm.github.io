Isolated systolic hypertension is common in the elderly population. SBP has a better prediction for the risk of cardiovascular disease as compared to DBP. Hence, treatment of isolated systolic hypertension is beneficial to reduce all-cause mortality and cardiovascular risk, and stroke. The optimal SBP remained unclear, but an SBP goal of less than 140 mmHg and keeping DBP at 70 mmHg or higher are considered appropriate in most patient populations.
