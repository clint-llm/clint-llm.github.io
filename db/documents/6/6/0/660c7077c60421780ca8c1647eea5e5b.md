Ear development is complex, with tissues originating from the neural crest as well as endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm layers to form the inner, middle, and external ear.

Importantly, the stapedial artery also arises from the second branchial arch, and if it degenerates too early, microtia can result. Ultimately, these six hillocks fuse to form the auricle by 22 gestational weeks of age. The auricle develops to 85% of adult size by the age of 5 years and is fully developed by age 8. This early development is why some surgeons will elect to perform microtia reconstruction in very young patients, particularly if they are not using autologous rib grafting.

While microtia may occur in isolation, it is sometimes associated with genetic craniofacial syndromes such as Goldenhar, Treacher Collins, Nager, Crouzon, and CHARGE syndromes, Pierre-Robin sequence, and others.
