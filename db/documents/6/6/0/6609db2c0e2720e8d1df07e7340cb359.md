Contraindications to total laryngectomy include the presence of a surgically unresectable tumor, distant metastases, a condition resulting in high anesthetic risk, a tumorÂ encasing the common or internal carotid artery, or a tumor invading the profound parts of the tongue. While tumors invading the profound parts of the tongue are technically resectable, such procedures are rarely performed except in extreme circumstances; procedure-associated morbidity is high.
