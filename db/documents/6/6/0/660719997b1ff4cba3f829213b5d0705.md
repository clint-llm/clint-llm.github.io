Intense pulsed light treatment sessions are relatively safe and tolerable. However, it may be beneficial to avoid IPL in certain individuals, such as those with a recent sunburn and in pregnant or breastfeeding women. IPL has also been found to induce reactivation of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) on the face or genitals via transient hyperthermia and activate latent HSV in the trigeminal ganglion.
