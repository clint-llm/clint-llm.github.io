Memantine is an uncompetitive antagonist of the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors in the CNS. Alzheimer disease is believed to be caused by overstimulation of glutamate, the primary excitatory amino acid in the CNS, resulting in excitotoxicity and neuronal degeneration. The NMDA receptor is a voltage-gated cation channel that in the physiologic unstimulated state is blocked by magnesium ions. Stimulated magnesium is displaced allowing calcium influx and activation. In AlzheimerÂ disease, there is pathologic overstimulation of the receptor causing it to be in a chronically active state. Memantine helps to counteract the excessive stimulation.

Memantine also exhibits antagonist activity at the serotonergic type 3 (5-HT3) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. It has no activity at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), benzodiazepine, dopamine, adrenergic, histamine, or glycine receptors or for voltage-dependent calcium, sodium, or potassium channels.
