The life expectancy in pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis remains very poor. Most patients who present with signs & symptoms of pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis will be having an underlying history of malignancy though occasionally, the initial presentation of occult malignancy could be pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis. In a patient coming to the hospital, which is already diagnosed to have a malignancy with pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis, pulmonary and critical care, as well as an oncology consult, is a must for further evaluation and coordination of the management.

Few patients might get benefit from intensive care (on a case to case basis), including a trial of non-invasive ventilation and/or mechanical ventilation if the respiratory failure is presumably precipitated by a potentially treatable or reversible causes like an infection or pulmonary embolism. Infectious disease consult could be obtained in difficult to diagnose cases. Occasionally the patient may present with signs & symptoms of pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis without a history of underlying malignancy. Here again, extensive evaluation needs to carried out by pulmonologists to reach a definite diagnosis of the lung pathology, and the oncologists need to evaluate for a potential neoplastic primary.

A palliative care consult is routinely advised once the cytology/histopathology of pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis is confirmed or a presumptive diagnosis of pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis has been made because of an advanced non-treatable underlying malignancy with the patient being unfit to undergo a safe diagnostic procedure to ascertain the lung pathology. PsychologicÂ or psychiatric counseling is recommended to help the patient & family to cope up with news of very advanced malignancy.
