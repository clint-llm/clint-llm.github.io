A fistula is generally defined as an abnormal or surgically made passage from one epithelialized surface to another. Therefore, in a pancreatic fistula, there is an abnormal connection between the pancreatic ductal epithelium and another epithelium surface. This communication between the epithelized surfaces can lead to an enzyme-rich pancreatic fluid to leak.

Internal pancreatic fistula is when the pancreatic duct is disrupted, resulting in communication with the peritoneal or pleural cavities. External pancreatic fistula, which is also known as pancreaticocutaneous fistula, is the communication of the pancreatic duct with the skin leading to drainage of pancreatic fluid.
