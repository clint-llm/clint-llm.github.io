A behavior plan should not be started if it cannot be appropriately executed with consistency and longevity. Often, shaping, which is reinforcing and rewarding behavior as it approaches the desired behavior, is needed before the desired behavior is fully reached. Perfection cannot be the expectation from a behavior plan. Mistakes and setbacks are common when a change in behavior is expected, so consistency and patience are important from the caretakers and the clinician. If a behavior plan is only partially enforced, then this can lead to worsening behavior.
