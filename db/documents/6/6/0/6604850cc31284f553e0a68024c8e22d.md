As discussed above, Wellens syndrome is the result of critical stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery manifesting in characteristic ECG changes. It is a pre-infarction state. However, if not recognized early and properly treated, the disease tends to progress to a large acute anterior wall myocardial infarction, which can lead to substantial morbidity and mortality. Therefore it is important for clinicians to recognize Wellens pattern early.
