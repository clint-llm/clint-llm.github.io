Antiseptics are chemical agents applied to the skin to reduce the microbial count and reduce the risk of surgical site infections (SSIs). SSIs are defined as an infection occurring at the surgical site within 30 days of the procedure and represent one of the most common complications of dermatologic surgery. Broad-spectrum antiseptics generally cover more pathogens and subsequently are some of the most popular in dermatologic surgery. Antiseptic agents in dermatologic surgery commonly include chlorhexidine, povidone-iodine, chloroxylenol, isopropyl alcohol, hexachlorophene, benzalkonium chloride, and hydrogen peroxide. They should be used for most, if not all, procedures that enter the dermis of the skin or deeper. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring of skin antiseptics, so providers can direct patient therapy where they are indicated as part of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanisms of action of some of the common dermal antiseptic agents.
- Review the indications for using dermal antiseptics.
- Summarize the potential adverse events of various skin antiseptic agents.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients who can benefit from dermal antiseptic agents.
