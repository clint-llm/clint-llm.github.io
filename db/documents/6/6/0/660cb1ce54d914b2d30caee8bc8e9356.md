The differential diagnosis can be quite extensive. Factors that increase the likelihood of cardiac disease include exertional pain, diaphoresis, nausea and vomiting, and radiation of pain to the right arm. Other life-threatening illnesses to consider include pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, pneumothorax, esophageal rupture, and cardiac tamponade. There may be atypical symptoms, especially in women and older patients, so a high degree of suspicion is required.  Since symptoms include nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, and fatigue it is imperative to consider cardiac causes of these symptoms and not dismiss these symptoms as a gastrointestinal illness.
