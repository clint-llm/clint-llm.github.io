**Abdominal plain films**are non-specific in the majority of cases. Crosstable or lateral imaging may demonstrate multiple air-fluid levels. However, plain abdominal films cannot distinguish with high specificity the difference between small and large bowel obstruction. Rarely, if there is any air in the rectum, may there be an outline of the meconium mas on an abdominal radiograph. The abdominal film may also demonstrate small bowel gas mixed with colonic meconium producing a granular appearance similar to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). When a granular pattern occurs within the first 12 hours, the diagnosis is most likely meconium plug syndrome, as NEC develops after >18 hours.

**Contrast Enema**is the investigation of choice and is often diagnostic and therapeutic.

The contrast enema, demonstrates the classical visualization of the meconium against the colonic wall, creating a double-contrast impression.

**Chloride sweat test**- to rule out cystic fibrosis.

**Suction rectal biopsy**- to rule out Hirschsprung disease, which is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the rectal biopsy specimen. In 13 to 38% of cases, meconium plug syndrome (MPS) has correlations with Hirschsprung disease (HD).

**Serum electrolytes**- To monitor the infant's electrolyte status during treatment with contrast enema agents.
