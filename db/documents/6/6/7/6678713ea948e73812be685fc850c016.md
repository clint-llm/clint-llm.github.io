Staging for LM/LMM is the same as it is for all melanomas, using the TNM staging criteria based on the latest American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual, 8th Edition.

- Stage I – Low-risk primary melanomas (T1a, T1b, T2a) without evidence of regional or distant metastases.

- Stage II – Primary melanomas that are at higher risk of recurrence (T2b, T3a, T3b, T4a, T4b), but without evidence of regional or distant metastases.

- Stage III – Involvement of regional lymph nodes or the presence of in-transit or satellite metastases.

- Stage IV – Distant metastases present.
