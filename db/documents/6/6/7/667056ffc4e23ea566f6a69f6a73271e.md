Due to the rarity of the disorder and asymptomatic presentations, alkaptonuria is often mistaken for a more common disease process such as osteoarthritis. An incorrect diagnosis can lead to dangerous consequences of delayed and improper medical management of the condition.

Misdiagnosis of scleral hyperpigmentation as an ocular melanosarcoma once led to enucleation of a patient’s only remaining eye. Later pathology studies diagnosed the patient’s condition as ocular ochronosis.

Joint symptoms of ochronotic osteoarthropathy can also be mistaken as other joint or hypercalcification diseases such as early-onset osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition disease, and hyperparathyroidism. However, the rapidly advanced progression of calcification, involvement of small joints, variety of calcium crystal deposits, and abnormal laboratory testing set alkaptonuria apart.
