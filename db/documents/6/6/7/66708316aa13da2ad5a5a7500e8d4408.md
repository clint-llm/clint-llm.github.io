Screening for cancer is initiated in an otherwise healthy population when cancer risk is substantial enough that the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment is justified. Cervical cancer screening has decreased the incidence and mortality rates due to cervical cancer. Overall in the United States, from 1990 to 2015 the cancer mortality has decreased by 25%. A major decline has been noted in the mortality rates for colorectal cancer (47% in men and 44% in women) and breast cancer (39% in women). This can be partially attributed to the introduction of cancer screening for colorectal and breast cancer.

Early-stage breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer have a five-year survival rate ranging from 84% to 93%. However, it has been noted in various studies, that subsets of the population are not aware of the benefits of cancer screening. Community outreach programs that increase cancer awareness and motivate people to have a discussion about cancer risk and screening with a doctor will be tremendously beneficial.
