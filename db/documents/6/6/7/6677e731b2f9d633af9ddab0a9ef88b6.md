There is limited data regarding the success of sedation-facilitated intubation using these agents, but several studies indicate an endotracheal intubation success rate, which is less than ideal – 85% in one study and 67.5% in another.

Rapid sequence intubation has been chosen over medication-facilitated intubation in the emergency department setting due to its lower risk of complications.
