Surgical excision is the standard of treatment for all salivary gland tumors. This may lead to a loss of functional tissue and saliva secretion, causing xerostomia, dental caries, halitosis, periodontal disease, and oral infections.

Treatments for Frey syndrome have included antiperspirant ointment, botulinum toxin A injections, and barrier flaps such as superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) flap, temporoparietal flap, sternocleidomastoid flap, anterolateral thigh flap, or thick skin flap.

Patients who undergo submandibular gland resection have a risk of neurological damage to the hypoglossal nerve, lingual nerve, and marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve.

Complications from radiation include sensorineural hearing loss, chronic otitis media/externa, otalgia, skin erythema, mucositis, dysphagia, dysgeusia, xerostomia, soft tissue fibrosis, osteoradionecrosis, and radiation-induced malignancy.
