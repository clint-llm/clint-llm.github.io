An intervention as complex and life-altering as heart-lung transplant can only be performed safely when undertaken by a dynamic, multifaceted dedicated team of professionals including but not limited to surgeons, cardiologists, pulmonologists, anesthetists, nurses, transplant pharmacists, physical and occupational therapists, respiratory therapists, dieticians, social workers, clinical psychologic professionals, and enthusiastic lay champions from the local communities. These team members must work closely with patients and their families as psychosocial, demographic, and behavioral factors are now recognized factors in the long-term survival of transplant patients.
