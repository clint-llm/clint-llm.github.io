Labs and/or imaging studies are not always warranted in well-appearing, normoxic, asymptomatic patients. If obtained, the workup should be directed towards the patient’s history and exam (eg for continued hypoxia a chest x-ray and blood gas may be warranted or for altered mental status a head CT, blood glucose, blood gas, toxicology analysis, ethanol level, and a metabolic panel may be needed). The most common laboratory abnormality noted in these patients is metabolic acidosis secondary to a lactic acidosis. Electrolyte abnormalities are uncommon in non-fatal drowning patients despite the type of fluid in which the patient was immersed.

A chest x-ray is not required in all drowning victims. Moreover, the initial chest x-ray has little correlation with the patient’s clinical course or outcome. However, one should be obtained with continued hypoxia or worsening respiratory symptoms. Patients may develop a non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema/ARDS-type presentation and should be treated accordingly.  Routine use of glucocorticoids, diuretics, and empiric antibiotics is not currently recommended. Antibiotics should be withheld until the patient begins to develop infectious signs and/or symptoms. In significantly unstable patients, providers may consider using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as salvage treatment for refractory hypoxia or hypothermia. Therapeutic hypothermia has also been discussed as being a beneficial treatment adjuvant.
