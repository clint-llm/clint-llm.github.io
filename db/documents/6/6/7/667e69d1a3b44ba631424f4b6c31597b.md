- Misdated pregnancy: First-trimester ultrasound (either transvaginal or transabdominal) provides the most accurate dating of pregnancy.

- Oligohydramnios: The discrepancy between fundal height and gestational age may be observed in women with low amniotic fluid volume. An ultrasound scan can be used to reliably predict the estimated fetal weight (EFW).
