As bacterial drug resistance continues to rise across the globe, it has become of utmost importance to enhance antibiotic stewardship.

PCT assays have utility in several clinical scenarios; current research suggests that PCT levels are most useful in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to determine when and if antibiotics should be initiated.

Overall, PCT levels provide a promising laboratory measurement for identifying bacterial infections. However, the utility of this test is limited by the clinical setting and patient population. Therefore, further research must be conducted before implementing PCT guidelines for everyday clinical practice.
