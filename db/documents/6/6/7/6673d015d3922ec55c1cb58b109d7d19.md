Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis and the wide-range of gum disease presentations pose a diagnostic dilemma to clinicians and is best managed by an interprofessional team approach.  Though there are specific diagnostic criteria to diagnose ANUG, patients may exhibit non-specific signs and symptoms or only meet some of the diagnostic criteria. Regardless of the specific presentation, recognition of potential necrotizing gum disease is the most critical action. Many studies emphasize the prevention of periodontitis and the need for intervention to be tailored to the individual's needs. One meta-analysis identified critical actions that may help in the implementation of preventive programs. The first critical action is communication to the public of the importance of gingival bleeding as an early sign of periodontal disease. The second critical action is the implementation of universal periodontal screening by the oral health care team. Third, we must understand the role of health promotion as well as understanding the limitations of self-medication with oral health care products. The final critical action is facilitating access to appropriate and effective professional preventive care.
