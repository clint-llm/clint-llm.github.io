Asymmetric periflexural exanthem of childhood is a rare condition which is usually misdiagnosed by nurse practitioners, primary care providers, andÂ dermatologists. Pediatricians must be aware and contribute to the diagnosis of this dermatosis to prevent unnecessary examinations and to reassure parents about the benign course of the condition. an interprofessional team approach involving physicians (both MDs and DOs), mid-level practitioners (NPs and PAs), and nursing can best address this relatively benign condition, and provide reassurance and prevent misdiagnosis and resultant improper prescribing of medication.
