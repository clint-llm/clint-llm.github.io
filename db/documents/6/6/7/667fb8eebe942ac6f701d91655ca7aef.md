Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans typically presents as an asymptomatic, skin-colored to red-brown indurated plaque, which eventually develops multiple raised violaceus to red-brown nodules. They grow slowly and can reach several centimeters in diameter. The atrophic variant presents as a violaceous plaque that may resemble morphea or scar. The tumor, particularly in the early stages, can resemble a keloid or dermatofibroma and is often misdiagnosed. As they grow larger, some can ulcerate and become painful. The majority of DFSPs occur on the trunk (50%), followed by the extremities (35%) and then head and neck (15%).

The shoulder and pelvic region are particularly characteristic areas for dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans usually extends into the subcutaneous fat but rarely involves the fascia, muscle, or bone unless it is longstanding or recurrent. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is known to have relentless growth with asymmetric, root-like projections which cannot be appreciated on clinical exam. Thus, local recurrence following excision is common. Distant metastasis is rare, occurring in 1% to 4% of cases and usually only after multiple local recurrences. The lung is the most common site of metastasis via hematogenous spread. The regional lymph nodes are rarely involved. The fibrosarcomatous variant of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans has a higher risk of local recurrence (14% to 52%) and distant metastases (8% to 29%).
