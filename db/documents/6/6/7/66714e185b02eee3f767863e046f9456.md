AV junction forms from the fusion of the atrioventricular sulcus and cushions. The disruption of the continuity between the atria and the ventricles lies at the ventricle margin of the atrioventricular junctional myocardium. The process of separation between the atria and ventricle begins at 7 weeks at the anteromedial portion of the right atrioventricular junction. At 12 weeks the fusions of the atrioventricular sulcus and cushions have been completed. During development, the atrioventricular insulation matures first while the left-sided fibrous annulus is shown to better developed in an adult heart.
