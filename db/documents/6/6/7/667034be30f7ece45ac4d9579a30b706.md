Tonsillar herniation is the movement of brain tissue from one intracranial compartment to another, specifically the movement of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum. This is a life-threatening and time-critical pathology that may be reversible with emergent surgical intervention and medical management. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of tonsillar herniation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of tonsillar herniation.
- Summarize the evaluation of tonsillar herniation.
- Outline the management options available for tonsillar herniation.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of tonsillar herniation and improve outcomes.
