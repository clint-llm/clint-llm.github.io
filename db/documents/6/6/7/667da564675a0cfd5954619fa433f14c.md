The first step is to explain the procedure in detail, including the expected benefits, possible risks, and realistic alternatives. Next, obtain the patientâ€™s consent to perform the procedure. The equipment and medications required for the nerve block must be ready and present in the room prior to starting the procedure. After conducting the time-out, the patient gets placed in the desired position. The targeted area is appropriately cleaned and covered by sterile drapes. Depending on the imaging modality of choice, the room should be equipped with that device.
