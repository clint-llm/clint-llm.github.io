An ileostomy is a procedure in which the lumen of the ileum, part of the small bowel, is brought through the abdominal wall via a surgically-created opening called a stoma. The purpose of an ileostomy is to evacuate stool from the body via the ileum instead of the usual route via the anus. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and potential benefits of the ileostomy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with a stoma.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for an ileostomy.
- Outline the contraindications to ileostomy.
- Review the technique involved in creating an ileostomy.
- Explain the importance of enhancing care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients undergoing ileostomy.
