The positive effects of St John’s Wort can be negated when used in conjunction with other medications; sometimes, the effects of drug interactions can be life-threatening. Drugs that also utilize the cytochrome P450 system, specifically CYP3A4, or are substrates of P-glycoproteins in metabolism can have reduced efficacy and produce adverse effects when taken in conjunction with St. John’s Wort. These drugs include HIV protease inhibitors, CYP3A4 HIV non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, irinotecan, imatinib mesylate, digoxin, oxycodone, and warfarin. As mentioned earlier, this CPY450 and P-glycoprotein activity appears, based on some research results, to be related to the hyperforin content of these herbal products and is likely more an issue with commercially prepared products. Medical practitioners need to err on the side of caution, especially considering some of the drugs that could be impacted where therapeutic failure is especially problematic. (e.g., HIV medication, warfarin, oral contraceptives).

Those on hormonal contraceptives must be aware when taking St. John’s Wort that there have been instances of unplanned pregnancies and irregular menstrual cycles. Clinicians must be aware that when prescribing serotonergic agents and other antidepressants, there is a potential risk of pharmacodynamic interactions occurring when taken with St. John’s Wort.
