In addition to documented cases of short, hypoplastic, or absent radial bones, the proximal radio-ulnar synostosis is a malformation caused by the bony fusion of the proximal radius and ulna. The proximal third of both bones are the most common sites of fusion. The malformation correlates with an increased incidence of posterior dislocation of the radial head. Proximal radio-ulnar synostosis has associations with Poland syndrome, Cenani-Lenz syndactyly, and Cornelia de Lange syndrome.
