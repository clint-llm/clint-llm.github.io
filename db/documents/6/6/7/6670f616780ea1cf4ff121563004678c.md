**Portal Hypertension**

Portal hypertension is responsible for the majority of the complications seen in patients with chronic PVT. It presents with splenomegaly, varices or ascites. Portal vein thrombosis commonly forms varices in sites other than the esophagus and stomach (ectopic varices).

**Intestinal Ischemia**

Intestinal ischemia It is typically seen when acute PVT progresses to obstruction of mesenteric venous outflow with reflex arterial constriction and occlusion.

**Septic Portal Vein Thrombosis**

Septic portal vein thrombosis (acute pylephlebitis) occurs when PVT develops in a patient with an abdominal focus of an infection like appendicitis, diverticulitis, among others.

**Portal Cholangiopathy**

Portal cholangiopathy is a complication that may develop with longstanding PVT due to extrinsic compression of large bile ducts from venous collaterals around portal vein. It may progress to ischemic strictures of bile ducts presenting with obstructive jaundice and cholangitis.
