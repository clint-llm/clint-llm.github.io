There are practice pearls worth remembering in the evaluation and treatment of back pain.

For adults:

- History and physical exam are sufficient for evaluation of non-traumatic, acute back pain in the absence of red flags - avoid imaging before six weeks in severe back pain in the absence of red flags

- NSAIDs, opioids, and topiramate are more effective than placebo in the short-term treatment of nonspecific chronic low back pain

- Acetaminophen, antidepressants (except duloxetine), lidocaine patches, and TENS are not consistently more effective than placebo in the treatment of chronic low back pain

- Consider a physical therapy referral for McKenzie method techniques to reduce the risk of recurrence; intensive patient education that includes advice to stay active, avoid aggravating movements, and return to regular activity as soon as possible is effective in patients with nonspecific pain

For children:

- Children with back pain who have no significant physical findings, a short duration of pain, and a history of minor injury can be treated conservatively with no further evaluation

- Children with back pain, either abnormal physical findings, constant pain, nighttime pain, or radicular pain, should receive further evaluation

- Anterioposterior and plain lateral films are the first-line radiographic studies

- Consider laboratory evaluation to accompany your radiographs as malignancy and infection are higher on the differential diagnosis for pediatric patients than adults

- Tumor and infection needs to be ruled out for back pain in children four years and younger
