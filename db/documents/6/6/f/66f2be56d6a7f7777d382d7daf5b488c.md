ADPKD is due to an abnormality on chromosome 16 (PKD1 locus) or chromosome 4 (PKD2 locus). PKD1 mutations comprise about 78% of ADPKD cases, while PKD2 mutations comprise about 14% of cases. The remaining cases have no identifiable mutations. PKD1 patients tend to progress to ESRD at an earlier age than PKD2 patients (mean age 54.3 versus 74.0).
