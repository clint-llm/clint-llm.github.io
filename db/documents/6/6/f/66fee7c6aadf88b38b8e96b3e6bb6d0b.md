The**subscapularis**is the largest component of the posterior wall of the axilla. It prevents the anterior dislocation of the humerus during abduction and medially rotates the humerus. A large bursa separates the muscle from the neck of the scapula

- Origin: subscapular fossa of the scapula

- Insertion: lesser tubercle of the humerus

The **supraspinatus**muscle is the only muscle of the rotator cuff that is not a rotator of the humerus.

- Origin: supraspinous fossa of the scapula

- Passes above the glenohumeral joint

- Insertion: greater tuberosity of the humerus

The **infraspinatus**is a powerful lateral rotator of the humerus. The tendon of this muscle is sometimes separated from the capsule of the glenohumeral joint by a bursa.

- Origin: infraspinous fossa of the scapula

- Insertion: greater tuberosity of the humerus, immediately below the supraspinatus.

The **teres minor**is a narrow and long muscle entirely covered by the deltoid, hardly differentiated from the infraspinatus.

- Origin: lateral border of the scapula (below the infraglenoid tubercle)

- Insertion: greater tuberosity of the humerus, below the infraspinatus tendon.
