There are about 3,000 species of snakes worldwide; 10% to 15% of them are venomous. Snakes primarily use their venom to obtain food.

In the United States, greater than 95 percent of snakebites are caused by the Crotalidae ("pit viper") family of snakes, so named because of heat-sensitive "pits" between the eyes and the nostrils used to sense their prey. The Crotalidae family includes the following snakes:

- Rattlesnakes, genera Crotalus and Sistrurus

- Copperheads, Agkistrodon contortrix

- Cottonmouths, or water moccasins, Agkistrodon piscivorous

The Elapidae or coral snakes (Micrurus species) account for a much smaller proportion of snakebites in the United States.  Elapids are found along the southern edge of the United States, whereas pit vipers are dispersed throughout most of the continent.  Rattlesnakes account for most snakebite-related deaths in people and domestic animals in the USA. Most coral snake bites in the United States occur in southern states, with Florida, Texas, North Carolina, and Georgia among the most common. Risk factors for snake bites include male sex, handling or disturbing a snake, and owning a venomous snake.
