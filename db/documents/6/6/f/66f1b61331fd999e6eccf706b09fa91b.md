Current cadmium exposures come from electroplating, batteries, possible environmental exposures.

Acute exposure route is important:Â  Oral ingestion confers gastrointestinal injury and inhalation confers a severe chemical pneumonitis.

Chronic exposure is most characterized by nephrotoxicity in the form of proteinuria (beta-2-microglobulin), though there has also been a link to lung cancer.

Treatment is removal from exposure, supportive care, and succimer is a therapeutic consideration in acute cadmium salt ingestion; otherwise, chelation not recommended.
