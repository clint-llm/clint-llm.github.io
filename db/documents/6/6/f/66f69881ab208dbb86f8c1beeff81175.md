A significant concern of herbal supplements clinically is their interaction with cytochrome p450 enzymes (CYP450). Especially when patients are taking prescription drugs and herbal supplements concurrently. 80% of prescribed medications are metabolized through six CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4).Gingko biloba, hyperforin in St. John’s Wort, ginsenosides in ginseng, and diallyl sulfide in garlic induce CYP450 enzymes. Terpenes in black cohosh and Echinacea extract may inhibit CYP450 enzymes.

The other possible interaction is when an herbal supplement has a similar mechanism of absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion (ADME) to a prescribed drug. In these cases, changing the prescribed drug dosage can safely counteract the negative interaction.

Garlic may act as a blood thinner by inhibiting platelets and negating the effects of anticoagulants.

People with ragweed allergies may be allergic to Echinacea as well. Six months of continuous ingestion of different Echinacea preparations showed no toxic effects.

Black cohosh has been shown to interact with the OATP2B1 enzyme; this may reduce the efficacy of fexofenadine, glyburide, amiodarone, and many statin medications.

In several human trials, Asian ginseng was shown not to affect CYP2E1, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, or P-gp.

Gingko biloba has been shown to inhibit platelet aggregation. Several studies, however, showed that Gingko did not increase bleeding risk or have a significant effect on hematologic parameters.Gingko may increase INR when combined with warfarin, which may increase the bleeding risk when taking Gingko and warfarin simultaneously.

Goldenseal has been shown to inhibit CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. These two enzymes metabolize 50% of current pharmaceutical agents. It is strongly recommended to avoid taking goldenseal with most prescription and over-the-counter medications.

St. John’s Wort has been shown to induce CYP3A4 and P-gp. It may interact (reduce effectiveness) with irinotecan, protease inhibitors, digoxin, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, warfarin, and oral contraceptives.

Saw palmetto has been shown not to affect CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, or CYP2E1 enzymes.

Reported possible side effects of hawthorn include nausea, dizziness, vertigo, fatigue, sweating, headache, palpitations, and epistaxis. It is not recommended during pregnancy because it can cause uterine stimulation.
