According to studies in the United Kingdom, the annual incidence of bacterial meningitis is 0.38 per 1000 live births, and that of viral meningitis is 0.83 per 1000 live births.

One study from Canada reported rates of neonatal meningitis ranging between 2.2 and 3.5/1000 NICU admissions over a 7-year period.

In developing countries, the incidence is higher, at 0.8 to 6.1 per 1000 live births, with a mortality rate of up to 58%. The true incidence is likely higher as the epidemiology is limited in many rural, developing settings.
