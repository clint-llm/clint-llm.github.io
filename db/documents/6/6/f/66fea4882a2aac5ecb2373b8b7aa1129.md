Pulmonary DCS is best prevented by strictly adhering to established decompression protocols.  Post-treatment, if the diver wants to return to diving, they should be evaluated by a practitioner trained and experienced in assessing fitness to dive.  The practitioner should collaborate with the diver to isolate the events that led up to the DCS incident and provide counseling regarding future diving based on those events and the outcome of the diver's treatment.
