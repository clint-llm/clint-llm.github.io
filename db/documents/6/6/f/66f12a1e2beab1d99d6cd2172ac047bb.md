The clinical features of bronchiolitis are primarily due to airway obstruction and diminished lung compliance. The virus infects the epithelial cells in the airways and induces an inflammatory reaction that leads to ciliary dysfunction and cell death. The accumulated debris,Â edema of the airways, and narrowing of the airways due to the release of cytokines eventually lead to symptoms and lowered lung compliance. The patient then tries to overcome the decreased compliance by breathing harder. Typical features include:

- Air trapping

- Increased mucus production

- Atelectasis

- Labored breathing

- Decreased ventilation
