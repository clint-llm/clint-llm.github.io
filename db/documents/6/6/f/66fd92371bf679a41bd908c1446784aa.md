Ethanol is an alcohol by chemical composition used to manage and treat methanol/ethylene glycol toxicity. Ethanol has also been used efficiently in the clinical sector for disinfection and sterilization. The modern-day has seen ethanol being used as a novel therapy for neoplasms in lieu of surgical interventions. This activity revolves around the indications, mechanism of action, administration, adverse effects, and contraindications to the use of ethanol. This activity will also highlight the vigilance that the healthcare team should demonstrate in a clinical setting to enhance the therapeutic outcomes when using the drug.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the therapeutic uses of ethanol.
- Describe the mechanism of action of ethanol in its various clinical uses.
- Summarize how to manage ethanol toxicity.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to ensure appropriate candidate selection for receiving a percutaneous ethanol ablation rather than surgery in cases of simple cyst or carcinomas to avoid comorbidity associated with surgery.
