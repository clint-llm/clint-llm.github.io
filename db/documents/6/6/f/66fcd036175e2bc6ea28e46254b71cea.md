**Boxed Warnings**

- The use of golimumab can result in serious infections, which may further cause hospitalization or even death. Diseases such as bacterial sepsis, tuberculosis (TB), and fungal and opportunistic infections have been reported. Treatment with golimumab should be discontinued if any of these infections ensue.

- Lymphoma and additional malignancies, which some have resulted in mortality, have also been reported with the use of TNF inhibitors in pediatric populations.

- A TB test should be performed prior to initiating golimumab. If a positive test is positive for latent infection, TB treatment should be initiated before starting golimumab.

- Patients receiving golimumab should be monitored for the development of active TB regardless of a negative initial test for latent TB.

- Patients with HBV receiving treatment with golimumab should be monitored for some months after initiating therapy for HBV reactivation. In the event of a reactivation, golimumab should be stopped immediately, and anti-viral treatment should be initiated.
