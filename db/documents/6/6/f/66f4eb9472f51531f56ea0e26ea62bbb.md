Most patients with follicular lymphoma present with painless peripheral lymphadenopathy.Â The adenopathy commonly waxes and wanes spontaneously but does not altogether disappear.

Patients are evaluated at regular intervals after completion of the initial therapy to monitor for treatment complications and progression. Patients are assessed with detailed history and physical examination, complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and lactate dehydrogenase. On physical examination, a rapid rise in the size and number of lymph nodes, or the development of B symptoms such as night sweats, fevers, weight loss, and fatigue, generally indicate relapsed disease.
