Most studies have focused on the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis, using murine models. However, barring a few differences, most cases of myocarditis develop from the same three-step sequence of events

- Acute injury because of infectious or non-infectious causes, leading to myocardial damage

- Myocytolysis causing the release of intracellular antigens and cytoskeletal proteins like cardiac myosin

- Activation of the innate immune response against cardiac self-antigens, followed by CD4+ T cell activation, clonal expansion of B cells, and production of cardiac autoantibodies.

Rheumatic carditis occurs because of molecular mimicry of streptococcal antigens (like M protein) with cardiac antigens such that anti-streptococcal antibodies cross-react with cardiac myosin and valvular endotheliumBorrelia, Trypanosoma, or Toxoplasma cause myocyte injury by direct invasion and intracellular proliferation

Studies have implicated both cell-mediated, and antibody-mediated immune responses in the pathogenesis of myocarditis, and CD4+ T cells play a major role in both pathways.
