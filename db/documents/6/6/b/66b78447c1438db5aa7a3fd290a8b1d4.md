The princeps pollicis artery provides minor blood supply to the distal nerve fibers of three nerves in the hand:

- Ulnar nerve

- Median nerve

- radial nerve

The princeps pollicis artery's primary function is to perfuse the muscles, bone, and skin of the thumb. The blood supply sometimes overlaps with the distal nerve fibers' territory. But the princeps pollicis artery is not the dominant blood supply to the nerves in the hand.
