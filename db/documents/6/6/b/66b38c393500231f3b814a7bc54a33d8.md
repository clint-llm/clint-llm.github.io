Please note that while equipment and technique of balloon tamponade devices for esophageal varices are similar, this list is specific to Sengstaken-Blakemore tube placement. The most common tube types are the Sengstaken-Blakemore tube and the Minnesota tube, with the major difference being that the Minnesota tube has a larger gastric balloon and both gastric and esophageal aspiration ports. The Sengstaken-Blakemore tube only has an aspiration port for gastric contents; however, a double-lumen nasogastric tube used as an esophageal aspiration port. Further note that there are a few variations on the supplies required. It is possible to place the tube without Luer-locks and stopcocks by clamping the tubing with Magill forceps instead.
