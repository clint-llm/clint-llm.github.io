Radial head fractures account for approximately one in three elbow fractures and 1 to 4 percent of all fractures in adults. In the past, the radial head was deemed insignificant and felt to have little influence on elbow anatomy and biomechanics, so its excision was frequently indicated. Long-term outcomes associated with the removal of the radial head have shown undesirable consequences. Treatment and prognosis of radial head fractures are typically dependent on the associated injuries at the time of presentation. This activity reviews the causes, pathophysiology, and presentation of radial head fractures and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in their management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of radial head fractures.
- Outline the presentation of a patient with a radial head fracture.
- Describe the treatment options available for radial head fractures.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of radial head fractures and improve patient outcomes.
