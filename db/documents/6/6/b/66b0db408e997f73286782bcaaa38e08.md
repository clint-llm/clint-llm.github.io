Centrally acting opioid receptor antagonists are potent competitive inhibitors with the highest affinity for the mu receptor. Naloxone is the most common choice in opioid overdose emergencies, and naltrexone is utilized primarily in opioid and alcohol use disorders to help maintain abstinence primarily by decreasing cravings. The competitive antagonism of the central mu receptors stimulates the respiratory drive, increases alertness, terminates analgesia and euphoria, and causes mydriasis.

Peripherally acting opioid receptor antagonists do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier but are potent competitive inhibitors at the mu receptor, which are found in high concentration at peripheral nerve terminals in bronchial smooth muscle and the digestive tract. Antagonism of these peripheral mu receptors can lead to intestinal hypermotility.
