The equipment necessary for LVRS depends on the type of approach used. Typically two different surgical techniques for LVRS are used and are institution-dependent:

- Median Sternotomy

- Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS)

Special surgical equipment such as sternal saw for median sternotomy, or insufflation/camera equipment for VATS should be prepared ahead of time. Special anesthesia considerations such as a double-lumen endotracheal tube, arterial line insertion/monitoring, and intra-operative/post-operative pain-control methods (epidural, nerve block, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump, etc.) should be determined ahead of time. Although some institutions use buttressing material with their stapler to try and prevent air leaks, there has been no evidence to suggest that this decreases post-operative air leaks in LVRS patients.
