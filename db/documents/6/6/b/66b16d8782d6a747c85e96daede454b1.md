Pacemakers consist of two main components: a pulse generator and the leads. Pulse generator houses the battery and other electronics which control the modes of the pacemaker. Pacemaker leads conduct the depolarizing potential to the myocardium. The sensing of the innate activity of the heart is also a function of the leads.

**Pacemaker Timing Cycle**

A pacemaker has two primary functions, pacing (an electrical stimulus for myocardial depolarization) and sensing (detecting intrinsic electrical activity and wave of depolarization). Different timing cycles are programmed in a pacemaker for its functioning.

- **Lower Rate Limit**: Base rate or slowest rate that the pacemaker will allow the patient's heart to go. It is programmable.

- **Upper Rate Limit**: The maximum rate at which a pacemaker can pace in the absence of intrinsic activity.

- **Maximum Tracking Rate (MTR)**: Maximum atrial rate at which a dual-chamber pacemaker tracks the sensed atrial activity and paces the ventricle.

- **Sensed AV Delay**: It is a time duration after sensed atrial activity at which the pacemaker will pace the ventricle if it does not sense the intrinsic activity.

- **Paced AV Delay**: It is a time duration after atrial pacing at which the pacemaker will pace the ventricle if it does not sense the intrinsic activity.

- **Post Ventricular Atrial Refractory Period (PVARP**): It is a time duration after the ventricular event when a pacemaker does not react to a sensed atrial activity. It sees the activity but does not reset the timing cycle.

- **Post Ventricular Atrial Blanking (PVAB):**This is the time duration after the ventricular event when a pacemaker does not sense any atrial event. Pacemaker becomes blind for atrial events.

- **Total Atrial Refractory Period (TARP)**: The sum of AV delay and post-ventricular atrial refractory period.
