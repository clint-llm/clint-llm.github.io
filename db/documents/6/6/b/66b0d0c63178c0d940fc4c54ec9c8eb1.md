Microdontia histologically presents as a normal tooth; however, the enamel and dentin layers are not as robust as a normal-sized tooth.

Macrodontia histologically presents as normal teeth histologically; however, the layers of enamel and dentin are thicker and more pronounced than normal-sized teeth.

Taurodontism presents as a normal tooth. However, due to the hyperplastic and abnormally large pulp chamber, there is excess pulpal tissue. Though the tissue is greater in volume, it is histologically normal.

Teeth that exhibit fusion appear histologically as normal teeth; however, depending on where and at what point in development the teeth began to fuse, certain elements – pulpal chambers, roots, and/or crowns – may appear fused or duplicated.
