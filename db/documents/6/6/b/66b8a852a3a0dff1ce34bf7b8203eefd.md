Microscopically, a peptic ulcer consists of chronic inflammatory cells and granulation tissue, endarteritis obliterans, and epithelial proliferation. PepticÂ ulcers have four prototypical zones:

- Superficially located neutrophils, bacteria, and necrotic areas

- Fibrinoid necrosis at base of the ulcers and its margins

- Chronic inflammatory cells with accompanying granulation tissue

- Fibrous scars in the muscularis propria layer showing blood vessels with underlying endarteritis obliterans
