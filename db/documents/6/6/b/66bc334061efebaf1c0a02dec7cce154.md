Fat embolism and fat embolism syndromeÂ can be categorized as traumatic or nontraumatic.

**Traumatic Causes**

Traumatic causes of fat embolism syndrome are more common that than nontraumatic causes.

Trauma as a cause of fat embolism syndrome can occur from the following:

Fracture of the long bones, specifically

- Femur

- Tibia

- Pelvis

The postoperative condition also can favor the development of fat embolism syndrome including the following:

- Pelvic arthroplasty

- Knee arthroplasty

- Intramedullary nailing and reaming

Other rare traumatic conditions that can cause fat embolism syndrome include the following:

- Massive soft tissue damage

- Crush injury

- Prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation

- Severe burn involving more than 50% of body surface area

- Bone marrow transplantation

- Liposuction

- Median sternotomy

**Nontraumatic Causes**

Cases of nontraumatic fat embolism syndrome are very rare and include the following:

- Fatty Liver

- Acute or chronic pancreatitis

- Therapy with corticosteroid

- Infusion of fat emulsion

- Lymphography

- Hemoglobinopathies

- Sickle cell disease

- Thalassemia

Several risk factors are associated with the development of fat embolism syndrome. The following conditions increase the risk of developing fat embolism syndrome:

- Young age

- Closed fractures

- Multiple fractures

- Prolonged conservative management of long bone fracture

The technique of inserting the intramedullary nails also can contribute to the risk of developing fat embolism syndrome.

- Increased velocity in reaming

- Overzealousness in the nailing of the medullary cavity

- The widened gap between the nail and the cortex of the bone
