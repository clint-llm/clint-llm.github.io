The prevalence of obesity in the United States has doubled since 1980, and currently, 35 percent of this country's population suffers from obesity. Obesity is associated with multiple medical complications, and it is paramount to address the associated metabolic, cardiovascular, and respiratory complications. Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is one of the major respiratory complications of obesity. Typically, the pulmonary function testing will show mild to moderate restrictive defects. This activity describes the pathophysiology, etiology, presentation, and management of obesity hypoventilation syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in enhancing care delivery for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
- Review the presentation of a patient with obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
- Outline the management options available for obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
- Summarize a well-coordinated interprofessional team approach to provide adequate care to patients affected by obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
