Appropriate patient selection is essential. Neuraxial neurolysis can be helpful in intractable cancer-related pain when pharmacological analgesic therapy including opioids and antitumor therapy has failed to control pain. Its indication is for pain that is primarily somatic in origin. Visceral or neuropathic pain treatment is less reliable with spinal neurolytic procedures than somatic pain.
