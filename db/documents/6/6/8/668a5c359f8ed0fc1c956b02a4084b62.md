The trigeminal nerve can be damaged anywhere along its course. For example, V1 could get injured in Meckel's cave (for example, by an expanding acoustic neuroma) or the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus (for instance, by cavernous sinus thrombosis or expanding pituitary lesion).

The infratrochlear nerve specifically can be injured in nasal fractures or in fractures of the orbit (especially effecting the medial orbit). It may also incur damage from pressure from an anesthesia mask, which may cause neuropraxia or even axonotmesis. The impact of infratrochlear nerve damage is a loss of sensation in the affected areas.

Given the external location of the nerve, it is palpable below the trochlea. Blockade is possible with 1Â to 2% lidocaine by infiltrating at the superomedial border of the orbit and along its medial wall. This block is useful when attempting a manipulation under anesthesia of a nasal fracture or other nasal surgery, including septoplasty, rhinoplasty, and repair of nasal skin laceration.

The literature describes infratrochlear neuralgia. It involves a painful cranial neuropathy at the internal angle of the orbit and medial upper eyelid, upper bridge of the nose, and/or the lacrimal caruncle. Of the cases reported, the possible precipitating causes were post-nasal trauma or previous tracheitis. The majority of cases had no precipitating cause. Research and clinical experience have shown it to respond to nerve blocks.
