Proper technical evaluation is important to ensure proper interpretation of radiographs and clinical decision making involving the radiograph. The imaging technologist and the interpreting radiologist's technical evaluation should be done before a report is issued associated with the radiograph. It is important for imaging technologists and radiologists to keep in good communication with each other as well, as it promotes a culture of learning in the radiology department and allows for a collaborative enhancement between the two roles, which can heighten awareness of technical factors that should be evaluated on every radiograph.

Once a report is issued associated with the radiograph, the staff involved in the patient's direct care may also help ensure the technical adequacy of imaging through education on technical evaluation of X-ray imaging. Increased communication between teams in direct care with patients and radiologists reading radiographs has decreased the radiology department's errors.
