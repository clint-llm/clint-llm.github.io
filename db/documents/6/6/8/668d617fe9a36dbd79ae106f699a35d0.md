Once the etiology of pleural effusion is determined, management involves addressing the underlying cause. In cases of complex parapneumonic effusions or empyema (pleural fluid pH less than 7.2 or presence of organisms), chest tube drainage is usually indicated along with antibiotics. Small-bore drains (10 G to 14 G) are equally effective as large-bore drains for this purpose. If patients do not respond to appropriate antibiotics and adequate drainage, then thoracoscopic decortication or debridement may be necessary. Instillation of intrapleural fibrinolytics and DNAse may be used to improve drainage and in those who do not respond to sufficient antibiotic therapy and those who are not candidates for surgical intervention.

If a patient with malignant pleural effusion is not symptomatic, drainage is not always indicated unless an underlying infection is suspected. For malignant pleural effusions that require frequent drainage, options for management are pleurodesis (where the pleural space is obliterated either mechanically or chemically by inducing irritants into the pleural space) and tunneled pleural catheter placement.

Chylous effusions are initially managed conservatively, but most require surgery.

One should not remove more than 1500 ml of fluid during a single attempt as it can lead to re-expansion pulmonary edema. A chest x-ray is mandatory after performing thoracentesis to determine residual fluid and the presence of a pneumothorax.
