Treatment and management are dependent on the type of urinary incontinence. Conservative, pharmacologic, and surgical modalities exist. Treatment and management should begin with the least invasive methods and then escalate as appropriate:

- Stress urinary incontinence

- Conservative management - behavioral therapy (controlling fluid intake, prompted voiding, constipation management, etc.), electrical stimulation, mechanical devices (cones, pessaries, urethral plugs), pelvic floor muscle strengthening (Kegel and floor muscle exercises), weight loss
- Pharmacologic management - alpha-adrenergic agonists (e.g., phenylpropolamine),
- Surgical management - intravesical balloons, trans- or periurethral injections of bulking agents, sling procedures, urethropexy

- Urge urinary incontinence

- Conservative management - similar to the treatment for stress urinary incontinence with the exception of mechanical devices
- Pharmacologic management - antimuscarinics (e.g., darifenacin, solifenacin, oxybutynin, tolterodine, fesoterodine, trospium),
- Surgical management - neuromodulation, onabotulinumtoxinA injection

- Mixed urinary incontinence

- Treatment and management as above, focusing on dominant symptoms

- Overflow urinary incontinence

- Conservative management - clean intermittent catheterization, indwelling urethral catheter, relief of obstruction
- Pharmacologic management - alpha-adrenergic antagonists (e.g. terazosin, tamsulosin)
- Surgical management - suprapubic catheter

- Functional urinary incontinence

- Underlying causes should be addressed or alleviated if possible

Medications should be reconciled, and substances such as caffeine and alcohol should be avoided if they are contributing to incontinence.

Urinary incontinence in end of life care can be difficult to manage and should be handled on a case by case basis. In some instances, an indwelling catheter or condom catheter may need to be used to maximize comfort for the patient in the last stages of their life.
