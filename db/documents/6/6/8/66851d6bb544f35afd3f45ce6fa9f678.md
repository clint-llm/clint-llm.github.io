The malignant cells in lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma are believed to originate from cells at a late stage of B-cell differentiation. These cells derive from a B-cell arrest after somatic hypermutation in the germinal center and before terminal differentiation to a plasma cell**.**The pathological findings in lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma are due to infiltration of the bone marrow with small lymphocytes and IgM monoclonal gammopathy. Visual and neurological symptoms are related to hyperviscosity and sluggishness of blood flow. Bleeding encountered in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is due to IgM binding to the clotting factors. Cryoglobulinemia in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia patients leads to Raynaud phenomena and cold urticaria.
