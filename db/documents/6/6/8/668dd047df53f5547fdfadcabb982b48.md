The main intention to treat PMS is symptom relief and to reduce its effects on daily routine activities. Pharmacotherapy was always the first line of treatment for premenstrual syndrome, but recent research has suggested the superior benefits with combination therapy.

Combination of pharmacotherapies (such as NSAIDs, SSRIs, anxiolytic agents, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, spironolactone, oral contraceptive pills) with nonpharmacological treatments, mainly cognitive and behavioral therapies, exercises, massage therapy, light therapy along with dietary and nutritional modifications have been proven beneficial for the treatment of premenstrual symptoms.

**Lifestyle modifications**include regular exercise, avoiding stressful events, and maintaining healthy sleeping habits, especially during the premenstrual period. Increased intake of complex carbohydrates increases the level of tryptophan, a serotonin precursor.

**Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**is an approach that emphasizes the correction of unsettled disruptive thoughts, behaviors, and emotions. CBT helps in the recognition of these behaviors and helps develop coping strategies to improve daily functioning.

The fruit extract **Vitex agnus-castus**is the only herbal medicine that is proven to control PMS-associated mood swings and irritability.

Recent studies of **combined oral contraceptives**comprising 0.02 mg of ethinyl estradiol and 3 mg of drospirenone (compound hormone pills for 24 days followed by hormone-inactive pills for the last four days) have demonstrated an improvement in PMDD symptoms.

**Selective serotonin receptor inhibitors (SSRIs)**can be used as the first-line treatment of PMS with predominantly emotional symptoms.
