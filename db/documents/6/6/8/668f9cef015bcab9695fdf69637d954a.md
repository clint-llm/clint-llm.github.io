Cytogenetic testing is an important diagnostic tool in fetal and genetic medicine, oncology, and hematology.

The main indications of karyotyping and FISH studies in neoplastic diseases are

- Diagnosis and classification of leukemias

- Estimation of prognosis

- Evaluation of appropriate treatment regimens

- Evaluation of response to treatment by looking for the elimination of cells carrying the abnormal genotype.

The main indications of cytogenetic studies in congenital genetic diseases are:

- Abnormal ultrasound findings

- Abnormal biochemistry results

- Recurrent miscarriages

- Advanced maternal age, particularly >35 years old

- Family history

- Abnormal non-invasive prenatal test results (NIPTS)

- Multiple irrelevant congenital anomalies

Abnormal biochemical findings in maternal serum may include: decreased alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), which might indicate trisomy 21; decreased unconjugated estriol (UE3), increased human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), and abnormal inhibin-A levels are also associated with Down syndrome.

While most of the findings in an ultrasound examination are insufficient to confirm a diagnosis, femur-length shortening and nuchal skin fold thickening can raise suspicion of trisomy 21.

Non-invasive prenatal testing/screening (NIPTS) is a relatively new method that detects chromosomal anomalies using the circulating cell-free fetal DNA present in the mother's plasma.
