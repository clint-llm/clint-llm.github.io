The veins of the foot are susceptible to several pathologies, including corona phelbectatica, varicose veins, deep vein thrombosis, and venous ulcers.

Varicose veins are a common pathology seen in the veins of the foot and ankle. They are ectatic, tortuous vessels of the superficial venous system that are at least 3 mm in size that arises from the failure of venous valves to close properly to allow the backward flow of blood.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a frequent complication seen in orthopedic surgery and can cause significant morbidity and mortality.

Lastly, the veins in the foot can be involved in abscesses and ulcers due to diabetic complications as well as intravenous drug use. In each case, it is crucial to treat the underlying medical issue such as diabetes or addiction while also providing topical wound care therapies, antibiotics, and/or anti-platelet or anti-clotting medications to prevent a blood clot.
