Administration is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to iron dextran. Additionally, iron dextran is contraindicated in any form of anemia, which is not the result of iron deficiency. Co-administration with dimercaprol should be avoided as iron-dimercaprol chelates are especially toxic to renal tissue. Patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be at an elevated risk of developing adverse reactions. Additionally, caution is necessary when administering iron dextran to patients with any disease states that mimic known major adverse effects; disease states of concern include atopy, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and cardiovascular disease.
