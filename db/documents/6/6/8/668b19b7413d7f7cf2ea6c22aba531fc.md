FAP results from a mutation at the APC gene on chromosome 5. The APC gene is a tumor suppressor gene. Most mutations are non-sense mutations, but the genotype and phenotypes vary significantly as the APC gene is large. Â The location of gene mutation contributes to the phenotypic variations, including the development of extracolonic manifestations of the disease.

If more than ten adenomatous polyps are present on a single colonoscopy, genetic testing is necessary. Ten to thirty percent of patients with a presentation of FAP will not have a detectable APC gene mutation.
