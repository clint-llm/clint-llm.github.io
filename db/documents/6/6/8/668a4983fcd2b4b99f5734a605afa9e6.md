Exposure to beryllium is the underlying causative factor. Heavy beryllium-using industries include metal machine shops, electronics, defense industries, and beryllium extraction companies. Other industries include ceramic, automotive, aerospace, jewelry making, dental/alloy appliance, and computer. It appears that some people may have a genetic predisposition towards developing severe CBD.

Beryllium exposure tends to occur via inhalation of beryllium fumes or dust, but it can also be absorbed following skin exposure. The organic forms of beryllium are rapidly excreted, but the insoluble inorganic particles can remain in the body for many years.
