CPAP cannot be used in individuals who are not spontaneously breathing. Patients with poor respiratory drive need invasive ventilation or non-invasive ventilation with CPAP plus additional pressure support and a backup rate (BiPAP).

The following are relative contraindications for CPAP:

- Uncooperative or extremely anxious patient

- Reduced consciousness and inability to protect their airway

- Unstable cardiorespiratory status or respiratory arrest

- Trauma or burnsÂ involving the face

- Facial, esophageal, or gastric surgery

- Air leak syndrome (pneumothorax with bronchopleural fistula)

- Copious respiratory secretions

- Severe nausea with vomiting

- Severe air trapping diseases with hypercarbia asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
