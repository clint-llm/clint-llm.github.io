Torsion of the testicular appendages is considered to be the most common cause of acute scrotal pain in prepubertal children and may even be the single most prevalent cause of pediatric orchalgia.

The appendix testis, sometimes called hydatid of Morgagni, is a vestigial remnant of the Mullerian duct and is present in 76% to 83% of testes.

The appendix epididymis is a vestigial Wolffian (mesonephric) duct remnant and is present in 22% to 28% of testes.
