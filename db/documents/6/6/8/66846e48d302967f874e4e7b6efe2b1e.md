TEN was previously considered to be related to Fas-Fas ligand or granulysin-mediated apoptosis. More recent studies suggested the reactive oxygen species (ROS) as the initiating factor for keratinocyte damage and that it precedes the activation of the beforementioned apoptotic systems.

Fas is a membrane-bound protein responsible for the initiation of programmed cell death through a series of intracellular events. Fas ligand (FasL), which is usually produced by cytotoxic T(CTL) cells and natural killer (NK) cells, tends to bind to Fas on target cells, initiating apoptosis. The fact that the number of these cells is low in skin biopsies taken from TEN patients indicates that they are not the source of FasL.

Oxidative stress is one of the proposed theories of TEN. Glutathione S-transferase-p (GST-p) is a biomarker of oxidative stress in keratinocytes. A higher level of this marker has been detected in TEN patients compared to other cutaneous drug reactions.
