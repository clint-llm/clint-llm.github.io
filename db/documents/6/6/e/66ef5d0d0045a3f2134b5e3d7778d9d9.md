The formation of the granulomas in GPA begins with the formation of neutrophilic microabscesses. The granulomas in GPA ultimately result in partial or total occlusion of blood vessels. The granulomas in GPA are not well-formed, unlike the ones in sarcoidosis or tuberculosis, and consist of giant cells surrounded by plasma cells, lymphocytes, and dendritic cells. These cells can damage the submucosa and penetrate the surrounding tissues, cartilage, or bone, resulting in necrosis and permanent deformities.
