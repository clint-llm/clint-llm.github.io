Type I LCD is caused by the accumulation of a mutant form of the transforming growth factor beta-induced protein, also called kerato-epithelin. It is the product of the TGFBI gene. While this protein is found throughout the body, its effects are limited to the cornea. These effects are most likely mediated by abnormal protein folding and precipitation as amyloid.

Type II LCD is caused by the accumulation of a mutant form of the protein gelsolin, resulting in amyloid deposits throughout the body. It is caused by the substitution of uncharged amino acids for asparagine at residue 187, resulting in a change in conformation. It is suggested that this conformational change causes the protein to form the previously described amyloid deposits.
