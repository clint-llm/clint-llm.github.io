One important disease that can be mistaken for encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis is peritoneal encapsulation. This is also a rare disease in which a thin accessory peritoneal membrane can surround various parts of the small bowel. This forms an accessory peritoneal sac typically asymptomatic and incidentally diagnosed but can also cause small bowel obstruction symptoms. This peritoneal sac is different from EPS as peritoneal encapsulation is a congenital malformation and not one that develops from chronic inflammation.

In addition, because many symptoms of EPS can be nonspecific gastrointestinal complaints, the differential diagnosis can be extensive, such as small bowel obstruction, gastroparesis, irritable bowel syndrome, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, peptic ulcer disease, pancreatitis, Crohn disease, retroperitoneal fibrosis, tumors, malignancy, hernias, and peritonitis.
