Navicular stress fractures are caused by overuse in the vast majority of instances, explaining the high incidence in competitive athletes. With this in mind, it is necessary to inform the patient of the value of proper training and technique in their athletic activities, as well as using appropriate equipment to reduce the amount of stress placed upon the foot. Additionally, fractures treated with immobilization more expediently typically have a more satisfactory clinical outcome, so the value of prompt evaluation cannot be overemphasized.
