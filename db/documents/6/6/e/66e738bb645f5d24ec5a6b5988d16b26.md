Cardiopulmonary fitness testing requires an interprofessional healthcare team effort, including exercise physiologists, physician assistants, nurses, physical therapists under the supervision of a cardiologist. When a patient is considered high risk for testing (example: in patients within seven days of myocardial ischemia, patients with malignant arrhythmia, severe pulmonary arterial hypertension), the recommendation is that direct supervision of the procedure and immediate availability of a cardiologist is needed to improve patient safety.
