Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) describes a transient and reversible contraction of bronchial smooth muscle after physical exertion that may or may not produce symptoms of dyspnea, chest tightness, wheezing, and cough. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of EIB and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB).
- Summarize the pathophysiology of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.
- Identify the typical management considerations for patients with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication among the interdisciplinary team to enhance care coordination for patients affected by exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.
