Not only is cotton dust implicated in the pathogenesis but also the endotoxin level in the work environment. This endotoxin is a lipopolysaccharide found in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria which resideÂ within the cotton dust. Exposure has been implicated as the key mediator of respiratory disease among these workers with studies showing a decline in FEV1 with endotoxin exposure. However, this is not uniform, and there seems to be a variable response - with an even greater decline in FEV1 in those with polymorphisms in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) gene.
