Subconjunctival hemorrhages, in general, do not have any gender discrepancy. However traumatic SCH was shown to be more prevalent in young males most likely related to performing heavy work and tendency to do more aggressive activities. The rate of spontaneous vs. traumatic varies depending on the population characteristics themselves. One study showed the incidence rate of non-traumatic SCH to be higher in women with a men to women ratio of 0.8.Â  It is with a wide consensus that spontaneous SCH increases with age, especially after the age of 50. This is due to the higher probability of comorbidities such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. There is also an increased incidence of SCH in the summer according to one study however this may be secondary to children presenting more often during summer vacation months.
