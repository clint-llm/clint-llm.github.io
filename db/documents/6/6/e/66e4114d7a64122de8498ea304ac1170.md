Glossopharyngeal neuralgia is an extremely rare condition. It accounts for 0.2 to 1.3% of all types of cranial neuralgias. One long-term study of the population in Rochester, Minnesota, from 1945 to 1984 showed a crude incidence rate of 0.7Â per 100000 population. The incidence was equal in both sexes. The overall rates increase with age in both males and females.

In 1981 Rushton et al. published a retrospective review of the data on 217 patients with glossopharyngeal neuralgia. These patients were seen at the Mayo Clinic from the years 1922 to 1977. 57% of the cases were in patients over 50 years of age, and 43% were between 18 to 50 years of age. Approximately 74% of patients had spontaneous remissions, whereas 17% experienced no relief. Only 12% of the patients had bilateral pain.
