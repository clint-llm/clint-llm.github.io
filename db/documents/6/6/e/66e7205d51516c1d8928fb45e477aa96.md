The physiotherapeutic approach is useful as a conservative therapy. It provides patient education on the correct shoulder position, or it can assist in the period in which the patient has to recover the post-surgery shoulder function. It is not always feasible to recover the range of motion. This will depend on multiple factors, such as the pathology, the type of intervention, the ability to withstand pain, etc.

The literature does not demonstrate a unanimous consensus regarding the osteopathic approach to the recovery of shoulder function or post-surgical pain relief.

Regarding the chiropractic approach to the recovery of shoulder function, both as a conservative practice and as a post-surgery recovery method, the literature is not unanimous, and long-term data are lacking.

The use of post-surgery taping on the shoulder could reduce the sensation of pain but not joint swelling, while using this instrument on unstable shoulders does not find consensus in the literature.

An interprofessional team approach is probably the best approach to patient recovery.
