Mechanical ventilation (MV) works by applying a positive pressure breath and is dependent on the compliance and resistance of the airway system. Although mechanical ventilation can be a complex and seemingly elusive topic, expectations are that healthcare professionals who deal with critically ill patients have a basic familiarity with the management of a patient on a ventilator. Providers must also recognize how applying mechanical ventilation affects patient physiology and response to disease states. The focus of this activity will be on managing the intubated patient in the first few hours of care on mechanical ventilation and will review the basics of mechanical ventilation and highlight ventilator strategies when managing a patient by an interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the basics of mechanical ventilator management.
- Describe the different ventilator strategies utilized for different disease processes.
- Outline major complications of mechanical ventilation.
- Summarize the advantages of a patient receiving mechanical ventilation.
