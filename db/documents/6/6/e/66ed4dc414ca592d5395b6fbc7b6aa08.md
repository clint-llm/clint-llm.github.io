Tumor Nodal Metastases, TNM staging developed by the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) is the commonly used staging system, and the latest version is the 8th edition released in 2018.

**T, the primary tumor:**

**TX**Primary tumor cannot be assessed.

**Tis**Carcinoma in situ

**T1**Tumour limited to one subsite of the hypopharynx and/or 2 cm or less in greatest dimension.

**T2**Tumour invades more than one subsite of the hypopharynx or an adjacent site or measures more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension without fixation of hemilarynx

**T3**Tumour more than 4 cm in greatest dimension, or with fixation of hemilarynx or extension to oesophageal mucosa

**T4a**Moderately advanced local disease; Tumour invades any of the following: thyroid/ cricoid cartilage, hyoid bone, thyroid gland, esophagus, or central compartment soft tissue.

**T4b**Very advanced local disease; Tumour invades prevertebral fascia, encases carotid artery, or invades mediastinal structures.

**N, nodal status:**

**NX**Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed.

**N0**No regional lymph node metastasis

**N1**Metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node ≤ 3 cm in greatest dimension and extranodal extension (ENE) negative

**N2a**Single ipsilateral lymph node ≤ 3 cm and ENE+ or single ipsilateral lymph node > 3 cm but ≤ 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE negative

**N2b**Metastases in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none > 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE negative

**N2c**Metastases in bilateral or contralateral lymph node(s), none > 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE negative

**N3a**Metastasis in a lymph node that is > 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE negative

**N3b**Metastasis in either:

- Single ipsilateral lymph node, > 3 cm with ENE or

- Multiple ipsilateral, contralateral, or bilateral lymph nodes, any with ENE or

- Single contralateral lymph node of any size and ENE

**M, metastatic status:**

**M0**No distant metastasis

**M1**Distant metastasis
