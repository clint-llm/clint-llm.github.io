There are many challenges in implementing multifaceted enhanced recovery strategies such as ERACS. Cardiac surgical care will always involve a multidisciplinary team effort starting from the initial diagnosis to the eventual post-surgical recovery. As such, having standardized preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative protocols for all the team members is crucial in implementing a successful ERACS program. In addition, ERACS is still relatively new, and it will be a while before data from large-scale randomized trials are available. It is important to gather as much data as possible for all the relevant events and interventions before and after the ERACS implementation to assess the efficacy.
