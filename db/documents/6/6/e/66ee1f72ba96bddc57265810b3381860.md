All peripheral nerve fibers consist of three connective tissue layers, which serve as a protective connective sheath. The epineurium is the outermost layer of dense connective tissue that encloses the entire peripheral nerve. Within the epineurium, there are several nerve fascicles that are individuallyÂ surrounded by the perineum. These fascicles are made up of myelinated individual nerve fibers surrounded by endoneurium.
