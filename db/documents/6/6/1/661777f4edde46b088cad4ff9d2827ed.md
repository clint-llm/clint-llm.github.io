Proper functioning of protein catabolism is of utmost importance to sustain the metabolic needs of the human body. The breakdown of large polypeptide chains to unleash free essential and non-essential amino acids provides cells with the needed substrates for protein synthesis or energy creation. Intracellular protein breakdown is important for normal turnoverÂ as well as in malnutrition and malnourished physiological states to mobilize amino acids for export to support the energetic demands of vital organs. Protein catabolism defects can lead to a variety of clinical presentations affecting almost every organ system.
