Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is classified as focal, segmental, and diffuse. The diffuse form is more common, which is further staged byÂ Malek and Elder into three different stages according to the extent of involvement in the nearby tissues.

- Stage 1 (Nephric): Disease limited to the kidney.

- Stage 2 (Perinephric): Disease involving the renal pelvis or the peri-renal fat within Gerota fascia.

- Stage 3 (Paranephric): Disease involving the wider area, including the adjacent organs or retroperitoneum.
