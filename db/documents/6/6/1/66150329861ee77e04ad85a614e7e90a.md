Erb palsy, or Erb-Duchenne paralysis, is one of the most common neurological birth injuries. It is caused by injury to the brachial plexus, which is formed from the ventral rami of cervical nerves 5 to 8 and thoracic nerve 1. The brachial plexus innervates all muscles of the upper limb except the trapezius. Erb palsy occurs when the upper trunk of the brachial plexus, comprising cervical nerves 5 and 6, is severed. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of Erb palsy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Erb palsy.
- Describe the physical findings in a patient with Erb palsy.
- List the treatment and management options available for Erb palsy.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and advance the treatment of Erb palsy and improve patient outcomes.
