Patients with fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) who have developed strokes should be properly educated in this regard. Further education regarding FMD should help patients recognize further symptoms that may indicate disease progression or complications. Education regarding other risk factors for stroke should be provided including abstinence from smoking, the benefits of a healthy diet, and good glycemic control. Patients should be informed about the risk of dissection and cautioned to avoid neck trauma and rigorous neck manipulations.
