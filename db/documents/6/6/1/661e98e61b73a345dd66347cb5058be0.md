Lorazepam, like other benzodiazepine medications, can be a highly addictive medication. As a result, an interprofessional team approach to prescribing and managing these medications is necessary. This team includes the prescribers (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), psychiatrists, nursing staff, and pharmacists, each of whom must be vigilant for signs of misuse or adverse effects. This approach will prevent misuse and unintended adverse events and optimize therapy. [Level 5]

Great care is necessary when prescribing lorazepam at high doses or prolonged durations, particularly in patients with a history of substance use disorder or concurrent opioid prescriptions. Managing such patients requires an interprofessional team that includes nurses, pharmacists, and several specialist clinicians, to monitor for signs of abuse, diversion, or concomitant use with other prescription or non-prescription sedative medications. Prescribers and pharmacists must monitor treatment, provide patient education, and be vigilant in prescribing benzodiazepines such as lorazepam. The prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) can identify potential misuse of lorazepam.

The interprofessional healthcare team should use state and federal controlled substance monitoring and diversion databases to identify high-risk patients with multiple and frequent prescriptions for benzodiazepines, opioids, muscle relaxants, and other sedative-hypnotics. Safe prescribing is only achievable with interprofessional treatment monitored by both the clinician and pharmacist. [Level 5]
