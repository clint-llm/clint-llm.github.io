The typical patient with recurrent UTIs does not require either cystoscopy or any urological imaging.

In women with a history of recurrent UTI who present with typical symptoms, no further urological evaluation is necessary other than a urine culture and sensitivity, even though the diagnosis of recurrent cystitis can be made clinically. Urine cultures should be performed in the setting of a severe infection or high risk of antibiotic resistance (multidrug-resistant isolate; recent inpatient admission; recent antibiotic use; a history of travel to India, Israel, Spain, or Mexico). Urine cultures are also necessary to differentiate recurrent infections (repeat infections with different organisms) from relapsing (identical organisms on culture). Relapsing infections suggest a persistent source of bacterial inoculation, such as an abscess, chronic bacterial prostatitis, or an infected stone. The American Urological Guidelines on recurrent urinary tract infections in women recommend obtaining a urinalysis and urine culture with each episode of acute cystitis.

Urological imaging is advised for only a select group of women. Indications for urological imaging include relapsing infections, persistent hematuria after treatment; a history of stone passage; or repeated isolation of Proteus from the urine, which is often associated with renal stones. Preferred imaging modalities include renal ultrasonography or, ideally, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis.

A variety of sampling methods have been described to establish the diagnosis of UTI in the pediatric population. However, obtaining the urine sample utilizing suprapubic aspiration or catheterization might result in lower contamination and more reliable results. Moreover, if the urine sample has been collected through a plastic bag, several more steps should be undertaken to rule out the possibility of UTI, including dipstick evaluation and microscopic analysis. The presence of leukocyte esterase and nitrite on a urinary dipstick and the possibility of pyuria and bacteriuria; both should be excluded to rule out the impression of a UTI. Utilizing a clean voided midstream urine sample for the diagnosis is limited to toilet-trained children.

Performing a cystoscopy solely for the diagnosis of recurrent UTIs is rarely indicated as it might induce an ascending lower urinary tract infection. Cystoscopy is rarely helpful when utilized routinely; however, it might be useful in a few circumstances, including post-operative exclusion and management of possible ureteral injuries, to evaluate incomplete bladder emptying or to identify possibly bladder calculi. Even the optimal recommended type of irrigation fluid used during cystoscopy has been investigated. For instance, in the study conducted by Lauren N. Siff et al. during 8 months in the urogynecology departments of the joined clinics within the Cleveland health system, the authors explored the significantly higher rate of UTI in those patients who had undergone cystoscopy with 10% dextrose water in comparison with normal saline.
