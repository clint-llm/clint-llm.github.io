**Pathophysiology**

An avulsion fracture occurs when a ligament or other soft tissue attachment to bone overcomes the stress capacity of the bony attachment and tears off a portion of the bone. This usually occurs with forces applied from trauma.

The anatomic position of some ligaments put them at risk with traumatic mechanisms involving external directional or rotational forces specific to that body part.

Some avulsion fractures can become quite displaced due to the distracting soft tissue forces, while the displacement of the avulsed fragment in other areas is prevented from migration by additional soft tissue attachments that remain intact; therefore, holding it relatively non-displaced, or very close to its attachment site.

The pathophysiology of sports-related injuries is often related to throwing, the eccentric phase of any sporting activity, rapid acceleration or deceleration, kicking, running, jumping, or abrupt changing of direction.

In the adolescent population, avulsion injuries are almost always the result of failure through the apophysis.

The described imbalance between muscle strength and the weaker unfused apophysis increases with continued growth and maturation until the physis fuses.

Bony avulsions are less common overall in adults because once the physis closes or ossifies, the connection between the apophysis and the body of bone becomes stronger, and is no longer the weakest structure in the transference of force between the soft tissue and the bone.

In some areas of the body, the pathophysiology of avulsion fractures is altogether unique. For example, in adolescent tibial tubercle avulsion fractures, the portion of the proximal tibial physis deep to the ossifying tibial tubercle apophysis is composed of fibrocartilage until just before physeal fusion. Close to the time of fusion, this fibrocartilage segment is replaced by weaker hyaline cartilage, which predisposes the tibial tubercle to avulsion fractures during this distinct age and timeframe of development.

The reason behind avulsion fractures in the post-surgical setting may be due to the weakening of bone from removal or alteration during surgery. For example, avulsions of the anterior superior iliac spine, commonly only seen in adolescents, is reported in adults after undergoing bone harvesting procedures from the iliac crest.

**Mechanisms**

The avulsion mechanism at a myotendinous attachment site involves an indirect muscle pull such as forceful flexion or extension of a joint against a myotendinous contraction attempting to move the joint in the opposite direction.

There are many cases with no external trauma, where a body part can be forced into extreme ranges of motion. In such scenarios, there is likely an associated protective forceful muscular contraction that leads to the avulsion of bone.

Dislocation of a joint can cause indirect forces from the distraction force resulting in capsular avulsion fractures, or Shear injury.

The most common mechanism of avulsion fracture in the adolescent population is sudden tension across an open apophysis from the forceful contraction of a large muscle. Often in an attempt to accelerate or decelerate a limb or the body mass.

Chronic mechanisms whereby avulsion fracture can be the result, stem from repetitive traction, microtrauma, and overuse traction-type injuries.

Along with avulsion fractures, the mechanism by which so many associated soft tissue injuries occur varies with each joint or body part. These additional soft tissue injuries which happen in concert with avulsion fractures may not be seen or apparent on imaging. Whether the visualized avulsion injury or its associated soft tissue injury occurred first, the general concept that stabilizing soft tissues each plays distinct and intertwined roles in physiologic movement and ranges of motion remains the same. Disruption of one stabilizing structure as a result of the injury force can drastically affect or cause injury to many other related stabilizing soft tissue structures or the cartilage. Without the protection of the normal physiologic restraints, the force and instability lead to additional unnatural forces and further potential destruction.
