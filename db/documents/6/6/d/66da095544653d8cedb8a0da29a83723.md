Although photoprotection is indicated in all age groups, the 1999 FDA Sunscreen Final Monograph recommended that parents of children under the age of 6 months should consult a physician before sunscreen administration in this age group. This recommendation is due to the lack of infant metabolism development and excretion of the chemically absorbed agents within sunscreen. If sunscreen is necessary, it should be limited and infrequently used on sun-exposed areas of the body only.
