The pathophysiology of MOH is not well understood, but studies have demonstrated that central sensitization likely plays a major role.

The thinking is that the insertion/deletion polymorphism in the gene that encodes an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) increases an individualâ€™s susceptibility to MOH. ACE is a key enzyme in regulating blood pressure, but in the brain, it interacts with monoaminergic synaptic transmission, thereby contributing to dependence behavior. ACE polymorphisms seen in MOH patients have been demonstrated to influence sensitization and habituation patterns. Other potential polymorphisms are a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), and serotonin transporter (SERT).

Animal studies have also demonstrated that pain medications alone can cause altered neurotransmitter metabolism, especially serotoninergic and endocannabinoid systems.
