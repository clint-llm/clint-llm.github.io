Caustic ingestions are severe causes of morbidity and mortality and can easily affect all age groups. 80% of the total cases of caustic ingestion in the United States occur in children. Caustic ingestions are cause for emergent treatment and require coordination between both surgical and medical therapies for the best outcomes. Clinicians must be aware of common pitfalls and resources available to them. Most ingestions (especially in children) are non-toxic and may be managed at home, but immediate triage, rapid evaluation, and the timely institution of treatment are critical in producing favorable outcomes.
