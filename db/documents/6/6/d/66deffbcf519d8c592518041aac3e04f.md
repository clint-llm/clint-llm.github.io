For years, the Bowditch phenomenon concept - increasing heart rate to enhance inotropy - was exploited to devise a therapeutic modality for the failing heart.

This exploration has eventually led to the paradigm shift to current therapeutic knowledge of the role of long-term use of beta-blockers in improved cardiac function.
