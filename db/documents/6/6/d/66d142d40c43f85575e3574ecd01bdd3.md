Superimposed infections of the affected regions are the most common complication of this disease. Due to the often underlying immunocompromised status of the patients, the risk of associated sepsis is high as well.

Less severe, though equally devastating complication of this disease is debility due to pain. Calciphylaxis lesions are extremely painful and result in significant morbidity for the patients.
