Damage to the lumbar plexus or nerves proximal and distal to it can result in several pathologies.Â  Lumbar disc herniation can result in occlusion of the intervertebral foramen, which can compress lumbar spinal nerves proximal to their entrance to the lumbar plexus. This condition can result in paresthesia and weakness of the areas innervated by nerves of the lumbar plexus. Commonly, peripheral nerves and the lumbar plexus can suffer damage due to trauma.

An important reflex to note is the cremasteric reflex. The femoral portion of the genitofemoral nerve and the ilioinguinal nerve provide the afferent fibers for this reflex. The genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve supplies motor innervation to the cremaster muscle is responsible for the efferent. As the afferent portion is the sensory aspect, stroking the medial thigh should cause contraction of the cremasteric muscle result in the ascension of the scrotum. In patients with testicular torsion, the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve will become entrapped, and this reflex will be absent.

A common and significant nerve compression syndrome can arise from the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, which is a branch of the lumbar plexus. This syndrome is called meralgia paresthetica and is caused usually by entrapment of the nerve as it passes under, or through the inguinal ligament.
