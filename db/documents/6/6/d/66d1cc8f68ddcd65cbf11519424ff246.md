In most of the cases, nodular cortical hyperplasia is ACTH-independent. The glands are massively enlarged, mimicking a neoplasm. The cortical nodules in the late-stage sometimes show a transformation from diffuse hyperplasia; these nodules are yellow and vary in size from 0.2 to over 4.0 cm. The nodules compose of fasciculata-type clear cells, reticularis-type cells, or a mixture of both cell types. Distinct nodules with zona glomerulosa hyperplasia and intervening cortical atrophy are observed in children with McCune-Albright syndrome.

In PPNAD (sometimes referred to as “micronodular adrenal disease”), the glands are usually of normal size, although they can be small or slightly enlarged. Multiple pigmented cortical nodules are present with commonly seen intervening atrophic cortex.
