Atrial septal defect (ASD) is one of the most common types of congenital heart defects, occurring in about 25% of children. An atrial septal defect occurs when there is a failure to close the communication between the right and left atria. It encompasses defects involving both the true septal membrane and other defects that allow for communication between both atria. There are five types of atrial septal defects ranging from most frequent to least: patent foramen ovale, ostium secundum defect, ostium primum defect, sinus venosus defect, and coronary sinus defect. Small atrial septal defects usually spontaneously close in childhood. Large defects that do not close spontaneously may require percutaneous or surgical intervention to prevent further complications such as stroke, dysrhythmias, and pulmonary hypertension. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of atrial septal defect and highlights the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of atrial septal defect.
- Outline the presentation of a patient with atrial septal defect.
- Describe the treatment and management options available for atrial septal defect.
- Explain the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding the management of patients with atrial septal defect.
