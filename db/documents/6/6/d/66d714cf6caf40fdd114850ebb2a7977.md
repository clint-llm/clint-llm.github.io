With a recurrence rate of 30% with immersion, underlying pathologies, and the potential for severe or fatal outcomes, a diagnosis and reversal of underlying causes of IPE should occur before participation in further diving, snorkeling, or energetic swimming. A delay in an investigation for underlying cardiac pathology such as reversible cardiomyopathies may result in normalization of the transitory anomalies. If these tests are performed many days after the event, they may be misleading, resulting in medical and cardiac “clearance to resume diving” with potentially unfortunate subsequent incidents and deaths. If individuals continue to dive and snorkel, there should also be an emphasis on limiting contributing factors by using thermal protection, not overhydrating, ensuring minimal equipment resistance, avoiding excessive exertion, avoiding beta-blockers, or sympathomimetics, using companion divers, and always having emergency oxygen and medivac capability.
