Most of the purported causes of arachnoiditis appear to be iatrogenic. It is, therefore, important to recognize that arachnoiditis is a rare but possible complication of various treatments, including surgery and injections. The iatrogenic aspect of the cause of arachnoiditis should be considered and brought to a patient's attention when discussing the risks and benefits of an invasive spinal procedure or surgery. For instance, up to 90% of arachnoiditis has been linked to lumbar spine surgery. It is a common and current medical practice to deliver various medications in or near the spinal fluid space, such as steroids, local anesthetics, contrast agents, and chemotherapeutic agents. Although the true risk of arachnoiditis remains unknown and appears to be low, the possibility of this type of neurologic injury should be recognized and considered when assessing the potentials benefits and risks of invasive spinal procedures, surgery, or injections.
