The optic fissure exists as a transient element in the development of the optic nerve, but despite its transience, it carries crucial functional significance for the time it exists. The optic fissure contains the hyaloid artery, allowing it to supply the developing inner chamber of the eye without penetrating the neuroectoderm. Beginning at week 5, the edges of theÂ **optic fissure**begin to fuse, and by week seven, closure is complete with the most distal apposition of these edges becoming the pupil. Once closure of the optic fissure is complete, the two layers of neuroectoderm comprising the stalk continue to proliferate to the point of apposition and fusion. Cells from the inner layer of neural tissue interact to form a neural network, and thereby the optic nerve is born. A narrow hollow space remains inside the stalk containing a remnant of the hyaloid artery, which gives rise to the central artery of the retina.
