The pathology of osteonecrosis is the same irrespective of its etiology. Ischemia and necrosis prevent repair, cause bone resorption, and replacement with granulation tissue. The resulting acellular region compromises mechanical stability, which leads to the eventual collapse of the affected condyles.

The degenerative nature of this disease dictates that if left undiagnosed and untreated, the patient's clinical condition will deteriorate. If diagnosed and treated conservatively in the early stages of the disease, the patient may avoid the inherent risks associated with surgery. Unfortunately, in current practice, very few patients with SON are detected in the early stages of the disease, and even if they are, subsequent surgery may well be required.
