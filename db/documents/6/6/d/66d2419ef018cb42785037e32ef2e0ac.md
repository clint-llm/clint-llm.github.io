The adverse effects, according to incidence and severity, are as follows:

- >10%: Hemorrhage (5% to 28%); major hemorrhage (≤4%)- including intracranial, GI, retinal, epidural hematoma, adrenal bleeding - have been reported. By far, the most common complication is bleeding, and risk factors for bleeding include bacterial endocarditis, underlying congenital or acquired bleeding disorders, vascular retinopathy, thrombocytopenia, recent procedure/surgery, stroke, neuraxial procedures, uncontrolled hypertension, renal impairment, recent major bleeding, concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis, and advanced age. Clinical evaluation is necessary for any unexplained decrease in hemoglobin or blood pressure.

- 1% to 10%:

- Central nervous system: Dizziness (2%), insomnia (2%), fatigue (1%), depression (1%), anxiety (1%), and syncope (1%)
- Dermatologic: Wound secretion (3%), pruritus (2%), and skin blister (1%)
- Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain (3%)
- Hepatic: Increased serum transaminases to >3 x ULN (2% 
- Neuromuscular & skeletal: Back pain (3%), limb pain (2%), and muscle spasm (1%)

- Other rare effects: Bronchiectasis and pulmonary hemorrhage

- <1% (discovered in postmarketing and/or reported cases): Agranulocytosis, anemia, anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock, angioedema, cerebral hemorrhage, cholestasis, DRESS syndrome, injection site hematoma, hemiparesis, hemophthalmos, hepatic injury, hypersensitivity, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, intracranial hemorrhage, jaundice, retroperitoneal hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, and thrombocytopenia

**US Boxed Warning**

- Increased risk of thrombotic events can occur with premature cessation of rivaroxaban, so when discontinuing the drug for reasons besides pathological bleeding or completing the course of therapy, the addition of alternative anticoagulant therapy should merit consideration.

- Spinal or epidural hematomas may occur with a spinal puncture or neuraxial anesthesia (epidural or spinal anesthesia) procedures. The risk of spinal/epidural hematoma increases with indwelling epidural catheters, concomitant use of other drugs that may affect hemostasis in patients with a history of epidural or spinal punctures, or patients with a history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery. Assessment of risks versus benefits is necessary for patients who are anticoagulated or pharmacologic anticoagulation is anticipated before neuraxial procedures. The optimal timing between the administration of rivaroxaban and neuraxial procedures is unknown.
