The diagnosis of primary ovarian insufficiency can be devastating, especially to women who desire fertility. While it is not a deadly diagnosis in and of itself, it does impact a womanâ€™s overall well-being. Physicians should be honest with patients regarding this diagnosis and provide encouragement that many of the physical symptoms of POI can be treated with hormone replacement therapy, and the possibility of spontaneous conception exists as the course of POI is variable and unpredictable. It is very important to provide support and resources that these women may utilize to help them cope with the psychosocial stresses (anxiety, depression, guilt, decreased sexual desire) that coincide with POI. Proper counseling for patients includes a discussion regarding how low estrogen levels can affect bone, cardiovascular, neurocognitive, and mental health. Patients with POI require close follow-up to ensure they are receiving the necessary hormonal replacement and are not having complications of such medications. With proper estrogen replacement, women with POI can live healthy, long lives.
