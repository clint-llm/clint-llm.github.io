CPM is a well-established technique for performing a number of open-heart procedures. The procedure is only done by the cardiac surgeon. However, the technique is associated with a number of complications that may be managed by the intensivist, internist, nephrologist, neurologist, and gastroenterologist. The procedure can be associated with a stroke, multiorgan failure, bleeding, infection,Â and renal failure. These patients are monitored in a cardiac surgical unit by ICU nurses until they are stable.
