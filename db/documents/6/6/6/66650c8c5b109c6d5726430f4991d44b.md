As previously mentioned, CNS infection occurs in the majority if not all of the patients with syphilis; however, spontaneous resolution can occur without an inflammatory response. Alternatively, transient or persistent meningitis can occur; in the latter case, they are deemed to have developed neurosyphilis. Neurosyphilis may be asymptomatic or present in an early symptomatic phase, but eventually, if allowed to go untreated, a late symptomatic disease may ensue that is discussed further under history and physical.

Treponema pallidum gains access to the body through tiny abrasions of the skin and mucous membranes. Subsequently, mucopolysacharidase helps with its attachment to the host cells causing obliterative endarteritis and necrotic changes in the terminal arterioles.
