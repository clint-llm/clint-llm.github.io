The body's core internal temperature has a narrow range and typically ranges 97-99 F with tight regulation. When the bodyâ€™s ability to thermoregulate becomes disrupted it can result in overheating (hyperthermia) or being too cool (hypothermia). Either state can have deleterious effects on the various body systems, most significantly reduced blood flow leading to ischemia and multiple organ failure.
