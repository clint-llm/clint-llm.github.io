Several cellular and molecular mechanisms explain the beneficial effects of immunotherapy including allergic specific suppression of inducible CD4(+), CD 25+, forkhead box p3+ T-regulatory cells, and IL-10 secreting T-regulatory cells, preventing their increase in peripheral blood. Other mechanisms include suppression of eosinophils, mast cells, and basophils, and the switching of antibodies from IgE to IgG4 blocking antibodies.
