- The C-arm. It is called that because its C-shaped arm places the X-ray source and X-ray detector face to face. It is a fluoroscopy system, also named imaging scanner intensifier. The devices provide high-resolution X-ray images in real-time, helping for catheter placement and positioning during EP study procedure, allowing left and right oblique positions.

- The radiographic table. Patient placement is in a horizontal position on this table during procedures. The table allows moving forward and backward, left and right, to help the catheter insertion and positioning.

- Specialized EP equipment consists of a data acquisition system, cardiac stimulator, and radiofrequency energy generator. Other pieces of equipment needed in an EP laboratory are arterial pressure monitor and cuff, pulse-oximeter, external defibrillator, resuscitation equipment (intubation kit, emergency drugs), and temporary external pacemaker.
