Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a circulatory problem causing a reduced blood flow through the arteries. This typically reduces blood flow to the extremities manifesting as thigh or calf pain during walking or exertion. This activity describes the evaluation and management of peripheral arterial disease and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the risk factors for developing peripheral arterial disease.
- Explain the role of atherosclerosis in the pathophysiology of peripheral arterial disease.
- Identify the use of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) in the evaluation of peripheral arterial disease.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team members to advocate for lifestyle changes to improve outcomes and prevent the progression of peripheral arterial disease.
