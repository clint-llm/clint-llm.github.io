Adamantinoma is a rare tumor accounting for approximately 0.4% of all primary malignant bone tumors. There is a slight male predominance with a sex ratio of 5:4. Adamantinomas frequently occur in young to middle-aged adults between the ages of 20 to 40. The pediatric and elderly populations are rarely affected. The most common sites involved by adamantinoma are the anterior metaphysis or diaphysis of the tibia. Other sites include the fibula, ulna, femur, humerus, and radius.
