Perinatal asphyxia is a lack of blood flow or gas exchange to or from the fetus in the period immediately before, during, or after the birth process. Perinatal asphyxia can result in profound systemic and neurologic sequelae due decreased blood flow and/or oxygen to a fetus or infant during the peripartum period. When placental (prenatal) or pulmonary (immediate post-natal) gas exchange is compromised or ceases altogether, there is partial (hypoxia) or complete (anoxia) lack of oxygen to the vital organs. This results in progressive hypoxemia and hypercapnia. If the hypoxemia is severe enough, the tissues and vital organs (muscle, liver, heart, and ultimately the brain) will develop an oxygen debt. Anaerobic glycolysis and lactic acidosis will result.  Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy refers specifically to the neurologic sequelae of perinatal asphyxia.

The diagnostic criteria for neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy are as follows:

- Metabolic acidosis with pH <7.0 (in umbilical cord or infant blood sample)

- Base Deficit -12

- APGAR score = five at 10 minutes with a continued need for resuscitation

- Presence of multiple organ-system failures

- Clinical evidence of encephalopathy:  hypotonia, abnormal oculomotor or pupillary movements, weak or absent suck, apnea, hyperpnea, or clinical seizures

- Neurologic findings cannot be attributed to other cause (inborn error of metabolism, a genetic disorder, congenital neurologic disorder, medication effect)
