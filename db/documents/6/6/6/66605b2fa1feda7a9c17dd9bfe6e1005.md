The annual rate of serum sickness incidence is low. In one meta-analysis, the incidence of serum sickness following the administration of Crotalidae polyvalent immune Fab antivenom usedÂ for crotaline snake envenomation was 0.13%.

Further, the probability of developing serum sickness is dependent on the dose and varies by antigen type. For example, serum sickness associated with equine origin anti-rabies serum is more likely than tetanus antitoxin (16.3% vs. 2.5% to 5%).
