Hemorrhagic disorder of the newborn is a bleeding disorder that manifests in the first few weeks of life after delivery. The term hemorrhagic disorder of the newborn encompasses all hemorrhagic diseases, i.e., due to vitamin K deficiency, trauma, clotting factor deficiency, etc. When the cause is vitamin K deficiency, it is referred to as vitamin K deficiency bleeding or VKDB. Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin mainly synthesized in adults by gut bacteria. Newborns, however, have minimal vitamin K reserves in their liver during the time of delivery and are not able to synthesize vitamin K due to a sterile gut. Hence they are at risk of developing the hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. One of the main functions of vitamin K is gamma-carboxylation of coagulant factors- 2,7,9 and 10. This converts inactive clotting factors into an active state. Deficiency leads to the inadequate activity of these clotting factors, which results in bleeding.

Hemorrhagic disease of the newborn can be categorized into three groups. These groups are separated based on the age of onset.

- Early: Occurs within the first 24 hours of birth, can also occur in-utero or during delivery.

- Classical: 1 week of neonatal life (2ndÂ through 7th day)

- Late: From 8 days to up to 6-12 months.
