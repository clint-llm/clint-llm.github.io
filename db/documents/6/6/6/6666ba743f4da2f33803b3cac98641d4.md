Folate is an essential water-soluble vitamin, naturally present in food, especially in fruits, green leafy vegetables, and liver. Folic acid is the synthesized form of folate present in fortified foods and supplements and has a higher bioavailability than naturally occurring folate. Folate has been added to grains in the United States, to prevent congenital disabilities, especially neural tube defects, as it is necessary for the formation of several coenzymes in many metabolic systems and maintenance in erythropoiesis. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of folate deficiency and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review various possible etiologies leading to folic acid deficiency.
- Describe the pathophysiology of folic acid deficiency.
- Summarize the treatment and management options for folic acid deficiency.
- Explain the importance of interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to aid in prompt diagnosis of folic acid deficiency and improving outcomes in patients diagnosed with the condition.
