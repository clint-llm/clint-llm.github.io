**Serine and Glycine Cycle**

Serine is a non-essential amino acid that can be obtained from supplements and in our diet. Glycine can form in our tissues from serine. Serine is the primary carbon source in the conversion of tetrahydrofolate to N5, N10-methylene tetrahydrofolate. Glycine production also occurs in this reaction. The formation of serine requires a hydroxymethyl group from N5, N10-methylene tetrahydrofolate, and a glycine residue in the reverse reaction.

**Methionine Cycle**

Methionine is an essential amino acid converted to S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) that participates in various methylation reactions and results in the formation of S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH). SAM acts as a methyl donor, where it can donate single carbons to assist with the production of nucleic acids, proteins and neurotransmitters, and other methyltransferase reactions. Next, the adenosyl group is removed from SAH to form homocysteine. A methyl group is donated by methylcobalamin (B12) to homocysteine, which forms methionine. This reaction also requires the enzyme methionine synthase.  Resultant cobalamin (without the methyl group) can be regenerated back to methylcobalamin by accepting the methyl group from N5-methyl THF. This process allows the recycling of N5-methyl THF to THF for reuse.
