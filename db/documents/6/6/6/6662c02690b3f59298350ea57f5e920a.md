In the proper clinical scenario, imaging findings of a well-defined cystic mass near the pancreas is almost certainly indicative of a pancreatic pseudocyst. However, histopathology may be required to differentiate a pseudocyst from malignant cystic lesions, most commonly mucinous cystadenoma. EUS guided fine needle aspiration can be used to obtain a tissue sample to identify cyst wall histology and quantify tumor marker levels of the cyst fluid.

Depending on which part of the cyst is sampled, the histological tissue identified may vary.  The biopsied areas may contain any combination of benign pseudocyst tissue, carcinoma in situ, or areas of advanced malignancy. Therefore, a negative biopsy does not necessarily rule out malignancy. Given this variability, it is recommended to use histological sampling in conjunction with tumor marker levels to increase the accuracy of diagnosing a malignant cyst. A CEA level of greater than 400 ng/mL within the cystic fluid strongly suggests a mucinous lesion; these levels are usually lower in a pancreatic pseudocyst.
