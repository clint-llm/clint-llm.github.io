Contrast sensitivity (CS) is the ability to perceive sharp and clear outlines of very small objects.

A patient can have 20/20 visual acuity in many ocular diseases with loss of CS. Sometimes the loss of CS can be more psychologically disturbing than the loss of visual acuity.

Contrast can be defined as the degree of blackness to the whiteness of a particular object or a target. The contrast threshold is the minimum contrast required to perceive an object clearly.

CS varies with the luminance, target, grating motion, and grating shape. Neural mechanism and channel theory have more profound insights into the mechanism of CS. The factors which affect CS are refractive error, age, cataract surgery, refractive surgery, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, optic neuropathy, pituitary adenoma, etc. This activity deals with the pathophysiology, indications, types, factors affecting, methods of measuring, and clinical implications of CS.
