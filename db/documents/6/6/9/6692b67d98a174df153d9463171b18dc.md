**Sternal Malformations/Defects**

- **Cleft sternum**
- A cleft sternum (sternal cleft) is a developmental anomaly caused by the failure of fusion of the two lateral mesodermal sternal bars which later form the body of the sternum.

- **Pectus excavatum**
- Interestingly, there are reports of the sternal malformation of pectus excavatum even in ancient Egyptian mummies in medico-historical literature.

- **Pectus carinatum**
- The estimated incidence of pectus carinatum is 4 to 13 times less than that of pectus excavatum.

- **Sternal Foramen**
- The estimated incidence of sternal foramen is 2.5% to 13.8% of the general population.
