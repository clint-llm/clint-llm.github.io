Complications after a triple arthrodesis include:

- Wound dehiscence, possibly due to aggressive tissue handling techniques or arterial insult; this is manageable via aggressive post-operative wound care.

- Pseudo or non-union of arthrodesis sites may occur, possibly due to improper joint resection or lack of rigid internal fixation.  Further immobilization post-operative, bone stimulators, or a repeat procedure may be performed to correct.

- The most common joint for non-union in a triple arthrodesis is the talonavicular joint.

- Hardware failure, possibly due to improper patient immobilization after surgery or due to non-union. If asymptomatic, no further management may be needed; however, a repeat procedure may necessary.

- Infection managed by antimicrobial therapy

- Vascular disruption to the talus due to arterial insult during dissection.

- Early osteoarthritis of the ankle joint due to the improper final position of the arthrodesis sites.
