Progesterone is a steroid hormone; thus, its mechanism is very similar to the bodyâ€™s other steroid hormones, such as estrogen and glucocorticoids, which utilize intracellular receptors for their method of action. Due to the lipophilic nature of progesterone, it can readily cross the membrane of a target cell and bind to and activate progesterone receptors located within the cytoplasm. This progesterone and receptor complex then transports to the nucleus and binds to DNA, specifically near the promoter regions of genes that contain enhancers, containing hormone response elements. This binding of the complex to the promoter can either enhance or repress transcription, which ultimately alters the production of proteins.
