There is an intricate balance between the organisms residing in the lower respiratory tract and the local and systemic defense mechanisms (both innate and acquired) which when disturbed gives rise to inflammation of the lung parenchyma, i.e., pneumonia. Common defense mechanisms that are compromised in the pathogenesis of pneumonia include:

- Systemic defense mechanisms like humoral and complement-mediated immunity that is compromised in diseases like common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), X-linked agammaglobulinemia (inherited), and functional asplenia (acquired). Impaired cell-mediated immunity predisposes individuals to infection by intracellular organisms like viruses and organisms of low virulence like Pneumocystis pneumonia (PJP), fungal causes, among others

- The mucociliary clearance that is often impaired in cigarette smokers, post-viral state, Kartergerner syndrome, and other related conditions

- Impaired cough reflex seen in comatose patients, certain substances of abuse

- Accumulation of secretions as seen in cystic fibrosis or bronchial obstruction

The resident macrophages serve to protect the lung from foreign pathogens. Ironically, the inflammatory reaction triggered by these very macrophages is what is responsible for the histopathological and clinical findings seen in pneumonia. The macrophages engulf these pathogens and trigger signal molecules or cytokines like TNF-a, IL-8, and IL-1 that recruit inflammatory cells like neutrophils to the site of infection. They also serve to present these antigens to the T cells that trigger both cellular and humoral defense mechanisms, activate complement and form antibodies against these organisms. This, in turn, causes inflammation of the lung parenchyma and makes the lining capillaries "leaky," which leads to exudative congestion and underlines the pathogenesis of pneumonia.
