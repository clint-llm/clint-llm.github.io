Dyspnea results from a complex interplay of multiple factors, and its treatment requires careful evaluation and an individualized approach to management. Generally speaking, the sensation of dyspnea arises from the awareness of a respiratory supply-and-demand mismatch. Such a mismatch can result from the perception of increased demand, decreased capacity, or a combination of both.
