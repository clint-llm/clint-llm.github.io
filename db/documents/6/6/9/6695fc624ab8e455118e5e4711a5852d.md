Venlafaxine causes a lower frequency of anticholinergic, sedating, and cardiovascular side effects but a higher incidence of gastrointestinal complaints, sleep impairment, and sexual dysfunction than TCAs. Additionally, venlafaxine may impair sexual function, resulting in diminished libido, impotence, or difficulty achieving orgasm. Sexual dysfunction frequently results in noncompliance and should be asked about specifically. Sexual dysfunction can sometimes be ameliorated by lowering the dose or instituting drug-free weekends and holidays in appropriate patients. Some patients find withdrawal symptoms uncomfortable.

Common side effects include:

- Headache

- Nausea

- Insomnia, dizziness, hypotension, anorexia, somnolence

- Xerostomia

- Asthenia

- HTN

- Impotence, decreased libido, and/or anorgasmia

- Constipation

- Weight loss

- Abnormal dreams

- Diarrhea, abdominal pain

- Blurred vision

- Anxiety, tremor

- Hypercholesterolemia

- Hyponatremia

- Serotonin syndrome

- Seizures

There is an FDA black box warning against venlafaxine as it can increase suicidality, cause depression exacerbation, hypomania/mania, and serotonin syndrome. Venlafaxine can also cause abnormal bleeding, altered platelet function, and anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reaction. Venlafaxine can cause fatal skin conditions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and erythema multiforme. Venlafaxine can also cause deterioration of glaucoma angle closure and seizures.
