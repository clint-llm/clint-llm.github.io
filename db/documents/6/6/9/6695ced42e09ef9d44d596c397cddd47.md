The diagnosis of frailty frequently poses a diagnostic dilemma.

The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is a prominent, well-validated, and frequently used score among these options. It is heavily weighted to evaluate function, including the ability to mobilize and perform activities of daily living. It helps identify those patients at risk for adverse outcomes due to frailty and can help providers implement timely preventive strategies to maximize patient outcomes.

Recent studies have shown that increasing scores on the Clinical Frailty Scale are linearly correlated with increased mortality in patients with COVID19 infections.

Criticisms of the clinical frailty scale have pointed out that due to it being heavily weighted on patient function, it can be susceptible to an inherent "ableism" bias. For example, a patient with a congenital or traumatic amputation may require a similar level of in-hospital care as a patient with an amputation due to poorly controlled chronic diabetes. The first may be of greater baseline health status than the latter. There is concern that using the Clinical Frailty Scale to allocate limited medical resources, such as those in the ICU, may be negatively influenced by an "ableist" bias.
