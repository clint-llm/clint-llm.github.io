**Complete Hydatidiform**M**ole**

46, XX (majority); 46, XY, no fetus/embryo, expanded swelling of the villi, and expanded trophoblastic hyperplasia.

**Partial Hydatidiform**M**ole**

Triploid 69, XXY; 69,XYY; 69,XXX, abnormal fetus/embryo, central swelling of the villi, central trophoblastic hyperplasia.

**Gestational Choriocarcinomas**

Diffusely penetrative growth involving endomyometrium. The tumor cells recap chorionic villous trophoblasts of different types and are arranged in biphasic to triphasic growth arrangements: sheets or cords of mononuclear tumor cells surrounded by layers of multinuclear syncytiotrophoblasts. Lymphovascular tumor thrombi are usually present.

**Placental Site Trophoblastic Tumor (PSTT)**

Tumor cells invade myometrium with vascular\lymphatic invasion. Focal hemorrhage and necrosis are seen in nearly half of the cases, while the transmural myometrial invasion is in 10% of the cases. Perforation could also occur.

**Epithelioid Trophoblastic Tumor (ETT)**

The tumor usually creates discrete nodules or cystic hemorrhagic masses, that's deeply invading the surrounding tissues. Hemorrhage, necrosis, ulceration, and fistula can be seen as well. Characteristically, ETT expresses nodular, expandable growth of approximately uniform, medium-sized tumor cells organized in nests, cords, or large sheets.
