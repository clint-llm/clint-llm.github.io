The major differential diagnoses consist of:

- Pulmonary edema - characterized by edematous material that lacks coarse granules, cholesterol clefts, and foamy macrophages.

- Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia - consisting of intra-alveolar eosinophilic exudate with 'bubbles' corresponding to cysts of organisms that can be highlighted using Grocott special stain.

- Alveolar mucinosis - intra-alveolar accumulation of mucin are potentially observable in association with mucinous adenocarcinomas or bronchiectasis or honeycomb fibrosis.
