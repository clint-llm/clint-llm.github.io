Newer, more efficacious local anesthetics have largely overshadowed the clinical use of procaine, and as such, is only applicable in a narrow medical context now. Nonetheless, practitioners who continue to use the medication should be acutely aware of its indications, benefits, and risks and should inform patients of these as well. All involved clinical professionals must undertake careful effort (e.g., physicians, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, etc.) to monitor the patient during and after administration of procaine and to promptly recognize signs of hypersensitivity or toxicity as discussed before to prevent and/or abort any adverse outcomes, should they arise.

When a clinician opts to use procaine, they should consult with the pharmacist to ensure there are no potential interactions and that dosing is correct. Nursing will likely administer the drug and should be up to speed on adverse events so they can monitor the patient during the procedure and alert the clinician if there are any concerns. These interprofessional team measures demonstrate how collaboration can optimize procaine use to drive better patient outcomes. [Level 5]
