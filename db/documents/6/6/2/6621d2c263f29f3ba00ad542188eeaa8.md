Misoprostol is contraindicated in those with previous allergic reaction or hypersensitivity to prostaglandin. Those at risk for gastric ulcers secondary to NSAID use and are pregnant should not take misoprostol given the adverse effects reported during pregnancy.

Besides allergic reactions, there are no absolute contraindications for misoprostol's gynecologic and obstetric indications given the lack of society-approved guidelines for these uses. Contraindications are relative to the drug's desired effect and should be individualized depending on each patient's risk factors. For example, given the increased risk of uterine rupture, those with previous caesarian sections should not take misoprostol to induce a medical abortion.
