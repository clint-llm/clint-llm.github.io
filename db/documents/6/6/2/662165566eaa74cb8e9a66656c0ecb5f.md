Clinicians also should be aware that apparent limitations in the accuracy of right ventricular hypertrophy criteria and conflicting results in the literature might reflect the fact that different pathophysiologic substrates give rise to very different ECG findings. Tall (normal duration) right precordial R waves (as part of R, RS, or QR morphologies) with right axis deviation, as noted above, are most likely to be associated with severe RV pressure overloads due to pulmonic stenosis (and its variants) or pulmonary hypertension from causes other than COPD (primary pulmonary hypertension or recurrent pulmonary emboli). Pulmonary hypertension due to severe COPD (emphysema) may be associated with very slow R wave progression, delayed precordial transition zone, and right axis deviation. In contrast, right ventricular hypertrophy due to a classic volume load state (ostium secundum atrial septal defect) may be associated with RV conduction delay and right axis deviation.
