Healthcare outcomes can be enhanced by open provider-patient communication. It is essential to an interprofessional team to ask about the patient’s living environment including contact with animals and provide tips on how to manage flea and other insect infestations. Assistance may be required from extermination services as well as veterinarians, in the case of pets in the home, to rid the environment of infestation. By counseling patients, the team members can help prevent both patient discomfort from bites as well as the spread of disease. Healthcare providers including nurse practitioners, nurses with specialty training in dermatology, pharmacists, and the primary care provider should provide a judgment-free space that offers a healthy exchange to educate the patient and family to facilitate the best patient care and produce the best outcomes.
