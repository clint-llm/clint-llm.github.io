A threatened abortion occurs when a pregnant patient at less than 20 weeks gestation presents with vaginal bleeding. The cervical os is closed on a physicalÂ exam. The patient may also experience abdominal cramping, pelvic pain, pelvic pressure, and/or back pain. Vaginal bleeding usually begins first followed by cramping abdominal pain hours to days later. Bleeding is the most predictive risk factor for pregnancy loss. More than half of threatened abortions will abort. The risk of spontaneous abortion, in a patient with threatened abortion, is less if fetal cardiac activity is present
