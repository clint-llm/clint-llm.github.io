Sound production requires three components: a power source, a vibratory source, and a resonator. Human vocal sound production utilizes expired air as the power source, driven from the lungs by the diaphragm and intercostal muscles. The vocal folds within the larynx are the vibratory source, and the upper airway and oral cavity together constitute the resonator chamber.

The vocal folds' vibratory pattern is referred to as the "mucosal wave" because the movements of the vocal folds resemble waves in a fluid medium.****The complex 3-dimensional sinusoidal vibration of the vocal folds is a multi-step process that results from the interplay between air pressure and anatomical structures. It begins with exhaled air pressing upwards against adducted vocal folds; once the subglottic pressure has increased to a threshold level, air can escape between the vocal folds. The folds then separate in an inferior to superior direction, creating a dynamic gap between them that moves upwards until it opens completely at the superior margin of the vocal folds.

As the mucosal wave travels upwards and laterally across the vocal folds, there is a dynamic relationship between the two main functional parts of the vocal folds, the cover and body, each of which is composed of two or more layers, according to Hirano's classic 1974 description.
