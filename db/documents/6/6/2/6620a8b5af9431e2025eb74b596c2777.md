Treatment of avian influenza usually consists of supportive care and antiviral medications.

The World Health Organization released Rapid Advice Guidelines in 2007, outlining consensus treatment recommendations for H5N1 influenza outbreaks.

The WHO also made recommendations on chemoprophylaxis of those with possible viral exposure in the above guidelines. Of note, oseltamivir (75 mg daily) prophylaxis for 7 to 10 days after last known potential exposure for high-risk groups (household and close family contacts) receives a strong recommendation. Moderate and low-risk groups are not as strongly advised to receive chemoprophylaxis, although moderate risk groups require individual assessment.
