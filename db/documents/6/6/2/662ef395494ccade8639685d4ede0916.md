Median nerve blocks are often performed by anesthesiologists, emergency department physicians, orthopedic surgeons, pain specialists, and rheumatologists. However, when performing these blocks, the patient must have a dedicated nurse monitoring the vital signs. Resuscitative equipment must be in the room before starting the procedure. When done well, the nerve block is useful for managing lacerations to the hand.
