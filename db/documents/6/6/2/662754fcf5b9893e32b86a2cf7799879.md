Patients with suspected OSA usually present with excessive daytime sleepiness, loud snoring, gasping, choking, or breathing cessation while sleeping that a bed partner witnessed. Excessive daytime sleepiness is one of the most common symptoms. However, the majority of patients are asymptomatic.

The **STOP-BANG**questionnaire is one of the most widely accepted screening tools for OSA.

- Snoring: Do you snore loudly (louder than talking or loud enough to be heard through closed doors)?

- Tired: Do you often feel tired, fatigued, or sleepy during the daytime?

- Observed: Has anyone observed you stop breathing during your sleep?

- Blood pressure: Do you have or are you being treated for high blood pressure?

- BMI: BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2

- Age: age > 50 yrs

- Neck circumference: Neck circumference >40 cm

- Gender: Gender male

Use **STOP-BANG**to decide if high probability of moderate-severe disease. High risk if ‘YES’ to ≥ 3 items Low risk if ‘YES’ to < 3 items Items.

Obesity is the most common finding in individuals with OSA. Other physical findings are large neck circumference (17 inches or 43 cm in males and 16 inches or 40.5 cm), crowded oropharynx (Mallampati 3 to 4), retrognathia, micrognathia, tonsilar hypertrophy, low-lying palate, overjet, and a large tongue. However, after adjusting for body weight and neck size, only lateral narrowing is an independent predictor of OSA.
