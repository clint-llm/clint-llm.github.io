Clinicians have a responsibility to identify obesity as a gateway disease. Identifying appropriate prevention and treatment measures for obesity and its comorbidities is imperative. Patients and their caregivers must understand that obesity is a chronic disease, and weight management will need to be a lifelong process.

A multidisciplinary and interprofessional approach to obesity is essential to determine the barriers to weight maintenance. Involving the patients in discussions regarding environmental factors affecting obesity promotes health literacy. Psychosocial factors haveÂ strong associations with overeating. Health care workers at the primary care level, including therapists and psychologists, can potentially play a significant role in identifying these individuals, referring them to health care providers for further screening and treatment, and providing behavioral therapy targeted towards their eating habits.

Studies have revealed a lower risk of obesity when there is a higher satisfaction with public transportation, safety in the neighborhood, and accessibility to sports facilities. Governmental/ charity-based improvement in these functions will likely improve weight loss.

Social policy changes by increasing the availability of healthy foods, regulating portion sizes and ingredients, and further promoting physical activity are vital. Another potential change is requiring calorie counts of food to be listed in fast food and other restaurants.
