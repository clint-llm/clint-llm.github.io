Small for gestational age (SGA) infants can be constitutionally normal with birth weight consistent with the expected optimal birth weight or from fetal growth restriction (FGR) with features of in utero malnourishment. Constitutionally normal SGA infants are not at increased risk of mortality and morbidity compared to the increased risk of mortality and morbidity in infants with FGR SGA.

The evaluation of FGR SGA begins during the antenatal period with routine obstetric physical exam and ultrasound. Also important are preconception histories such as the history of prior FGR SGA birth, maternal chronic medical conditions, infections, and substance abuse. These are helpful for early diagnosis and facilitate monitoring and delivery planning.

After birth, the newborn is stabilized with special attention paid to temperature and glucose management.Â  The infant should undergo further evaluation to determine the cause of FGR SGA, and treatment is directed at the underlying causes. In a large proportion of cases, there is no underlying cause prenatally identified. In these cases, further evaluation is required through detailed maternal and pregnancy history, pathological examination of the placenta, comprehensive physical examination of the newborn, prenatal drug or toxin exposure history or meconium testing, and congenital infection work-up.
