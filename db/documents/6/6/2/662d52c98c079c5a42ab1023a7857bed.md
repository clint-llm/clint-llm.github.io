In the adult population, most temporal bone fractures result from motor vehicle accidents (55%), with falls being the second most common cause (25%), industrial accidents the third (16%), and assaults fourth (4%).

Most temporal bone fractures are caused by laterally-directed blows to the skull, but anteroposterior blows can also cause temporal bone fractures and are liable to produce fractures that propagate transversely across the petrous pyramid and involve the otic capsule - the region of dense bone that contains the cochlea, vestibule, and semicircular canals.
