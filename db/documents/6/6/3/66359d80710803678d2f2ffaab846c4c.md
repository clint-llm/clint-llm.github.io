Hydrocarbons are organic compounds that consist of hydrogen and carbon. They are ubiquitous in society and are present in many common household and occupational products, including motor fuels, paint thinners, cleaning agents, lotions, and industrial solvents. Unfortunately, these products are also used as agents of abuse and typically inhaled. Serious toxicity and death can be associated with hydrocarbon exposure. Pulmonary toxicity is most common, however the cardiovascular system, nervous system, and gastrointestinal system can all be affected. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of hydrocarbon toxicity and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiology of hydrocarbon toxicity.
- Describe the signs and symptoms of hydrocarbon toxicity.
- Summarize the treatment options available for hydrocarbon toxicity.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and communication to advance the diagnosis and management of hydrocarbon toxicity and improve outcomes.
