Torsemide causes excretion of sodium chloride and water by inhibiting sodium and chloride reabsorption in the ascending loop of Henle and distal collecting tubule. The effect is caused by blocking the chloride-binding site of the Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransport mechanism. Torsemide does not affect renal blood flow or glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

However, studies have also shown that genetics can play a role in the drug response of various loop diuretics, including torsemide.
