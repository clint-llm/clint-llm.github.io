As noted above, duodenal ulcers are the result of the corrosive action of gastric secretions on the surface epithelium of the small intestine that has undergone prior injury. In duodenal ulcers, there are multiple underlying comorbidities to consider when establishing the diagnosis and underlying cause. H. pylori and NSAID use are the two main underlying etiologies to consider and discussed here. The mechanism by which H. pylori predisposes individuals is unclear. However, the thinking is that H. pylori colonization and persistent inflammation lead to the weakening of the mucosal surface layer causing it to be vulnerable to exposure to gastric acid. A secondary running theory considers the possibility that H. pylori also can increase acid production via inflammatory mechanisms, further exacerbating the initial injury caused by the infection and initial acid-driven injury.

Prostaglandins play a crucial role in developing the protective mucosa in the gastrointestinal tract, including gastric and small intestine mucosa. Their biosynthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), which exists in two isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2. NSAIDs exhibit their therapeutic effect by inhibiting the COX-1 and COX-2 pathways. Recurrent use of NSAIDs causes a significant and persistent decrease in prostaglandins leading to susceptibility to mucosal injury. It is thought to be one of the primary predisposing pathophysiologic factors for the development of duodenal ulcers.
