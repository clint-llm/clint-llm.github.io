It is important for all healthcare providers, including physicians, pharmacists, and nurses, to be aware of expiration dating and how it could affect their patients' medications. Some medications, when expired, can have a decrease in efficacy, change in chemical composition, or harbor bacterial growth. Liquid antibiotics and medicated eye drops have been linked to bacterial growth due to nonsterile compounding procedures. Medications such as Nitroglycerin are sensitive to heat and light.

Patients who take nitroglycerin should be educated that after the medication has been opened, it may no longer be effective. There have also been cases of Fanconi Syndrome reported due to patients taking old tetracyclines. As tetracycline degrades, byproducts such as epi-anhydrotetracycline or anhydrotetracycline can lead to serious illness. Although medications may not look different after they have expired, it is important to educate patients on the proper disposal of medications after they have expired. One study estimated that between 2004 and 2013 there were over 640,000 children are taken to the emergency room after getting into their parentâ€™s medicine cabinets and accidentally taking medication.
