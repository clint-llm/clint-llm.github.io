The vascular smooth muscle of blood vessels, including the aorta, is innervated primarily by the autonomic nervous system (ANS), particularly the sympathetic nervous system. Activation of alpha-1 receptors causes vasoconstriction in response to low blood pressure. Activation of beta-2 receptors causes vasodilation.
