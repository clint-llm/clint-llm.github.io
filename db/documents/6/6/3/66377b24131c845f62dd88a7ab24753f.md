The management of normocytic normochromic anemia depends primarily on treating the underlying cause of anemia. Blood transfusion remains an important short-term management option, especially in individuals with severe anemia (Hb <7 g/dL), those who are symptomatic or have associated cardiac disease.

- **Anemia of Chronic Disease:**Treatment of the anemia of chronic disease requires treating the underlying disorder. Anemia of chronic disease is usually mild anemia, but approximately 20% of patients may have hemoglobin <8 g/dl. In these more severe cases, clinicians should rule out additional concurrent causes of anemia, such as iron deficiency anemia. The use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, blood transfusion, and iron supplementation with treating the underlying diseases are the most important treatment options. If patients have low or inappropriately normal erythropoietin levels, they may respond to injections of erythropoietin or darbepoetin. Patients with appropriately elevated EPO levels (especially >500 mU/ML) do not respond. The anemia of chronic disease is often mistaken for iron deficiency anemia.

- **Acute Blood Loss:**Treated with efforts aimed at stopping bleeding, and supportive measures such as IV fluids, crossmatched packed red blood cells, and oxygen support.

- **Rheumatoid Arthritis:**Anti-TNF-a antibody has been shown to lessen the severity of anemia.

- **End-stage Renal Disease (ESRD):**Usually due to decreased renal erythropoietin-stimulating agents, goal Hb being 10.5-11 g/dl in ESRD patients with Hb<10 g/dl. ESRD patients with transferrin saturation ≤30% and ferritin ≤500 ng/ml require iron supplementation, preferably with intravenous rather than oral iron.

- **Primary Bone Marrow Failure:**Conditions such as aplastic anemia require immunosuppression therapy, bone marrow transplantation, etc.

- **Hemolytic Anemia:**If caused by faulty mechanical valves (macroangiopathic hemolytic anemia), these will need replacement. Hemolytic anemia due to medications requires the removal of the offending drug. Hemolytic anemia due to inherited causes is treated depending on the type of disorder. Persistent hemolytic anemia may require splenectomy.

- **Hemoglobinopathies:**Simple blood transfusions, exchange transfusions, hydroxyurea.

- **DIC:**The removal of the offending stimulus. Patients with life-threatening bleeding require the use of antifibrinolytic agents along with blood product transfusions (platelet, plasma, cryoprecipitate).
