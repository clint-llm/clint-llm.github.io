Patient history often involves travel to endemic areas and a history of walking barefoot. The most common initial finding is a small reddish papule that progresses to a serpiginous pruritic rash with a slow rate of progression from less than 1 to 2 cm per day. The initial presentation may vary depending on species. Disease from A. braziliense manifests within 1 hour, while papular lesions may take days to appear when U. stenocephala is the organism that infects a person. Vesiculobullous disease may occur as well, and papulopustular inflammation of the follicles has been documented, although this is not common.
