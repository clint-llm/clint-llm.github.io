This diagnosis requires quick identification and treatment. It is a medical emergency requiring maximal supportive care and monitoring in the ICU.

Fluids and glucocorticoid replacement are the mainstays of emergent therapy. Two to three liters of normal saline or 5% dextrose in normal saline should be infused in the first 12 to 24 hours.

Once the crisis is controlled, an ACTH stimulation test can be performed to diagnose the etiology of the adrenal insufficiency in those patients with no prior history of adrenal disorders.

**Current Guidelines for Addisonian Crisis**

- In acutely ill patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of acute adrenal insufficiency, one should rule of Addisonian crisis.

- Assess blood pressure and perform orthostasis

- Determine the history of steroid use

- Perform appropriate tests like sodium, potassium, creatinine, urea, TSH, cortisol, and plasma ACTH levels

- In stable patients, consider performing a short adrenocorticotropic hormone test.

- Never delay treatment because of testing.

- If in doubt and suspicion is high, administer IV hydrocortisone and hydrate the patient.
