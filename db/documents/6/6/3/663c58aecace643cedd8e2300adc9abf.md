Postoperatively, patients are admitted overnight and monitored for oxygen desaturations, snoring, hyponasal speech, and OSA. They are discharged once tolerating adequate oral intake. Patients with concern for sleep apnea should undergo formal polysomnography to evaluate for OSA and be considered for continuous positive airway pressure in the short term. Persistent sleep apnea, airflow obstruction, and hyponasal speech may require flap revision or takedown in the long term.
