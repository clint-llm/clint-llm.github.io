Fetal ultrasound can detect agenesis of the corpus callosum as early as the 16th week of gestation.

An antenatal ultrasound scan may show some findings suggestive of agenesis of the corpus callosum:

- Dilated and elevated third ventricle

- Lateral ventricles may appear as widely spaced parallel bodies with small frontal horns

- Colpocephaly gives rise to a "teardrop" configuration on axial scans.

- Absent septum pellucidum with widened interhemispheric fissure

- Color Doppler may show that the normal semicircular arterial loop, formed by the pericallosal artery, along with the superior surface of the corpus callosum, is missing or distorted

Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain is the investigation of choice for agenesis of the corpus callosum.

The following signs are suggestive of the diagnosis

- Racing car sign: Axial imaging of the lateral ventricles will show the similarity to a Formula One car viewed from above

- “Moose head appearance” or “Viking helmet sign” or "Longhorn appearance": Coronal views at the level of the frontal horns have this characteristic appearance due to CCA and eversion of bilateral cingulate gyri into the frontal horns

- Sunray appearance: Sagittal imaging shows gyri radiating outward in a radial pattern from the ventricle

- Lateral ventricles appear to be parallel to each other and non-converging

- ACC is also typically accompanied by colpocephaly (dilatation of the trigones and occipital horns)

- High riding third ventricle

- Along the superomedial surface of lateral ventricles, inverted Probst bundles may be present

Neuropsychological evaluation of all patients with agenesis of the corpus callosum is mandatory.
