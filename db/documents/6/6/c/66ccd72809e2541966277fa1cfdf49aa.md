Ropinirole is a medication used to manage and treat Parkinson's disease and restless leg syndrome. It is a dopamine agonist (D2). The dopamine receptors (D2) are g-protein-coupled inhibitory neurons that inhibit adenylyl cyclase and calcium (Ca2+) channels and activate potassium channels leading to their physiological functions. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, mechanism of action, adverse events, and other key elements of ropinirole therapy.
