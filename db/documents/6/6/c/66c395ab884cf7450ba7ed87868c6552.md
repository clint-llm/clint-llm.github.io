Bouveret syndrome is caused by a large stone passing through a bilioduodenal fistula causing gastric outlet obstruction. In recent years, morbidity and mortality rates have decreased but remain high, estimated at 60% and 12% to 30%, respectively. Unfortunately, the chance of misdiagnosis is still high due to non-specific symptoms and laboratory findings. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of Bouveret syndrome and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Bouveret syndrome.
- Explain how to evaluate a patient for Bouveret syndrome.
- List the management options available for patients with Bouveret syndrome.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies to enhance care coordination and in turn, improve recognition and treatment of Bouveret syndrome.
