A preoperative CT scan of the paranasal sinuses with 1 mm contiguous axial, coronal, and sagittal views is a prerequisite to surgical planning. Attention focuses on the vidian canal position in the sphenoid sinus, its relation to the sphenoid corpus, the thickness of bone over the roof of the canal, and the angle it forms with the canal. Â After orotracheal intubation, the patient is positioned in a semi-Fowler position with the head in a horseshoe rest or Mayfield pin holder. Pterygopalatine ganglion block is performed transorally, via the greater palatine canal. The nasal cavity is prepared and decongested with adrenaline-soaked neuro sponges.
