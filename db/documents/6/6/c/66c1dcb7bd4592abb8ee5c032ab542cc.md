The prognosis of early breast cancer is quietly good. Stage 0 and stage I both have a 100% 5-year survival rate. The 5-year survival rate of stage II and stage III breast cancer is about 93% and 72%, respectively. When the disease spreads systemically, its prognosis worsens dramatically. Only 22% of stage IV breast cancer patients will survive their next 5 years.
