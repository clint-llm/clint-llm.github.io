Laboratory findings are typically consistent with hypokalemia, mild hypernatremia, and mild hypomagnesemia.

Plasma renin concentration (or PRC) and plasma renin activity (or PRA) are the initial laboratory measurements in the diagnosis of hyperaldosteronism. In primary hyperaldosteronism, the PRC and PRA are low (less than 1 ng/mL/hour and undetectable, respectively) as the excess aldosterone originates from the zona glomerulosa itself and not an extrinsic pathway. In secondary hyperaldosteronism, the PRC and PRA are high, as renin is the primary mediator for the excess production of aldosterone. These levels are usually measured in the morning after patients have been out of bed. The results are more accurate when the labs are drawn at least two hours after the patient is out of bed and at least five minutes in sitting position.

PAC/ PRA ratio (Plasma aldosterone concentration/plasma renin activity) is a confirmatory test for primary hyperaldosteronism. Most studies support an elevated PAC/PRA (> 30) and PAC (> 20 ng/dL) levels with a sensitivity and specificity of over 90%. However, a PAC/PRA ratio greater than 20 and PAC greater than 15 ng/dL have been reported to be sufficient. In secondary hyperaldosteronism, both PRA and PRC are increased, but the PAC/PRA is less than primary hyperaldosteronism.

The role of 24-hour urine collection in hyperaldosteronism is controversial. However, it can be used to detect inappropriate potassium wasting (> 30 mEq/day). This test can be useful in evaluating the role of extrarenal losses and diuretic abuse in hypokalemia, especially when the increase in aldosterone is barely detectable to mild.

Confirmation of hyperaldosteronism diagnosis typically requires Aldosterone suppression. Testing usually comprises of sodium loading and subsequent measurement of aldosterone. This is achieved with oral sodium loading over three days (5000 mg sodium in diet or 90 mEq sodium tablet). Subsequently urine aldosterone is measured, and a value > 12 mcg/day is used to confirm the diagnosis of hyperaldosteronism. Alternatively, a two-liter intravenous isotonic saline infusion over 4 hours ca be used. With the saline infusion, PAC levels greater than 10 ng/dL are consistent with hyperaldosteronism; however, the saline infusion has a false negative rate of 30%.

Radiological imaging such as computed tomography (CT scan) can be used to distinguish adenomas from bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, but studies have found that CT cannot distinguish the two reliably. All patients with primary aldosteronism should undergo imaging to rule out large masses or carcinomas.

Adrenal vein sampling (AVS) is used to differentiate unilateral from bilateral pathology if radiological imaging is not helpful. An incongruence in levels (usually a 4 fold increase on the side of the adenoma) indicates unilateral origin, whereas equivalent levels indicate a bilateral source. AVS is not recommended in patients younger than 35 years with spontaneous hypokalemia, marked levels of aldosterone, and highly suspicious adrenal adenoma on CT imaging.

Genetic testing is advised in primary aldosteronism seen in very young patients (less than 20 years) with a family history. Familial hyperaldosteronism could be type I (FH-I or glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism) or type III (FH-III).

Metabolic alkalosis is frequently observed in hyperaldosteronism. The historically wee documented association with hypokalemia has been observed to be less than 40% in studies. Mild hypernatremia and hypomagnesemia some of the other lab abnormalities found in these patients.
