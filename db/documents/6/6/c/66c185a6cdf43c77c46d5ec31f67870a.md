Interprofessional team care can contribute to using fluorescein angiography most efficiently. Nurses are required to assist in preparing the patient for the procedure. Counseling the patient before the procedure, pushing the dye while the ophthalmologist is capturing the images, and observing the patient for any adverse reactions can all be carried out by the nursing staff. Anesthetists or specialists in critical care are required to manage cases that develop an anaphylactic reaction. An interprofessional team approach helps prevent complications. It helps carry out angiography procedures uneventfully and provides optimal diagnostic information. [Level 5].
