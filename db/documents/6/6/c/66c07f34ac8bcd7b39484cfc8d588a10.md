Labyrinthitis is an inflammation of the membranous labyrinth. It can be caused by viruses, bacteria, or systemic diseases.

**Viral Labyrinthitis**

The most common cause of labyrinthitis is secondary to a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Labyrinthitis secondary to maternal rubella or cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections is one of the most common causes of congenital deafness. In the post-natal period, mumps and measles are the leading causes of viral hearing loss.

**Bacterial Labyrinthitis**

Bacterial labyrinthitis typically arises from either bacterial meningitis (20% of children with bacterial meningitis will develop auditory or vestibular symptoms)Â or otitis media.

**Autoimmune Labyrinthitis**

Labyrinthitis has been demonstrated to be a rare complication of both polyarteritis nodosa and granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

**HIV/ Syphilis**

Both syphilis and HIV have been associated with labyrinthitis. However, there is limited research as to whether the inflammation is caused by opportunistic infections as a result of the HIV-related immunosuppression or the virus itself.
