Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is a severe, progressive, fatal demyelinating disease that presents in immunocompromised states. Treatment is aimed at prolonging survival in these patients and hence there is a need to identify PML as early as possible in the disease process. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.
- Review the risk factors for developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.
- Summarize the management options of patients suffering from progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. 
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.
