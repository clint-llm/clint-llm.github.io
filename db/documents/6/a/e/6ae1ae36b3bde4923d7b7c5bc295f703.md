Severe hypothyroidism may present as myxedema coma and is an endocrine emergency. Prompt recognition and early treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) are essential, and even then, mortality reaches 25% to 60%.

Myxedema crisis should be suspected in cases where there is encephalopathy, hypothermia, seizures, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, and fluid retention.

Factors leading to an increased risk of myxedema crisis include inadequate doses of thyroid hormone, interruption in treatment, undiagnosed hypothyroidism, or presence of acute illness such as sepsis

Supportive treatment should be provided in the intensive care unit with fluid and electrolyte management, ventilator support, vasopressors, treatment of coexisting acute illness, and hypothermia.

Thyroid replacement treatment is with intravenous hydrocortisone at stress doses followed by intravenous levothyroxine then switched to oral levothyroxine after clinical improvement. The reason to give steroids is that these patients may have adrenal insufficiency, which can lead to an Addisonian crisis if the thyroid deficiency is replaced without addressing adrenal insufficiency. It is recommended to check for Adrenal insufficiency but wait for the results and start treatment with steroids.

If the treatment is effective, this should result in cardiopulmonary and cognitive improvement.

Endocrinology consultation should be considered.
