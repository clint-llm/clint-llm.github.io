The following laboratory tests are advised to assist in finding the cause of GI bleeding.

- Complete blood count

- Hemoglobin/hematocrit

- International normalized ratio (INR), prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time

- Lactate

- Liver function tests

**Diagnostic Studies**

- Upper GI endoscopy

- Can be diagnostic and therapeutic
- Allows visualization of the upper GI tract (typically including from the oral cavity up to the duodenum) and treatment with injection therapy, thermal coagulation, or hemostatic clips/bands

- Lower GI endoscopy/colonoscopy

- Can be diagnostic and therapeutic
- Allows visualization of the lower GI tract (including the colon and terminal ileum) and treatment with injection therapy, thermal coagulation, or hemostatic clips/bands

- Push enteroscopy

- Allows further visualization of the small bowel

- Deep small bowel enteroscopy

- Allows further visualization of the small bowel

- Nuclear scintigraphy

- Tagged RBC scan
- Detects bleeding occurring at a rate of 0.1 to 0.5 mL/min using technetium-99m (can only detect active bleeding
- Can be helpful to localize angiographic and surgical interventions

- CT angiography

- Allows for identification of an actively bleeding vessel

- Standard angiography

- Allows for identification of a bleeding vessel and potential treatment via embolization or intra-arterial vasopressin
- Requires the active bleeding be at a rate of 0.5 to 1.0 mL/min to visualize the site

- Meckel scan

- Nuclear medicine scan to look for ectopic gastric mucosa
