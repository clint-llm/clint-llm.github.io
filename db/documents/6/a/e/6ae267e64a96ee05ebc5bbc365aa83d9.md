Supraphysiologic levels (two to threefold elevation) of plasma catecholamines and neuropeptides (norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine) have been observed in patients with Takotsubo syndrome.

Estrogen provides direct cardioprotective effects, including vasodilation, vascular protection, and effects against atherosclerosis and endothelial dysfunction.

Inflammation is thought to play a critical role in the development of Takotsubo syndrome.

Microvascular dysfunction has been shown in Takotsubo syndrome patients with several catheter-based and imaging modalities.

There is a hypothesis that Takotsubo syndrome is a form of an aborted myocardial infarction in which there is indeed the formation of acute thrombus with quick and complete lysis of thrombus with spontaneous resolution of the infarct. Detailed intravascular imaging with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and OCT has shown eccentric atherosclerotic plaques in the mid LAD of patients with TTS that were thought to be normal on coronary angiography.
