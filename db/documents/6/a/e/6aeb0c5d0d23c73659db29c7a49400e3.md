A seizure represents the uncontrolled, abnormal electrical activity of the brain that may cause changes in the level of consciousness, behavior, memory, or feelings. Convulsive concussion, convulsive syncope, movement disorders, rigors, sleep-related events, or psychogenic non-epileptic spells are all in the differential diagnosis of an event. Seizures can classify as partial or generalized. In a partial seizure, the most common seizure type in adults, one area of the cortex activates first and may manifest through simple symptoms such as a motor or sensory phenomena. Generalized seizures result from diffuse cortical activation at seizure onset or generalization of partial seizure activity. This activity discusses the evaluation and management of seizures and explains the interprofessional team's role in improving outcomes for patients with this condition. This activity examines when this condition should be a consideration on differential diagnosis and how to evaluate it properly. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of seizures.
- Review appropriate workup of a patient with seizures.
- Summarize drug treatment options for continuing seizures.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team in enhancing the delivery of care for patients with seizures.
