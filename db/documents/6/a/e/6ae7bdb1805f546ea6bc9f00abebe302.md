The management of an immediate hypersensitive reaction is best done with an interprofessional team that includes ICU nurses.Â To improve patient outcomes, clinicians should be aware that immediate hypersensitivity reactions are a medical emergency. No time should be wasted with blood work or imaging studies. The treatment of immediate hypersensitivity reactions includes the management of anaphylaxis with intramuscular adrenaline (epinephrine), oxygen, intravenous (IV) antihistamine, support blood pressure with IV fluids, avoid latex gloves and equipment in patients who are allergic, and surgical procedures such as tracheotomy if there is severe laryngeal edema. These patients are best managed in an ICU setting.
