The approach to the consideration of other possibilities when screening for niacin toxicity is to consider other conditions that present with flushing, with or without associated gastrointestinal symptoms

- If the flushing is associated with angioedema, the clinician should consider anaphylaxis. This response is triggered by an Ig mediated effect on mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils, which releases inflammatory mediators.  Epinephrine counteracts this cascade.

- Panic attack, dumping syndrome, rosacea, thyroid storm, or hyperthyroidism

- Food or preservative allergies

- Medications, like metronidazole, can precipitate disulfiram reactions.

- Scombroid poisoning, which is histamine-mediated

- Cardiac medications (adenosine, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers)

- Parenteral antimicrobials (ceftriaxone, vancomycin, amphotericin-B)

- Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (erectile dysfunction drugs)

- Black widow envenomation

- Anticholinergic medications and plants (e.g., jimsonweed and deadly nightshade) can cause anticholinergic toxicity, which can present with flushing as one of its symptoms.  Through its mechanism of action, physostigmine acts to reverse the poisoning by promoting cholinergic stimulation.

- Seratonin syndrome can present with flushing, in addition to delirium, hyperreflexia, hyperthermia, and tachycardia. This reaction is due to excessive stimulation of 5-HT2A/5HT1A receptors. A nonselective serotonin antagonist like cyproheptadine may help treat this, along with benzodiazepines.

In cases involving liver damage, the extensive differential for elevated liver function tests would be applicable. The clinician must consider:

- Drugs like amiodarone, isoniazid, and methotrexate

- Over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen

- Hepatotoxic species of mushrooms like Amanita phalloides (i.e., "death cap")

- Alcohol misuse
