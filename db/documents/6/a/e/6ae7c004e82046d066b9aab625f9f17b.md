The treatment of PSC requires an interprofessional approach. Gastroenterology consultation is useful. Surgery consult and referral to a tertiary center are needed in patients undergoing liver transplantation. Patients with osteoporosis might need to be referred to an endocrinologist. Besides physicians, nurses, dieticians, psychiatric counselors, pharmacists, and physical therapists play a critical role in the management of these patients. Pharmacists should encourage patients to take appropriate medications and educate patients about their side effects. Patients will need to be evaluated by a dietician for appropriate diet recommendations. Gastroenterology nurses provide education, monitor patient status, and facilitate referrals. The transplant nurse should assess the patient's candidacy for a transplant and assist the team by educating the patient on the surgery.

Physical therapy is encouraged except in patients with advanced osteoporosis. Some patients might benefit from psychiatric counseling. Close communication between team members is essential for improving outcomes. [Level 5]
