While shellfish toxicity is secondary to a non-allergic pathway, it is crucial to consider it in cases that are challenging to differentiate. As mentioned above, there are multiple potential toxins to be aware of in shellfish toxicity. Saxitoxins are responsible for causing paralytic shellfish poisoning and are secondary to dinoflagellates.

Neurotoxic shellfish poisoning can also occur and may resemble paralytic shellfish poisoning, but is much milder.

Another disease state secondary to shellfish is amnesic shellfish poisoning, which occurs due to domoic acid. These patients demonstrate gastrointestinal symptoms within 24 hours of ingestion and may develop neurologic symptoms such as confusion, disorientation, or memory loss within 48 hours.

Azaspiracid shellfish poisoning is due to marine toxins that can accumulate in shellfish and trigger severe gastrointestinal symptoms. While the toxin may be secondary to dinoflagellates, its origin is not definitively known. Symptoms persist for two to three days, and the substance can induce widespread organ damage.

The mildest toxin-associated illness found with shellfish ingestion is diarrhetic shellfish poisoning, and it is also associated with biotoxins from dinoflagellates. Symptoms are primarily gastrointestinal, but may also include fevers, chills, or headaches. Timing is generally between 30 minutes to six hours after ingestion.
