Median neuropathies can be divided into proximal (high) and distal (low) median neuropathies.

**High Median Neuropathy**

On physical exam, inspect the thenar eminence for atrophy. Assess light touch sensation over the lateral three and one-half digits. The pronator teres, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, and flexor digitorum superficialis are innervated directly by the median nerve proper. Lesions of these muscles will result in weakness in pronation (pronator teres) and significant weakness in flexion of the forearm at the elbow (flexor carpi radialis and flexor digitorum superficialis). One can hold the patient's hand and test the ability to flex the fingers. Because the flexor digitorum superficialis tendons insert onto the sides of the fingers, weakness in the ability to flex the fingers at the proximal interphalangeal joint will occur in a high median neuropathy.

The anterior interosseous branch can be tested by asking the patient to make the “okay” sign with the thumb and index finger. A pinch instead of a circle indicates an anterior interosseous nerve palsy. Additionally, asking the patient to place the hand flat on the bed and then ask the patient to raise the thumb off the bed is a way to assess the distal aspects of the nerve by assessing both the opposition and abduction of the thumb. This is part of the findings in a high median neuropathy.

If there is suspicion for median nerve pathology above the level of the elbow, ask the patient to make a fist. If there is a lesion at this level, then the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) function will be affected, resulting in impairment of flexion of all four fingers at the proximal interphalangeal joint. Loss of the anterior interosseus nerve will cause loss of flexion at the distal interphalangeal joint of the index and middle digits. When attempting to make a fist, the index and middle fingers will remain extended. This is commonly referred to as the “hand of benediction” or "preacher's hand". However, in clinical practice, an anatomic variation of the ulnar nerve typically allows flexion of the middle finger at the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint, and therefore a “pointer finger” (pointing with the index finger) is a more appropriate description of the observed finding. This is part of a high median neuropathy.

A supracondylar humeral fracture can damage the entire nerve, resulting in high median neuropathy.

Median nerve injury at the elbow or forearm can cause a single-palmar crease appearance due to the combined inability to flex the index finger and distal phalanx of the thumb, weak flexion of the middle finger, and defective opposition of the thumb. This is part of a high median neuropathy.

**Low Median Neuropathy**

Low median neuropathies consist of carpal tunnel syndrome, which has been discussed above, and median recurrent neuropathy. Lesion of the recurrent branch of the median nerve denervates the flexor pollicis brevis, opponens pollicis, and abductor pollicis brevis. The recurrent branch of the median nerve is located rather superficially at about the middle of the thenar muscle mass. Dishwashers washing dishes may damage the recurrent branch of the median nerve with a superficial cut, typically on a knife or a piece of broken glass. An unsuspecting emergency room physician may examine sensory function over the hand and note no loss of sensation. He may then use a piece of surgical tape or place a stitch to close the wound. The patient will return weeks later because of loss of motor function to the thumb and severe thenar muscle atrophy. This is medical malpractice because the physician did not realize that the recurrent branch of the median nerve has no sensory function. It is mandatory in the physical examination of such a patient to have the patient touch the pads of the thumb and little finger together in performing the opposition test. If the patient were asked to do so, he would have been unable to oppose the thumb. it would immediately have been obvious that he had suffered a median recurrent neuropathy.

Loss of innervation to the thumb causes the loss of the muscle mass of the thumb. This is sometimes termed the “ape hand” (even though most apes have opposable thumbs).

At the elbow, the median nerve lies medial to the brachial artery. If one needs to sample arterial blood gas levels by arterial puncture, it is common to use the radial artery due to its easy availability. However, one should perform the Allen test to determine whether the anastomosis between the radial artery and ulnar artery is sufficient for the ulna artery to supply blood to the thumb and index finger because the puncture may cause thrombosis of the radial artery. If the Allen test demonstrates inadequate perfusion by the radial artery, then the brachial artery can be sampled. The anatomical position of the radial artery to the median nerve now becomes of paramount concern in order to avoid damaging the median nerve. One first obtains a good localization of the radial artery with a pulse if possible. Sonography can yield superior results and should be used if available. It is then critical not to puncture the area medial to the brachial artery to avoid damaging the median nerve.

Injection nerve palsy is an iatrogenic condition caused when an intramuscular injection is placed in proximity to, or directly into, a nerve, thereby leading to axonal and myelin degeneration. The agent can penetrate the endoneurium, resulting in edema in the space surrounding an individual nerve fiber, ultimately leading to nerve damage and even nerve death. This will be extremely painful for the patient, and motor function will typically be more severely affected than sensory function. The most toxic agents are thought to be: penicillin, chlorpromazine, meperidine, dimenhydrinate, tetanus toxoid, procaine, and hydrocortisone.
