There are several methods to treat malocclusion. Palatal expanders are traditionally used before braces treatment to treat a narrow palate, crowding, or crossbite. Rapid palatal expansion (RPE) works by placing a force on the two maxillary bones to split the mid-palatal suture. Palatal expanders are most useful during adolescence, as the maxillary bones become fused during puberty. The expander contains a screw turned daily or as directed by the patient's orthodontist. Every turn places pressure on the maxillary bone, allowing for less than 1 mm of expansion.

Spacers can be used before or during braces treatment to increase space interproximally. Spacers are normally utilized between molars if there is not enough space for metal bands to be placed around them. Spacers can be made of different materials based on how long they need to be placed in the mouth. Rubber spacers are traditionally used for 1 to 2 weeks and normally fall out as soon as space is adequate. Metal spacers are commonly used for more than six weeks but can also be used for short-term space management.

The traditional way to treat malocclusion is with the use of braces. There are several types of braces made with different materials. Two of the more notable types are metal and ceramic braces. Traditional metal braces consist of brackets placed on teeth that need to be corrected and an archwire that will hold the brackets together. When tightened, the archwire will place pressure on the brackets, allowing the teeth to be aligned and straightened. Ceramic braces are the same as metal braces except that they come in an enamel-like color so that the braces are less noticeable. Brackets can also be made out of stainless steel and gold.

Over the past few years, clear aligners have become increasingly popular, especially in adult patients. Clear aligners utilize CAD/CAM technology to digitally scan the dental arches to create clear removable trays. A clear aligner treatment has many different sets of aligners, each for a different stage of treatment. Patients wear each stage tray for 1-2 weeks, depending on the treatment plan created by the orthodontist.

Clear aligner treatment is ideal for patients who cannot have many in-person appointments or are concerned with aesthetics. Unfortunately, there are drawbacks to clear aligner treatment, including patient compliance and the severity of the case. Patients are instructed to wear clear aligners for at least 22 hours daily for an optimum time for the teeth to straighten. Additionally, if malocclusion cases are too severe, clear aligners are not recommended, and traditional braces are usually suggested.

While various methods have been proven to treat malocclusion successfully, newer technologies are still being tested to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of treatment. Perhaps in the near future, the utilization of low-level laser therapy on orthodontic movement, for example, will be a common practice in orthodontic offices.
