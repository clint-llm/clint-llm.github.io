AS is mostly a spontaneous tumor; however, a transformation from a benign vascular lesion has been reported previously. Radiation-induced AS is commonly seen in breast cancer survivors who receive RT to the chest wall. However, it can occur in any part of the body that has been irradiated previously. Stewart-Treves syndrome is defined as AS occurring in the setting of chronic lymphedema. Chronic lymphedema can occur with cancer and its treatment, infection like filariasis (Milroy's disease).

A few case reports suggest an association of AS with mutation in the DNA repair genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Familial syndromes like neurofibromatosis, Maffuci syndrome, Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome are also associated with AS. chemicals like vinyl chloride, thorium dioxide, arsenic, radium, anabolic steroids are also associated with AS.
