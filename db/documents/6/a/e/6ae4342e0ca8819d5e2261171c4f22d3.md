In 2015 it was recorded that burn injuries caused 500000 burns victims and 40000 hospitalizations in the United States. Over $7.9 billion is estimated to be spent on emergency room visits and hospital burn care per year. Survival after burns is attributed to a better understanding of when to transfer to burn centers, resuscitation protocols, and early excision and grafting. Over the last 50 years, there have been significant developments in the assessment and treatment of burn patients attributable to interprofessional care and increasing knowledge in the critical care of the burn patient.
