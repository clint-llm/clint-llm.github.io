The differential diagnosis includes clinical syndromes and imaging findings that overlap or share similar features to true spinal cord ischemia. Differentials include a variety of myelopathies which can be categorized as compressive, infectious, inflammatory, or nutritional (as in the case of posterior column disease related to B12 deficiency). Compressive etiologies are easily diagnosed with routine imaging and may include extramedullary tumor, hematoma, abscess, or degenerative bony remodeling.

Diagnostic criteria have recently proposed by Zalewski et al. based on experience with a cohort of 133 ASCI patients compared to patients with non-ischemic myelopathy.
