Diagnosis is by clinical suspicion. Other causes of genital ulceration and inguinal adenopathy should be excluded.

The basis for a definitive diagnosis of LGV is on serology tests (complement fixation or micro-immunofluorescence) or identification of Chlamydia trachomatis in genital, rectal and lymph node specimens (by culture, nucleic acid amplification test or direct immunofluorescence).

Men who have sex with men who have signs and symptoms of proctocolitis should receive testing for LGV. In these patients testing of rectal specimens with nucleic acid amplification test is the preferred approach.

HIV testing should be a consideration in patients with a sexually transmitted infection.
