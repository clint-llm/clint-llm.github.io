Important consultation for a wheat allergy includes an allergy and immunology provider, gastroenterologist, and nutritionist. If a patient is having gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, a gastroenterologist can help determine differential diagnoses, conduct further testing, and determine the etiology of the symptoms. An allergist can do skin and blood testing to make the diagnosis and guide treatment options, such as immunotherapy. Additional consultations that would be helpful would be a nutritionist who can guide dietary changes that need to be made to avoid wheat from one's diet.
