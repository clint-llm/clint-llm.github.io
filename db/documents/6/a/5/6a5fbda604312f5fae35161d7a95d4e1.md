As discussed above, there continue to be many new discoveries with regards to atrial natriuretic peptide. We have discovered its effects on the vasculature, on the kidney, and lipolysis, among others. Each of these has a wide range of impacts on various pathologies, from hypertension to heart failure to even metabolic syndrome. In addition to continued studies into ANP, an interdisciplinary approach is also necessary to help tackle these disorders. From nurses checking vitals and drawing labs to pharmacists helping to dose future therapeutic regimens to physicians understanding the physiology behind ANP, it will require a team effort.
