Prior to administering tramadol, it is essential to get the patient's baseline liver function tests (AST and ALT) because hepatic metabolism of the drug can lead to hepatotoxicity. Recommendations also include psychiatric evaluation for suicidal ideations, abuse, or misuse of tramadol before prescribing the medication.

After administration, the practitioner should continue to monitor the patient’s liver function, blood pressure, respiratory system, and mental status.  Due to the addictive potential of the drug, continued monitoring of the risks and benefits of tramadol use should take place every three months.
