Spiradenomas typically present as dermal or subcutaneous nodules on any area, though more commonly are seen on the head, neck, and trunk, and less commonly on the arms and legs. Several spiradenomas have been reported on the ears and eyelids, as well as papular lesions of the proximal nail fold. On physical examination, lesions are typically small, though they can grow to several centimeters in diameter, and have a blue, gray, or purple hue. Spiradenomas can be strikingly painful, though most are asymptomatic. Although the typical presentation is a solitary lesion, there can be linear, blaschkoid or grouped spiradenomas. Multiple spiradenomas can be seen and, if present with cylindromas and trichoblastomas, Brooke-Spiegler syndrome must be considered.

Though rare, spiradenomas have occurred in infancy, representing less than 1% of all reported cases of spiradenoma. These typically present as more superficial dermal nodules than seen in adults.

Rapid growth in a long-standing lesion may be an indication of malignant transformation. Malignant spiradenomas also tend toÂ ulcerate and have a predilection for the trunk and extremities. A change in color of the lesion can be a sign of malignant transformation. Metastases from malignant spiradenomas can occur in lymph nodes, lung, brain, or liver.
