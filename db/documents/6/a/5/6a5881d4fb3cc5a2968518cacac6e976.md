Specimen requirements for routine susceptibility testing using the disk diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method are similar to the guidelines for collecting samples for bacterial culture since a certain number of well-isolated colonies (usually 3 to 5) grown from a culture is necessary to prepare a suspension of inoculum.  The usual specimens sent for culture and sensitivity tests are blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, sputum, wound, stool, and other body fluids and discharge.

Special susceptibility tests via commercial systems may not always require bacterial colonies from culture because they can detect resistance to certain antimicrobial drugs by employing molecular techniques for detecting resistant genes.  An example would be the Xpert MTB/Rif assay which determines sensitivity or resistance to rifampicin directly from sputum specimens.
