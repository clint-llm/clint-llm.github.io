**Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy**

So far, chemotherapy has a limited role in the pre-operative treatment of endometrial cancers clinically and surgically confined to the uterus, though platinum-based regimens have been used with radiotherapy to reduce the size of tumors involving the cervix before surgery.  Preoperative platinum-based regimens have also been used before debulking surgery for stage IV and recurrent endometrial cancers.

**Postoperative Adjuvant Chemotherapy**

Although local-regional recurrence rates have been reduced and progression-free survival rates increased with postoperative pelvic radiotherapy in cases of endometrial carcinoma clinically limited to the uterus, but with surgically demonstrated deep myometrial, cervical and/or adnexal involvement, these favorable results were not further enhanced by the addition of cytotoxic chemotherapy. In surgical stage III endometrial cancers, the combination of chemotherapy with pelvic radiotherapy has been associated in some studies with increased rates and lengths of progression-free and overall survival and reduced local-regional recurrence rates.

Platinum-based cytotoxic regimens have been the most often used chemotherapy for both neoadjuvant and postsurgical chemotherapy for endometrial cancer; although targeted hormonal, enzymatic and cell growth, and proliferation inhibitors and immunotherapies are emerging for advanced endometrioid and for serous carcinomas.
