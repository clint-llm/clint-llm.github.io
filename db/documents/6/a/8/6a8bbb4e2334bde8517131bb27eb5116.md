The initial symptoms of envenomation vary depending on the species of cone snail and the victim. When stung by a piscivorous cone snail, one may feel anything from a sharp pricking sensation to unbearable pain.  At the envenomation site, local numbness, ischemia, cyanosis, and necrosis may occur and sometimes involves entire regions of the body. Given that the affected neurotransmitter pathways exist throughout the body, systemic symptoms may develop. These progress from initial weakness, sweating, and visual changes to generalized muscle paralysis, respiratory failure, cardiovascular collapse, and coma. If a patient is untreated, death is rapid and often occurs within one to five hours. Less severe envenomations, resulting from contact with a molluscivore and vermivorous species, are milder in their toxic effects. These effects are also variable and may include numbness, paresthesias, and limb immobility.
