Mammillary bodies receive blood supply from the circle of Willis, which runs on the inferior surface of the hypothalamus. Branches off the posteromedial artery directly supply the mammillary bodies. These arteries originate from the posterior cerebral artery but can originate off of the posterior communicating artery. The posteromedial artery has three branches: rostral, deep penetrating, and caudal. The caudal branches supply the mammillary bodies.

Capillary plexus around the region carry blood away from the mammillary bodies through the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial portal system.

Lymphatics within the brain differ from other regions of the body. Within the brain, the blood-brain barrier regulates the movement/transport of nutrients, small molecules, metabolites, and/or cells and toxins in and out of the brain.  The blood-brain barrier is a functional and structural boundary between vasculature and the brain that forms from brain vasculature endothelial cells, adjacent astrocytic end-feet, and pericytes. Tight junctions connect brain endothelial cells and create a physical barrier. This barrier forces most molecules to travel through selective transcellular routes – forming a transport barrier. In addition, there is also a synergistic relationship between brain endothelial cells and astrocytes. Perivascular astrocytic end-feet surround brain endothelial cells, but a basal lamina separates them. The barrier formed from these astrocytic end-feet and endothelial cells protect the brain from toxins and assist with transport of nutrients, wastes, glucose, lipids, and neurotransmitters between capillaries and neurons in the brain.
