Contraindications for hip arthrography include active infection of the hip joint, overlying soft tissues, or skin in line with the needle path. Cellulitis overlying the hip joint is a contraindication as infection can seed the joint space when the needle courses from overlying skin into the joint space.

Contraindications for hip joint contrast injection are similar to those for intravenous administration, including contrast allergy and impaired renal function. Adverse reaction risk is lower for intraarticular hip injection compared to intravenous administration of contrast. The decreased risk is secondary to a lower contrast dose and slower systemic absorption. In patients with a contrast allergy, a prophylaxis protocol should be followed.

Steroid prophylaxis is recommended for patients with a history of allergic reactions to contrast. For patients with impaired renal function, the risk of adverse reactions related to intraarticular contrast injection depends on the contrast dose and severity of renal impairment. The lowest contrast dose necessary should be diluted with saline in renal insufficiency patients. The recommendation is to refrain from contrast use in patients eliciting acute renal insufficiency.
