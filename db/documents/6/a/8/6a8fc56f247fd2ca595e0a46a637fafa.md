Tests to assist in the diagnosis of Paget disease include:

- Bone scan

- Bone x-ray

- Elevated markers of bone breakdown like N-telopeptide

This disease also may also present with the following findings:

- Elevated ALP (alkaline phosphatase)

- Normal Serum calcium and Phosphate

Measurement of serum alkaline phosphatase is useful as well as urine levels of hydroxyproline, C-telopeptide, and N telopeptide.

Procollagen N terminal peptide is also a sensitive serum marker for bone formation.

Hyperuricemia is common and is due to a high turnover of bone.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs in about 10% of patients due to inadequate calcium in the face of increased demand.

Plain x-rays may reveal arthritis or fractures of gross bony lesions.

Bone scans can help document the extent of disease and should be used to follow treatment. In addition, a bone scan can pick up early changes in bone even before the patient develops symptoms.
