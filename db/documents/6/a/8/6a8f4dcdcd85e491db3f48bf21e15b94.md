Caring for patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia is both rewarding and often complex. The perioperative management of these patients relies significantly on understanding the underlying physiology, experimental evidence, and expert consensus.

The primary goals for these patients involve identifying the unique anatomic and physiologic changes through perinatal work-up, enhancing prenatal pulmonary development, stabilizing and optimizing medically after delivery, and safely repairing the diaphragmatic defect under general anesthesia. During the prenatal stage, the anesthesia team can provide maternal and fetal anesthesia to enable successful occlusion of the trachea for those patients undergoing FETO.

Preoperatively, the role of the team is to ensure the neonate is sufficiently stable to tolerate the anesthesia and stress of surgery.Â For the diaphragmatic repair, the anesthesiologist provides anesthesia and analgesia for the infant while monitoring clinical stability and assessing potential complications. The key intraoperative focuses are ensuring hemodynamic stability, managing PH as needed, and avoiding pulmonary barotrauma through ventilator optimization.
