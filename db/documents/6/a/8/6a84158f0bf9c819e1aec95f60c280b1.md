For the diagnosis of diffuse interstitial lung disease, surgical biopsy via VATS or thoracotomy is the gold standard. Transbronchial cryobiopsy can be used as well. Traditional transbronchial forceps lung biopsies have been reported to have a low diagnostic yield. Ideally, biopsy samples should be obtained from more than one lobeNSIP is a diagnosis of exclusion. Nonspecific gross findings may be observed on wedge biopsy, including increased stiffness of the pulmonary parenchyma secondary to interstitial inflammation and fibrosis. The histopathology of NSIP is characterized by a temporally homogeneous inflammatory and fibrosing interstitial process. Fibroblastic foci and peripheral accentuation are typically absent, which helps to differentiate it from usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). NSIP is also characterized by diffuse alveolar wall thickening by uniform fibrosis, but with the preservation of the alveolar architecture. Three separate groups within NSIP have been described:

- Group 1: Mainly interstitial inflammation

- Group 2: Inflammation and fibrosis

- Group 3: Mainly fibrosis
