Hypertrophic scars are contained within the site of injury and may regress over time, while keloids spread beyond the borders of the initial injury and do not regress. On histological examination, hypertrophic scars tend to have collagen in a wavy, regular pattern, whereas keloids have no distinct pattern of collagen. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of hypertrophic scars/keloids and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the recognition and management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the recommended management of hypertrophic scars/keloids.
- Outline the typical presentation for a patient with hypertrophic scars/keloids.
- Review the pathophysiology of hypertrophic scars/keloids.
- Summarize the importance of enhancing care coordination among the interprofessional team to ensure proper evaluation and management of hypertrophic scars/keloids.
