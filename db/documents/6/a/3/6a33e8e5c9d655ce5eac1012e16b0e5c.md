Pitavastatin competitively inhibits 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Inhibiting this enzyme decreases the production of mevalonic acid from HMG-CoA. This enzymatic inhibition, in turn, increases the number of LDL receptors expressed on hepatocytes to compensate for the loss of mevalonic acid and results in greater LDL catabolism.

**Pharmacokinetics**

**Absorption**

Peak plasma concentrations of pitavastatin are reached within approximately 1 hour after oral administration. It has a bioavailability greater than 60%. It has some absorption in the colon; however, its absorption mainly occurs in the small intestine. In comparison to all other statins, pitavastatin reaches peak plasma concentrations the fastest and has the highest bioavailability.

**Distribution**

Pitavastatin is largely bound to protein (>99%), primarily to albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein, with a mean volume of distribution of 148L.

**Metabolism**

Pitavastatin is mainly metabolized in the liver by UGT1A3 and UGT2B7 and minimally by CYP2C9 and CYP2C8.

**Excretion**

The half-life of pitavastatin is approximately 12 hours. The majority of pitavastatin (79%) is excreted in the feces, whereas approximately 15% is excreted in the urine.
