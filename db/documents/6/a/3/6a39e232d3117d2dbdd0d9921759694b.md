Surgery of the spleen is not uncommon and is typically required for any traumatic event to the spleen which causes bleeding. Splenic rupture and/or lacerations may lead to life-threatening internal bleeding warranting a splenectomy. Partial splenectomy may also be considered based on the vascular segmentation of the spleen via the un-anastomosed arterial supply. A splenectomy may be performed via laparoscopy or laparotomy. Whenever possible, laparoscopy is recommended as it typically results in less scarring and faster recovery time for the patient as a less invasive approach compared to laparotomy. Other conditions which may require splenectomy include, but are not limited to hypersplenism (overactive spleen),Â  blood disorders such as idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), thalassemia, hemolytic anemia, sickle cell anemia), and cancer such as lymphoma, Hodgkin disease, and leukemia.
