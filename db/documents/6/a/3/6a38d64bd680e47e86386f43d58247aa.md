ALK(-) ALCL is a T-cell lymphoma characterized by large, anaplastic lymphoid cells with uniform, strong expression of CD30 but a lack of ALK protein expression. It tends to grow cohesively and invade lymph node sinuses. It also has a vast morphologic spectrum and may mimic other entities featuring pleomorphic and anaplastic cells with wreath-like or horseshoe-shaped nuclei. Morphology and immunohistochemistry are the mainstays used to distinguish this entity from other ALK-positive ALCL, CD30 positive T-cell lymphomas, and classical Hodgkin lymphoma as well as other non-hematologic malignancies such as carcinomas, sarcomas, and melanomas. ALK(-) ALCL has a poorer prognosis than ALK-positive ALCL, but it has a better prognosis than peripheral T-cell Lymphoma, NOS. Molecular studies have identified DUSP22 rearranged ALK(-) ALCL as having a prognosis similar to ALK-positive ALCL.Â Regarding treatment, ALK(-) ALCL is generally responsive to doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy (CHOP regimen), but relapses are frequent. CD30 is a newer therapeutic target and brentuximab vedotin (anti CD30) has been used for relapsed/refractory systemic ALCL.
