The development of tetralogy of Fallot is multifactorial; it has been associated with untreated maternal diabetes, maternal intake of retinoic acid, phenylketonuria, chromosomal anomalies (trisomies 21, 18, 13), microdeletions of chromosome 22q11.2, and Alagille syndrome with JAG1/NOTCH2 mutations. Other genetic abnormalities with a predisposition for tetralogy of Fallot include mutations in transcription factor NKX2.5, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphism, and mutations in TBX1 and ZFPM2.
