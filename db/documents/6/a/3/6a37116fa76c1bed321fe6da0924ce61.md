The musculoskeletal differential diagnosis of groin pain is broad and includes tendonitis (iliopsoas, rectus femoris), bursitis (iliopsoas), athletic pubalgia (sports hernia, sportsmanâ€™s hernia, pre-hernia complex, Gilmore groin), hip joint pathology (osteoarthritis, femora-acetabular impingement, slipped capital femoral epiphysis, avascular necrosis), osteitis pubis, sacroiliac dysfunction, neuropathic pain (radiculopathy, sciatica), and mechanical low back pain.

Nonmusculoskeletal causes of groin pain include urologic disorders, malignancy, gastrointestinal disorders, sexually transmitted infections, and, in women, gynecologic disorders.
