All LGICs share similar protein structures, the variability in the subtypes relating to their central pore with a differing affinity for specific cations/anions.

- GABA-A receptors - involves two alpha-1 subunits, two beta-2 subunits, and one gamma-2 subunit all situated in a ring around an anionic selective pore. Within the protein conformation, several allosteric sites are present, two serving as active sites for GABA binding and identified binding sites of several pharmacological agents including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, zolpidem/zaleplon, and flumazenil.

- Glycine receptors – involve three alpha-1 subunits and two beta subunits, situated in a ring around an anionic selective pore. Several allosteric active sites for glycine binding are present, as well as a binding site for strychnine – a crystalline alkaloid used as a pesticide.
