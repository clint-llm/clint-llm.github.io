Hepatocellular carcinoma is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in males worldwide. NAFLD is now a leading cause of HCC worldwide, especially in western countries. The incidence of HCC is expected to increase by 122% in the United States due to the increase in obesity and diabetes between 2016 and 2030. Chronic hepatitis B virus infection is the leading cause of HCC worldwide. Universal hepatitis B vaccination is likely to decrease the incidence of HCC worldwide.

Five-year survival of HCC is 18% and second to pancreatic cancer. Management of HCC is complex, and there is a variety of treatments for HCC from different specialties. An interprofessional team, including medical oncology, surgery, radiation oncology, interventional radiology, and lead by hepatologist is important in providing a holistic and integrated approach to patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and achieving the best possible outcomes.
