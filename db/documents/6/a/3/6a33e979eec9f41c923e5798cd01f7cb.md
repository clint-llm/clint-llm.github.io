Differentiating between bacterial, viral, and fungal meningitis may be difficult. CSF analysis may not be conclusive, and cultures do not immediately yield an answer. Multiplex and specific PCR panels are available and provide information in a few hours. Given the morbidity and mortality, it is prudent to initiate empiric antibiotic therapy and admit all those with suspected meningitis to the hospital on droplet precautions, until pathogen is identified, and appropriate antibiotics have been given for 24 hours.
