Treatment of papuloerythroderma of Ofuji consists of initially finding the underlying etiology and treating the secondary disease; this may include the treatment of infectious processes or removal of pharmacological agents. Those with idiopathic disease currently have no gold standard of therapy; however previous cases have received treatment with photochemotherapy (PUVA - psoralen and ultraviolet A), oral steroid courses, and cyclosporine. A 9-month course of cyclosporine at 3mg/kg was noted to lead to complete resolution of skin-lesions with some residual post-inflammatory change.
