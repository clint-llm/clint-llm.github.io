Although the fovea is located within the retina, it is not supplied by the central retinal artery or any of its branches. It is instead supplied with blood by the choroid, a vascular layer of the eye that contains connective tissue and lies between the retina and the sclera. The choroid also supplies oxygen to the outermost layers of the retina.Â The central 500 micrometers of the fovea contain no retinal capillaries and therefore, must be supplied by the capillaries of the choroid.
