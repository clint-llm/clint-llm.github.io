Acute liver injury: Reported cases have shown PTU to be associated with acute liver failure and death. PTU has a black box warning for this issue. There are cases reported in pregnancy, adults, and children. Hence, caution is necessary with its use, especially in the first six months of the start of therapy. Since the onset is unpredictable and variable, regular monitoring is not recommended. Educate the patient regarding the potential symptoms to come and visit the physician for anorexia, pruritis, right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, light-colored stool, and dark urine. Stop the drug at the first appearance of these symptoms and perform laboratory tests: biochemical (bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase) and hepatocellular injury markers (AST, ALT).

Hypothyroidism: PTU can lead to hypothyroidism- weight gain, constipation, or drowsiness. Hence, routine monitoring of TSH and T4 is necessary to maintain the euthyroid state.

ANCA-associated vasculitis: There have been multiple reported studies in which PTU-treated patients developed small vessel vasculitis and positivity to proteinase-3 or myeloperoxidase. Symptoms include- fever, weight loss, myalgia, arthralgia, and paraesthesia. Idiosyncratic reactions like this usually start within weeks of drug initiation but have been found to occur years later as well. Most patients responded to drug withdrawal, immunosuppressants, and substitution with other thioamide drugs for hyperthyroid symptom control. Complications included: leukoclastic vasculitis, glomerulonephritis (crescenteric or rapidly progressive), alveolar/pulmonary hemorrhage, cerebral angiitis, or ischemic colitis.

Hypersensitivity: Reports of severe hypersensitivity reactions like Steven Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and urticaria have been described.****

Agranulocytosis: This is a potentially life-threatening occurrence with PTU in 0.2 to 0.5 % of patients. The patients should receive instruction to report any symptoms suggestive of pancytopenia â€“ fever, sore throat, interstitial pneumonitis. The risk is at its highest in the first three months of treatment.

Potential teratogenicity: PTU was a Category D drug for pregnancy under the old FDA system.
