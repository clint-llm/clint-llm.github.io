The brachiocephalic veins also referred to as the innominate veins, are large venous structures located within the thorax and originate from the union of the subclavian vein with the internal jugular vein. The left and right brachiocephalic vein join to form the superior vena cava on the right side of the upper chest. These vessels are a vital component of the human circulatory system, aiding in drainage of deoxygenated blood from the head and upper limbs.
