Management of the grieving patient is optimal with an interprofessional team that includes a mental health nurse, palliative care team, psychiatrist, primary care provider, social worker, and other support teams. Even temporary grieving can affect patients both physically and mentally, and it is best to have a mental health nurse involved in the care early on. For most patients, time will help heal the grieving process, but some patients may benefit from counseling or the temporary use of pharmacotherapy.
