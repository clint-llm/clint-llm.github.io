Associated symptoms and signs of vaginal atrophy overlap with many other vaginal conditions, making it more difficult for a clinician to contribute the symptoms solely to atrophy. Differential diagnoses must exclude the presence of vulvovaginitis, including candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis. Sexually transmitted infections, such as gonorrhea and chlamydia. Dermatologic conditions including lichen planus, lichen sclerosis, or inflammation secondary to an irritant. Symptoms and signs may also mimic urinary tract infections or malignancy.

Although these differential diagnoses must be ruled out, their presence does not exclude the diagnosis, and simply may be recurring symptoms/infections secondary to ongoing vaginal atrophy.
