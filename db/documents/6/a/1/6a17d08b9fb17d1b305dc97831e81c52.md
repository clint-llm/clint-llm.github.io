The pathophysiology of plasma cell neoplasms is related to the monoclonal plasma cell proliferation and the disease entity. The abnormal plasma cell clone can cause lytic lesions in the bone, inhibit normal hematopoiesis, and lead to deterioration of renal function through the deposition of abnormal immunoglobulin. AL amyloidosis pathogenesis is due to amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloid deposition in tissues; AL is composed of intact immunoglobulin light chains or less commonly, heavy chains that are produced by the monoclonal plasma cells and then taken over and discharged by macrophages into the extracellular matrix.
