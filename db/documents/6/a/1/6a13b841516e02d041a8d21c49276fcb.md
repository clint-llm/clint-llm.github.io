Ludwig angina is life-threatening cellulitis of the soft tissue involving the floor of the mouth and neck. Ludwig angina involves 3 compartments of the floor of the mouth: sublingual, submental, and submandibular. The infection is rapidly progressive, leading to potential airway obstruction. The most common etiology is a dental infection in the lower molars, mainly second and third, accounting for over 90% of cases. Any recent infection or injury to the area may predispose the patient to develop Ludwig's angina. Predisposing factors include diabetes, oral malignancy, dental caries, alcoholism, malnutrition, and immunocompromised status. This review addresses the management and acute treatment of this possibly lethal condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify and recognize the clinical signs and symptoms of Ludwig angina.
- Implement appropriate diagnostic modalities to aid in the diagnosis and assessment of Ludwig angina.
- Apply evidence-based treatment strategies for Ludwig angina, including airway management, antibiotic therapy, and surgical intervention.
- Collaborate with all members of the interprofessional team including specialists such as otolaryngologists, anesthesiologists, and oral maxillofacial surgeons to provide efficient, comprehensive, and coordinated care.
