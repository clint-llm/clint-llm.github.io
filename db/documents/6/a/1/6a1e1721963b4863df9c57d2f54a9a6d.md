Cerebral palsy is a group of permanent disorders affecting the development of movement and causing a limitation of activity. Non-progressive disturbances that manifest in the developing fetal or infant brain lead to cerebral palsy. It is the most common cause of childhood disability. The degree and type of motor impairment and functional capabilities vary depending on the etiology. Cerebral palsy may have several associated comorbidities, including epilepsy, musculoskeletal problems, intellectual disability, feeding difficulties, visual abnormalities, hearing abnormalities, and communication difficulties. Treatment of cerebral palsy should be with an interprofessional approach. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and complications of cerebral palsy and underscores the importance of an interprofessional team approach to its management.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the various pre-, peri-, and post-natal etiologies that can result in cerebral palsy.
- Describe the physical examination process needed to evaluate a patient who presents with cerebral palsy.
- Review the interprofessional team approach that is necessary to manage cases of cerebral palsy.
- Explain the importance of interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to aid in the diagnosis of cerebral palsy and improving outcomes in patients diagnosed with the condition.
