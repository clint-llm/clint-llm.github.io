Blood pressure, body mass index, and blood sugar are mandatory before evaluating further. Also, the following workup would help in diagnosing the underlying systemic disorder leading to the retinal hemorrhages:

- Diabetes and metabolic syndromes: complete blood count and platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c and lipid profile.

- Hypercoagulable states: prothrombin time/ partial thromboplastin time, protein-C and -S, factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, homocysteine, antithrombin III, antiphospholipid antibodies.

- Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and autoimmune workup: antinuclear antibody, anti-ds deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), anti-nRNP antibody testing, anti-histone antibodies, anti-Ro/SS-A, anti-La/SS-B antibodies.

- Infective work up: ELISA, FTA-ABS/RPR.

- Masquerade syndrome: When the diagnosis is unclear, doing Lyme titers, herpes simplex titers, and FTA-ABS/RPR for syphilis will help in the diagnosis.

- Spondyloarthropathy: HLA-B5/B12: For conditions that present with anterior and posterior segment findings, one should rule out Behcet disease.
