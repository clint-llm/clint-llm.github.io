The biochemical considerations mentioned determine the structure of IgE and drive the function of allowing IgE to bind to given antigens and IgE-specific cellular receptors. For Immunoglobulin E to accomplish its function, the Fc portion of the antibody must bind to a given cellular receptor located on a particular type of cell, such as a mast cell, eosinophil, etc. Although many cellular receptors have been identified and studied, the main ones are Fc-epsilon-RI and Fc-epsilon-RII, or CD23.
