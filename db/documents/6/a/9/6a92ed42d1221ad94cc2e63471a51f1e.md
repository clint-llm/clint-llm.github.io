The International Classification of Vestibular Disorders (ICVD) described persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) in 2017. Symptoms are portrayed as unsteadiness, dizziness, or non-vertiginous dizziness, which are present most days for 90 days or more and exacerbated by positions such as sitting upright, standing, or walking and visually complex stimuli.

The condition is secondary to disruptions in visual processing and postural control mechanisms. It is classified as a chronic vestibular disorder, although there is an association with conditions such as migraine, anxiety, and depression.
