Primary care physicians and thoracic surgeons are more likely to encounter thymomas. Thymomas are also found incidentally on imaging by emergency department physicians. The treatment of thymomas should be undertaken by a multidisciplinary team at all times to determine appropriate treatment strategies. A thoracic surgeon should be involved with all cases of anterior mediastinal masses and thymomas; however, the consultation of other specialists may be needed, including medical and radiation oncologists, as well as a neurologist in patients with known myasthenia gravis. Often these neoplasms present asymptomatically and are found incidentally. Symptoms are related to local effects from the mass or paraneoplastic syndromes. Further imaging and lab studies are utilized to narrow down the differential.
