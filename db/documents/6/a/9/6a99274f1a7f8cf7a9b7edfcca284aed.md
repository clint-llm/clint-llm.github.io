While the general health care provider is almost always involved in the care of patients with streptococcal infection, caring for patients with the severe streptococcal disease, it is important to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that include a general surgeon, plastic surgeon, radiologist,  infectious disease, and speciality trained nurses.

Necrotizing fasciitis is a life-threatening condition, and due to the complexity of this disease, a team approach is required. Since necrotizing fasciitis is a surgical emergency, it is required that the patient should be admitted to a surgical intensive care unit, where the medical staff is skilled in performing debridement and, if needed, reconstructive surgery. Emergent surgical consultation is required to explore and debride the necrotic tissue. In addition, surgical exploration identifies the aetiology and extent of necrosis. CT and MRI may be helpful to locate the primary foci of infection. Hemodynamic stability should be maintained.

In patients with toxic shock syndrome, monitoring of cardiac output is important. Due to the high incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (55%) in patients with severe Streptoccoal soft tissue infection, intubation, and ventilatory support are needed. Greater than 50% of patients with severe soft tissue infections can develop acute renal failure; hence, dialysis may be needed.
