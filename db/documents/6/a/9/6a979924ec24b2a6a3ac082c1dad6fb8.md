The tongue is a muscular organ essential to a personâ€™s ability to communicate and to experience food via taste, chewing and swallowing. Injuries to the tongue, therefore, have a considerable impact on quality of life. Tongue lacerations can result from a variety of means including seizures, self-harm, blunt force facial trauma, oral trauma while intubated, and child abuse.
