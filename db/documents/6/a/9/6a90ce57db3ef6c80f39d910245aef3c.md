- HIV-associated lipodystrophy characteristically presents as lipoatrophy, lipohypertrophy, or a combination of both in HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy.

- The syndrome can significantly impact an individual's quality of life, both physically and psychologically.

- Treatment regimens containing thymidine analog nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), such as stavudine and zidovudine, are most commonly associated with lipoatrophy and should be avoided.

- HIV-associated lipodystrophy can be accompanied by hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia, contributing to morbidity.

- Management of lipodystrophy includes switching ART, lifestyle modifications, pharmacologic interventions, and surgical treatment.

- Because lipoatrophy and lipohypertrophy are challenging to treat, prevention is essential and can be accomplished by avoiding agents associated with lipodystrophy.
