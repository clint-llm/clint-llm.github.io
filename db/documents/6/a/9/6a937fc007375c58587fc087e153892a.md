Fluphenazine therapy is optimally managed by an interprofessional healthcare team comprised of physicians (MDs, DOs; including specialists), mid-level practitioners (NPs and PAs), nurses, and pharmacists. The drug is generally prescribed by a primary care provider, psychiatric nurse, or psychiatrist.

It is essential to monitor patients receiving fluphenazine therapy because the drug is notorious for causing extrapyramidal side effects and adverse cardiac events. An ECG is a requirement before starting the medication to ensure that the patient does not have QT abnormalities. The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale is a well-studied, easy-to-administer assessment for the emergence of extrapyramidal effects. Nursing staff can provide valuable feedback in this area and serve as the primary contact point for the patient with the team, coordinating all team members. Complete blood counts and metabolic panels are also necessary to monitor changes in white blood cell counts, liver transaminases, and blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. Additionally, the pharmacist must keep track of patient medications to verify dosing, avoid potential drug-drug interactions, counsel the patient regarding possible adverse events, and tell the patient how to dose their medication optimally. This interprofessional team approach with open information sharing can drive better patient outcomes with fewer adverse events.
