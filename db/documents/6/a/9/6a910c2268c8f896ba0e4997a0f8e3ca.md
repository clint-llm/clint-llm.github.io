The mainstay of management is the prevention of acute tubular necrosis by identifying the patients undergoing high-risk procedures and having comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, heart failure, advanced malignancy, atherosclerosis, and CKD that can potentiate the effects of acute tubular necrosis. The following are some of the high-risk procedures and conditions:

- Cardiogenic shock

- Hemorrhagic shock

- Pancreatitis

- Severe burns

- Sepsis

- Hypovolemia

- Major surgery (cardiac bypass, vascular surgery such as abdominal aortic aneurysm peripheral limb surgery, hepatobiliary surgery, emergent surgical exploration)

Interventions to decrease the risk of acute tubular necrosis in the above conditions include prevention of hypovolemia or hypotension, including cessation of ACEI or angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with low blood pressure, and optimization of volume status via intravenous (IV) fluids, such as crystalloids, to ensure adequate renal perfusion. Nephrotoxic medications that can lead to acute tubular necrosis should be avoided, including NSAIDs, antibiotics such as amphotericin B, aminoglycosides, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and radiocontrast agents.

Diuretics are used only to manage the volume status but are not recommended for the treatment of acute tubular necrosis in the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2012 guidelines. Other pharmacological agents such as dopamine, fenoldopam, and atrial natriuretic peptide do not provide any survival benefit in patients with acute tubular necrosis.

Renal replacement therapy (RRT) has the same indications and is used in volume overload refractory to diuretics, hyperkalemia, signs of uremia, and metabolic acidosis. In critically ill hemodynamically unstable patients, the use of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is the preferred option.
