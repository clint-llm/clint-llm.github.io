Syphilis is caused by infection with the spirochete, Treponema pallidum. Spirochetes are a phylum of bacteria that are characterized by long and helically coiled cells having flagella which provide them motility. It was first isolated from skin lesions of patients with syphilis in 1905 by Schaudin and Hoffman.T. pallidum is approximately 0.01 to 0.02 microns wide and 5 to 20 microns long and is almost invisible under direct microscopy but can be detected by darkfield microscopy.
