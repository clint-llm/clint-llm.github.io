The natural history of prostate cancer has been extensively studied in patients treated conservatively. Most localized prostate cancer represents an indolent disease, with population studies indicating slow progression in the majority over many years. This activity highlighted the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with prostate cancer.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the key risk factors in the development of prostate cancer.
- Outline the key steps in evaluating a man with an elevated PSA test.
- Describe the treatment options available to patients with localized prostate cancer and their side-effects.
