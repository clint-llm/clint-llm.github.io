Differential diagnosis of dysmenorrhea is broad, and it can be listed as gynecological conditions and non-gynecological conditions:

**Gynecological conditions:**

- Endometriosis

- Obstruction of the reproductive tract: Imperforate hymen, transverse vaginal septum, vaginal agenesis, OHVIRA syndrome (uterus didelphys with obstructed hemivagina and ipsilateral renal agenesis), cervical stenosis.

- Functional and nonfunctional adnexal cysts: Nonfunctional adnexal cysts include para tubal and para ovarian cysts, endometrioma, benign ovarian cysts such as benign cystic teratoma and benign serous or mucinous cystadenoma, and the rare cases of ovarian borderline or malignant tumors (germ cell, granulosa cell, or epithelial tumors).

- Adnexal torsion

- Adenomyosis

- Pelvic inflammatory disease / sexual transmitted infections

- Endometrial polyps

- Asherman syndrome

- Ectopic pregnancy

- Chronic pelvic pain

- Membranous dysmenorrhea

**Non-Gynecological conditions:**(gastrointestinal, urological, and musculoskeletal)

- Irritable bowel syndrome

- Urinary tract Infections

- Interstitial cystitis

- Musculoskeletal causes: abdominal wall muscles, the abdominal wall fascia, the pelvic and hip muscles, the sacroiliac joints, and the lumbosacral muscles
