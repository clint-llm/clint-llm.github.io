OASIS becomes essential as the assessment performed, preliminarily impacts how patient management will proceed. For instance, depression is one of the under detected conditions of the HHC system of New York City. The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene found that if patients in HHC received adequate treatment, about 70 to 80% responded positively. If providers had adequate training, referrals for treatment would increase. Also, there should be sufficient coordination between providers and mental health services for the HHC have sufficient detection, treatment, and follow up for the patients.

When including symptoms of depression in screening with OASIS, which is mandatory, it increases the efficiency of diagnosing underlying depression in HHC patients and, at the same time, treat them.
