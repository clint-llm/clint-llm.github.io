The fascial spaces confine early infection, but since the spaces communicate with each other, the inflammation can involve the other spaces as the infection progresses. The buccal space is the fascial space limited superomedially and inferomedially by fibers of the buccinator muscle originating from alveolar processes of the maxilla and mandible. Thus, the roots of the posterior teeth are related to this space. Any infection in the parotid may extend to the buccal space and vice versa.
