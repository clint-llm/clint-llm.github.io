Identifying and controlling the risk factors associated with cognitive impairment and dementia is key to planning a treatment plan for the patient.

Lifestyle modification has been shown to positively impact the risk of cognitive decline. Regular physical activity, engaging in cognitively stimulating activities, social activity, cessation of smoking, and healthy dietary habits have been linked to a reduced risk.

The Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study showed no significant difference in cognitive outcomes in the moderate-intensity exercise group and the health education control group. However, patients over 80 years and those with poor baseline physical activity had better cognition scores.

The Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) study revealed no difference in the incidence of dementia with the training of memory, reasoning, and speed of processing compared to the control group.

Cholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs), such as donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine, are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat mild to severe AD.

These medications should be cautiously used in patients with peptic ulcer disease, cardiac conduction disorders, and seizures. The risk of heart block must be assessed in all patients before initiating AChEIs with an electrocardiogram. Setting expectations with the patient at the beginning of the treatment prevents disappointment and establish realistic goals. The efficacy of the medication is determined 2 to 3 months after starting the medication with a reevaluation of cognition and function. These medications are not shown to delay the onset of dementia in patients with MCI.

Antagonists to N-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA), such as memantine, are another class of FDA-approved medication to treat moderate to severe AD. These medications prevent activation of the NMDAR (NMDA receptor) glutamate receptor to prevent cell death from calcium influx. The most common side effect of memantine is confusion and drowsiness.

It is important to note that even though AChEIs and NMDAs have therapeutic effects, they only help treat the symptoms and do not prevent or cure AD.

Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) target underlying mechanisms that damage a nerve cell. There are a few ongoing clinical trials that allow DMT (aducanumab, gantenerumab, and solanezumab) to be add-on therapies to either cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine.

Despite innovation, many new drugs fail phase III trials upon failure to meet the endpoint targets. Continued investigations into combination therapies, repurposing existing drugs, and DMTs add-on to standard-of-care are needed to meet the challenge of treating AD.

**Modifying other risk factors**- On cessation of smoking, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are reduced. Similarly, on stopping alcohol, there is a reduced risk of nutritional deficiency and alcohol-related neuron damage. Avoid ototoxic medications, clear out tympanic canal sediment in the clinic, assistive hearing devices, and audit rehabilitation can address hearing loss.

Treatment of depression can significantly improve the quality of life and function in the elderly population. Treatment options for depression are multimodal and not limited to psychosocial therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, medications, and electroconvulsive therapy.

Reducing the risk factors of MCI can slow the progression of AD-related dementia and delay mortality.
