The most common side effects are gastrointestinal, such as nausea/vomiting, constipation or diarrhea, flatulence, metallic taste, staining of the teeth, or epigastric distress. Patients may feel uncomfortable with the change in stool caliber and color to green or 'tarry black.' Many oral iron supplements (ferrous fumarate, ferrous gluconate, ferrous sulfate) formulations are associated with higher GI side effects than IV iron or placebo.

The adverse effects of IV iron may be infusion reactions and anaphylaxis.

Iron may decrease the absorption of other medications by forming an insoluble complex with those agents. These include methyldopa/levodopa, fluoroquinolones, penicillin, or tetracyclines.
