Necrotizing periodontal diseases are a clinical diagnosis. They are characterized by their aggressive nature and rapid onset, leading to extreme pain, gingival necrosis, interdental ulceration, and in more advanced stages, osteonecrosis

Although general dentists are responsible for providing the acute and initial management of NPDs, referrals to a periodontal specialist or oral surgeon should be made to manage the disease sequelae. It is imperative that dental and medical professionals simultaneously address the oral complications and underlying systemic conditions. An interprofessional approach will improve NPDs patients' outcomes.
