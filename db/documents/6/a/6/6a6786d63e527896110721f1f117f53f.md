Electrodiagnostic studies are performed especially in spinal stenosis because it helps the clinician to exactly localize and rule out other differentials. There are two main parts to an electrodiagnostic study, they include the nerve conduction study and the needle electromyography study. This activity reviews the electrodiagnostic findings associated with spinal stenosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of spinal stenosis.
- Identify the indications for electrodiagnostic studies in spinal stenosis.
- Summarize the risks and contraindications associated with electrodiagnostic studies for a patient with spinal stenosis.
- Describe the typical electrodiagnostic study findings associated with spinal stenosis.
