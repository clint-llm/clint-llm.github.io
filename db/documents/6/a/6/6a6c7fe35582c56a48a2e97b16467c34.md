Myoclonus can arise from several levels in the nervous system, ranging from the cerebral cortex to the peripheral nerves. Cortical myoclonus predominantly affects body regions with the largest cortical representations, such as the hands and face. As the motor areas of the cerebral cortex are mostly involved during voluntary actions, the jerks mostly manifest on the action (i.e., action myoclonus).

Brainstem motor systems are mainly involved in axial and bilateral movements and are near subcortical reflex centers. Thus, brainstem myoclonus is characterized by being generalized and stimulus sensitive (especially auditory stimuli). Its hallmark is auditory reflex jerks as in startle syndrome and brainstem reflex myoclonus.
