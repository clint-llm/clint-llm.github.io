Today, the majority of ectopic parathyroid glands are relatively silent without clinical manifestations. Because of this, surgery is not usually a recommendation unless the patient has symptoms. Guidelines for surgery include adjusted calcium over 0.25 mmol/L above the reference range, urine calcium greater than 10 mmol/ 24 hours, more than 30% reduction in creatinine clearance, less than -2.5 bone density T-score, and being less than 50 years old. Active ectopic parathyroid gland complications include namely hypercalcemia, which results in an increased fracture rate (more commonly in females), kidney stone disease, hypertension, cardiac valve calcification, and neurological symptoms (such as weakness, anxiety, and depression). For those patients that do not meet surgery guidelines, medications can be used and include hormone replacement therapy (specifically in post-menopausal women to decrease fracture rates) and calcimimetics that inhibit the release of PTH by binding to calcium receptors and dominating the negative feedback loop.
