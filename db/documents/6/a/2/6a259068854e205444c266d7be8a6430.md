If an osteoid osteoma affects the epiphysis, elongation of the limb may occur which can result in a limb length discrepancy.  If radiofrequency ablation is performed to treat the benign bone tumor, there are several identified complications, although they are rare.  These include cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, nerve damage, skin burns, and reflex sympathetic dystrophy.  To reduce the risk of neurovascular damage or damage to the skin, it is recommended radiofrequency ablation be reserved for lesions greater than 1.5 cm from a neurovascular bundle and greater than 1.0 cm from the surface of the skin.
