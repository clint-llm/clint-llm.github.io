On top of the increased use of PPIs in modern times and the resultant difficulty in diagnosing Zollinger-Ellison syndrome early, only 0.1% to 1% of patients with peptic ulcer disease (PUD) have ZES.

An article by Epelboym and Mazeh in 2014 presented the difficulty in estimating the incidence because of the overlap between ZES and PUD, and an accurate incidence cannot be determined, but gastrinomas are found in every 0.1 to 3 persons per million.
