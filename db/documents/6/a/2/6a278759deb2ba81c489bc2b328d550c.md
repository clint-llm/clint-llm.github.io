The larynx is derived from the endoderm and mesoderm.  It develops during the fourth week of life. A laryngotracheal groove initially forms from an extension of the foregut, which then becomes an esophagotracheal septum and the laryngotracheal diverticulum.

The third, fourth and sixth pharyngeal arches are the source of many of the muscles of the larynx.  The fourth pharyngeal arch forms the constrictors of the pharynx, levator palatini and cricothyroid.

The sixth pharyngeal arch gives rise to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, cricoid cartilage, arytenoid cartilages, corniculate cartilages and the intrinsic musculature of the larynx.

With regards to the intrinsic muscles of the larynx, the recurrent laryngeal brachial of the vagus nerve innervates all muscles, except for the cricothyroid which is innervated by the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve.  This nerve is a derivative of the fourth pharyngeal arch.
