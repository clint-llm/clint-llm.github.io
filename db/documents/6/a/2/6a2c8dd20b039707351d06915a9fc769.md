Continuous EKG monitoring is one of the current technologies used in the emergency department, intensive, post-anesthesia, and cardiac care units. Often, nurses are the first care responders in these hospital settings. The first interaction of the EKG view puts great responsibility on the nurses in managing technical aspects of the EKG monitoring and decision-making on the clinical grounds with information received from the monitor. The current practice includes that nurses initially interpret the EKG, gather data, and promptly notify the physician-in-charge to ensure an appropriateÂ management plan.
