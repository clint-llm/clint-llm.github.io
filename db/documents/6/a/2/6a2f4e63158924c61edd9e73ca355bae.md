While there are many tools used to evaluate a patient's anatomy, there are fewer tools to assess physiological function. Nuclear medicine can do both. While the images captured from nuclear medicine might not be as high of a resolution as images from computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, they can still be more sensitive for some indications. There is a wide range of uses for nuclear medicine, and new radiotracers are continually being developed. This presents a challenge to clinicians when sending patients for testing. Many patients who would benefit from these studies are not referred to have the study completed due to a clinician's lack of knowledge about the procedures.

Nuclear medicine has effective uses for myocardial perfusion imaging, detecting bone malignancies, detecting renal outflow obstruction, assessing thyroid nodules, detecting pulmonary embolisms, and more. Due to the nature of nuclear medicine, it can even be used to treat disorders such as hyperthyroidism and neural crest tumors.
