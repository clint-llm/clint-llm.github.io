Dilation and curettage (D&C) is one of the most common invasive procedures in the United States. The procedure can be performed on a pregnant or nonpregnant patient and be either diagnostic or therapeutic. Sometimes the circumstances lead to a diagnostic procedure becoming therapeutic. A patient seeking elective termination or management of a missed, incomplete, or inevitable abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy at less than 14 weeks of estimated gestational age could be offered this surgical procedure or medical management. Dilation and evacuation is a similar procedure employed at an estimated gestational age of greater than 14 weeks and is outside this activity's scope.

Approximately 30% of females will have an abortion by age 45 years; most of these occur in an outpatient setting.

A D&C may be performed in the evaluation of abnormal uterine bleeding. However, with the advent of aspiration devices for endometrial biopsy and advances in ultrasound technology, the D&C is rarely the first step in the evaluation. D&C may also be used to manage abnormal uterine bleeding refractory to medical therapy.

A D&C occurs in 2 steps: dilation of the cervix and curettage of the endometrial cavity. The first cervical dilators were available in the early 19th century. Recamier is credited with inventing the first curette in 1843, which resembled a small scoop or spoon with a long handle.
