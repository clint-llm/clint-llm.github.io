Pulmonary barotrauma is a potentially life-threatening complication in patients on mechanical ventilation. It is important to recognize and quickly act to prevent barotrauma for prolonged periods as this may lead to significant morbidity and mortality in patients intubated in the intensive care unit. This activity will highlight how to recognize, diagnose, prevent, and manage barotrauma in patients on mechanical ventilation.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of pulmonary barotrauma.
- Review the risk factors for developing pulmonary barotrauma.
- Summarize the management options for patients with pulmonary barotrauma.

- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by pulmonary barotrauma.
