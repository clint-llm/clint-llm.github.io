Peritonsillar abscesses are localized collections of pus in peritonsillar space between the tonsillar capsule and superior constrictor muscle. Since this space is composed of loose connective tissue, it is highly susceptible to abscess formation following infection. Clinical presentation may vary from acute tonsillitis with a minimal unilateral pharyngeal bulge to dehydration and sepsis. This activity examines the presentation, evaluation, and management of peritonsillar abscesses and stresses the role of an interprofessional team approach to the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Provide a differential diagnosis for a painful lump on the posterior oropharygeal or retropharyngeal mucosal surface.
- Explain the treatment of peritonsillar abscesses.
- Describe the potential complications of a peritonsillar abscess.
- Use well-coordinated interprofessional team approaches to provide effective care to patients afflicted with peritonsillar abscesses.
