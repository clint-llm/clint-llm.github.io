Untreated aneurysms are at risk of rupture (~60%), sepsis, thrombosis, and distal ischemia or multiorgan failure.

Complications of in-situ surgical repair are related to the prolonged operating time and resultant distal ischemia, such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, ischemic bowel, or acute kidney injury. Late complications of in-situ grafts are reinfection, graft failure, paraaortic leak, due to anastomotic failure or fistula formation. In-situ graft infections are associated with 100% mortality within two years if the graft remains in-situ.

The extra-anatomic bypass has fewer intraoperative complications, but the majority of the patients eventually develop limb ischemia or severe claudication.
