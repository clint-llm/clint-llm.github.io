Physical examination is the key to reach a proper diagnosis. General practitioners, including nurse practitioners and physician assistants (PAs), should be aware that early diagnosis will lead to expedient treatment with superior outcomes. Most patients initially present to the primary caregiver, emergency department, or nurse practitioner and hence, knowledge of a jersey finger is necessary to avoid the morbidity. Prompt referral to an orthopedic hand surgeon is almost always essential for definitive management.

Orthopedic surgeons must provide information regarding physical examination and complications of delayed diagnosis to other healthcare providers. Patients should always receive counsel regarding treatment options, especially those involved in sports.

Nursing should assist in the management process by helping during evaluation and surgery in the event a surgical treatment route is chosen, as well as assessing patient progress and compliance on subsequent visits. Pharmacists play only a minor role in this condition, primarily consisting of post-operative pain medication consult, with a view towards avoiding opioids if possible; they can consult with the provider on other pain management options outside of opioids.

Physical or occupational therapists can be crucial in both surgical recovery and non-surgical management and should coordinate with the treating physician on progress, since irrespective of the chosen treatment course, patients do need rehabilitation to restore finger function and joint mobility. The physical therapist should report on progress to the surgeon. Only through open communication between all members of the interprofessional healthcare team can the morbidity of a jersey finger be avoided. [Level 5]
