Patients typically will present with a 7-14 day history of a flu-like illness, including fever, malaise, myalgia, vomiting, and diarrhea.

- Adults will typically present with dyspnea, chest pain, and arrhythmias. Vital signs will be abnormal, including fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and sometimes hypotension. No single sign or symptom will be specific to make the diagnosis, but a presentation with chest pain or CHF often indicates a poor prognosis.

- Children will often present with grunting respirations and intercostal retractions. Infants will often present with fulminant syndrome, fever, hypoxia with cyanosis, respiratory distress/failure, and even cardiac arrest. Much like adults, long-term prognosis correlates with the severity of their initial presentation.

The physical exam may reveal the following:

- Sarcoid myocarditis may present with heart block and associated lymphadenopathy

- Giant cell myocarditis may present with ventricular tachycardia and heart failure

- Acute rheumatic fever mat present with chorea, erythema marginatum, polyarthritis, and subcutaneous nodules.

Physical findings may include an S3, rales, gallop, tachycardia and dependent edema.
