- Platypnea is commonly associated with orthodeoxia and both result from diseases that cause intracardiac or extracardiac right-to-left shunting significant enough to cause hypoxia.

- Measuring oxygen saturation in different positions should be performed any time platypnea is reported.

- Treatment of platypnea is directed to the underlying cause.

- Hepatopulmonary syndrome is defined as the triad of liver disease, pulmonary gas exchange abnormalities leading to arterial deoxygenation, and evidence of intrapulmonary vascular dilatations.[13]Diagnostic criteria for Hepatopulmonary Syndrome consist of the following :
            The presence of liver disease and / or portal hypertension
            An elevated room air alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient {P(A-a)O2Â gradient} > 15mmHg or > 20mmHg when age > 65years.
            Evidence of intrapulmonary vascular dilatations in the basal parts of the lungs
            Absence of other significant cardiopulmonary disease.
