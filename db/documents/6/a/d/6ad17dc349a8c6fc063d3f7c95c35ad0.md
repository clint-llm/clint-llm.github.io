Enhanced recovery after major surgery (ERAS) protocols are evidence-based, multimodal approaches used to facilitate recovery after major surgical procedures in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative periods. Anesthesia management plays a key role in providing standardized care achieving earlier recovery. This activity reviews the role of the anesthesia team in improving recovery and care of patients after major surgical procedures such as major gastrointestinal surgery, urological surgery, gynecological surgery, thoracic surgery, orthopedic surgery, breast surgery.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize current literature covering the ERAS protocol.
- Review the multifactorial approach of ERAS protocols in the perioperative period.

- Identify the role of the anesthesiologist in the ERAS pathways.
- Explain the benefits and challenges of the implementation of the ERAS system.
