WPW pattern is a rare condition, and most patients with preexcitation on ECG will never have symptoms, associated arrhythmias, or the most feared complication of sudden cardiac death. Two population studies put the rate of sudden cardiac death between 0.0002 to 0.0015 per patient-years for patients with WPW pattern. Some risk factors place a patient at higher risk for sudden cardiac death, including male gender, age less than 35 years, history of atrial fibrillation or AVRT, multiple accessory pathways, septal location of the accessory pathway, the ability for rapid anterograde conduction of the accessory pathway.
