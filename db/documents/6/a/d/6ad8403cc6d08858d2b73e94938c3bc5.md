Acute pharyngitis is a common infection and can be caused by a wide variety of organisms such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhea, and many others to include viral pathogens such as influenza. The presence of a maculopapular or scarlatiniform rash may make the infection appear like scarlet fever. A. haemolyticum can be differentiated from S. pyogenes in the laboratory by a negative strep and catalase test and aÂ positive reverse CAMP test. Severe upper respiratory infections may also cause diphtheria-like symptoms where a gray membrane overlying the tonsil or epiglottis can be seen.A. haemolyticum on tellurite enables differentiation from Corynebacterium diphtheria.
