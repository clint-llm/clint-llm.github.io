There are relative and absolute contraindications to placing central venous catheters, and contraindications may be site-specific. Relative contraindications may be overruled by the urgency with which the catheter needs to be identified and thus require careful consideration of the patient’s underlying pathology and hemodynamic status.

Absolute contraindications:

- Active skin or soft tissue infection at the potential site of the central line.

- Anatomical distortion at the site includes implantable/indwelling hardware, such as hemodialysis catheters and pacemakers.

- Vascular injury proximal or distal to the site of the catheter insertion, such as in traumatic injuries.

Relative contraindications:

- Coagulopathy, though the actual incidence of clinically significant bleeding is around 0.8%.

- Thrombocytopenia seems to correlate with a greater risk of adverse events.

- Uncooperative awake patient.

- Distortion of landmarks by congenital anomalies or trauma.

- Morbid obesity.

Typically, patients with an international normalized ratio (INR) of greater than 3.0 or platelets less than 20 x 10^9/L have severe coagulopathy and an increased risk of bleeding.
