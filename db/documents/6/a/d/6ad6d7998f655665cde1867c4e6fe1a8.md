Operative risk assessment is an integral part of patient preparation. Commonly used risk models to predict perioperative morbidity and mortality include the Euro score system and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Risk Model.

The STS model also requires surgical acuity, re-operative status, shock, and chronic lung disease. Aspirin should be continued, especially in those who present with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). For those patients who take P2Y12 inhibitors (e.g., clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor) and undergoing elective CABG, these drugs should be stopped for either five days (for clopidogrel) or seven days (for prasugrel) before the procedure. Beta-adrenergic blockers should be continued in the perioperative period unless contraindications exist. Recently, the use of intravenous P2Y12 inhibitor (cangrelor) allowed for earlier CABG operations as cangrelor's antiplatelet effects are very short-acting, and the intravenous infusion can be stopped before CABG.

Each patient should have recommended units of blood, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets cross-matched before the procedure. On the day of the procedure, the patient should have fasting of at least six hours, and intravenous antibiotics should be administered before CABG.
