The cause of frontal lobe disorders includes an array of diseases ranging from closed head trauma (that may cause orbitofrontal cortex damage) to cerebrovascular disease, tumors compressing the frontal lobe, and neurodegenerative disease. Other causes include epilepsy with frontal lobe foci, HIV, multiple sclerosis, and early-onset dementia.
