Aqueous humor production and drainage are not directly tested due to a lack of clinical utility. IOP acts as a surrogate measurement due to its association with glaucoma and the availability of cost-effective measuring devices. A clinician may measure IOP indirectly via ambulatory applanation tonometry, whereby air is used to flatten (applanate) an area of the cornea, and the pressure needed to do so is calculated.
