An auricular hematoma is a collection of blood underneath the perichondrium of the ear and typically occurs secondary to trauma.[1] Auricular deformity, commonly known as “cauliflower ear” is the result of untreated or inadequately treated auricular hematoma. It is important to recognize and drain this collection since a persistent hematoma can induce cartilage destruction with subsequent deformity of the ear.[2] Treatment involves drainage and evacuation of the hematoma either at the bedside or in the operating room.[3] To prevent re-accumulation, it is important to place a bolster dressing post drainage procedure to close the potential space.[2] Consultation with ENT or plastic surgery is beneficial as they can provide recommendations regarding diagnosis, management, and follow up.
