Disruption of the nodes of Ranvier and myelin may also occur as a result of autoimmune disorders, including Multiple sclerosis (MS), Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), and lupus.  Injuries to the white matter such as during neonatal hypoxia or following traumatic brain injury may also result in subsequent demyelination.

Multiple sclerosis characteristically presents with multiple lesions to the white-matter that develop across time.  Although reduction of conduction velocity, or complete conduction block, due to demyelination is the primary pathology associated with MS, the long-term progression of the disease symptoms also correlates with axonal damage caused by direct immune interactions with nodal/paranodal proteins.  For example, disruption of paranodal septate-like junctions due to loss of NF155 disrupts conduction by permitting extracellular current flow and the inappropriate redistribution of potassium channels into the node.

Guillain-Barre syndrome is an immune-mediated neuropathy that is mediated by antibodies that cross-react with endogenous proteins enriched in peripheral nerves, such as the ganglioside GM1 or members of the neurofascin adhesion molecule family, such as NF155.

Age-dependent changes to the molecular distributions of nodal and paranodal proteins may be implicated in cognitive decline.  In aged rodent and primate nerves, there is an increase in the inappropriate distribution of voltage-gated potassium channels into the nodal and paranodal regions.
