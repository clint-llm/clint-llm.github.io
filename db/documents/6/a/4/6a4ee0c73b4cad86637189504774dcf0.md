Basilar invagination is infrequently found in isolation and poses significant treatment challenges. Before any treatments specific to the condition, practitioners should screen for other associated anomalies. Advancements in diagnostic techniques have facilitated the management of this condition. Patients with reducible invaginations potentiallyÂ can avoid a combined anterior and posterior approach, requiring only posterior decompression and stabilization. The most appropriate surgical approach and fixation choices will likely remain controversial until high-level randomized trials can elucidate the most effective treatment course.
