A simple meningocele comprises of meninges and CSF protruded into the subcutaneous tissue through a spinal defect. Skin overlying meningocele is usually intact. A complex meningocele is associated with other spinal anomalies. Meningocele is a typically asymptomatic spinal anomaly and is not associated with acute neurologic conditions. Neural tube defects are the second most common type of congenital disability after congenital heart defects.

There are two types: open or closed. Spinal dysraphism comprises a spectrum of congenital anomalies stemming in a defective neural arch, from which meninges or neural elements herniate, leading to various clinical manifestations. Spinal dysraphism includes aperta (visible lesion) and occulta (with no visible external lesion). Meningocele, myelomeningocele, lipomeningomyelocele, rachischisis, and myeloschisis are the familiar names based on the pathological findings. Myelomeningocele is the most common among others accounting for 90% of cases.
