Complications of MR itself include progressive CHF with or without symptoms, LV dysfunction, development of atrial fibrillation, and subsequent risk of thromboembolism, right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, infective endocarditis. Early complications from the surgery or percutaneous intervention for MR include bleeding, infection at the local incision site, dehiscence of prosthetic material and infective endocarditis, stroke, atrial fibrillation, cardiac tamponade, and death. Late complications after the surgery include the redevelopment of MR requiring repeat surgery, symptomatic CHF, LA/LV enlargement and dysfunction, arrhythmias, and death.
