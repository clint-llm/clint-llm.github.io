Muscles within the retroperitoneum can be organized based on their location. Muscles contributing to the posterior margin of the retroperitoneal space consist largely of the transverse abdominal, psoas, quadratus lumborum, and iliacus. The paraspinous muscles contribute to the medial boundary on either side of the spine, and the abdominal musculature forms the lateral margin. The superior border is formed in part by the diaphragm, while the iliopsoas muscle is the primary muscle contributing to the inferior border.
