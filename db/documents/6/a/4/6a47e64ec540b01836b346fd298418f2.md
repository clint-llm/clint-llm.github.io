Within the floor of the fourth ventricle, also known as the rhomboid fossa, the facial colliculus can be found laterally to the median sulcus, which symmetrically divides the floor into the right and left halves. The facial colliculus is formed by the facial branchial motor nerve fibers (cranial nerve VII), which turn and loop over the ipsilateral abducens nucleus (cranial nerve VI). The abducens nucleus is located in the dorsal aspect of the caudal pons towards the midline, whereas the facial nucleus is located deeper within the tegmentum of the caudal pons. The loop around CNÂ VI forms a dorsal enlargement, and this observed bump serves as an essential landmark of the floor of the fourth ventricle.
