Cardiac catheterization is an invasive procedure that has evolved over the past four centuries. Although the description of circulation by William Harvey was the cornerstone of cardiac hemodynamics, Stephen Hales can be considered the pioneer of cardiac hemodynamics and cardiac catheterization as he measured the first arterial pressure in the early 17 century.

After the initial work and development of cardiac catheterization, William Sores described the first selective coronary angiogram when he incidentally injected contrast in the right coronary artery's ostium while doing an aortogram.

Left heart catheterization has a diagnostic as well as therapeutic role. Although it is used for cardiac hemodynamics and assessment of valvular lesions, its main diagnostic role is the assessment of coronary artery disease. In the contemporary era, left heart catheterization, especially selective coronary angiogram, is considered the gold standard test for coronary artery disease diagnosis.

In this article, we will summarize the anatomy, physiology, and indications of left heart catheterization. We will also discuss the basic technique, procedural complications, and clinical significance of left heart catheterization.
