Amid the pandemic caused by the deadly respiratory pathogen SARS-COV2, COVID-19 remains the topmost differential for any patient presenting to the emergency department with respiratory distress having bilateral infiltrates on the chest radiograph. Community-acquired pneumonia is another important consideration when dealing with a patient with significant respiratory symptoms, as it is quite common. EVALI is a relatively new disease, and there is a lot of confusion surrounding the diagnosis since it mimics the clinicopathologic presentation of various other pulmonary ailments. Nevertheless, the following patterns of lung injury have been reported with EVALI:

- Acute eosinophilic pneumonia

- Lipoid pneumonia

- Acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome

- Acute and subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis

- Organizing pneumonia

- Acute eosinophilic pneumonia

- Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage

- Respiratory bronchiolitis-associated pneumonitis

It is noteworthy to remember that the pathologies mentioned above can present without a history of e-cigarette use and hence should be considered as a possible differential in the appropriate clinical context.
