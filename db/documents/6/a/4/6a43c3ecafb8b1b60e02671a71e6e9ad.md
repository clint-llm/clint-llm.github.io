As discussed previously, the differential for dizziness is broad, given its varied sensations and causes. If a patient is experiencing presyncope or lightheadedness, this may point to a cardiac or autonomic etiology. Orthostatic Hypotension is diagnosed when a patient's systolic blood pressure drops by at least 20 mmHg or the diastolic blood pressure drops by at least 10 mmHg upon standing from a sitting or supine position. This can result in decreased cerebral perfusion, which then causes symptoms of dizziness.

In addition to the organic causes discussed already, there are multiple nonorganic causes of dizziness. One of the most frequent is medication-induced dizziness. While they cannot all be listed and discussed here, a provider should be aware of the common classes, including antihypertensives, antibiotics, diuretics, NSAIDs, antiepileptics, and antidepressants.
