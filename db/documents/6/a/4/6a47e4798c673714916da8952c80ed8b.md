Erythema ab igne is a rash characterized by a reticulated pattern of erythema and hyperpigmentation. It is caused by repeated exposure to direct heat or infrared radiation, often from occupational exposure or the use of heating pads. While the rash is most often benign, its presence can indicate chronic inflammation or, less commonly, systemic illness and should prompt further investigation. Furthermore, careful inspection of the rash may yield evidence of pre-malignant transformation and should prompt referral for biopsy. This activity explains when this condition should be considered, articulates how to properly evaluate for this condition, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of erythema ab igne.
- Describe the presentation of erythema ab igne.
- Summarize the treatment of erythema ab igne.
- Explain the role of the interprofessional team in collaborating to optimize evaluation, management, and care of patients with erythema ab igne.
