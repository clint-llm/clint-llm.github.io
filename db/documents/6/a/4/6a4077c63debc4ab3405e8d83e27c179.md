Preparation, procedure, and post-procedure of bidirectional Glenn shunt require a multidisciplinary approach. Before the procedure, the case must be discussed by the cardiologists, interventional cardiologists,s and cardiothoracic surgeons using the echocardiography and cardiac catheterization data if the patient is appropriate for BDG. Doing the operation involves the whole team of operating nurses, cardiac anesthesiologists, perfusionists.

Post-procedure, these patients need intensive care for a week or so and need help from the intensivists, intensive care nurses, and respiratory therapists. Sometimes these patients need Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the post-operative period and need to have an ECMO team ready to go.
