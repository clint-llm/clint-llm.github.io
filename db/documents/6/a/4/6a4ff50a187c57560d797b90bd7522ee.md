Historically, the chief complaints in case of pneumonia include systemic signs like fever with chills, malaise, loss of appetite, and myalgias. These findings are more common in viral pneumonia as compared to bacterial pneumonia. A small fraction of patients may have an altered mental status, abdominal pain, chest pain, and other systemic findings.  Pulmonary findings include cough with or without sputum production. Bacterial pneumonia is associated with purulent or rarely blood-tinged sputum. Viral pneumonia is associated with watery or occasionally mucopurulent sputum production. There may be an associated pleuritic chest pain with the concomitant involvement of the pleura. Dyspnea and a diffuse heaviness of the chest are also seen occasionally.

Common findings on physical examination include:

- Tachypnea

- Tachycardia

- Fever with or without chills

- Decreased or bronchial breath sounds

- Egophony and tactile fremitus, both suggestive of a consolidative process

- Crackles on auscultation of the affected regions of the lung

- Dullness on percussion
