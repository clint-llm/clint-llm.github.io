The use of an electrocardiogram has expanded from simple heart rate and essential rhythm monitoring to interpreting complex arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and other ECG abnormalities. The rapid detection of myocardial infarction has substantially reduced the door-to-balloon time for reperfusion therapy. Nurses' skills regarding assessment and comprehensive knowledge of the dysrhythmias can prevent stroke in atrial fibrillation and improve patient outcomes from the emergency department presentation through discharge and follow-up.

ECG outcomes in management are noticeable in every department within the interprofessional healthcare team. Interaction among clinicians (MDs and DOs, including specialists, NPS, and PAs), nurses, patient care assistants, pharmacists, and ECG technicians is critical to providing the most effective patient care. Interprofessional collaboration and teamwork in the hospital setting prevent significant medical errors through multiple checkpoints and ensure timely emergency care in cardiac emergencies. For better outcomes, excellent professional ethics, patient satisfaction, and staff proficiency in evaluating ECGs are mandatory. There should be effective, open communication between interprofessional team members with appropriate role clarity, shared policies, and strategies to improve system-related issues to drive optimal patient outcomes.
