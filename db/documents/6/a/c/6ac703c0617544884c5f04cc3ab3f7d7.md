Although surgery is the primary treatment modality of choice, optimal treatment of any sinonasal malignancy, BSNS included, involves collaboration with other services and members of an interprofessional healthcare team. It is important to review imaging for these tumors with a radiologist, specifically a neuroradiologist if available, to help determine tumor extent and possible involvement of adjacent structures.

If the tumor is extensive at the time of presentation, which it often is, consultations for ophthalmology and neurosurgery should be considered to help in surgical planning. Furthermore, just as with any other malignancy, all new BSNS cases should be formally discussed at a multi-disciplinary tumor board meeting. Post-operatively, the patient may require an intensive care unit stay for frequent neurologic monitoring. In any post-operative admission, communication between the hospitalist medicine team, nursing staff, and floor technicians is vital for excellent patient care.
