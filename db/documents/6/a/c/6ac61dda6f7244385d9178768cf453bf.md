Several decades have passed since the advent of PD.  Arguably it is the best method to determine with reasonable certainty the presence or absence of discogenic spine pain, yet its utilization has declined for several reasons.  First, PD is an invasive test and therefore carries risk, including the concern that the structural integrity of discs tested may be compromised leading to premature or more rapid degeneration.  Second, although PD is widely criticized for having unacceptably high false-positive rates, much of this controversy stems from earlier literature; a re-analysis of the data by members of the SIS found that in patients without a somatization disorder or prior back surgery the false positive rate per disc is in the mid-single digits, but only when performed with strict adherence to the published SIS guidelines.  Third, PD is unreliable in predicting spinal fusion outcomes when performed to relieve chronic spine pain.  It may, however, be unfair to judge the worthiness of a test by surgery with a known low-to-moderate success rate for this indication.  Finally, MRI has vastly improved the ability to define disc morphology, and some MRI findings such as the high-intensity zone and Modic changes correlate with the probability of discogenic lower back pain to some degree.
