Biotin (vitamin H or vitamin B7) is a B-complex vitamin that acts as an essential coenzyme for five carboxylases: pyruvate carboxylase, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, propionyl-CoA carboxylase, and coenzyme for acetyl-CoA carboxylases 1 and 2.

Besides, gut micro bacteria can produce biotin. The average dietary intake of biotin in the western population is approximately 35 to 70 mcg/day.

Nominal biotin deficiency has been noted in pregnant and lactating women, but its clinical significance is unknown. Biotin supplements are available in the market for improvement in nail, hair, and skin health, but there is no robust evidence available. Taking biotin supplements can interfere with some laboratory tests resulting in false-positive and false-negative results. There are studies reporting the efficacy of high-dose biotin in some neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis; however, the underlying mechanism is uncertain.
