Labs that are pertinent to the initial evaluation in a patient with cyanide poisoning are complete blood count, electrolytes, urinalysis, urine tox screen, arterial blood gas, carboxyhemoglobin level (if in a fire), chest x-ray, and EKG. Plasma lactate also may be obtained, and a level greater than eight mmol/L is 94% sensitive and 70% specific for significant cyanide toxicity. All patients presenting from a structural fire are to be presumed to have cyanide toxicity. Also, consider obtaining acetaminophen and salicylate levels to rule out co-ingestions. An increased anion gap metabolic acidosis is expected in patients with cyanide poisoning. It is also advisable to get a carboxyhemoglobin level in patients where this is a concern, such as fire or smoke inhalation victims.

Cyanide concentration levels may be obtained; however, the results are not available in time to be clinically useful. The results of direct testing are often unreliable because proper storage and prompt blood draws are needed. Given this fact, the clinician must rely on the presenting symptoms and the general clinical status of the patient.
