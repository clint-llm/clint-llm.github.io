Overall corneal ulcers take longer for healing. Bacterial ulcers heal relatively early than fungal corneal ulcers. Acanthamoeba keratitis might take even months for complete remission. Corneal scarring is the most common outcome following corneal ulcers. These cases can be managed later with glasses or with optical iridectomy or optical keratoplasty to restore vision.  Perforated corneal ulcers often tend to have a worse prognosis. The use of prior topical steroids in fungal and Acanthamoeba keratitis worsens the prognosis.
