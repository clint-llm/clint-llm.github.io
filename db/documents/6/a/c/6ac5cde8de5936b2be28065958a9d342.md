Resident training is quite a dynamic process. Training in any healthcare profession is quite dynamic. No two residents/students will have the same experience during their shifts, rotations, or entire training experience. Therefore, programs are obligated to ensure each resident has the knowledge and requisite skill to provide life-saving and stabilizing care to any patient that should present to the emergency department in which they work. Given the environmental dynamics relative to the individual programs, departments, and individual experience, simulation has become a more standard way to ensure that each resident has met the requirements to be proficient in their practice of Emergency Medicine. Various researchers over the past millennia have developed several models and educational theories. Knowledge of these theories is paramount in understanding the multiple ways in which people, and in this case, adults, learn. Understanding how adults learn is directly related to the effectiveness of teaching scenarios.

A few widely described educational theories:

- Malcolm Knowles Adult Theory of Andrology:

- 
              
- Cognitive load is the amount of information the working memory can store at any given time.
              
              
- Maintains that working memory has a limited capacity, and instructional design should seek to avoid overloading working memory.
              
              
- Suggest that as learners advance to expert levels, the learners develop "schema" or cognitive frameworks that allow the expert to work systematically through problems.

- Sweller's Cognitive Load Theory:

- 
              
- Adults learners are most engaged when they are involved with the planning, implementation, and evaluation of their learning.
              
              
- Experiential based learning platforms are most effective for adult learners.
              
              
- Adults care and are more attentive to ideas and subjects that have a direct and immediate bearing on their profession.
              
              
- Adults achieve learning through problem-oriented teaching rather than subject-based teaching.

- Kolbs Experiential Cycle Theory:

- Experiences occur within social settings, and knowledge is organized and constructed based on those real-life social experiences.
- Therefore, new knowledge should be presented in the context of real-life experiences.
- Instructors should organize content and subject matter such that they grounded in real-life experiences.
- The real-life experiences should match the learner's realm of capability, aptitude, and capacity.
- The quality of the experience directly relates to the learner's ability to apply the newfound knowledge.
- The newfound knowledge allows the learner to repeat the steps to continue new knowledge acquisition.

- Dewys Speculative Theory:

- 
              
- Concrete Experience: Learner encounters a new experience or revision of prior encounters.
              
              
- Reflective Observation: Learner reflects on variations of their perceptions and knowledge versus the experience or encounter.
              
              
- Abstract Conceptualization: Learner's reflection leads to the development of new ideas, concepts, and/or skills.
              
              
- Active Experimentation: The learners apply the newly generated ideas, concepts, and/or skills to their world and observes their effect.
              
              
- This is a cycle whereby, after active experimentation, the learner has created a new "concrete experience" and thus repeats the steps.

- Dreyfus/Benner Model:

- 
              
- Novice: Learners are rigid in following the rules, plans, or steps and have not yet learned to exercise discretionary judgment.
              
              
- Advanced Beginner: Have advanced, however, are still limited to situational awareness and have not progressed to prioritization of tasks and ideas.
              
              
- Competent: The learner begins formulating routines and plans and can now multitask concerning the activity and has generated some preception of ultimate goals.
              
              
- Proficient: Learners are now able to understand deviations of "norms" and develop independent holistic views of situations.
              
              
- Expert: At this level, the learner has now transcended from normalized views and proceeds with a vision of what could be rather than what is.

When constructing simulation scenarios, the designer must keep in mind these basic education and learning theories as guides to the design of effective scenarios for their adult learners. Simulation scenario objectives should be designed as such to focus on these three broad areas.

- Cognitive: What knowledge will be applied?

- Psychomotor: What actions will be performed, skill, or otherwise?

- Affective: What feelings will be generated?

An objective, however, does not need to encompass all three areas to be effective and may simply focus on one task. Objective designers also must keep in mind the who, what, where, and how so that objectives can be matched properly to the learners. For example:

- Who is the intended audience? (I.E., PGY3 EM residents, First Year Paramedic Students, Practicing ICU Nurses, Commerical Airline Pilots, etc.)

- What would be the behavior or action that the objective is attempting to elicit? (I.E. The EM resident will intubate withing 2 minutes of scenario onset)

- Where are the conditions upon which the scenario/simulation is occurring? (I.E., You are a paramedic called to a multivehicle accident on a busy six-lane highway)

- How in-depth and to what extent is the learner expected to proceed? (I.E., A 78-year-old has witnessed the arrest. The learner is a first-year nursing student. The scenario ends when they call for help)

Additionally, several aspects have been identified and are commonly employed in and recommended for successful adult learning programs. These include:

- A safe environment is explicitly established. A safe environment allows learners to feel supported and acknowledged.

- The environment allows freedom and creativity and avoids rigid patterns or structures.

- Adult learners are treated as respected and intelligent peers capable of learning and performing to the level of the instructor.

- Learners are inspired to accept responsibility for their learning so that they may achieve professional competence.

- Learner intellect and skill are challenged optimally, meaning challenges should be designed to extend just beyond the learner's present ability.

- Learners are actively engaged in the learning process. Active engagement may include learner-led lectures, encouragement of questions, and dynamic instructor/learner dialogue.

- Learners are encouraged, and mechanisms provided to allow adequate feedback.

Debriefing is critical to successful simulation programs. A debriefing occurs following the simulation scenario. Debriefing differs from feedback as debriefing is a facilitated and active discussion between the learners involved in the scenario and the instructor.
