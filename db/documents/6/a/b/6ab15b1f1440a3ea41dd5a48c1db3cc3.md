Suspicion for gas gangrene should arise with traumatic wounds causing vascular compromise, especially with soil involvement. Common settings and conditions associated with gas gangrene include bowel and biliary tract surgery, gunshot wounds, knife wounds, open fractures, abortion, retained placenta, prolonged rupture of the membranes, intrauterine fetal demise, and intramuscular injection.

Traumatic gas gangrene usually presents with sudden onset of severe pain. The mean incubation period is less than 24 hours, depending on a variety of factors, including the amount of bacterial introduction and the extent of the vascular compromise. The skin over the infected area initially appears pale. The area then becomes a bronze color, eventually transitioning to purple, red, or black discoloration. Eventually, dark hemorrhagic bullae develop along with massive edema. Crepitus may be felt due to gas production, although this is dependent on the amount of edema. Sometimes odor may accompany the wound and is often described as a sweet smell. Fever and tachycardia may also be present.
