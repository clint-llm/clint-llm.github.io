Considering that prognosis and outcomes are often varied with patients rarely returning to baseline functionality, the physician plays an important role in managing expectations. Patients should be educated on various complications such as limited chronic range of motion, early arthritis, and predisposition to reinjury. A physician managing athletes, especially those predisposed to finger injuries such as football and basketball players, should advice his/her patients to present early in the setting of jam-injuries of the fingers. Educating patients that a delay in management can have possible long term sequela that could limit further participation in sports.
