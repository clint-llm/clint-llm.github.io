Adult T cell leukemia is primarily caused by HTLV-1 infection that is transmitted through breastfeeding, sexual contact, and blood transfusion. Although most of the individuals who carry HTLV-1 infection remain asymptomatic, they are at an increased lifetime risk for developing ATL. There is no uniform screening. However, patients should avoid prolonged breastfeeding (more than six months); condom use should be encouraged by physicians. Patients should be educated for the risks of intravenous drug-related infections, including HTLV-1.
