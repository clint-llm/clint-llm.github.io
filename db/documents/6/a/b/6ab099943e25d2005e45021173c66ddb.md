Personnel required for CO2 laser resurfacing include the operator, who can be a licensed physician, including dermatologists, otolaryngologists, plastic surgeons, and oral surgeons, or who may be a clinician with a lower level of training supervised by a physician. Assistance for the procedure can be provided by physician assistants or nurses who are trained in the use of lasers for cutaneous ablation. All members of the healthcare team must have training in laser safety. This same team should also provide pre-procedure evaluation and counseling as well as post-procedure follow-up.
