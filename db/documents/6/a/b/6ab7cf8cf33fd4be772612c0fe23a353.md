The diagnosis, treatment, and management of bronchial atresia is a team-based approach involving the coordination of care between respiratory therapy, nursing, radiology, thoracic surgery, pulmonology, and the primary care provider. If the patient is asymptomatic, the healthcare team must discuss conservative management versusÂ elective surgery. If the patient is suffering from severe effects from bronchial atresia, early consultation with thoracic surgery and pulmonology is necessary. Appropriate follow-up and postsurgical care are imperative for the management of this condition.
