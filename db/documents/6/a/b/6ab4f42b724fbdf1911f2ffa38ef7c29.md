The first method used to isolate Reed-Sternberg cells was via suspension of fresh tissue samples. Reed-Sternberg cells were selected based on their size and negative expression of CD3, CD14, and CD20. This method did not yield consistent results and was improved upon by suspending cells onto glass slides and immunolabeling for CD30. A second technique for cell isolation used thick paraffin sections instead of fresh tissue. Enzymatic digestion and mechanical force were used to suspend cells. The suspended cells were labeled for CD30 and isolated using a hand pipette. Another technique involved usage of hydraulically driven pipettes.
