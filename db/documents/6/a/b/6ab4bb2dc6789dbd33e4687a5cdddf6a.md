# Continuing Education Activity

Organ transplantation is defined as removal of organ from one person ( donor) to placement into another person who is called recipient.Transplantation is performed in patients with end-stage organ failure and can increase life expectancy while also improving the patient's quality of life. The most commonly transplanted solid organ is the kidney, followed by the liver, heart, and lungs. Pancreatic and intestinal transplants are performed as well but are less common. More recently, vascularized composite allografts (VCAs, e.g., face, hand, penis) have been performed for reconstructive procedures.Non-vital tissues, such as bones, corneas, and tendons, may also be transplanted. This activity reviews the concerns and implications of organ donation, retrieval and transplantation into recipient. This activity highlights the role of inter professional team for successful organ procurement and transplantation.

**Objectives:**
- To identify the brain death in the trauma patients who will be potential organ donor.
- Describe the critical pathway of organ procurement from trauma patients
- To understand the concepts associated with organ retrieval
- To emphasize the importance of inter professional team approach in improving graft and patient outcome.

# Introduction

Organ transplantation is the removal of an organ from one person (the donor), and placement into another (the recipient). Transplantation is performed in patients with end-stage organ failure and can increase life expectancy while also improving the patient's quality of life. The most commonly transplanted solid organ is the kidney, followed by the liver, heart, and lungs. Pancreatic and intestinal transplants are performed as well but are less common. More recently, vascularized composite allografts (VCAs, e.g., face, hand, penis) have been performed for reconstructive procedures.

Deceased patients are the major contributor to donor organs, and the most common causes of death are cerebrovascular accidents followed closely by traumatic brain injuries. In recent years, opioid overdoses have become another significant source of deceased organ donation.

Living donations are less common but still serve to increase the existing donor pool. Over 7300 living donations were performed in the United States in 2019, saving patients from a potentially long-wait on the transplant list. The most frequently donated organ is a kidney, but portions of the liver or lung are transplanted as well. More recently, living donations of VCAs have been explored.

The number of patients awaiting organ transplantation far outstrips the availability of donor organs. In the United States, estimates are that a new patient is added to the transplant list every ten minutes, and twenty patients die every day while awaiting transplant. In 2019, surgeons performed nearly 40,000 transplants, but at the end of the year, over 110,000 patients remained on the waiting list. While there are multiple ways to consent to organ donation (including a signed donor designation, designation on a driver's license, or signed consent from the deceased's next-of-kin), the estimate is that only 30 to 40% of potential donors in the United States become actual organ donors.

# Function

**The Function of Transplantation in Trauma Patients**

Patients who have suffered traumatic injuries should be evaluated and resuscitated according to Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocol, developed by the American College of Surgeons (ACS), including a proper primary and secondary survey.

- Phase I - Identification of Potential Organ Donors, Referral to OPO

- Phase II - Declaration of Death, Acquisition of Consent for Organ Donation

- Phase III - Donor Evaluation

- Phase IV - Donor Management

- Phase V - Organ Procurement

Trauma donors are generally younger and have fewer co-morbidities than non-trauma donors. On average, trauma donors are more likely to yield additional (non-kidney) organs and produce more organs per donor, overall.

# Issues of Concern

Medical ethics, a set of values used to navigate complicated situations, are founded in the concepts of patient autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice.

In 2016, Canada introduced Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID), for cases of grievous and irremediable suffering. With an estimated 2,000 cases of euthanasia per year, this may present another avenue for increasing organ availability. From 2016 to 2019, 30 patients made donations for a total of 74 organs donated.

# Clinical Significance

**Donation after Brain Death (DBD)**

The definition of brain death is the irreversible loss of consciousness, absence of brainstem reflexes, and persistent apnea. It is a clinical diagnosis made by two independent physicians. The most common causes are cerebrovascular accidents and traumatic brain injuries, but can also occur secondary to anoxia or brain tumors. To make a diagnosis of brain death, the patient must be in an irreversible coma with a known cause and completely unresponsive to mechanical stimuli. All reversible causes of coma must be excluded. The patient must be weaned off CNS depressant medications (alcohol, opioids, anesthetics) and neuromuscular-blocking agents. The patient cannot be hypothermic (core body temperature <35 degree Celsius) or hypotensive (mean arterial pressure [MAP] <60 mmHg). Severe acid-base and electrolyte abnormalities must be ruled out as well. All brainstem reflexes should be assessed, including the pupillary, corneal, oculocephalic, vestibular, and cough/gag reflexes. Spinal reflexes remain in up to 75% of patients, and their presence does not preclude a diagnosis of brain death. The apnea test can assess ventilatory drive. The patient is disconnected from the ventilator for 10 minutes, and a positive test occurs with absent respiratory effort and increasing PaCO2. The apnea test should stop, and the patient reconnected to the ventilator if the patient experiences hypotension, hypoxemia, or cardiac arrhythmia. A false-positive apnea test can occur when the patient is sedated or with a high cervical injury impairing diaphragmatic function. While brain death is a clinical diagnosis, additional testing can support the diagnosis, particularly when confounding factors are present. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a common method to assess for brain electrical activity, as it is non-invasive and is performable at the bedside. However, it can be heavily influenced by sedation, hypothermia, and metabolic derangements, limiting its usefulness. Cerebral angiography, transcranial doppler ultrasound, and cerebral scintigraphy - all assessments of cerebral blood flow - are not influenced by CNS depression, hypothermia, and metabolic disorders, making them very useful as confirmatory tests for brain death.

**Donation after Circulatory Death (DCD)**

Circulatory death, defined as the permanent absence of respiration and circulation, is becoming increasingly prevalent in attempts to expand the number of potential organ donors. The typical DCD patient is one who has suffered a neurologic injury but does not fit the criteria for brain death; less common are patients with respiratory or neurodegenerative disease who are planning to withdraw treatment electively. Initially, only kidneys were transplanted, but the practice has expanded to include liver, lung, and pancreatic transplants. One of the primary challenges of DCD is the balance of ensuring donor death, while also limiting ischemia to the desired organs.  The Maastricht classification system is used to classify these patients into five categories based on the type of circulatory death, location, and other factors. There are two defined forms of DCD - controlled circulatory death, and uncontrolled circulatory death.

**Organ Procurement**

Following the death declaration and appropriate preparation, the process of organ retrieval may then commence in the operating room. The patient is prepped and draped in a sterile fashion, and the intended organs mobilized. The donor is then exsanguinated, and blood rapidly replaced with a preservation solution. These solutions are hypothermic (often 5 to 10 degrees Celsius) and function to rapidly lower the temperature of the intended organs - decreasing metabolism and facilitating preservation. Rapid cooling can be enhanced with topical ice. Following cooling, the intended organs are removed, placed in sterile containers on ice, and then transported to another location for implantation. In general, the heart/lungs are removed first, followed by the liver then the kidneys. During organ removal, vascular conduits are an option to assist with vascular reconstruction during implantation. After solid organ removal, other tissues (bones, corneas, tendons, etc.) may be removed.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Successful organ procurement in traumatic patients requires extensive coordination and teamwork between many groups. Many factors can influence the number of organ donations performed. Early detection protocols with referral to an organ procurement organization (OPO) in the emergency department can lead to an increased likelihood of successful organ procurement.

Notification of the OPO is particularly important, as they have significant responsibility in the procurement process. OPOs are responsible for increasing the number of available donors and coordinating the donation process for these potential donors. Trained and experienced professionals can counsel families on brain death, the importance of organ donation, and can obtain consent from the family if needed.

The acquisition of donor organs also requires extensive teamwork, primarily due to the number of teams involved. The treatment team and procurement teams are separated to avoid conflicts of interest. Therefore, the treatment team must work independently to withdraw care but also keep the transplant team informed for prompt organ retrieval. Often, there are several procurement teams to retrieve different organs for transplantation, so they must coordinate amongst themselves. Lastly, in cases of heart/lung transplantation, the initial organ implantation is often done in the same operating room (to limit ischemic time), and that adds further complexity. Extensive coordination and cooperation between the trauma team, OPO, treatment team, procurement teams, and supporting staff are crucial to maximizing the number of organs procured and achieving the best outcomes for patients.
