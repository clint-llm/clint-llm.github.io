A smooth tendon suture is important for restoring a low-friction gliding surface and facilitating tendon rehabilitation. Mastering a method that allows for atraumatic suture placement with stable, accurate coaptation of the tendon ends that is strong enough to allow early digital mobilization while preventing gapping is a focus for improving the strength and efficacy of flexor tendon repairs while optimizing patient outcomes.

Limited skin incisions, gentle handling of the tendons, and sharp dissections are important surgical tips to minimize postoperative adhesion formation, in addition to lessening the use of cautery around tendons while permitting minor bleeding to coagulate naturally.
