The facial and lingual arteries are branches of the external carotid artery which run close to the vallecula.Â  The lingual artery runs parallel to the fibers of the geniohyoid and is at the level of the hyoid bone.

Venous drainage of the area follows a similar pattern. The lingual vein and the pharyngeal venous plexus drain to the internal jugular vein.

Lymphatic drainage in the area of the vallecula includes both tonsils and lymph nodes. The palatine tonsil and the lingual tonsils are within a few centimeters of the vallecula. There is also an extensive amount of lymphatic tissue called the lateral bands of the pharynx in this region. Combined, these tonsils and the lateral bands make up Waldeyer's ring, or nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT). The deep cervical lymph nodes are the primary drainage of the vallecular region. These lymph nodes drain to the jugulofacial venous junction, which continues to drain inferiorly to the jugulo-subclavian venous junction bilaterally.
