The condition typically begins with dysesthesias like a tingling sensation in the palms and/or soles and produces symmetric, well-demarcated painful erythema that can progress to blistering with desquamation, erosion, and ulceration. An especially severe bullous variant that advances to full-thickness epidermal necrosis and sloughing has been reported following cytarabine or high-dose intravenous methotrexate, particularly in children.

Although rare, acral erythema involving the penis and scrotum has been reported.

A presumed variant of acral erythema, called fixed erythrodysesthesia plaque (FEP), is characteristic of intravenous (IV) injections of docetaxel. This lesion develops as a fixed, single plaque, proximal to the infusion site, which does not include the palms or soles. It resolves with desquamation and leaves an area of hyperpigmented skin in 5 to 6 weeks.

Temporary Loss of fingerprint is seen with capecitabine-associated, chronic acral erythema and can cause identification issues.
