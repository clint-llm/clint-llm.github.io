Equally important as the selection of suturing materials is the appropriately selected knot and technique. Two primary knots are utilized in dentoalveolar circumstances: the slip knot (Figure 1) and the surgeon’s knot (Figure 2).

The primary factor when selecting one or the other is the suture material utilized. A surgeon’s knot must be selected when using synthetic suture materials to prevent loosening of the knot. Synthetic sutures like polyester maintain memory (they will unravel to return to a straight position). First, a surgeon’s knot is done by tying a double overhand throw; then, an additional single overhand throw is placed in the opposite direction to lock the knot. The granny or surgical slip knot enables the surgeon to tighten the suture toward the tissue and pull the flap edges together. The slip knot may be used with gut and chromic gut suture materials. This knot is not recommended when using resorbable or non-resorbable synthetic materials. The surgical slip knot is executed by making two separate overhand knots in the same direction, pulling taught and re-approximating the wound edges without blanching the tissue, then place an additional overhand throw in the opposite direction to lock the knot.

Suturing techniques consist of interrupted and continuous suturing methods. The simple interrupted and crisscross (Figure 3) are two interrupted techniques frequently utilized in dentoalveolar settings to approximate tension-free wounds and flaps.

The simple interrupted technique is accomplished by first penetrating the buccal gingiva, crossing the wound, and exiting the lingual tissue with the needle oriented medially throughout this movement. A loop is created, and the suture thread is tied off at the original entry point. This technique may be utilized for closing small wounds or placed in multiples to close larger wounds.

The crisscross technique is an ideal choice for extraction sites, maintaining both the blood clot and materials packed into the socket, such as gel foam, collagen plugs, and graft material. The crisscross technique can be performed in two manners. The first is where the needle is inserted into the mesial/buccal gingiva and exits the distal/buccal gingiva. The needle crosses over the alveolar arch or extraction site, enters the mesial/lingual gingiva, and exits the distal/lingual tissue. The suture is then tied off to the non-working end of the suture thread at the original entry point on the buccal/mesial of the extraction site. The crisscross technique can also be performed where the needle enters the mesial/buccal gingiva, crosses the extraction site, and exits the mesial/lingual tissue. The suture thread is brought across the extraction site, enters the distal/buccal gingiva, and exits the distal/lingual gingiva. The suture thread is then tied off at the original entry point at the mesial/buccal non-working end. The crisscross and interrupted techniques are not recommended for flaps or wounds that are under tension.

The horizontal mattress technique (Figure 4) is an interrupted suturing technique recommended for flaps under tension where the flap is released beyond the mucogingival junction. This technique is performed by first entering the mesial/buccal gingiva and exiting the mesial/lingual gingiva. The suture thread enters the distal/lingual tissue, crosses the wound, penetrates the distal/lingual tissue, and is then tied off at the original entry point at the mesial/buccal non-working end. Since prolonged tension is expected when using this technique, it's prudent to use a longer-lasting resorbable or permanent suture.

The continuous suture (Figure 5) is used when longer wounds are present, such as full mouth extractions. The continuous suture can be locking and non-locking. The advantage of the locking variation is that some security will remain if either knot unties. With the non-locking variation, if either knot comes untied, the flap is compromised, and the wound will likely dehisce. The advantage to the continuous suture is that it applies evenly distributed pressure across the entirety of the wound. Continuous sutures under tension can be reinforced with separate, simple horizontal mattress sutures.
