Pyoderma gangrenosum is an ulcerative disorder that falls into the category of neutrophilic dermatoses. Pyoderma gangrenosum should not be confused with pyogenic granuloma, a completely separate entity but with an equally ill-fitting name. Despite its name, pyoderma gangrenosum is not caused by infection or gangrene. Pyogenic granuloma is often associated with systemic disease. The diagnosis is made clinically after excluding other similar skin disorders. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of pyoderma gangrenosum and stresses the importance of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of pyoderma gangrenosum.
- Describe the pathophysiology of pyoderma gangrenosum.
- Summarize the treatment options for pyoderma gangrenosum.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by pyoderma gangrenosum.
