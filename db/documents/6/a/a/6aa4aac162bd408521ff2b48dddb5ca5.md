The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) lists ten personality disorders that are divided into three clusters, clusters A, B, and C. Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a cluster B disorder that is characterized by hypersensitivity to rejection and resulting instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, affect and behavior. Borderline personality disorder causes significant impairment and distress and is associated with multiple medical and psychiatric co-morbidities.
