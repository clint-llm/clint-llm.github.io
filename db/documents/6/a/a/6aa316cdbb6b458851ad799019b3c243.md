Patients with SCA are usually diagnosed in childhood. Intensive newborn screening programs in developed countries can identify patients in the neonatal stage. In the US, universal screening for SCA was implemented in all states by 2007. High-performance liquid chromatography and isoelectric focusing are the methods used in the US. In Europe, most countries deploy targeted screening in high-risk areas (where SCA is more common) and not a universal screen. In sub-Saharan Africa, no country has adopted a screening program. In India, the solubility test is used as the first step- if positive, then high-performance liquid chromatography is used to confirm at the reference center.

**Acute Complications in Patients with SCA**

**Acute Chest Syndrome (ACS):**ACS is the most common complication of SCA. It is also the most common cause of death and the second most common cause of hospital admission. A patient can either present with ACS or may develop it during hospitalization for any other reason. Hence, it is prudent to monitor all patients with SCA admitted to the hospital for ACS. It is important to recognize ACS early and act upon it to prevent respiratory failure.

- The risk factors for ACS include a previous history of ACS, asthma, or recent events like recent surgical procedures, pulmonary embolism, fluid overload, infection, etc.

- The clinical features include sudden onset of cough and shortness of breath. Fever may or may not be a part of the spectrum of presentation. If present, then it usually points towards infection.

- Laboratory evaluation includes a complete blood count with differential chemistries, including liver and kidney evaluation, blood cultures, and sputum cultures.

- Chest X-ray shows a new pulmonary infiltrate- this is a quintessential feature of defining ACS. CT and perfusion mismatch scans are only used if there is a strong clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism or fat embolism. Therefore, they are not usually helpful in acute settings.

**Sequestration Crises:**This can either be hepatic or splenic sequestration.

- Splenic sequestration is a significant cause of acute anemia.

- Patients experience rapid spleen enlargement associated with pain in the left upper quadrant. In children with SCA, it is common in children between 1 to 4 years of age, as the spleen is still intact.
- Patients with non-SCA variants (HbSC, HbS-beta+ thalassemia) are not prone to 'auto-splenectomy' commonly seen in patients with SCA. Hence they can develop splenic sequestration later in life. Such patients may have baseline splenomegaly, causing hypersplenism. Parents and patients must receive counseling regarding the signs and symptoms of an enlarging spleen.
- Younger patients present with acute anemia and hypovolemic shock due to smaller circulating volumes, whereas adults may present with a more insidious onset.
- Pain occurs due to stretching of the splenic capsule and new infarcts.
- Blood count shows a drop in Hb by more than 2gm/dL, increased reticulocyte count, and nucleated red blood cells.

- Hepatic sequestration: Hepatic sequestration can occur across all phenotypes of SCA. Like the spleen, patients may have a baseline enlargement of the liver. Hepatic sequestration is also defined as rapid enlargement of the liver with stretching of the capsule. The hemoglobin shows a drop of more than 2gm/dL. Liver enzymes may not get elevated.

**Acute Stroke:**Stroke is the most devastating complication of SCA. Since the advent of transcranial doppler (TCD) and the institution of primary prevention programs, the incidence of stroke has gone down in patients with SCA. In the absence of primary prevention, ~10% of children suffer from overt stroke, and approximately 20 to 35% have silent cerebral infarcts. TCD is not useful for adults.

- Severe headache, altered mental status, slurred speech, seizures, and paralysis- are signs of stroke.

- Urgent neurological consultation and CT scan followed by MRI/MRA must be done.

**Aplastic crises:**It is usually precipitated by parvovirus B-19 and is defined as a rapid drop in Hb at least 3 to 6 gm/dL below the baseline. Patients present with severe fatigue, anemia, shortness of breath, and even syncope. Blood counts show severely low hemoglobin with near-absent reticulocytes. Bone marrow biopsy shows arrest in the pro-normoblast stage in patients with acute parvovirus infections.

**Acute intrahepatic cholestasis (AIC):**Presents with sudden onset right upper quadrant pain. Physical exam shows worsening jaundice, enlarging and tender liver, and clay-colored stools. Labs show very high bilirubin levels, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and coagulopathy. The hemolysis parameters may be normal. AIC is a medical emergency.

**Infections**in patients with SCA can be a harbinger of infection withStreptococcus pneumoniae infection or osteomyelitis.

- The use of prophylactic antibiotics and pneumococcal vaccinations has reduced their incidence. However, loss of splenic function in SCA patients puts them at risk of invasive bacterial species.

- Osteomyelitis can be unifocal or multifocal- Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, and other enteric organisms can cause osteomyelitis in SCA patients.

**Priapism**is defined as a sustained, unwanted painful erection lasting more than 4 hours. It is a common condition among patients with SCA, affecting 35% of all men/boys.

**Acute Ocular Complications**

- Hyphema- Accumulation of blood in the anterior chamber of the eye that occurs due to blunt trauma.

- The complication presents similarly in patients with SCA and sickle cell trait.
- The low oxygen pressure and acidotic nature of the aqueous humor promote sickling of the RBC, leading to blockage of the trabecular network leading to an acute rise in intraocular pressure (IOP). 
- High IOP is poorly handled in patients with SCA - which can lead to CRAO and secondary hemorrhages.

- Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)- Results from thrombus formation in the retinal artery leading to infarction of the retina, macular ischemia, or macular infarction. CRAO can occur spontaneously or secondary to increased IOP (from hyphema), Moyamoya syndrome, or ACS in patients with SCA.

- Orbital infarction: A rare complication that results from infarction of the surrounding orbital bone, which leads to an inflammatory response and compression of surrounding structures.

- Patients present with proptosis, local pain, and edema of the lid or orbit.
- The exam shows reduced extraocular motility and decreased visual acuity.
- CT scan helps in distinguishing this from orbital cellulitis/ infection.

- Orbital Compression Syndrome (OCS) - also called orbital apex syndrome, is characterized by ophthalmoplegia and vision loss secondary to events occurring at the orbital apex. Cranial nerves II, III, IV, VI, and the first division of CN V can be involved. MRI of the orbits is the best modality for diagnosis.

**Chronic Complications in Patients with SCA**

**Iron Overload:**Iron (Fe) overload is a common problem in SCA patients due to repeated transfusions and chronic hemolysis. Each unit of packed RBC contains 200 to 250 mg of iron. Excessive iron mainly affects the heart, lungs, and endocrine glands.

**Avascular Necrosis (AVN) of Joints:**AVN of the femoral head is a common cause of chronic pain and disability in SCA patients. Although the hip joint is the most common joint to be involved, other joints can also be affected. AVN occurs at the distal portion of the bone, where collateral circulation is poor. The capillaries get occluded by sickle RBCs leading to hypoxia and bone death. Risk factors for AVN of the femoral head include age, frequency of painful episodes, hemoglobin level, and alpha-gene deletion. In patients with HbSS, the overall prevalence is 50 percent by age 33. HbSS-alpha thalassemia and HbSS-Beta-0 thalassemia are at higher risk of developing AVN early in life.

**Leg Ulcers**: More common in SCA compared to other SCD genotypes. Approximately 2.5% of patients with SCA above ten years of age have leg ulcers. Leg ulcers are more common in men and older people and less common in people with high total hemoglobin, alpha-gene deletion, and high levels of HbF. Trauma, infections, and severe anemia also increase the risk of leg ulcers. The ulcers occur more commonly on the medial and lateral surfaces of the ankles. They vary in size and depth, and chronic ulcers may lead to osteomyelitis, especially if they are deep enough to expose the bone.

**Pulmonary Artery Hypertension (PAH)**: Affects 6 to 11% of patients with SCA. PAH in SCA is classified under World Health Organization (WHO) group V. However; chronic hemolysis leads to pulmonary vascular changes classified under WHO group 1 in up to 10% of all SCA patients. PAH in SCA can also occur due to left heart dysfunction (Group II), chronic lung disease from SCA (Group III), chronic thromboembolism (Group IV), or extrathoracic causes (Group V).

The patient may complain of dyspnea on exertion, swelling in the legs, or present with symptoms of underlying disease (like a history of thrombosis, heart failure, etc.). An echocardiogram helps in estimating the tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV). Elevated TRV is associated with increased mortality in adults. However, TRV can be transiently elevated during acute chest syndrome. Serum NT-pro-BNP is directly correlated with mortality as well. The final diagnosis is made with a right heart catheterization.

**Renal complications:**Chronic kidney disease (CKD) occurs in approximately 30% of adult patients with SCA. The acidotic, osmotic, and hypoxic environment of the kidney increases the risk of polymerization of HbS, leading to the sickling of RBC. SCA patients secrete excessive creatinine in their proximal tubules. Hence, it becomes challenging to identify early signs of kidney disease, as creatinine takes a longer time to rise. Microalbuminuria (30-300mg albumin in 24-hour urine collection) is often the first manifestation of CKD. Spot urine-creatinine ratio is not validated in SCA patients due to hypersecretion of creatinine.

- Hypoesthenuria- Inability to concentrate urine due to loss of deep juxtamedullary nephrons. It is the most common complication in SCA patients. It leads to frequent urination and increases the risk of dehydration. It also increases the risk of enuresis in children.

- Renal papillary necrosis occurs due to obstruction of the vessels supplying the vasa recta resulting in medullary infarction. It presents with hematuria. It is more common in patients with HbSC disease.

- Asymptomatic Proteinuria: It is present in 15 to 50% of patients. It develops early in life due to hyperfiltration and loss of selectivity for albumin.

**Ophthalmologic Complications:**Chronic eye complications are more common in patients with HbSC and HbSS disease. They are found in up to 50% of patients.

- Proliferative Sickle Retinopathy occurs due to vaso-occlusion of vitreal arterioles leading to ischemia which leads to neovascularization. Neovascular tissue is predisposed to hemorrhage and vitreal traction forces resulting in vitreal hemorrhage (the most severe complication of proliferative sickle retinopathy).
