Ghrelin and leptin exist as key hormones with regulatory effects of clinical significance in treating various disorders. In cancer cachexia, ghrelin has already shown promise as a therapeutic option with its anti-inflammatory action on cancer cells. Through its effects on muscle catabolism, anti-apoptotic mechanism, and reducing the adverse effects of chemotherapy, ghrelin may help treat cancer cachexia.

Synthetic ghrelin-receptor agonist analogs like Anamorelin have shown beneficial effects.
