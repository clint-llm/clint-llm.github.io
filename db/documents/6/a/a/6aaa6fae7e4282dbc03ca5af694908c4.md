Patients presenting with symptoms of central nervous system are evaluated with radiographic imaging of the brain to rule out the presence of elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis, culture, staining and immunodiagnostic tests of cerebrospinal fluid are the primary diagnostic tests that are performed to diagnose meningitis caused by Cryptococcus. Analysis of the fluid usually shows low white blood cell count, low glucose, and elevated protein but could also be normal in approximately 25-30% of the cases.

Disseminated Cryptococcus infection is defined by a positive blood culture or a positive culture from at least two different sites. Disseminated infection is commonly associated with HIV infection or several other immunocompromised states.
