Despite the strong link to bird exposure, it is not necessary for a diagnosis. This is especially true in areas with large numbers of wild birds. For example, there have been two outbreaks in Australia with towns surrounded by a large avian flora.

Symptom onset is typically abrupt, with a headacheÂ cited as the most prominent complaint, in addition to fever, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and cough.

Psittacosis can affect multiple organ systems, and a multitude of manifestations have been reported in case reports of psittacosis.

- Central nervous system manifestations of meningoencephalitis, cerebellar ataxia, cranial nerve palsies, transverse myelitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and status epileptics

- Respiratory manifestations of pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, and septic shock

- Cardiac manifestations are rare but can include myocarditis, pericarditis, culture-negative endocarditis, and aortitis

- Renal and gastrointestinal manifestations include acute interstitial nephritis, acute renal failure, glomerulonephritis, hepatitis, and pancreatitis

- Hematological manifestations include disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), splenomegaly, and hemophagocytic syndrome

- Rheumatological manifestations include reactive arthritis and polyarteritis

- There have also been cases of gestational psittacosis with poor fetal and maternal outcomes, as well as an association with ocular lymphoma

The physical exam will usually reveal rales or evidence of consolidation on pulmonary auscultation. Traditionally, pleural rubs and pleural effusions have been uncommon in psittacosis and, when present, warranted considering an alternate diagnosis.
