Compensated chronic liver disease (who has not developed significant complications) usually carries a better prognosis than decompensated liver cirrhosis. Decompensated liver cirrhosis patients (who have developed variceal bleeding, ascites, HCC, SBP, and hepatorenal syndrome) have a poor prognosis. Mean survival of about six months if Child-Pugh score of 12 or greater or MELD score of 21 or higher.

There are various scoring systems used to assess the severity of chronic liver disease.

1. **The Child-Pugh score**uses ascites, bilirubin, albumin, PT, and encephalopathy.

- Class A (score 5-6): well-compensated disease.

- Class B (score 7-9): functional compromise.

- Class C (score 10-15): decompensated disease.

2. **MELD**(model of end-stage liver disease) uses bilirubin, serum creatinine, and INR. The MELD score was initially used to predict mortality within three months after the TIPS procedure and now used to prioritize patients for receipt of a liver transplant.
