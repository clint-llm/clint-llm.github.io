The patientâ€™s family/ guardian or the patient should be adequately counseled regarding the battery of investigations and evaluations required whenever a new onset fever occurs in a patient already admitted to the ICU. The concern is much more whenever an undiagnosed new-onset fever sets in, especially with sepsis/septic shock features. The family/guardian should be aware of the potential complications, expected morbidity, including a prolonged ICU stay, and the mortality involved in such instances of secondary sepsis.
