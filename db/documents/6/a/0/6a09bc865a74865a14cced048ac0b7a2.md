Non-marginal and non-canalicular system-involving lacerations involving eyelid skin can be repaired by the emergency room clinician, general plastic surgery, or primary care providers. An ophthalmologist or oculofacial plastic surgeon should perform complex lacerations involving the eyelid margin, canalicular system, or canthal tendons.
