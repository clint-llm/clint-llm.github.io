Brugia and Wuchereria species are similar in morphology and are the main cause of filariasis. They can be identified to the genus level using size, body wall composition, thickness, and morphology of the cuticle. The presence of small filarial worms in lymph nodes is pathognomonic for either Wuchereria or Brugia. Adult worms are typically found in lymph nodes in the groin or neck, whereas microfilariae are typically found in the peripheral blood.

The adult worms typically range in size from 45 to 100 micrometers in diameter and are typically found in lymph node cross-section. Their descriptions include "thin, smooth cuticle which is thickened over lateral chords, three or four well-developed, low, broad muscle cells per quadrant, and relatively broad, flat lateral chords."

Microfilariae can be seen with a blood smear or other peripheral blood sample that is stained with either Giemsa or hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain. The blood samples should be takenÂ after 8 pm. The microfilariae vary in size from 200 to 300 micrometers in length and 2 to 8 micrometers in diameter and are identified by the terminal and subterminal nuclei in the tail region.
