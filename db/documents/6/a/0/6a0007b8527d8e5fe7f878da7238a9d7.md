The current (fourth) Universal Definition of MI Expert Consensus Document updates the definition of MI to accommodate the increased use of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn). Detection of an elevated cTn value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) is defined as myocardial injury.

**Type 1 Myocardial Infarction**

The criteria for **type 1 MI**includes the detection of a rise, fall, or rise and fall of cTn with at least one value above the 99th percentile and with at least one of the following:

- Symptoms of acute myocardial ischemia

- New ischemic electrocardiographic (ECG) changes

- Development of pathological Q waves

- Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality in a pattern consistent with an ischemic etiology

- Identification of a coronary thrombus by angiography, including intracoronary imaging or by autopsy

**Type 2 Myocardial Infarction**

The criteria for **type 2 MI**includes detection of a rise, fall, or rise and fall of cTn with at least one value above the 99th percentile and evidence of an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand unrelated to coronary thrombosis, requiring at least one of the following:

- Symptoms of acute myocardial ischemia

- New ischemic ECG changes

- Development of pathological Q waves

- Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality in a pattern consistent with an ischemic etiology

**Cardiac Procedural Myocardial Injury**

Cardiac procedural myocardial injury is arbitrarily defined by increases in cTn values (>99th percentile URL) in patients with normal baseline values (≤99th percentile URL) or a rise of cTn values >20% of the baseline value when it is above the 99th percentile, but it is stable or falling.

**Coronary Intervention-related Myocardial Infarction**

Coronary intervention-related MI is arbitrarily defined by the elevation of cTn values >5 times the 99th percentile URL in patients with normal baseline values. In patients with elevated pre-procedure cTn in whom the cTn levels are stable (≤20% variation) or falling, the post-procedure cTn must rise by >20%. However, the absolute post-procedural value must still be at least five times the 99th percentile URL. In addition, one of the following elements is required:

- New ischemic ECG changes

- Development of new pathological Q waves

- Angiographic findings are consistent with a procedural flow-limiting complication such as coronary dissection, occlusion of a major epicardial artery or a side branch occlusion or thrombus, disruption of collateral flow, or distal embolization

**Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG)-Related Myocardial Infarction**

CABG-related MI is arbitrarily defined as an elevation of cTn values >10 times the 99th percentile URL in patients with normal baseline cTn values. In patients with elevated pre-procedure cTn in whom cTn levels are stable (≤20% variation) or falling, the post-procedure cTn must rise by >20%. However, the absolute post-procedural value still must be greater than ten times the 99th percentile URL. In addition, one of the following elements is required:

- Development of new pathological Q waves

- Angiographic documented new graft occlusion or new native coronary artery occlusion

- Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality in a pattern consistent with an ischemic etiology
