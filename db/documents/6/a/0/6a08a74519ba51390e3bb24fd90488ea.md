Antiepileptic drug (AED) medications are the mainstay of treatment for most patients with seizures.  First-line medications are valproic acid, lamotrigine, and topiramate.

Topiramate has the risk of causing acute myopia and secondary closed-angle glaucoma. Common adverse effects are paresthesia, memory impairment, anorexia, dysgeusia, renal calculus, and oligohydrosis. In addition, it can lead to a hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis, and hyperammonemia and encephalopathy. Hyperammonemia is more commonly seen in patients with inborn errors of metabolism or hepatic dysfunction.
