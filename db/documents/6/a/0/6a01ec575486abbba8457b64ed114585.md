**Posterior Circulation**

The popliteal pulse can be evaluated to assess peripheral circulatory status in the same way one may examine radial or posterior tibial arterial pulses. A patient with significant peripheral arterial disease or diabetes may have poor circulation and difficulty ascertaining dorsalis pedal or posterior tibial pulses. The physician may then need to continue to move more proximally to gain a better clinical picture of the patient's arterial flow and can accomplish this by palpating the popliteal pulse. The most efficient way to appreciate this on the physical exam is flexing the knee slightly while gripping the extremity with both hands. The physician's thumbs should be over the patella with both fingertips of each hand in the fossa. It can be difficult to assess the popliteal pulse and is more challenging than those typically evaluated at the ankle and dorsum of the foot.

**Popliteal Artery Aneurysms**

Popliteal artery aneurysms are the most common true peripheral arterial aneurysm and are only second in prevalence to abdominal aortic aneurysms.

**Baker's Cyst**

A popliteal cyst, more commonly called a Baker's cyst, is an enlargement of the gastrocnemius-semimembranosus bursa which communicates with the knee joint in adults. Baker cysts are usually secondary to underlying internal derangement of the knee, whether it be inflammatory, degenerative, or injury. Diagnosis is usually made on clinical grounds and is very apparent on palpation of the extended knee while others are diagnosed by visual evidence of MRI or CT scan. Careful evaluation is needed to rule out other significant pathologies such as a popliteal aneurysm or deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and duplex ultrasonography is suggested to rule these out. These cysts can be uncomfortable due to mass effect and compression of surrounding structures. They may enlarge, dissect, or rupture which may provide temporary relief. Treatment may also involve arthrocentesis in addition to intra-articular steroid injections to reduce inflammation. However, recurrence is and addressing the underlying pathology surgically may be warranted as the cyst is a secondary effect.

**Peroneal Neuropathy**

As discussed, the peroneal nerve is a branch of the sciatic nerve that travels in the popliteal fossa before transferring the laterally around the neck of the fibula. Based on its anatomic location, the nerve is susceptible to injury. Peroneal neuropathy is the most common mononeuropathy of the lower limb. Classically, this neuropathy presents with foot drop and sensory changes over the lower limb. The peroneal nerve is likely to be injured by a fibular neck fracture, tibiofibular fracture, or tibial plateau fracture.
