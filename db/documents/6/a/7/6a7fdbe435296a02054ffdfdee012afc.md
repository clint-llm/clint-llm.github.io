**The Liver During Normal Pregnancy**

The liver, like other organs, undergoes various physiological and anatomical changes during pregnancy. An understanding of these changes can help one toÂ differentiate the physiological changes from the pathological ones. These changes can be broadly classified into the following categories:

- **Physical Findings:**During Pregnancy, the gross examination of the liver is relatively unchanged; however, skin findings such as spider angiomata (vascular spider) and palmer erythema can be seen. These physical findings are especially prominent in the latter half of the pregnancy, especially in Caucasian women. It should be noted that such findings might be hard to appreciate because of the expanding uterus.

- **Laboratory Findings:**Most of the liver biochemical tests remain within normal limits during pregnancy with a few exceptions. Serum alkaline phosphate (ALP) increases markedly (up to four times the normal) in the third trimester which results from the increased levels of placental alkaline phosphate. Conjugate increase in serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase along with serum alkaline phosphate usually indicates a pathological process as the level of serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase is usually slightly reduced during normal pregnancy. Other liver biochemical tests such as serum alanine transferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total and free bilirubin typically remain within normal limits, and any increased value should warrant further evaluation. Furthermore, hemodilution, a well-known phenomenon during pregnancy, results in a decrease in serum albumin which worsens as pregnancy progresses. Total cholesterol, triglyceride, fibrinogen, and ceruloplasmin are few other laboratory findings that are noticeably augmented during pregnancy.

- **Radiographic Findings:**Ultrasonography examination during pregnancy usually reveals a normal biliary tree. The only striking ultrasonographic findings are increased fasting gallbladder volume and residual volume post contraction.
