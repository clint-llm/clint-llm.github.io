CML is a common leukemia found in adults, and the advancement of tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment has a good prognosis. However, identifying patients with CML can be challenging in instances of cryptic translocations and presentations in advanced phases. The World Health Organization and the European LeukemiaNet provide evidence-based guidance on evaluation, diagnosis, treatment, and milestones for CML. To avoid misdiagnosis and delayed treatment, a bone marrow aspirate and collaboration with pathology is necessary in suspected cases to ensure adequate sampling to identify the BCR-ABL1 translocation.

Interprofessional teamwork and decision making with the patient are vitally important, and side effects that may hinder treatment adherence should be discussed directly with the patient. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are effective in most cases; however, the patient's non-compliance is a prominent cause of failure. The pharmacist must verify all chemotherapeutic agent dosing and compatibility, check for drug interactions, and educate the team on adverse effects. The health care team needs to identify side effects early, make patient concerns a priority, and combat any challenges as soon as possible.
