Metacarpal fractures account for 40% of all hand fractures. A fracture of the neck of the fifth metacarpal, or boxer's fracture, named for the classic mechanism of injury in which direct trauma is applied to a clenched fist, is the most common, representing 10% of all hand fractures. Treatment for a boxer's fracture varies based on whether the fracture is open or closed, the degree of angulation, rotation, and other concomitant injuries. Immobilization with an ulnar gutter splint may be the definitive treatment for closed, non-displaced fractures without angulation or rotation, while open fractures, significantly angulated or malrotated fractures or those involving injury to neurovascular structures require referral to a hand surgeon. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of boxer's fracture, and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of injury that results in a boxer's fracture of the hand.
- Review the necessary elements for an examination to assess for boxer's fracture, including any necessary diagnostic imaging studies.
- Summarize the treatment options available for fractures of the neck of the fifth metacarpal, including both conservative and surgical care.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with fifth metacarpal neck fractures.
