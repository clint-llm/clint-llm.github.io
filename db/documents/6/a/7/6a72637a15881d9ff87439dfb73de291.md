In a 2015 retrospective epidemiological investigation of several Scorpaenidae envenomation case series, Diaz determined that individuals most commonly injured are young adult males who vacation to endemic regions native to the fish. These individuals were typically engaging in activities that put them at increased risk such as wading in the surf, wade-fishing, beachcombing, or exploring tide pools.

Lionfish present an additional epidemiological threat as prized aquarium fish. Of the 45 lionfish (P. volitans) injuries reported to the San Francisco Bay Area Regional Poison Control Center from 1979 through 1983, 82% occurred in homes with saltwater aquariums and 18% occurred in tropical fish stores. Injuries occurred during transferring, catching, or hand-feeding the fish.
