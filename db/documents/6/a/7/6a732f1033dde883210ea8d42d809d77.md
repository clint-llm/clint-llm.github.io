Adhesive capsulitis, also known as frozen shoulder, is an inflammatory condition characterized by shoulder stiffness and pain. The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons defines adhesive capsulitis as “a condition of varying severity characterized by the gradual development of global limitation of active and passive shoulder motion where radiographic findings other than osteopenia are absent.”

Most patients have significant loss of passive range of motion, a feature crucial for diagnosis.
