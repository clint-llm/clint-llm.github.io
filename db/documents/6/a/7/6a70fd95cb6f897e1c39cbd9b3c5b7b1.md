Lower-extremity amputation is performed when nonviable lower-extremity tissue is present for many reasons, including ischemia, infection, trauma, or malignancy.

TheÂ second TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC II) working group reported the incidence of major amputations due to peripheral artery disease for up to 50 per 100,000 individuals annually.

A below-knee amputation (BKA) is a transtibial amputation that involves removing the foot, ankle joint, distal tibia, and fibula with related soft tissue structures. Generally, a BKA is preferred over an above-knee amputation (AKA), as the former has better rehabilitation and functional outcomes.

Ernest M. Burgess first described the remarkable functional impact on preserving the transtibial zone.
