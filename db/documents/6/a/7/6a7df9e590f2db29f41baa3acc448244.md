As described in this article, an ultrasound-guided suprascapular nerve block can help treat many causes of acute and chronic shoulder pain. Before this procedure, a safety check or time-out can help ensure that the correct procedure is performed on the correct patient and that all necessary equipment is available. This is also an opportunity for the patient to ask any questions about the procedure that they might have after the informed consent process.

An appropriately trained anesthesia provider should perform the procedure, and a nurse or another anesthesia provider should be available to help. Another provider or nurse may also help monitor the patient's vital signs and administer sedation if necessary. Knowing the appropriate techniques and emphasizing clear communication between appropriate personnel will ensure patient safety around the time of the suprascapular nerve block.
