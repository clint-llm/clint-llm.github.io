Infants are typically asymptomatic. However, in more severe cases of congenital hydroureteronephrosis, lack of appetite, and frequent urinary tract infections may be present.

Adults with acute urinary outflow obstruction typically present withÂ constant dull pain thought to be the result of stretching of the renal capsule, with intermittent episodes of severe pain due to genitourinary peristalsis transiently increasing the pressure. Many patients report nausea and vomiting, as well as dysuria or urinary urgency. On exam, these patients have tenderness at the costovertebral angle and often cannot find a position of comfort in the exam room.
