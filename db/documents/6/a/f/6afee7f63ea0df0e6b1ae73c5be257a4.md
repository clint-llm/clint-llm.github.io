Dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, is a subjective feeling of an abnormality of difficulty in swallowing. It can occur either while initiating the swallow or shortly thereafter. The former is referred to as oropharyngeal dysphagia and occurs when there is a problem at the level of the oropharynx, as the name implies. The latter happens due to problems in the esophagus, hence the name esophageal dysphagia. There are several mechanisms by which esophageal dysphagia occurs. Physical obstruction and motor problems are the two most common causes of dysphagia. They can occur at the level of the UES, the esophagus itself, or the LES. Diffuse esophageal spasm, achalasia, scleroderma, and diabetes mellitus are common causes of dysphagia owing to a motor problem. Esophageal carcinoma, reflux esophagitis, peptic strictures, or Schatskiâ€™s rings, on the other hand, are examples of conditions causing dysphagia due to an obstructive process. Esophageal obstructions cause difficulty swallowing to liquids initially that eventually progresses to dysphagia to both liquids and solids. In contrast, motor diseases cause dysphagia to both solids and liquids from the beginning.
