Primary vaginal cancer is rare, comprising 1-2% of all female reproductive tract cancers.

Primary vaginal cancer is strictly defined as a disease without evidence of cervical or vulvar cancer or a history of either within the past five years. Most vaginal lesions (80-90%) originate from cervical or vulvar lesions or other local sites such as the endometrium, bladder, rectosigmoid, or ovary. Distant sites of metastasis include the colon, breast, and pancreas. When primary vaginal cancer is suspected, a biopsy is done for histopathologic confirmation.

While current estimates of vaginal cancer are higher than vulvar cancer, these estimates include primary and other genital lesions.
