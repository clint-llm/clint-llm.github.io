The saphenous nerve block can be performed at the mid-thigh in the adductor canal or just below the knee depending upon the desired area of anesthesia. Although these locations are identifiable anatomically, ultrasound visualization has become the standard of practice.

The adductor canal approach to saphenous nerve blockade provides anesthesia at the level of the mid-thigh. Patient placement is in the supine position with the leg abducted and externally rotated to allow access to the medial thigh. The patient is prepared in a standard sterile fashion. A linear ultrasound transducer is placed perpendicular to the long axis of the lower limb, approximately 5 to 7 cm proximal to the popliteal crease, and slid proximally until the hyperechoic appearance of the vastoadductor membrane fades, and the femoral artery is identified. The saphenous nerve is identified as a hyperechoic circle anterolateral to the femoral artery. After negative aspiration, an in-plane approach is used to inject 5 to 10 mL of local anesthetic deep to the sartorius muscle and lateral to the artery.

The saphenous nerve can be blocked below the knee for anesthesia of the lower leg and foot. The patient is positioned supine with the leg straight. After standard sterile preparation, a linear ultrasound transducer is placed at the level of the tibial tuberosity. A short-axis view of the saphenous vein and fascia lata is obtained, and local anesthetic is infiltrated between these two landmarks

Saphenous nerve blockade may also be achieved more distally at the ankle, although the nerve is often not visible with ultrasound at this level. For this reason, a landmark based approach is more reliable but may require higher volumes of local anesthetic. After palpating the medial malleolus and great saphenous vein, local anesthetic is infiltrated approximately 2 cm anterior and posterior to the saphenous vein just superior to the medial malleolus. Ultrasound guidance is helpful if the saphenous vein cannot be visualized or palpated on exam. However, the saphenous nerve usually is not visible on ultrasound at this level
