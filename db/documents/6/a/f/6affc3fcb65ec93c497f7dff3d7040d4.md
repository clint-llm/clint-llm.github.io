Every organ system in the body requires cellular communication and, thus, cellular receptors, including cell-cell interactions like macrophages activating plasma cells of the immune system and the acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction of the nervous system. This activity also includes body-wide interactions like the hypothalamic release of ACTH, causing the adrenal release of cortisol, which then affects almost every organ system. Ultimately, the ability of any organism to become multi-cellular relies on the ability to use cellular receptors for communication.
