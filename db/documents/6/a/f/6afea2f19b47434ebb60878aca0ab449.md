Exotoxin production is the primary mechanism by which the organism shows its typical clinical characteristics. Exotoxin is a single polypeptide consisting ofÂ two subunits; A and B. B subunit mediates the binding of the toxin to the receptor on the cell membrane. A subunit has an enzymatic property that cleaves nicotinamide from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), thus inhibiting protein synthesis by ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor 2 (EF-2). The host response to the bacteria results in the local inflammation in the throat and pharynx, forming a tough, gray pseudomembrane, which is the characteristic physical finding of the diseases.
