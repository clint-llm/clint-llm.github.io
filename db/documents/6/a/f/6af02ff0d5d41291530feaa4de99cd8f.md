Medication overuse headache is considered one of the more prevalent neurological disorders. The 2015 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study estimated its prevalence at 1% worldwide (approximately 58.5 million people), which is lower compared to migraine and tension-type headaches. The same GBD study included medication overuse headache among the 20 most debilitating diseases.

It occurs fairly commonly in patients with chronic migraines (CM), with estimates of about 32% of patients within the chronic migraine group having medication overuse headaches. Medication overuse headache is believed to be more common in women (male to female ratio ranging from 2 to 1 to 5 to 1) and those with low socioeconomic status.
