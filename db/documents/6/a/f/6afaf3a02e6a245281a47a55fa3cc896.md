Cockayne syndrome is a rare genetic disease that causes severe motor, sensory, and intellectual disabilities. It requires interprofessional medical management and continuous care and supervision with frequent hospitalizations. Patients need clear information about their illness and scalability, psychological support, and social security coverage. Financial, technical, and administrative concerns sometimes compound these difficulties. The supervision and ongoing care that sick children need also have repercussions on their working lives (absenteeism, parental leave, part-time work). As for patients, their social integration and schooling depend on their physical abilities and development. (Level V)
