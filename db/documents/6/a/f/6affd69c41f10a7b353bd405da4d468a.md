Stridor is an abnormal, high-pitched respiratory sound that can be assessed during breathing. It is typically produced by the irregular flow of air in the airways and is most prominently heard during inspiration. X-rays or bronchoscopy may be used by a trained specialist to determine the etiology when there is diagnostic uncertainty. It should be noted that in young children and infants, a small amount of inflammation can cause significant and rapid airway obstruction. This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment of stridor and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the causes of stridor.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with stridor.
- Summarize the evaluation of a patient with stridor.
- Review the significance of effective communication between the interprofessional team to ensure prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment for patients presenting with stridor.
