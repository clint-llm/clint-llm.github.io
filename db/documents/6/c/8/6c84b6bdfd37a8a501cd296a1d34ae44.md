The differential diagnosis for nasal bone fractures should include bony injuries to the surrounding facial skeleton. These include the following:

**Nasoorbitoethmoid (NOE) Complex Fracture**

- These are nasal bone fractures that extend posteriorly into the ethmoid air cells and involve the medial canthus of either or both eyes. The hallmark of this condition is traumatic telecanthus. Nasoorbitoethmoid fractures also occur in all LeFort type III midface fractures.

**Orbital Fracture**

- An orbital fracture is suggested by periorbital edema or ecchymosis. In the case of an orbital floor fracture, patients may have hypoesthesia of the cheek or limitation in ocular movements.

**Skull Base Fracture**

- High-velocity impacts can cause fractures of the skull base. PatientsÂ may demonstrate characteristic bilateral periorbital ecchymosis or "raccoon eyes," as well as postauricular ecchymosis, which is also known as "Battle's sign." Patients with skull base fractures are at higher risk for CSF leak and spinal fracture.
