Patients with cystitis should be made aware of the importance of adherence to their prescribed antibiotic regimen. Increasing oral fluid intake should also be encouraged. In sexually active patients, post-intercourse voiding may help to reduce recurrent infection. Patients should be advised to follow up if their symptoms worsen or do not improve after treatment with an antibiotic has started.
