Early onset of migraine seems predictive for a less favorable outcome in later ages; however, follow-up studies are very limited and mostly with a short-term prospective period, of which the longest follow-up study is in a population of children with migraine under the age of 6. Some studies suggest that the onset of migraine at a very young age represents an unfavorable prognostic factor for the persistence of migraine at later ages. Some clinical features may change during the clinical course, and the active persistence of migraine may lead to an increase in allodynia.

Studies showed that cephalic cutaneous allodynia might appear in children and adolescents in the first six months of migraine onset. Contrary to adult studies, allodynia is not associated with migraine frequency or long disease duration but is significantly associated with migraine with aura, female gender, and awakening pain. A genetic tendency may be attributed to the appearance of allodynia in the pediatric age group.

In one of the published studies, 25% of patients stopped having migraines by the age of 25 years.
