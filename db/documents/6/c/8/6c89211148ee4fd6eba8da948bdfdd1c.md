Benzocaine is a commercially available local anesthetic. It is an amino ester and has uses in a variety of settings, including dental procedures, preparation for infiltrative anesthesia, and minor traumas. The primary purpose of using topical local anesthetics such as benzocaine is to reduce or relieve painful stimuli such as those caused by needle penetration. This anesthesia allows for more significant pain control and reduction of anxiety for the patient.Â Benzocaine gels, liquids, and lozenges are FDA approved. However, spray forms do not currently have FDA approval, and OTC oral drugs do not have authorization for children under two years of age and those prone to adverse effects indicated below.
