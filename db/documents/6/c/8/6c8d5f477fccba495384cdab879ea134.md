The human body is very good at remaining balanced ionically under most scenarios. As a result, with loss of bicarbonate (the negatively charged ion), the negatively charged chloride (Cl) ion is displaced to the extracellular space. This leads to a narrow anion gap, an electrically neutral state without correcting the pathology that induced the acidosis. Likewise, increased Cl may displace bicarbonate intracellularly. To determine the exact etiology of a narrow anion gap, hyperchloremic acidosis requires another test, the urine anion gap. The urine anion gap is calculated as follows:

- Urine anion gap = (Na + K) - Cl

Where Na is urine sodium, K is urine potassium, and Cl is urine chloride. The urine anion gap provides an estimate of urinary ammonium (NH4) excretion. The normal renal response to metabolic acidosis is to increase acidic NH4 excretion renally. Therefore, a positive urine anion gap between 20 and 90 mEq/L is indicative of low or normal NH4 excretion, seen in renal causes, such as distal renal tubular acidosis. A negative urine anion gap between -20 and -50 mEq/L is indicative of increased NH4 excretion. This occurs in patients with metabolic acidosis generated by extrarenal causes, such as profuse watery diarrhea. A urine anion gap approaching 0 is indeterminate.
