Excessive dopaminergic activity and damage to the pathways of the basal ganglia (hyperkinetic theory) are the basic predominant etiologies of hyperkinetic syndromes. Following are some of the common etiologies of hemiballismus:

- Intracranial hemorrhage

- Stroke (ischemic): the most common cause in patients more than 65-year-old from the small perforating branches of the basilar artery

- Neoplasm

- Head trauma

- Metabolic (e.g., nonketotic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome in uncontrolled type 2 diabetics)

- Neuroinfectious: although rare, are more common in younger patients

- Tuberculomas

- Toxoplasmosis: from complications of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) given its predilection to cause lesions in the basal ganglia

- Neuroinflammatory diseases: such as demyelinating disorders (e.g., multiple sclerosis)

- Paraneoplastic syndromes

- Vasculitis (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus)

- Toxic: alcohol, heavy metals exposure

Given that chorea syndromes are pathophysiologically a milder spectrum of hemiballismus, etiologies of these have been briefly listed here.
