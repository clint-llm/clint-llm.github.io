Mitral valve prolapse (MVP), also known as floppy mitral valve syndrome, systolic click-murmur syndrome, and billowing mitral leaflets, is valvular heart disease. It is generally considered a benign condition; however, at times, it may present with sudden cardiac death, endocarditis, or cerebrovascular accident. MVP is usually identified during cardiac auscultation. Echocardiography confirms the diagnosis. This disorder is the most common cause of non-ischemic mitral valve regurgitation in developed countries. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of mitral valve prolapse and the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the typical presentation of a patient with mitral valve prolapse.
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with mitral valve prolapse.
- Summarize the treatment options for mitral valve prolapse.
- Explore modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by mitral valve prolapse.
