A disturbance of the vestibular system, semicircular canals, or cranial nerve 8 is the underlying issue. This disturbance could be related to damage to one of these organs or simply confused neuronal input. It is important to remember that the central nervous system receives inputs bilaterally from these structures/systems, assembles the input and then, forms a response. The CNS also coordinates these bilateral inputs with our visual and sensory inputs creating an overall picture of whether we are moving in space/time or if the environment around us is moving. Suffice it to say that conflicting inputs from these various symptoms overwhelm the central nervous system causing dizziness, nausea, and the perception of movement.

Vertigo breaks down into two types: peripheral and central. As the main focus of this review is on peripheral vertigo, we will only touch slightly on central vertigo to help distinguish between the two.

Usually, peripheral vertigo is, although not always, due to a benign process, whereas central vertigo often indicates a more serious pathology.
