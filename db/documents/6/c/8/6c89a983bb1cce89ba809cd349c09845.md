Prognosis is poor if lung torsion management is delayed or the patient becomes septic resulting in ischemia of the lung tissue. The mortality rate was found to be as high as 8.3%. Higher mortality rates were associated with whole lung torsion as compared to lobar torsion. Studies have found similar survival rates among reposition and direct reposition. Indirection resection had higher mortality. Mortality from lung torsion was found to be highest in trauma patients at 22.2%, followed by thoracic surgery at 8.8%, and spontaneous lung torsion at 3.1%.
