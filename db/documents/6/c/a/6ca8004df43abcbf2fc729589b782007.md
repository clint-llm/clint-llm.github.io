# Continuing Education Activity

Hemifacial microsomia is the second most common congenital craniofacial defect after cleft lip and palate. It can present with a spectrum of deformities involving the eyes, ears, and the first two pharyngeal arches. To avoid the long-term morbidity associated with this condition, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of hemifacial microsomia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the etiology and epidemiology of hemifacial microsomia.
- Describe the appropriate steps for the evaluation of hemifacial microsomia. 
- Outline the treatment considerations for patients with hemifacial microsomia. 
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by hemifacial microsomia.

# Introduction

Hemifacial microsomia (HFM), also known as unilateral otomandibular dysostosis or lateral facial dysplasia, is an asymmetrical, congenital malformation of the 1st and 2nd branchial arches and the second most common craniofacial anomaly after cleft lip and palate.

# Etiology

HFM is a dysfunction of the 1st and 2nd branchial arches, which are formed by the neural crest cells (NCC).

Embryonically, the first branchial arch becomes the maxilla, mandible, zygoma, muscles of mastication, trigeminal nerve, anterior auricle (tragus, helical root, helix), malleolus, and incus. The second branchial arch becomes the hyoid bone, muscles of facial expression, facial nerve, stapes, and the remainder of the auricle (antihelix, antitragus, and lobule). Disruption during pharyngeal arch development from genetic defects, teratogens, smoking, hormonal therapy, vascular injury, vasoactive medications, cocaine, and maternal-fetal factors such as maternal diabetes, hypothyroidism, and celiac disease can result in hypoplasia or aplasia.

# Epidemiology

HFM is the second most common congenital craniofacial defect after cleft lip and palate.

# Pathophysiology

There are three interrelated pathogenic models for the development of HFM. No model is completely concordant with the varying presentation of HFM. Distinct phenotypes of HFM may be caused by different factors influencing separate pathogenic models.

- Vascular abnormality and hemorrhage. In 1973, Poswillo proposed embryonic hemorrhage around the stapedial artery as the cause for HFM through successful animal models.

- Interference with Meckel’s cartilage development. The Meckel’s cartilage arises from the first branchial arch and develops into the malleus, incus, and mandible. Disruption during this morphogenesis from teratogens, hemorrhage, and genetic defects can result in unilateral malformed ossicles and mandibular hypoplasia.

- Abnormal migration, proliferation, and differentiation of NCC. Direct insults to the NCC can occur through genetic defects, teratogens, and environmental factors. OTX2 is a gene essential for NCC development with OTX2 deletion found to cause mandibular dysostosis.

HFM can present with a spectrum of deformities involving the eyes, ears, and the first two pharyngeal arches. Ocular deformities include strabismus, anophthalmia, microphthalmia, eye asymmetry, cleft eyelid, and exophthalmia. Auricular abnormalities include preauricular appendage, preauricular fistula, microtia, ear asymmetry, and external auditory canal atresia. Deformities of the first and second pharyngeal arches include cleft lip and palate, bifid tongue, mandibular hypoplasia, maxillary hypoplasia, oral malocclusion, and dental malformations.

Although the term HFM implies facial involvement only, patients with HFM often have associated extracranial defects.

# History and Physical

Children presenting with HFM should have a detailed, three-generation family history conducted to identify any malformations that are characteristic for HFM.

The physical exam should focus on identifying facial abnormalities and asymmetries involving the auricle, ossicles, zygoma, maxilla, mandible, jaw mobility, and occlusion. Cleft lip and palate are common in HFM patients and should be evaluated. Ophthalmologic findings such as ocular dermoid cysts and vertebral abnormalities such as scoliosis may indicate the more severe variant of Goldenhar syndrome.

# Evaluation

The minimal diagnostic criteria for HFM requires either 1) Ipsilateral mandible AND auricle defects or 2) Asymmetric mandible OR auricle defects with the involvement of 2 or more indirectly associated anomalies OR a positive familial history of HFM.

The posteroanterior cephalogram is the gold standard for assessing facial asymmetry. Measurements such as the midline deviation of maxilla and mandible, ramus height, and occlusal cant are taken for surgical planning.

Many patients with HFM have airway and feeding difficulties due to underdevelopment of the pharynx, larynx, esophagus, mandible, and mastication muscles.

Additional screenings include an audiogram to assess for hearing loss, perceptual speech analysis for speech development, and psychosocial assessment. Cervical spine radiographs for vertebral defects and renal ultrasound for noncraniofacial malformations should also be performed.

# Treatment / Management

Given the heterogeneous presentation of HFM, an individualized and interprofessional approach is necessary.

Reconstructive surgery for HFM has the goal of improving facial symmetry, jaw function, and normal occlusion.

- Grafts. Grafts were first described by Gillies in the 1920s.

- Mandibular distraction osteogenesis (MDO). MDO was first popularized by McCarthy in the 1990s.

- Soft tissue correction. Soft tissue correction is performed after facial skeletal re-alignment. Options to augment surrounding tissue include microvascular free tissue transfer, autologous fat grafting, and implants such as high-density porous polyethylene.

- Ear reconstruction. HFM can present with deformities involving the auricle, external auditory canal, and middle ear structures. Deformities range from mild hypoplasia requiring only reshaping of the ear cartilage, to complete anotia with middle ear involvement necessitating reconstruction. Options for reconstruction include autologous grafting using costal cartilage grafts for the auricular framework and synthetic implants. Both have advantages and disadvantages, and the interested reader is directed to other articles with more in-depth discussions about microtia reconstruction. A less invasive option for reconstruction is the placement of a prosthetic ear. Prostheses can be adhesive or attached to an osseointegrated anchor that is placed surgically. The advantages of prostheses include the option for upgrades as the patients grow and the absence of donor site morbidity. One notable potential disadvantage of the osseointegrated device is that once placed, the other reconstruction options are no longer feasible.

# Differential Diagnosis

Hemifacial microsomia can present with a heterogenous array of facial defects with different levels of severity. Many disorders involving facial anomalies can be misdiagnosed as hemifacial microsomia including:

- CHARGE syndrome

- Restricted growth and development

- Treacher Collins syndrome

- Townes-Brocks syndrome

- Goltz syndrome

- Pierre Robin syndrome

- Traumatic postnatal deformity

- Parry-Romberg syndrome

- Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis

- Nager acrofacial dysostosis syndrome

- Branchio-oto-renal syndrome

- Maxillofacial dysostosis

# Treatment Planning

The timing of reconstructive surgical intervention is controversial. Proponents of early intervention hypothesize that mandibular asymmetry worsens over time as the affected side undergoes minimal growth, resulting in secondary deformities. They propose that early intervention can improve growth potential, masticatory function, dental development, and patient self-confidence.

Supporters of delayed surgical intervention recommend correction upon skeletal and dental maturity (age 15 in boys and 13 to 15 in girls) to avoid relapse of asymmetry and need for additional surgery as well as decreased blood loss and improved patient compliance. Large systematic reviews have concluded no evidence in supporting early surgical reconstruction and recommend postponing surgery until completion of dental and bony growth.

The timeline for treatment depends on the patient's age and severity of malformations. During infancy, indicated interventions include correction of cleft lip and palate, hearing aids for hearing loss, osteotomies for significant orbital dystopia and plagiocephaly, and mandible distraction for patients with severe retrognathia resulting in respiratory or feeding difficulties. During the skeletal growth phase from ages 6 to 12, reconstruction of the malformed auricle or placement of a prosthesis is recommended.

Maxilla and mandible defects can be addressed with orthodontic devices. Costochondral grafts or mandibular distraction can also be considered. In adolescence and adulthood, definitive reconstruction surgery of the facial skeleton to improve facial asymmetry and occlusion is recommended along with soft tissue augmentation using free tissue transfer or fat grafting. Any revision surgeries can also be done at this time.

# Staging

Due to the wide variable presentation of HRM, several classification systems have been proposed to better differentiate the phenotypical presentation to help improve diagnosis, treatment, and prognostic data. The first classification proposed by Pruzansky in 1969 focused on the characteristics of the mandible and glenoid fossa. In 1987, David et al. proposed the SAT (skeletal malformations, auricular involvement, and soft tissue defects) system, which was further expanded by Vento et al. to become the OMENS (orbit, mandible, ear, nerve, soft tissue) classification.

- Pruzansky system. This system organizes mandibular hypoplasia into 3 groups based on radiological findings and was later modified by Kaban et al. to include the temporomandibular joint.

- SAT (skeletal malformations, auricular involvement, and soft tissue defects) system. This system is based on the alphanumeric TMN system for cancer staging.

- OMENS (orbit, mandible, ear, nerve, soft tissue) system. This system is the most inclusive and was later modified to OMENS plus to include extracranial structures. Each anatomic category is assigned a numerical score from 0 (normal) to 3 (most severe). OMENS grading is considered more flexible and sensitive to the wide, heterogeneous phenotypic presentation of HFM.

# Prognosis

Studies have indicated that mandibular distraction osteogenesis with internal devices is effective in lengthening the mandible and improving facial symmetry, appearance, and dental occlusion on postoperative cephalograms and radiographs.

Similar studies have also shown similar rates of recurrence requiring revision surgery.

# Complications

Mandible distraction osteogenesis is the preferred method of treatment for HFM patients but can present with challenges and complications. A systemic review by Verlinden et al. found a complication rate of 43.9%, with 13.9% requiring revision surgery, hospitalization, or resulting in permanent sequelae.

Mucosal and soft tissue dehiscence were seen in 1.6% to 3.1% due to the thin soft tissue overlying the hypoplastic bone.

# Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care

After the surgical placement of internal distractors, the patients are admitted for airway observation. Patients are discharged once able to breathe without issues and are tolerating an adequate diet. After a latency period of 4-7 days for school-aged children, the distraction is activated at a rate of 1 mm per day until the desired length based on preoperative design. Parents are taught how to turn the distractor and keep the surgical site clean at home.

Once distraction is completed, the externally exposed rods are removed close to the skin. After 2 to 3 months of bony consolidation, the patient is brought back to the operating room to remove the internal device. A series of cephalograms are taken at the beginning of activation, end of activation, prior to device removal, and 1 year postoperatively.

# Consultations

Hemifacial microsomia may result from aberrant neurological regeneration impacting the salivary glands and integumentary system. Diagnosis and management should consist of an interprofessional team, including an otolaryngologist, plastic reconstructive surgeon, oral maxillofacial surgeon, ophthalmologist, primary clinician, psychologist, and geneticist.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Patient and family education on hemifacial microsomia can be challenging due to the heterogeneous presentation and the need for interprofessional management. Early involvement of a speech-language pathologist to address any functional deficits in speech and swallow is crucial. Introduction to a genetic counselor can be beneficial to address genetic and chromosomal abnormalities in the family. Patients and their families should be educated on the different treatment options and the timeline for reconstructive surgery. Studies have shown that the recurrence of asymmetrical bony growth is common after primary surgical management. Delay of surgical intervention until skeletal and dental maturity is often the best option to prevent revision surgery.

However, prolonged visible and functional impairments may have a significant impact on psychosocial development and personality formation in children.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Patients with hemifacial microsomia should be managed by an interprofessional team of otolaryngologists, plastic surgeons, oral maxillofacial surgeons, ophthalmologists, audiologists, speech-language pathologists, primary clinicians, psychologists, and geneticists. Children born with hypoplastic facial defects should be thoroughly evaluated by primary clinicians and geneticists for prompt diagnosis and referral to the reconstructive surgeons.

Other craniofacial microsomia syndromes with similar presentations should also be considered to determine if there are any accompanying vertebral or internal organ malformations. Studies have shown that reconstruction is best performed once children reach skeletal and dental maturity. As patients with HFM often require multiple surgeries throughout childhood and adolescence, they must be closely monitored by their primary clinician and reconstructive surgeons for both immediate and long-term functional and aesthetic outcomes. Finally, patients may develop social and functional impairment due to their condition.

Referral to a speech-language pathologist for speech and swallow, as well as psychosocial support, is recommended. Formal peer support groups with similar craniofacial malformation diagnoses can aid patients and parents in addressing their concerns.
