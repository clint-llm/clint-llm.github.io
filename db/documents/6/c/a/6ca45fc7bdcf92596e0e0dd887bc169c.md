The foramen ovale is a structure derived from muscular tissue. During embryogenesis of the heart, the septum secundum pulls the right horn of the sinus venosus into the right atrium and allows expansion of the right atrium. The right horn of the sinus venosus generates the smooth muscle of the right atrium and also contributes to the smooth muscle of the septum secundum on the wall where the foramen ovale is situated. Whereas in the left atrium, the pulmonary veins produce the smooth muscle in the chamber, which aids in the development of the atrial septum.
