Although IMSCT is mostly sporadic, some are associated with clinical syndromes such as neurofibromatosis 1, 2 (NF-1, NF-2), and Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL). NF-1 is due to a mutation on chromosome 17, which encodes a tumor suppressor gene. About 19% of patients with NF-1 develop IMSCT. NF-1 is largely associated with neurofibromas (intradural extramedullary), but in relation to IMSCTs, astrocytomas are most frequently encountered. NF-2 is due to a mutation on chromosome 22 and can be seen in about 2% of patients with IMSCTs. They commonly are associated with ependymomas and occasionally meningiomas (extramedullary). In VHL, hemangioblastomas are the most commonly found IMSCT.
