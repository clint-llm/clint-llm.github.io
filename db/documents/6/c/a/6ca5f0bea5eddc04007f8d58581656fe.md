No demographic group is unaffected by alcohol, but adolescents and young adults are most likely to present for intoxication and toxicity. They are also most likely to present for traumatic injuries sustained while drinking alcohol. Approximately 3.3 million deaths can be attributed to alcohol use; it is the fourth leading preventable cause of death in the United States. One in 12 adults has alcohol use disorder, which is defined as more than 3 drinks a day in men and more than 2 drinks a day in females or binge drinking.
