CRAO is analogous to a cerebral vascular accident involving the retina. As such, workup for CRAO closely parallels the workup for stroke or transient ischemic attacks.

Initial blood work should include point-of-care glucose, complete blood count with differential, and coagulation assays (PT/INR, PTT).

An erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein should be obtained to rule out giant cell (temporal) arteritis. If inflammatory markers are elevated and the history and physical are consistent with giant cell arteritis, then high dose steroids should be initiated immediately.

If symptom onset is less than 6 hours, a CT head without contrast should be obtained to rule out intracranial hemorrhage and determine if the patient is a candidate for thrombolytic therapy.

Other workup should be considered based on individual risks factors and history. This may include hemoglobin A1c, lipid profile, Rh factor, antinuclear antibody, fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test, hypercoagulability labs, carotid artery duplex, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and outpatient Holter monitoring.

If available, consider intravenous fluorescein angiography and/or electroretinography to confirm the diagnosis.
