The APC gene, located on the long arm of chromosome 5, is a tumor suppressor gene, which is responsible for the production of a protein that plays a significant role in cell division, regulation, and growth. It is specifically involved in controlling how often a cell divides and the manner of attachment of the cell to other cells within the tissue and the cell polarization and the morphology of some of its structures. It also serves as a determinant of the cellâ€™s mobility and direction in terms of chromosomal movement during cell division. Specifically, the protein beta-catenin, controlled by the APC gene, prevents those proteins responsible for stimulating cell division from being overly activated, thereby, preventing cell overgrowth and proliferation. Frequently it is the inactivation of the APC gene and the subsequent, inactivation of beta-catenin that is observed in cancerous cells.
