Patients with UCL injuries may present with soft tissue swelling, ecchymosis, and focal tenderness at the ulnar aspect of the thumb MCP joint.

Valgus stress testing during a physical exam does not distinguish between displaced and non-displaced UCL injuries, even if it demonstrates MCP joint instability.Â  Caution is also advisable during valgus stress testing as it may inadvertently convert a non-displaced tear into a displaced one, which is also the reason why abduction stress view radiography is no longer a recommendation.

Classification of acute UCL based on imaging:

- Type 1: Nondisplaced avulsion injury

- Type 2: There is a displaced fracture at the ulnar region of the base of the proximal phalanx

- Type 3: There is straining of the ligament

- Type 4: The UCL is completely torn

- Type 5: The is no injury to the UCL but avulsion of the volar plate is present
