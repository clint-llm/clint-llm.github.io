Cardiac computed tomography (CCT) is an innovative, cost-effective, noninvasive method of objectively evaluating the heart from an anatomical standpoint. When discussing CCTs, one must first appreciate the nomenclature as multiple terms are used synonymously; coronary computed tomography, cardiac computed tomography, coronary computed tomography angiography, cardiac computed tomography angiography, multidetector computed tomography (MDCT). In this article, we will differentiate between non-contrast-enhanced CCT denoted as "CCT," and contrast-enhanced CCT, aka cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) denoted as "CCTA." This article will predominantly focus on CCT while discussing some major aspects of CCTA. A more detailed article on the latter can be found separately.

CCT provides a three-dimensional approach to cardiac diagnostics, allowing the clinician to evaluate for coronary arterial disease (CAD) via the extent of atherosclerotic plaques. This is done with a 64-slice system aligned with the cardiac cycle, which provides high-quality spatial and temporal resolution images despite the cardiac activity.
