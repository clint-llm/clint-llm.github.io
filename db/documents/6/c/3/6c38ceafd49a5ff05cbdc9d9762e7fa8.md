Several devices exist for IO insertion, including First Access for Shock and Trauma (FAST1), the EZ-IO, and the Bone Injection Gun (BIG). Manual devices include the Jamshidi needle and the Diekman modified needle. Clinicians should refer to the instruction manual from the manufacturer with the device for specific details on proper use.Â All have similar applications and techniques, except the sternal site, which requires the purchase of the FAST1 product to avoid penetration of the posterior cortex into the thoracic aorta.
