Polymyalgia rheumatica is an immune-mediated disorder, and elevated inflammatory markers are one of the mostÂ common features. IL-6 appears to have a central role in mediating inflammation.

Patients with PMR have a decreased number of circulating B cells compared to healthy adults. The circulating B cells number inversely correlate with ESR and CRP. This altered distribution of B cells possibly contributes to the IL-6 response in PMR.
