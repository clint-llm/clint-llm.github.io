Complications accompanying CLL may include increased susceptibility to infections, particularly of the respiratory tract, progression to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Richter syndrome), an elevated risk of other malignancies (e.g., cancers of the skin, lungs, and GI tract), and immune system issues, where the immune system attacks red blood cells or platelets, although this is rare.
