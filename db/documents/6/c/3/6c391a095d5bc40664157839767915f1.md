- Typical parameters to monitor are renal function, i.e., Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine, and electrolytes such as potassium.

- If a patient has collagen vascular disease and/or renal impairment, periodically monitor complete blood count with differential to evaluate kidney erythropoietin production.

- In patients with hypotensive effects within 1 to 3 hours of initial dose or increased dosages or preexisting hepatic impairment, consider baseline hepatic function tests.

- White and red blood cell counts are necessary to evaluate for rare side effects of anemia, neutropenia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia.
