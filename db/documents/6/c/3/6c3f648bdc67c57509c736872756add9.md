CRE outbreaks are usually uncommon and isolated to institutional or geographic regions. The prevalence of community-acquired CRE has been reported to be 0%Â to 29.5%, and early screening detection of CRE-colonization in patients can help prevent or limit outbreaks via proper isolation methods.

Examples of how an interprofessional team approach applies in the case of CRE infections is bringing in an infectious disease specialist, as well as an infectious disease board-certified pharmacist. They will be more familiar with the latest antibiogram data and resistance patterns and help the team to focus therapy appropriately. Nurses need to be familiar with the proper administration of these drugs, as well as their common adverse events so that they can report any concerns to the team as they develop. These scenarios demonstrate how an interprofessional team can best address the management of therapy for these infections. [Level 5]
