**Pathomechanism**

Graves disease characteristically presents with a triad of exophthalmos or eye disease, pretibial myxedema, and hyperthyroidism.

The Snellen-Riesman's sign is due to the hyperdynamic circulation and increased cardiac output in thyroid eye disease and hyperthyroidism.

A bruit is defined as 'an audible vascular sound associated with turbulent blood flow. Although usually heard with the stethoscope, such sounds may occasionally also be palpated as a thrill'.

- Stenosis of an artery causing turbulent flow - the bruit is usually heard at the location of stenosis or proximal to it. Increased compensatory blood flow through other arteries or contralateral artery may also cause the bruit
- Stenosis or occlusion of the internal carotid artery (intracranial or extracranial)-ipsilateral or contralateral
- Atherosclerosis of carotid vessels

- Lesions with high vascularity/flow or dilated vasculature

- Arteriovenous malformations
- Cerebral hemangioma

- Hyperdynamic circulation and increased cardiac output:

- Thyrotoxicosis
- Severe Anemia
- Paget disease
- Beriberi

- The rapid shift of blood from a high-pressure area (artery) to a low-pressure area (vein) or anomalous vascular arteriovenous connection

- Carotid-cavernous fistula

- An orbital bruit may also be due to transmitted sound from the heart or other vessels including:

- Aortic stenosis
- An aortic aneurysm

- An orbital bruit may also be noted in
- Normal infants and children below 6 years
- Subarachnoid hemorrhage
- Migraine
- Increased intracranial tension
- Cerebrovascular accidents/ cerebral stroke/ large cerebral infarct or transient ischemic attack
- Vasculitis

- Giant cell arteritis
- Churg-Strauss vasculitis
