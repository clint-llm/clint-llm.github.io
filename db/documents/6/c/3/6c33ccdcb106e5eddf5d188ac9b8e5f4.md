Differences in case definitions make interpretation of population-based studies regarding BPH difficult. Whereas BPH can refer to histology, benign prostate enlargement, and physician-diagnosis of BPH, LUTS refers to the urinary symptoms shared by disorders affecting the prostate and bladder.

Age is a significant predictor of both development of BPH and subsequent LUTS, with 50% of men over the age of 50 shown to have evidence of BPH and the association with the development of LUTS shown to increase with age in a linear fashion.

At a population-level, the prevalence of BPH increased dramatically between 1998Â and 2007 in the US, nearly doubling in the number of cases.

International studies have suggested that Western populations have significantly higher prostate volumes compared to those from southeast Asia.
