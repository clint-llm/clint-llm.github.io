Differential diagnoses of lacunar infarcts include the following:

- Large vessel ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory: it is clinically differentiated from lacunar strokes by the presence of cortical signs, including altered mental status, aphasia, hemineglect, etc.

- Intracranial hemorrhages can be easily seen on neuroimaging modalities like brain CT scans.

- Seizures are caused by excess neuronal activity and can be differentiated clinically by their tonic-clonic activity and postictal state after having seizures.

- Complicated migraine: symptoms are usually accompanied by headache and aura. A typical auraÂ may involve visual disturbances, sensory symptoms, motor weakness, or speech disturbances.

- Brain tumors: are distinguished by their characteristic appearance on MRI.

- Multiple sclerosis (MS): can cause paroxysmal attacks of ataxia and dysarthria. MRI helps distinguish the presence of plaques due to MS from a stroke. Further cerebral vasoreactivity measured by transcranial Doppler (TCD) sonography can be used for differentiating ischemic and demyelinating lesions. The presence of oligoclonal bands on lumbar puncture is characteristic of multiple sclerosis.
