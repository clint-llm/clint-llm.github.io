The optic nerve (CN II) is the nerve responsible for relaying sight information to the brain. The optic nerve travels from the retina, which is the inside of the globe, through the optic foramen.

The ophthalmic nerve is the first division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V) and responsible for conveying sensory information from the globe, upper eyelid, lacrimal gland, conjunctiva, nasal mucosa, frontal sinus, external nose, and scalp. The ophthalmic nerve passes through the superior orbital fissure. Near this point, it divides into more specialized nerves.

The oculomotor (CN III), trochlear (CN IV), and abducent (CN VI) nerves also enter the orbit through the superior orbital fissure. The oculomotor and abducent nerves pass through the tendinous ring, while the trochlear nerve enters the orbit and passes just superior to the tendinous ring to enter the superior oblique muscle.
