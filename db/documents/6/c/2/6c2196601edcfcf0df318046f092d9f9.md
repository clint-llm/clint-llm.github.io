Myofibroblastoma is a benign rare spindle-cell breast tumor, which is rare and reported to have a slight male predisposition.

On palpation, myofibroblastoma appears as a solid, mobile mass. On histology, the lesion is well-circumscribed, consisting of randomly arranged fascicles of spindle-shaped cells missed together with adipocytes in an interrupted fashion within a collagenous and myxoid background. Ultrasonography and mammography imaging can be used for the diagnosis. The tumor can be confused with various lesions on imaging.

Myofibroblastoma is often confused with spindle cell lipoma, amongst other benign and malignant breast conditions. Its management involves surgical excision. Myofibroblastoma is not reported to have a malignant potential or recurrence risk.
