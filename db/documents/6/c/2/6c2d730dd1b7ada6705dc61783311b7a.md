Most oral hemangiomas will not require treatment due to their benign presentation and a high rate of complete involution over time. However, for OHs that present with impairment in speech, swallowing, or airway compromise, and for the 10% to 20% of lesions that persist into adolescence or adulthood, treatment is recommended. Current treatment options are divided into two categories: medical and surgical (or interventional).

Beta-blockers, such as propranolol, are the mainstay of medical treatment for OHs. The mechanism is unclear but has been suggested to include local vasoconstriction and triggering of apoptosis in endothelial cells. Patients are typically initiated on a regimen of propranolol 2-3 milligrams per kilogram per day divided into three doses, with improvement in OH appearance noted within 1-2 days after therapy begins. Throughout the duration of beta-blocker therapy, which may be up to 6 months, patients should be monitored for side effects, including bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, and bronchospasm.

Oral steroids are another option in the treatment of OHs but are not preferred to beta-blockers due to their unfavorable side effect profile. Prednisone has been most frequently studied for OH treatment and can be continued for up to four months. Varying dosing regimens are mentioned in the literature, with 2 milligrams per kilogram per day used in some studies and 20 to 30 milligrams per day used in others. It is generally agreed that if no change in the OH is noted within 2 weeks, prednisone therapy should be discontinued.

Patients, especially children, should be monitored while on steroid therapy for the development of hypertension, persistent hyperglycemia, changes in mood, and growth retardation. For patients with OHs resistant to beta-blockers and steroids, interferon-alpha has been studied with some success but is generally not preferred due to the risk of spastic diplegia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and hepatic toxicity. For patients who do not respond to medical therapy, or present with compromise in function, interventional or surgical options can be offered.

Surgical resection offers definitive treatment for OH and may be preferred for smaller lesions located on the lips and buccal mucosa. Resection would not be preferred for large lesions on the tongue as significant removal of tissue can result in chronic impairment of speech and swallowing. Sclerotherapy, in which a foreign agent (such as 3% sodium tetradecyl sulfate or ethanolamine oleate) is injected into one of the major vessels of an OH, leading to endothelial damage and obliteration of the lumen, is an evolving treatment modality for these lesions. Thus far, studies have demonstrated favorable results with minor adverse reactions following sclerotherapy treatment, but the risk of thrombosis with embolization does remain.
