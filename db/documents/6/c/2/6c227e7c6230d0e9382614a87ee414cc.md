Management of medial medullary syndrome is similar to any acute ischemic stroke. A rapid evaluation of the patient is necessary for proper management. Management in a stroke center will decrease the mortality and morbidity of these patients.

**Prehospital Management**

- Assess and manage ABCs, give supplemental oxygen to maintain O2 saturation >94%

- Initiate cardiac monitoring if possible

- Establish IV access per local protocol

- Measure blood glucose and treat it accordingly

- Keep the patient NPO

- Transport the patient to the nearest most appropriate stroke center

**Intrahospital Management Steps**

- Initiate intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) for thrombolysis within 3 or 4.5 hours of ischemic stroke symptom onset, according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The benefit of this therapy is dependent on time. So it should be started as soon as possible. After IV thrombolysis, patients should be monitored for 24 hours in the intensive care unit (ICU) or stroke bed/unit.

- Endovascular intervention: Endovascular treatment options include intra-arterial fibrinolysis, mechanical clot aspiration with the Penumbra system, and acute angioplasty and stenting. These newer techniques improve outcomes in different patients, but they are usually only indicated in patients with large vessel occlusion.

**General Therapy**

- Using normal saline is a good option, but hypotonic saline should be avoided as it can cause cerebral edema.

- Impairment of cerebral autoregulation occurs in the infarcted area of the brain. If BP is more than 220/120 or patients receive intravenous thrombolysis, then administer medications to lower the blood pressure. The blood pressure should come down gradually.

- Try to keep the patient's blood sugar within normal limits.

- Treatment of concomitant medical disease is important.

- Swallowing assessment before the patient receives oral medications, begins eating or drinking.

- Suspected pneumonia patients should be treated with appropriate antibiotics.

- Subcutaneous administration of anticoagulants to prevent DVT is recommended for the treatment of immobilized patients.

- Avoid routine placement of indwelling bladder catheters as it is associated with an increased risk of catheter-associated UTIs.

- Early appropriate physical and occupational therapy should be started along with rehabilitation.

**Potential Discharge Medications**

- Oral anticoagulation if the source of thrombus is the heart (i.e., atrial fibrillation)

- Antiplatelets such as clopidogrel, aspirin, or dipyridamole/ASA combination for other sources of thrombus

- Statins to treat dyslipidemia
