Glycolysis is the most crucial process in releasing energy from glucose, the end products of which are two molecules of pyruvic acid. It occurs in 10 successive chemical reactions, leading to a net gain of two ATP molecules from one molecule of glucose.

The overall efficiency for ATP formation is only approximately forty-three percent, with the remaining 57 percent is lost in the form of heat.Â The next step is the conversion of pyruvic acid to acetyl coenzyme A, this reaction utilizes coenzyme A, releasing two molecules of carbon dioxide and four hydrogen atoms. No ATP forms at this stage, but the four released hydrogen atoms participate in oxidative phosphorylation, later releasing six molecules of ATP. The next step is the breakdown of acetyl coenzyme A and release of energy in the form of ATP in the Kreb's cycle or the tricarboxylic acid cycle, taking place in the cytoplasm of the mitochondrion.
