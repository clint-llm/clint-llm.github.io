Its use is also contraindicated in patients with active liver disease or unexplained elevated levels of hepatic transaminases. Pregnant women or ones who may become pregnant should also avoid pitavastatin use. As pitavastatin is known to pass into breast milk, the recommendation is that nursing mothers also avoid pitavastatin use.
