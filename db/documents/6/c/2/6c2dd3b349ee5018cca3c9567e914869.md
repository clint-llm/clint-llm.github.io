Cervical radiculopathy is a relatively common condition seen in the outpatient setting, particularly after trauma or a fall. Patients will present with symptoms of pain, numbness, or tingling. A standard workup includes imaging such as cervical x-rays, cervical computed tomographic (CT) scan, cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and an electrodiagnostic workup. MRI is the gold standard to evaluate herniated disc. It is also beneficial for identifying other pathologies like tumors, infections, and demyelinating disorders. A cervical CT scan is the study of choice for distinguishing an osteophyte's presence compressing the nerve root, especially if combined with myelography. Imaging solely is not sufficient in diagnosing cervical radiculopathy. Electrodiagnostic studies, along with a thorough history and physical exam, are important to diagnose a patient.

The care of a patient with cervical radiculopathy involves several medical professionals, including physiatrists, neurologists, neurosurgeons, physical therapists, occupational therapists, social workers, and case managers. Cervical radiculopathy is initially managed conservatively with physical and occupational therapists' assistance, which typically resolves 75-90% of patients' symptoms.

Studies have shown a communication gap between the patient's imaging results and actual clinical findings. Abnormal findings on cervical MRI can be shown without clinical symptoms, thus not needing an intervention.
