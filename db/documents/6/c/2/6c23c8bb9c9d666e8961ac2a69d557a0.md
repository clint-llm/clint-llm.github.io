In sliding hiatal hernias, the GE junction migrates above the diaphragm secondary to increased laxity of the phrenoesophageal ligament. The ligament remains intact, and the GE junction migrates into the posterior mediastinum. With less amount of esophagus intra-abdominally, this predisposes the GE junction to malfunction leading to reflux. Regarding type 2 to 4, there is not one predominant theory to explain them all, and thus most PEHs are multifactorial in etiology. PEHs most often are associated with, but not limited to the widening of the esophageal hiatus or congenital versus acquired, such as prior history of surgical dissection, trauma, persistent increases in intra-abdominal pressure, or esophageal shortening due to fibrosis or scarring from repeated exposure to noxious content.
