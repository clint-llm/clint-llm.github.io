Ludwig angina mainly originates from dental infections in the mandibular molars, particularly the second and third molars, accounting for 90% of cases.

Other less common etiologies include oral piercing or laceration, mandibular fracture, traumatic intubation, osteomyelitis, peritonsillar or parapharyngeal abscess, submandibular sialadenitis, otitis media, and infected thyroglossal cysts.

Predisposing dental factors include poor oral hygiene, dental caries, and recent dental treatment.
