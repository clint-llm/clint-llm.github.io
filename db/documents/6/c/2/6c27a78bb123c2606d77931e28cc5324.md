Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) typically is a lifelong illness, though some experience a waxing and waning course. Even with CBT and/or SSRIs, seldom do the symptoms ever resolve. Roughly 30% of patients refuse treatment, abort treatment, or fail to respond to treatment. Of those who have successful treatment, about 50% have residual symptoms. Co-occurring hoarding has a worse prognosis.

In DSM-IV field trials of 431 patients, the fear of harming oneself was the most prevailing obsession. As reported by the adult psychiatric morbidity survey, an association between OCD and suicide has been established and predictably has links to comorbid anxiety, depression, and past suicide attempts. A cross-sectional study from January 2019 found that OCD and suicide are related regardless of symptoms of depression or mood instability.

If OCD does not get treated, the course is typically chronic, and it may be an episodic course, with a minority having a deteriorating course. With no treatment, remission rates in adults are low. Onset in childhood or adolescence can lead to chronic disease. However, 40% of individuals with the onset of OCD in childhood or adolescence experience remission by early adulthood. Other disorders often complicate the course of OCD.
