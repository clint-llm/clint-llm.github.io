Hyperkeratosis of the nipple and areola does not resolve without treatment and tends to persist indefinitely. Various medical or surgical treatments may be indicated in this condition. Keratolytic topicals (salicylic acid, lactic acid) are used as a first-line treatment. Nevertheless, they are rarely sufficient. Topical corticosteroids have almost no effect, even if they may relieve pruritus. Topical retinoids such as tretinoin 0.05% and isotretinoin have been used with little success. Calcipotriol, a topical vitamin D analog which regulates skin proliferation and differentiation, is poorly efficient. Topical hydroquinone combined with kojic acid may improve hyperpigmentation of the breast; however, no effect is obtained on hyperkeratosis. Systemic retinoids (etretinate, acitretin) were inefficient when used.

Physical destructive treatments, such as cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen, and carbon dioxide laser give more satisfactory results.

Surgical excision is another possible therapy. Surgical options include: shave excision, curettage, and areola removal followed by reconstruction using a skin graft. Tangential excision using a radiofrequency surgical device was used in cutting mode in two female patients, with no recurrence after 7 to 9 months.
