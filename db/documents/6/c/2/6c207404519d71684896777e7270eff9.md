Voltage-gated ion channels are comprised of 4 domains surrounding a central pore in which each domain contains six transmembrane alpha-helices. Within each domain, the 4th alpha helix (S4) contains positively charged lysine and/or arginine amino acids. When the cell depolarizes, the positive residues within S4 are repelled, inducing a conformation change that leads to the opening of the channel pore. Sodium channels are subject to fast inactivation. Upon opening of the channel pore, the linker region between domain III and IV binds to residues within the pore, thus blocking the flow of ions.

Two forces, electrical and chemical, determine the driving force of an ion. The electrostatic force is repulsive for similar charges and attractive for opposite charges. For example, a positive sodium ion (Na+) would be attracted to a negative intracellular voltage. The chemical force, or force of diffusion, is defined by relative extracellular and intracellular concentrations of the ion. The equilibrium potential is the voltage at which these two forces cancel, and there is no net flux of the ion. When an ion is permitted to move across the membrane, as is the case when an ion channel is open, the cell will move towards the ionâ€™s equilibrium potential. The equilibrium potential for Na+, which concentrates extracellularly, is approximately +60mV. Conversely, the equilibrium potential for K+, which concentrates intracellularly, is approximately -85mV. Thus the opening of sodium channels is depolarizing while the opening of potassium channels is hyperpolarizing.
