The treatment options are based on the stage of the disease. Given the leukemic involvement in Sezary syndrome, the treatment is generally systemic. It can be given alone or in a combination of skin-based therapy. Stage IVA (no visceral involvement) patients are usually treated with extracorporeal phototherapy (ECP) combined with biological response modifiers (retinoids and interferons). Other alternatives include low-dose methotrexate and histone deacetylase inhibitors (vorinostat and romidepsin). Various combinations of the above can be used along with skin-directed therapy.

- Skin-directed therapy includes topical or systemic steroids, topical nitrogen mustard, phototherapy (UVB and PUVA), and total skin electron beam therapy (TSEBT).

- Radiation therapy can be used for local control of skin and nodal disease.

- Patients with stage IVB (visceral involvement) are usually treated with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors or targeted therapy like brentuximab vedotin.

- Targeted agents approved for MF/SS include brentuximab vedotin (BV) and mogamulizumab (Moga). BV is an anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody conjugated with the tubulin inhibitor monomethylauristatin E that is approved by the FDA for patients who have received prior therapy. Its approval is based on the ALCANZA trial.

- In the relapsed and refractory setting, various single-agent chemotherapies can be used like doxorubicin, gemcitabine, and purine/pyrimidine analogs. FDA-approved drugs in this setting include intermediate-dose methotrexate and pralatrexate. Other options include pembrolizumab, alemtuzumab, bortezomib, and lenalidomide.

- Young patients with high-risk diseases should be offered allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at experienced centers.

Besides these disease-directed treatment options, pruritis is a big concern in patients with Sezary syndrome. Various local and/or systemic options can be used to control the pruritis.
