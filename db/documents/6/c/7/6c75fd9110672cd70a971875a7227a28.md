The classic instrument used for an excisional hemorrhoidectomy is the scalpel with or without the aid of scissors for dissection. This approach is highly effective and of low cost.

Ligasure and Harmonic scalpels are modern-day energy devices that have slowly come onto the medical scene. The added expense can negatively impact economic efficiency in the current reimbursement milieu. Ligasure is a bipolar cautery device used for both tissue division and coagulation of blood vessels. The Harmonic scalpel uses a reciprocating blade to generate heat for tissue division and coagulation. The proposed benefits of using energy devices relative to their cost have not demonstrated significant clinical advantages.

Monopolar electrocautery is a device capable of superior hemostasis compared with a scalpel. It allows excision of the hemorrhoidal complex without suture ligation, but at the expense of injuring adjacent tissues due to lateral thermal spread.

A Hill Ferguson retractor is inserted into the anal canal to visualize the entire length of the hemorrhoidal complex. Other equipment that is needed may include:
