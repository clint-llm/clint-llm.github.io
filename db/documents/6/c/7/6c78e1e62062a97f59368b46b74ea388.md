**Prevention Guidelines During Insertion**

Recent data reveal no difference in the infection rate based on the insertion catheter site. The following are some key components of a prevention program, abstracted from an extensive list provided by the CDC and IDSA.

- Hand hygiene by washing hands with soap, water, or alcohol-based gels or foams. Gloves do not prevent the need for hand hygiene.

- A strict aseptic technique using maximal sterile barrier precautions, including a full-body drape when inserting central venous catheters.

- Use 2% chlorhexidine skin preparations for disinfecting/ cleaning skin before insertion.

- Ultrasound guidance by an experienced provider for placement to circumvent mechanical complications and reduce the number of attempts.

- Avoid the femoral vein as a choice for central line placement, and prefer the subclavian vein when possible for non-tunneled catheters.

- Promptly remove any central line that is no longer required.

- Replace central lines placed during an emergency (asepsis not assured) as soon as possible or within 48 hours.

- Use a checklist.

**Prevention Guidelines During Maintenance**

- Disinfect the catheter hubs, injection ports, and connections before accessing the line.

- Replace administration sets other than sets used for lipids or blood products every 96 hours.

- Assess the need for the central line daily.
