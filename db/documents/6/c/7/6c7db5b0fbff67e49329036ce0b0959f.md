The indication for the use of an alpha-receptor modifying medication depends on which receptor is the target: the alpha-1 receptor or the alpha-2 receptor. Further, when administering a pharmacologic agent, it can exert either agonistic or antagonistic activity on the alpha receptors. This activity reviews the various alpha receptors and examines the types of agents that can act upon these receptors to alter the physiologic response for therapeutic effect.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the two predominant types of alpha-adrenergic receptors.
- Describe the effects of agonistic and antagonistic activity on the various alpha receptors.
- Summarize the potential adverse effects for each type of alpha agonist or antagonist medication class.
- Explain how knowledge of alpha-receptor physiology can help improve care coordination amongst the interprofessional team.
