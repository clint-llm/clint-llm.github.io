Patients with HELLP syndrome should be educated about the course of the disease. The risk of maternal and perinatal complications and mortality should be explained to the patient and their family. The risk of developing HELLP in subsequent pregnancies may be decreased by maintaining a healthy lifestyle and preventing diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. Regular exercise should be followed. Routine prenatal care and laboratory testing must beÂ initiated early in the subsequent pregnancies.
