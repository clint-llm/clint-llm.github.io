Post-operative care is centered around physiotherapy to regain and optimize function, and a specialist physiotherapist should be consulted to oversee this process. It will depend on the surgery performed (repair vs. debridement, microfracture or not). If there is a labral repair, care will typically follow a conventional arthroscopic instability repair rehabilitation pathway.

An example of such a program would involve: a sling for four weeks with elbow, wrist, and hand exercises, plus shoulder pendular movements during this time to reduce stiffness. Following this, a progressive exercise regime is adopted, starting with gentle active movements. This should progress over 6Â to 8 weeks, ultimately encouraging an active range of movement, rotation, stretching, and controlled (light) strengthening work. At the end of this period, more significant strength conditioning work can be introduced progressively. In the athlete, return to non-contact and contact sport may occur at five and six months, respectively, as a guide, but that is based on hitting the relevant functional recovery milestones.
