The initial evaluation should include a complete history and physical examination. As previously discussed, most patients will present with a small swelling or tender spot in the lower extremities, particularly in an ankle.

Soft tissue sarcomas, in general, can be divided into subtypes, and no single imaging modality is ideal for every tumor.

In addition to plain radiographs, which are useful to evaluate for possible masses arising from bone, or to detect intralesional calcifications, cross-sectional imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly preferred for masses that arise in the extremities. MRI, unlike CT, delineates different muscle groups and may provide more information regarding the extent of these tumors.

Histology is essential for planning further workup and treatment. Tissue may be obtained through incisional biopsy, fine needle aspiration, or core needle biopsy. The latter has a lower incidence of complications, is highly accurate, and is usually preferred.

Further pathological workup for CCSST should include immunohistochemistry. Confirmation of CCSST and differentiating this tumor from MM will also require fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

After treatment, discussed below, postoperative imaging is commonly performed 3 months after treatment. For high-grade lesions on presentation, 3- to 6-month interval imaging is preferred, while low-grade lesions may be followed with annual imaging.
