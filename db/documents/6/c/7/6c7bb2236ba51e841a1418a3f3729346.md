To understand the pathologic processes that result in vitamin D deficiency and subsequent manifestations, it is first essential to detail vitamin D metabolism.

The synthesis of active vitamin D (calcitriol) organically begins in the skin, where cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) is formed by the action of UVB radiation converting 7-dehydrocholesterol (provitamin D3) in epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts to pre-vitamin D, which spontaneously isomerizes to form cholecalciferol.

Subsequently, cholecalciferol gets transported to the liver, where it is converted to calcidiol, 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], by 25-hydroxylase (CYP2R1). Therefore, it is logical that patients with chronic liver disease would be at risk of developing vitamin D deficiency. This particular form of vitamin D is partially water-soluble and has a short half-life. It is worthwhile noting that 25(OH)D is also the best indicator of overall vitamin D status because this measurement most accurately reflects total vitamin D from dietary intake, natural sunlight exposure, and converted adipose stores in the liver. Estimates are that approximately 40 to 50% of circulating 25(OH)D derives from skin conversion.

Enzymatic conversion to calcitriol, 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D [1,25(OH)D], occurs in the kidneys by 1-alpha-hydroxylase. Similarly, chronic renal disease, amongst other renal pathologies, can cause vitamin D deficiency, which is why secondary, and eventually, tertiary hyperparathyroidism can develop with long-term renal failure. It is important to realize that 1-alpha-hydroxylase activity is strictly regulated.

As with any synthetic biologic process, feedback loops exist to regulate calcitriol production, namely:

- Positive feedback by parathyroid hormone (PTH)

- Positive feedback by decreased serum phosphate levels

- Negative feedback by fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) secreted by osteocytes in the bone matrix, which also inhibits renal phosphate absorption

- Negative feedback by calcitriol inhibition of 1-alpha-hydroxylase, which in turn decreases calcitriol synthesis and also stimulates 24-hydroxylase (CYP24R1) activity.

- 24-hydroxylase effectively removes circulating calcitriol by converting it to biologically inactive 24,25-dihydroxy vitamin D [24,25(OH)D].
