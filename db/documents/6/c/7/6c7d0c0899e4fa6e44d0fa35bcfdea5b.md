While non-lactational causes of mastitis are less common, lactational mastitis is a common condition that affects breastfeeding women. This activity reviews the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of the various forms of mastitis, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with these conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiology of lactational mastitis. 
- Identify the risk factors for developing lactational mastitis.
