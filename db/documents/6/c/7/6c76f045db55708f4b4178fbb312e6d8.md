Differential diagnosis includes:

- Drug-induced secondary causes such as antimalarial agents, Phenytoin, Penicillamine, Glucocorticoids. Stopping offending drug and rechecking immunoglobulins is warranted if patients are demonstrating an immunocompromised state.

- Genetic disorders as mentioned above including but not limited to Hyper IGM immunodeficiency, X-linked agammaglobulinemia, X-linked SCID, Trisomy 18, and 21, ataxia-telangiectasia can be mistaken for hypogammaglobulinemia. A genetic evaluation would be the next step to distinguish any chromosomal involvement or defect.

- Infectious etiologies such as CMV, EBV, HIV, Rubella, and congenital Toxoplasma gondii. Rule out by PCR is indicated if suspicion is high. Certain viruses and bacterial infections can cause low serum immunoglobulins and must be ruled out. Repeat Serum immunoglobulins once the infection is treated.

- Malignancies like Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Non-Hodgkins lymphoma, B cell malignancy can present similar to hypogammaglobulinemia. Oncological evaluation with proper tissue biopsies will be beneficial in certain cases if malignancy is high on the differential.

- Systemic disorders such as severe burns, nephrotic syndromes, severe diarrhea, and malnutrition can also be causes of low immunoglobulins. Proper history and examination are essential for adequate evaluation and assessment.
