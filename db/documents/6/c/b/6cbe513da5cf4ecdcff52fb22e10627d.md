The nail unit includes the nail plate and supporting structures. This section explains the anatomy of the nail unit and histologic findings of each region.

**Nail Plate**

The nail plate is the nail itself. It is a rigid, keratinized structure composed of around 196 rows of compact, well-differentiated keratinocytes called onychocytes.

**Nail Matrix**

The nail matrix is the origin of the nail plate. Its proximal end resides halfway between the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint and the PNF.**lunula**. The lunula is most prominent on the thumb and gets concealed by the PNF as one progresses to the digits on the ulnar side. The contour of the distal margin of the nail plate follows the shape of the lunula as observed in neonates and following nail avulsion.

At the edge of the lunula, an abrupt thinning of the epidermis is visible as the epithelium transitions to the nail bed.

Two elements constitute the mesenchymal layer under the nail matrix epithelium: a matrical dermis and a matrical hypoderm.

**Nail Bed**

The nail bed sits underneath the nail plate, spanning between the lunula and the hyponychium. The nail bed epithelium is composed of a monocellular basal layer, a spinous layer, and, like the nail matrix, is devoid of a stratum granulosum.

The nail bed dermis has one uniform compartment of collagen bundles and elastic fibers. There is a rich vascular network that is oriented longitudinally.

**Nail Folds**

The nail folds help secure the proximal and lateral margins of the nail plate.

- **Proximal**- The PNF is a skin wedge covering the proximal nail plate and matrix. Its dorsal surface is an extension of the normal finger epidermis, which reflects proximally to form a ventral surface. It overlies the proximal nail plate and divides into a distal and proximal zone.**eponychium**. At the angle between the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the PNF, the eponychium produces the**cuticle**, a thick stratum corneum layer that firmly adheres to the nail plate.

- **Lateral** – The LNFs line the sides of the nail. Histologically, apart from their lack of pilosebaceous units, they resemble normal skin.

**Hyponychium**

The hyponychium refers to the epidermis underlying the free margin of a nail. Melanocytes here have a basal distribution.

**Isthmus**

The isthmus is the transitional zone between the nail bed and the hyponychium.
