Zinc deficiency is not common, but it occasionally occurs in people with restricted diets and malabsorption problems. Zinc deficiency can be prevented in the majority of cases by educating the public. The pharmacist, outpatient nurse, and dietitian play a vital role, along with clinicians, in educating the public about the foods that can be consumed to prevent zinc deficiency. In fact, the federal government rules also suggest that the nutritional needs should be primarily met from foods and not by taking unnecessary supplements. Foods rich in zinc include whole grains, low-fat dairy products, seafood, poultry, legumes, soy, and red meat. Also, the pharmacist should educate the patient on the potential interactions of medications with certain zinc supplements. Certain antibiotics, penicillamine, and diuretics can affect the absorption and excretion of zinc supplements. More importantly, the pharmacist should educate the patient about the health risks associated with excessive zinc intake. The pharmacist should work with the clinician on making sure no drug-drug interactions occur. Through an interprofessional approach with a team of healthcare workers, zinc deficiency can be avoided and result in better outcomes.
