Dysplastic nevi may be present in approximately 2% to 18% of the population. Individuals with these nevi are at increased risk for melanoma. InÂ White race individuals in the United States, the lifetime risk of developing melanoma is less than 1%, whereas, in patients with dysplastic nevi, the risk is greater than 10%. The risk of melanoma increases significantly to 50% in individuals with a family history of dysplastic nevus syndrome. Dysplastic nevi are relatively uncommon in the Japanese population. The incidence of dysplastic nevi in the pediatric population is very low.
