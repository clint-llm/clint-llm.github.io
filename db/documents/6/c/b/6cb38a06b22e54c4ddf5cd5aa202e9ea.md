Klebsiella pneumonia is a serious infection, and even with adequate treatment, the mortality rates remain high. This infection is best looked after by an interprofessional healthcare team that includes an infectious disease expert, pharmacists, nurses, intensivist, dietitian, pulmonologist, and respiratory therapist. Nurses who look after these patients should follow strict infection control protocols to prevent the spread of the organism. Hand washing is crucial for medical personnel and visitors. Nurses should only ensure that devices are only used once to minimize transmission. The pharmacist should ensure that an empirical antibiotic prescription is not carried out, as this only leads to the development of drug resistance. Since many of these patients are frail, a dietary consult should be sought to optimize the calorie intake. Finally, since many of these patients are bedridden, a physical therapy consult should be considered to help with mobility and prevent stiffness of the joints.

**Outcomes**

Klebsiella pneumonia usually signals a grim prognosis. Even with optimal therapy, this infection of the lung carries a mortality of 30 to 50%. The prognosis is usually worse in diabetics, the elderly, and those who are immunocompromised. Even those who survive often have residual impaired lung function, and recovery can take months.
