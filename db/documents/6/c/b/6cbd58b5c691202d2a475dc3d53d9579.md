Wide local excisions are the mainstay for ALM. Definitive surgical margin recommendations are based on tumor thickness at the time of biopsy, which is further discussed in the surgical oncology section. Foregoing surgical excision of in-situ lesions when surgery is not practical can be considered.

Off label use of topical imiquimod has been studied; however, the persistence of in-situ lesions, failure to detect invasive lesions due to lack of excision, the progression of lesions, and the high cost of treatment are all potential pitfalls of this treatment. If metastases are detected clinically, by palpation of local lymph node beds, or by sentinel lymph node biopsy, systemic treatment with chemotherapeutic agents, targeted mutational therapy, and immune checkpoint inhibitors may be indicated which is further discussed below in the oncology section. Patients who have asymptomatic high stage disease do not show a survival benefit from treatment before symptoms arise.
