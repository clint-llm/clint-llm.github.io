The pathogenesis of restless legs syndrome is not completely known.

Calcium/phosphate imbalance, anemia, functional iron deficiency, and subclinical peripheral nerve abnormalities may be involved in the pathophysiology of uremic restless legs syndrome.

Vitamin D deficiency and calcium metabolism, pre-eclampsia, a strong family history, low serum iron, ferritin level, and high estrogen levels may also play a role in pregnancy.

Polymorphisms in genes including BTBD9 and MEIS1 are associated with restless legs syndrome.

Human neuropathologic and imaging studies have shown decreased iron in different brain regions including substantia nigra and thalamus. These areas also demonstrate a state of relative dopamine excess.

Restless leg syndrome is extremely common during pregnancy, especially during the third trimester.
