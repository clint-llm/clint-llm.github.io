Without treatment, hypothyroidism may have a risk of high morbidity and mortality. It can eventually lead to coma or even death. In children, failure to treat hypothyroidism can result in severe mental retardation. A leading cause of death in adults is heart failure. With treatment, most patients have a good prognosis, and the symptoms usually reverse in a few weeks or months.
