CBD can cause dose-related liver damage. Concomitant use of CBD and other medications such as leflunomide, lomitapide, mipomersen, pexidartinib, teriflunomide, and valproate can increase the risk of liver damage and is known to damage the liver. Clinicians should warn patients with elevated baseline transaminases about potentially worsening liver function with the administration of CBD. It is important to monitor bilirubin levels and transaminase levels before and during treatment. Discontinuation of CBD or discontinuing concomitant use has reduced elevations. In patients with moderate or severe liver damage, slow dose titration and adjustment is the recommended approach.

There are occasional reports of somnolence, and sedation has been occasionally reported with CBD use. These side effects may diminish over time and are more likely to be reported earlier in treatment. Doctors should be wary about prescribing CBD with other sedative medications, such as benzodiazepines and opioids. Concomitant use of CBD with these sedative medications can result in severe respiratory depression.

CBD use may have an association withÂ increased suicidal thoughts and/or behavior.

Also, CBD is newly on the market and is usually used as an adjunct therapy; thus, further studies are necessary to better understand all potential side effects and effects on liver enzymes and drug interactions.
