Laboratory assessment of phenol exposure is not widely available, and in most cases, will not alter initial management. However, if desired, laboratory confirmation of exposure can be performed by obtaining a serum or urine phenol level. Monitoring urine phenol levels is common in workplaces with occupational benzene exposure but has no definitive role in acute phenol poisoning.

Phenol-exposed patients should receive regular monitoring of vital signs and mental status. A baseline electrocardiogram should be obtained as well as continuous cardiac monitoring to evaluate for dysrhythmias. Laboratory evaluation should focus on identifying the presence of acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis, hepatitis, rhabdomyolysis, or methemoglobinemia. A chest radiograph should be obtained in cases of ingestion or inhalational exposure or patients with hypoxemia or respiratory complaints. Phenol metabolites may also produce characteristic blue-green urine that may provide a clue to the diagnosis in cases of unknown exposure.
