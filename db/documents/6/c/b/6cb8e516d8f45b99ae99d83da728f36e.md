Blunt renal trauma is more common than penetrating renal trauma. The causes of blunt renal trauma in order of frequency are: motor vehicle accidents, falls, sports injuries and pedestrian struck injuries. Blunt injuries can resultÂ from a direct blow to the organ, crushing of the organ against the paravertebral muscles or due to rapid deceleration forces. Rapid deceleration can cause avulsion at the ureteropelvic junction, avulsion of the renal vessels, or arterial dissection/thrombosis leading to a devascularized kidney. The most common cause of penetrating renal injury is due to gunshot wounds followed by stab wounds.
