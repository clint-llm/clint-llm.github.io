# Introduction

The lower urinary tract (LUT) consists of the bladder and urethra and allows for the low-pressure storage of urine with conscious control of micturition. Urodynamics is the measurement of the relevant physiological parameters of the LUT to assess its function and dysfunction. Clinicians can perform urodynamics noninvasively and invasively. The standard urodynamic test includes both forms of assessment. The test involves noninvasive evaluation of bladder emptying, and invasive assessments of bladder storage function and bladder emptying function**.**

Invasive monitoring utilizes the insertion of catheters into the bladder and other body cavities. A clear question should, therefore, be posed and answered when performing standard urodynamic testing, and its results should guide therapeutic intervention.

Standard urodynamic testing is performed in patients with LUT symptoms (LUTS). It involves noninvasive uroflowmetry, followed by invasive cystometry and a pressure-flow study. The addition of tests such as concurrent electromyography (EMG) of pelvic floor muscles and urethral pressure profiles can supplement the investigation for further clinical detail.

Video urodynamics is when standard urodynamics is combined with fluoroscopic imaging with radiographic contrast used in bladder filling. This form of assessment is particularly more informative in neurological patients who have neurogenic bladders and in patients who have had previous surgery or trauma-related anatomical defects.

Ambulatory urodynamics has a portable device continuously monitoring bladder and abdominal pressures via invasive catheters. Natural filling of the bladder occurs through diuresis, rather than infusion via a catheter. It is a second line investigation aiming to reproduce symptoms through normal ambulatory activity in patients for whom standard urodynamic testing has not yielded definitive answers.

# Specimen Collection

The International Continence Society (ICS) guidelines advise for a standard urodynamics protocol where all patients undergo thorough clinical assessment as part of a urodynamic investigation.

Patients investigated for LUTS are expected to complete a relevant, validated symptom score which includes a bother to life indicator. Furthermore, patients should complete a 3-day bladder diary (frequency volume chart) to assist in arriving at a urodynamic diagnosis.

A multi-channel urodynamic test comprises of five components:

- Uroflowmetry

- Cystometry

- Pressure flow study

- Urethral pressure profile

- Electromyography

Uroflowmetry is the non-invasive assessment of the free flow of urine voided per unit time, measured in milliliters per second (ml/s)**.**

The 2 phases of standard invasive urodynamic testing include cystometry during the filling phase and a pressure-flow study during the voiding phase.

Cystometry is the dynamic measurement of detrusor pressure during the continuous filling of the bladder. It begins with the infusion of fluid into the bladder with a catheter. Catheters are most commonly inserted transurethrally. However, other routes, such as suprapubic, are also options where necessary. Cystometry provides information regarding bladder sensations that occur as the bladder fills as well as the reaction of the detrusor to this filling. Cystometry determines the compliance and the capacity of the bladder. The competence of the sphincter also needs an assessment during any abnormal detrusor contraction that occurs as well as on increasing the intraabdominal pressure by coughing, performing Valsalva maneuver and other activity that reportedly causes incontinence in the patient. Cystometry ends with a micturition command, or "permission to void". Some patients may experience severe incontinence, which also signifies the end cystometry, before this command.

A pressure-flow study is the measurement of the pressure generated by the detrusor muscle and the resulting flow. It begins following the micturition command given at the end of cystometry—poor flow results from either impaired detrusor contractility or outflow obstruction. Without synchronous measurement of detrusor pressure, uroflowmetry on its own is unable to differentiate between these two entities.**.**

Urethral Pressure Profile provides the measurement of the urethral length and its competence. It is typically performed in women to help determine the cause of stress urinary incontinence.

Electromyography records the electrical potentials generated by the pelvic floor muscle activity utilizing surface electrodes.

A standard urodynamic report that follows should include all of the pre-test mentioned above clinical assessments, along with a urodynamic diagnosis and a management recommendation. Additional details regarding the temperature and type of fluid used, the rate of filling, the size of the catheter, and patient position should also be in the report.

# Procedures

The indication for performing urodynamics should be discussed with the patient before arranging the test along with a written information leaflet. This approach assists in understanding and promotes cooperation, though studies have shown that it may not necessarily improve overall patient satisfaction**.**

Before the procedure, the clinician should review all relevant clinical information. Appropriate contemporaneous consent should be gained and documented where necessary. Patient allergies should be reviewed, following the standard World Health Organization surgical checklist protocols. Adequate counseling regarding the relevant risks of the procedure is essential. These include dysuria, haematuria, urinary tract infection, failure to catheterize, urinary retention, failure to reproduce symptoms, and failure to arrive at a urodynamic diagnosis.

A uroflowmetry is the initial step, followed by the measurement of post micturition residual volume using transabdominal ultrasound or urinary catheter.

During urodynamics, the pressure measurement is by using transducers, and the bladder is filled with a pump. A computer screen displays live pressure traces and infuse volume.

Both fluid-filled and air-charged urodynamic catheters exist; however, the ICS has set standardized pressures based on fluid-filled catheters**.****.**

The patient is placed supine, and a multi-lumen urodynamic catheter is inserted into the bladder. This specialist catheter is usually 6-7Fr and made of polyvinyl chloride or polyurethane. It has multiple lumens for concurrent pressure monitoring and fluid infusion simultaneously. The catheter is introduced into the bladder with an aseptic technique using local anesthetic lubricant gel. A second catheter is introduced into the rectum or vagina to measure abdominal pressure. Other cavities such as an intestinal stoma and stomach are also options.

The transducers for the fluid-filled system are external and adjusted to the height of the superior border of the symphysis pubis, the approximate anatomical level of the base of the bladder. It is set to this level to avoid artifacts occurring due to hydrostatic pressure effects. If the patient changes position during the urodynamic test, the height of the transducer should be adjusted accordingly.

The vesical pressure at the beginning of the test should be zero or close to zero. A cough test is performed, and pressure change should reflect on both vesical and abdominal pressure traces. The peaks should be roughly equal in amplitude. If one peak is less than 70% of the other, the line with the lesser peak should be flushed with fluid and cough test repeated until similar pressure amplitudes are measured.

The filling phase occurs with the infusion of warmed sterile water or physiological saline. Filling rates can either be physiological or nonphysiological**.**

During cystometry, the pressure trace should be marked with annotations of the patient's subjective sensations. These markers should signify the patient's 'first sensation of filling,' 'first desire to void,' and 'strong desire to void.' The patient may be asked to cough, strain, or perform other stressing actions (crouching, exercises), to reproduce any of their usual incontinence symptoms. Regular cough tests at intervals of one minute or every 50 ml of infusate assure that the maintenance of the quality of pressure transmission throughout the test. Cystometry also measures bladder volume and bladder compliance.

A "permission to void" command follows after stopping the infusion pump. A pressure flow study is the next step, with the observation of pressures during uroflowmetry for the voided volume.

# Indications

The American Urological Association (AUA) in collaboration with the Society for Urodynamics, Female Pelvic Medicine, and Urogenital Reconstruction (SUFU) summarises the main indications for performing urodynamic studies into 5 categories

- Identifying LUT dysfunction

- Predicting the consequences of LUT dysfunction on the upper urinary tract

- Predicting outcomes of management

- Assessing the outcomes of an intervention

- Assessing treatment failure

Standard urodynamic testing is useful where there is an unclear diagnosis if surgical interventions are a consideration, in the presence of multiple coexisting pathologies and a decision is necessary regarding which symptoms to manage first, or in patients with complex urological/anatomical issues.

# Potential Diagnosis

**Female**

**Incontinence**

1. Detrusor overactivity (DO): Detrusor overactivity is characterized by involuntary contractions of the bladder detrusor muscle during bladder filling, which may be provoked or unprovoked.

- Phasic DO: intermittent DO, which occurs during filling, does not necessarily cause incontinence.

- Terminal DO: DO occurring near-maximum bladder capacity, usually results in incontinence.

- Compound DO: phasic DO, with an increase in detrusor and baseline detrusor pressure with each contraction during filling.; it occurs relative to underlying neurological disease.

- High and sustained DO involves continuous detrusor contractions, with detrusor pressure not returning to baseline.

- Post micturition DO: DO occurs after voiding, usually in the presence of detrusor and/or urethral instability.

2. Stress urinary incontinence (SUI): SUI is diagnosed with urodynamics with involuntary leakage seen as a result of an increase in abdominal pressure without detrusor contraction.

- Bladder neck descent <2 cm below the inferior border of the pubic symphysis with the bladder neck is closed at rest.

- Rotational descent/cystocele and the bladder neck closed at rest

- Normal bladder position with the bladder neck open at rest and weak urethral closure

- Mixed urinary incontinence (MUI): MUI is incontinence resulting from the co-existence of both DO and SUI. The advice is to treat the most bothersome cause of symptoms first.

**Bladder Outlet Obstruction (BOO)**

BOO may occur as a result of anatomical obstruction, such as stricture, previous incontinence surgery, cystocele, urethral diverticulum, or as a result of functional sphincteric obstruction due to high-tone non-relaxing sphincter.

**Detrusor Underactivity (DU)**

DU is a lack of adequate detrusor pressure or short contraction time, leading to poor bladder emptying, often in the presence of a high PVR.

**Male**

**Incontinence**

1. Detrusor overactivity (DO): The above characteristics of DO also apply in men. However, the cause of DO in men is known to be associated with benign prostatic obstruction, as well as other causes of BOO.****DO is present in 60 to 80% of men with LUTS, and in up to 93% of men with UUI.

2. SUI: The most prevalent cause of SUI in adult men is radical prostatectomy (RP).****can be as high as 74%.

3. MUI: Incontinence due to DO as well as SUI.

**Bladder Outlet Obstruction**

Male BOO is defined as an abnormally poor urinary flow with increased detrusor pressures seen on the pressure-flow study. The ICS nomogram is useful to diagnose BOO, and the bladder outlet obstruction index (BOOI) classifies men into unobstructed (BOOI <20), equivocal (BOOI of 20 to 40), and obstructed (BOOI >40).

**Detrusor Underactivity**

The urodynamic criteria to diagnose  DU in men include a  bladder contractility index (BCI) <100, bladder voiding efficiency (BVE) of <90%, and bladder outlet obstruction index (BOOI) <20.

**Loss of Compliance**

Compliance is the measure of bladder distensibility.

**Functional BOO**

Detrusor sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) is characterized by disordered involuntary contraction of the external urethral sphincter and detrusor muscle.

DU occurs in up to 83% of spinal cord injury patients and up to 25% in patients with multiple sclerosis.

# Normal and Critical Findings

**General**

Uroflowmetry assesses flow pattern, flow curve shape, maximum urinary flow (Qmax), voided volume (VV), voiding time (VT), PVR volume (PVR). A minimum of 150ml is required to provide an accurate assessment in men

The normal abdominal and vesical resting pressures are as follows

- Supine: 0 to 18 cm H2O

- Sitting: 15 to 40 cm H2O

- Standing: 20 to 50 cm H2O

The detrusor pressure (Pdet) is calculated by subtracting abdominal pressure (Pabd) from vesical pressure (Pves). Pdet = Pves - Pabd

Resting detrusor pressure: between -5 and +5 cm H2O

The detrusor pressure reached during maximum urinary flow (PdetQmax) is a crucial measurement in the assessment of bladder function during pressure-flow studies.

Bladder compliance (C) is the change of bladder volume (ΔV) divided by the change in detrusor pressure (ΔPdet) during filling cystometry. C = ΔV / ΔPdet.

- Non-neurogenic bladders 
- Normal compliance: >40 ml/cm H20
- Low compliance: <30 ml/cm H2O

- Neurogenic bladders 
- Normal compliance: >30 ml/cm H2O
- Low compliance: <10 ml/cm H2O

Straining can be seen in the form of temporary increases in vesical and abdominal pressure, lasting more than 2 seconds, usually in response to anatomical or function BOO.

**Female**

Bladder capacity: 300 to 500 ml.

Flow rate:

- 14 to 45 years: 18mL/s

- 46 to 65 years: 15mL/s

Abdominal leak point pressure (ALPP)

Valsalva leak point pressure (VLPP)

- <60 cm H2O: ISD

- 60 to 90 cm H2O: equivocal

- >90 cm H2O: urethral hypermobility

Maximum urethral closure pressure (MUCP)

- <20 cm H2O: suggests ISD

Bladder outlet obstruction index for female (BOOIf): BOOIf = PdetQmax - 2.2 * Qmax

- <0: <10% probability of BOO

- >5: 50% probability of BOO

- >18: >90% probability of BOO

**Male**

Bladder capacity: 300 to 600 ml

Flow rate:

- 14 to 45 years: 21mL/s

- 46 to 65 years: 12mL/s

Qmax in men

- <10 ml/s: likely obstructed

- 10 to 15 ml/s: equivocal

- >15 ml/s: likely unobstructed

Bladder outlet obstruction index (BOOI) for male: BOOI = PdetQmax - 2 * Qmax

- <20: Unobstructed

- 20 to 40: Equivocal

- >40: Obstructed

Bladder contractility index (BCI): BCI = PdetQmax + 5 * Qmax

- >150: Strong

- 100 to 150: Normal

- <100: Weak

Bladder voiding efficiency (BVE): BE = VV / (VV+PVR) * 100%

- 100%: Normal

- <90%: indicative of DU

- >90%: indicative of BOO

# Interfering Factors

**Pressure Transmission and Quality Control**

Pressure transmission assessment is via cough signal, live signal, and baseline resting pressures.

A cough signal should show as similar peaks in amplitude in both the abdominal and vesical pressure traces. A cough should have a peak height of at least 15 cm H2O above resting pressure.

A live signal should detect small physiological fluctuations up to 10 cm H20 and should never be a constant flat trace

Initial resting pressure is the pressure recorded at the beginning of the test. Detrusor pressure should be 0 or close to 0 cm H2O at the beginning of bladder filling.

Normal ranges of vesical and abdominal pressures if appropriate calibration and quality control have been performed

- Supine: 0 to 18 cm H2O

- Seated: 15 to 40 cm H2O

- Standing: 20 to 50 cm H2O

If initial resting pressures are outside of the above plausible ranges, then quality control measures should be repeated. These measures would include zeroing transducer to atmospheric pressure, positioning transducer to level of the superior border of the symphysis pubis, and flushing the lines.

Other causes of poor signal or lack of pressure transmission include air in the line (line should be flushed), tap not open, kinking of the catheter or tubes, catheter resting on bladder wall causing inappropriate pressure transmission, or catheter displaced into the urethra. Such issues are easily rectifiable when identified.

**Position Change**

If the patient changes position, this reflects in pressure changes of equal magnitude in both vesical and abdominal pressure. This change in resting pressure is usually between 8 and 30 cm H2O. The transducer height should be adjusted to the level of the superior border of the symphysis pubis to compensate for this.

**Rectal Contractions**

Spasms or contractions of the rectum will present as low amplitude temporary pressure changes, which cause equal and opposite detrusor pressure changes.

**Rapid Filling**

If the filling is too rapid, it may give a false-positive diagnosis of loss of compliance. The filling should be according to maximum physiological rate (approximately 25% of body mass (kg) in ml/min) or a nonphysiological filling rate of 10% of the largest voided volume recorded on the bladder diary while not exceeding 50 ml/min.

**Situational Inability to Void**

The patient's ability to void is affected by emotional and psychological circumstances. Therefore an environment that replicates their normal voiding as closely as possible should be created with privacy and dignity maintained where possible

**Pump Vibrations**

Vibrations from the infusion pump can transmit and detected along a pressure monitoring tube, seen as constant frequency oscillations of small amplitude, usually <4 cm H2O, in the affected pressure line, and reflected in the detrusor pressure trace. Lines should be disentangled so as not to touch each other and prevent artifactual pressure transmission. In double lumen catheters, pressures should be recorded with the pump switched off.

**Tube Knock**

A sharp and short increase in pressure traces of one or more lines is demonstrated when moving the affected tube. Movements can lead to errors in pressure transmission. A cough test should be repeated following any movements to ensure quality control.

# Complications

Risks of invasive urodynamic testing include ****:****

- Dysuria

- Hematuria

- Urinary tract infection

- Urinary retention

- Inability to catheterize the bladder

- Failure of diagnosis

Prophylactic antibiotics reduce the risk of bacteriuria following urodynamic testing, but there is insufficient evidence to suggest it reduces rates of symptomatic urinary tract infections.

AUA/SUFU recommends antibiotic prophylaxis in the following patients undergoing urodynamic testing due to their higher risk of developing peri-procedural urinary tract infections

- Known neurogenic LUT dysfunction

- Elevated PVR

- Asymptomatic bacteriuria

- Immunosuppression

- Age over 70

- Patients with an indwelling catheter or external urinary collection device

- Patients who perform intermittent catheterization

# Patient Safety and Education

Prior to invasive urodynamic testing, patients should receive clear and concise written information to enable understanding and cooperation. It should be made clear to patients before testing that urodynamics is a diagnostic procedure, that there is a possibility of failure to progress diagnosis, and that it is not a therapeutic procedure.

Urodynamics are generally well tolerated by patients. Embarrassment can be a significant cause of apprehension. Efforts should, therefore, focus on creating a relaxed atmosphere through informed and effective communication.

The only absolute contraindication for urodynamics is the presence of a urinary tract infection. In such cases, urodynamics should be postponed until this is treated.

Relative contraindications for urodynamics include patient inability to comply with instructions or communicate sensations, inability to catheterize bladder, medications for bladder dysfunction (which can be stopped 48 hours before testing), indwelling catheter, and autonomic dysreflexia.

Autonomic dysreflexia (AD) is a potentially life-threatening condition that arises in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI), particularly in those with an injury above the level of T6.

Patients most commonly describing headache, discomfort, nausea, anxiety, blurred vision, and pain.

# Clinical Significance

Cochrane review demonstrated that urodynamics affects clinical decision making in women, but there is a lack of similar fitting trials for men and children.

Invasive urodynamics in men allows for BOO to be distinguished from DU and can identify DO as a cause of storage dysfunction.

Diagnosis of low compliance neurogenic and non-neurogenic bladders identifies the risk of irreversible damage to upper urinary tracts and guides subsequent intervention.
