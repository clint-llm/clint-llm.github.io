Acute transplant rejection occurs days to months after a transplant when the immune system identifies a grafted organ as foreign and attacks it. Acute transplant rejection is common and the prognosis is guarded. However, early diagnosis of acute transplant rejection and heightened monitoring may make graft preservation feasible. This activity reviews the etiology, pathophysiology, presentation, and management of acute transplant rejections, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the signs and symptoms of acute transplant rejection.
- Explain how the diagnosis of acute transplant rejection is confirmed.
- Explain treatment considerations for patients with acute transplant rejection.
- Describe the roles of various interprofessional team members in caring for patients with acute transplant rejection and improving chances for survival and recovery.
