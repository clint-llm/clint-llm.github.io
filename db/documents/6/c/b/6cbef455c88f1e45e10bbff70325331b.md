Polyhydramnios is a pathologic excess of amniotic fluid volume (AFV) in pregnancy.

Polyhydramnios is caused by a disruption of the AFV equilibrium, which under normal circumstances balances fluid production and absorption.

Antepartum evaluation and fetal surveillance are indicated in severe polyhydramnios to identify the underlying cause, direct care, and time the delivery.Â Reductive amniocentesis and indomethacin are indicated only for severe cases of polyhydramnios.
