Contraindications to surfactant administration include congenital anomalies incompatible with life, perfusion failure states, diffuse pulmonary hemorrhagic conditions, and a diagnosis of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Contraindications also include neonates with respiratory difficulty, but laboratory evidence suggests lung maturity has already occurred. Usage of surfactant appears to result in a deterioration in newborns with pulmonary hypoplasia, although more clinical trials-based evidence is needed.
