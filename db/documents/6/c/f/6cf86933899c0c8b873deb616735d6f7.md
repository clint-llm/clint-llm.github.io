The transconjunctival lower lid blepharoplasty approach is best suited for the patient with steatoblepharon with minimal to moderate lower eyelid laxity. Fat repositioning can also address a prominent tear trough deformity. While modern-day periorbital rejuvenation principles emphasize orbital fat preservation during blepharoplasty (with either fat repositioning or augmentation); nevertheless, fat resection may be suitable for patients with steatoblepharon and no tear trough deformity.

Other indications for a transconjunctival approach include patients with a history of hypertrophic scarring, history of blepharoplasty, or a pre-existing pseudoproptosis (at risk for lower eyelid retraction and further scleral show).
