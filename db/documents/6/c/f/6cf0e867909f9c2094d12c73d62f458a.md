The incidence of complications from gastroparesis could vary according to underlying etiology. Longstanding patients of gastroparesis will most likely suffer from the following complications.

- Severe protein-calorie malnourishment

- Bezoars

- Mallory Weiss tears from retching and vomiting

- Procedure-related complications

- Narcotic dependence and social stigma

- Recurrent hospitalizations

- Significant healthcare burden

Bezoar - a solid mass of indigestible material that accumulates in the stomach, eventually mechanical obstruction. Bezoars can cause loss of appetite, weight loss, and a feeling of fullness. They can also lead to gastric ulcers, GI bleeding, and bowel obstruction. Usually diagnosed by endoscopy and large bezoars often require surgical intervention.
