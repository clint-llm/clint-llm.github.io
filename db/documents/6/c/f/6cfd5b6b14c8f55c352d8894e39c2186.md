The pathophysiology of CMV endotheliitis has yet to be fully elucidated. Suzuki and Ohashi have hypothesized that corneal endotheliitis is likely an anterior chamber-associated immune deviation (ACAID)-related disease. Latent CMV infection in the trabecular meshwork and the ciliary body becomes intermittently reactivated, and a small amount of virus may be released into the anterior chamber. Repeated releasing of the virus promotes ACAID against viral antigens. With the suppression of cell-mediated immunity, the virus can proliferate in the corneal endothelium. This theory is supported by a study of inducing ACAID against HSV in a rabbit model of herpetic corneal endotheliitis.
