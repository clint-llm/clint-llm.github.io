**Nerves Related to the Thyroid Gland**

The thyroid gland is close to two crucial nerves: the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve and the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Both are branches of the vagus nerve. During thyroidectomy, damage to these nerves leads to disability in phonation and/or difficulty in breathing. Injury to one of the branches of the superior laryngeal nerve leads to great difficulty in singing. Injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve unilaterally may lead to hoarseness of the voice and difficulty in breathing. Bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve injury is serious and often necessitates a tracheostomy.

The thyroid gland is entirely covered by two capsules- true and false. The thyroid gland consists of deep capillary plexus deeper to the true capsule. This physical arrangement makes it crucial to remove the plexus with capsule during thyroidectomy.
