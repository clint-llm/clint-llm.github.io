While in the clinic, dermoscopy allows visualization of Wickham striae in most cases. A network of white lines with red globules along the periphery is the classic finding.

Oral LP lesions located near dental restorations should prompt patch testing to determine if an allergy to one of the associated metals exists.

Biopsy with the microscopic analysis is the most useful tool to confirm the presence of LP. Lesions have many characteristics as noted previously that typically allow a definitive diagnosis. Adding direct immunofluorescence to histology can be helpful when trying to differentiate between LP and lupus erythematosus (LE).
