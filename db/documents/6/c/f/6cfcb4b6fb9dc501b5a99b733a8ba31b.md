Hypnic headaches are a primary headache disorder that presents in the elderly population and usually wakes people up from sleep. It is not very common, but because it could be misdiagnosed with giant cell arteritis, small and medium intracranial vasculitis, and other conditions, it is a critical disorder to be comfortable with its presentation. To avoid the misdiagnosis of hypnic headache, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of hypnic headache and highlights the interprofessional team's role in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with hypnic headache.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation of hypnic headaches.
- Review the management options available for hypnic headache and what are the first-line options.
- Summarize the importance of knowing the updated criteria for the diagnosis of hypnic headache and improving care coordination and collaboration amongst the interprofessional team, which include the emergency department physician, primary care, or neurologist, to enhance the delivery of care and improve outcomes for patients affected by hypnic headache.
