The skin is the body's largest organ and serves pertinent functions such as maintaining a physical barrier, thermoregulation, and participating in the regulation of water loss **. Damage to the skin barrier initiates a complex healing process through the interactions of many cell types within various microenvironments (advances in wound mngt, sorg). The process begins with the inflammatory phase, which involves the coagulation cascade and is followed by the migration of neutrophils. The presence of macrophages prompts the proliferative phase Wounds can be present over different anatomical parts of the body. However, the basic principles of choosing a wound dressing remain the same. Choosing the correct dressing will lessen the time of healing, provide cost-effective care, and improve the patientâ€™s quality of life. This activity addresses materials, techniques, cost, ease of application, and health professional preference. This activity also reviews the evaluation and treatment using various wound dressings and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in wound care.

**Objectives:**
- Review the irrigation requirements of a contaminated wound.
- Describe the dressing options for wound management.
- Summarize wound treatment options.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients requiring wound care and appropriate management techniques that can be employed.
