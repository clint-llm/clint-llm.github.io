The WHO has provided normal limits of reference for semen analysis. The values mentioned in the chart below represent the accepted 5th percentile for the parameters measured.

- Volume =  >1.5 ml

- pH = >7.2

- Total sperm number = 39 million sperm per ejaculate or more

- Morphology = >4 percent normal forms using the tygerberg method

- Vitality = >58% live sperm

- Progressive motility = >32%

- Total (progressive motility and non-progressive motility) = >40%

- No sperm agglutination

- Viscosity = <2 cm after liquefaction

- Optional investigations 

- Mixed antiglobulin reaction test with <50% motile spermatozoa with bound particles 
- Immunobead test with <50% motile spermatozoa with bound beads
- Seminal fructose =>13 mcmol/ejaculate
- Seminal zinc = >2.4 mcmol/ejaculate
- Seminal neutral glucosidase = <20 milliunits /ejaculate
