Patients with CCh are often misdiagnosed; hence coordination between the optician, ophthalmic nurses, ophthalmologist, and surgeon is critical for prompt diagnosis and management. CCh can be associated with ocular surface diseases, which should be treated before any surgical intervention. Effective treatment involves surgical reconstruction of the tear meniscus as well as the reservoir.
