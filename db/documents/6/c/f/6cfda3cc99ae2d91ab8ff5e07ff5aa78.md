Many splenic lesions have overlapping imaging features, making patient history, physical exam, and laboratory values helpful in narrowing the differential diagnosis. CT is a major imaging modality for evaluating splenic pathology. Splenic trauma is a unique scenario where CT is essential in diagnosis, and management requires close communication between the emergency department clinician, surgeon, radiologist, and interventionalist.Â More often, splenic abnormalities are noted incidentally on CT performed for another indication. The clinician's knowledge of normal and abnormal findings will prevent unnecessary intervention or work-up for incidental or benign lesions. Systemic disorders that involve the spleen are often more clinically significant than solitary splenic lesions.
