Tinea capitis, also known as ringworm or herpes tonsurans infection, is a fungal infection of the scalp hair. It is caused primarily by the dermatophyte species Microsporum and Trichophyton. The fungi can penetrate the hair follicle's outer root sheath and ultimately may invade the hair shaft. Clinically, tinea capitis can be divided into inflammatory and non-inflammatory types. The non-inflammatory type usually will not be complicated by scarring alopecia. The inflammatory type may result in a kerion, a painful nodule with pus, and scarring alopecia. Tinea capitis occurs primarily in children between 3 and 14 years of age, but it might affect any age group. It may also involve the eyelashes and eyebrows. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of tinea capitis and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the typical presentation of tinea capitis. 
- Outline the complications of tinea capitis.
- Review the management of tinea capitis.
- Describe the importance of enhancing care coordination among the interprofessional team to ensure proper evaluation and management of tinea capitis.
