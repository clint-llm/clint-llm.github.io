When evaluating a patient in whom there is a suspicion for flea bites, the provider should inquire about living conditions, recent exposures, and similar symptoms in co-habitants. The physical exam should include a thorough skin examination with particular attention to exposed areas such as the arms, legs, upper back, and scalp. Additionally, the exam should pursue details regarding any rashes including duration, edema, erythema, and pruritus. Evaluation for local areas of infection, while a rare presentation, should be performed as with all skin-breaks.
