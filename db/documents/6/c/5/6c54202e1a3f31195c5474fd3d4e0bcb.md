The definition of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. GDM can classify as A1GDM and A2GDM. The classification of gestational diabetes managed without medication and responsive to nutritional therapy is as diet-controlled gestational diabetes (GDM) or A1GDM. Conversely, gestational diabetes managed with medication to achieve adequate glycemic control classifies as A2GDM. Gestational diabetes is a disease developed during the second and third trimester of pregnancy, characterized by a marked insulin resistance secondary to placental hormonal release. This activity highlights the etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, treatment, complications, and prognosis for members of the interprofessional team that manage patients with gestational diabetes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of gestational diabetes.
- Review the evaluation of gestational diabetes.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for gestational diabetes.
- Summarize the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance gestational diabetes and improve outcomes.
