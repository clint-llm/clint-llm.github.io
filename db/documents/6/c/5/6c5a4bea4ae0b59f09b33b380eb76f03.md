In preparation for minimally invasive mitral valve surgery, a patient must undergo a full workup with diagnostic workup and therapeutic medical management by a cardiologist. The workup typically includes an echocardiogram to visualize the structures of the heart from a transthoracic approach or transesophageal approach as needed to understand the anatomy of the mitral valve. Further workup includes optimal management of other comorbidities. General anesthesia is required for minimally invasive surgery as well as the percutaneous edge-to-edge mitral valve repair. Patients will need clearance from their cardiologist before the mitral valve procedure.

For a surgical mitral valve repair, the patient would meet with the cardiothoracic surgeon and anesthesiologist before the procedure and prepared for the operating room. Patients planned forÂ percutaneous edge-to-edge mitral valve repair would meet with an interventional cardiologist and anesthesiologist for preparation for a hybrid operating room.
