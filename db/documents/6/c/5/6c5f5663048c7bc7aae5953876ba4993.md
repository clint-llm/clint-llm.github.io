A transconjunctival lower lid blepharoplasty aims to restore a more youthful and rested appearance to the periorbita with removal or relocation of pseudoherniated fat. When performing a transconjunctival blepharoplasty, proper patient evaluation, and development of a thorough, anatomic-based treatment plan can produce safe, reliable, and satisfactory outcomes.
