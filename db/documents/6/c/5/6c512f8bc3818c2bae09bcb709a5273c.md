Physeal complications occur in 2 to 14% of patients after growth plate injury.  Growth arrest is relatively rare.  Certain areas in the body that sustain growth plate injuries do appear to have a higher incidence of premature growth plate closure, such as the distal tibia, with an incidence of close to 27.2%.  There is a higher risk of physeal bar formation if there is periosteal interposition within the fracture.  Physeal bar formation can cause complete growth arrest as well as partial arrest, which can result in angular growth.  MRI or CT can be useful to assess for physeal bar formation.

Partial physeal arrest can be described by the Peterson classification:

- Type A:  Peripheral

- Type B:  Central bar that crosses entire physis (anterior to posterior) with healthy physis on the sides

- Type C:  Central surrounded by healthy physis

An important way to prevent physeal arrest is to limit the number of reduction attempts that occur. One reduction attempt increases the risk of arrest to 11%; two attempts increases the risk to 24%.

After physeal injury, harris growth arrest lines may form and can be used to assess subsequent growth.  If the line appears transverse and parallel to the physis, then the growth plate is continuing to grow evenly.  If there is an asymmetry in the harris growth arrest line, this may indicate asymmetrical growth after injury.

Other complications that can occur include infection, non-union, malunion, infection, neurovascular injury, and osteonecrosis.
