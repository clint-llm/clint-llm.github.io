Since Treponemal pallidum cannot be grown in a culture medium, serology and CSF examination are the mainstays for diagnosis. VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) and RPR (rapid plasma reagin) tests are nontreponemal tests used for screening for syphilis.Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay), and EIAs (enzyme immunoassays) tests are the treponemal tests which are often far more reactive than VDRL in symptomatic patients; nonreactive results help to exclude asymptomatic cases. If a patient has a positive serology for syphilis and neurologic signs and symptoms suggesting neurosyphilis, then a lumbar puncture is indicated to evaluate for neurosyphilis. Diagnosis of asymptomatic neurosyphilis is difficult, especially in HIV-infected patients. Recent studies demonstrated the role of CXCL13 in the diagnosis of asymptomatic patients so as to differentiate between symptomatic patients with asymptomatic HIV-infected patients. The value of CXCL 13 increases in HIV-infected patients accompanied by tabes dorsalis.

A rapid plasma reagin test is ordered to help distinguish between acute or chronic infection. A Treponema pallidum particle agglutination test is ordered to distinguish between syphilis infection and a false-positive screening test. If the VDRL or RPR is nonreactive and the treponema test reactive, one of the following is the cause: very early syphilis, treated syphilis, or late untreated syphilis.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in tabes dorsalis are infrequently noted. Swelling and high signal intensity in the affected segment of the spinal cord with associated gadolinium enhancement (flip-flop sign) and peripheral band-like enhancement (candle guttering appearance, most common finding) on MRI suggest focal inflammation of the spinal cord.

It is important to emphasize that tabes dorsalis is essentially a clinical diagnosis in many instances since, although the CSF profile (white cells, protein, VDRL, treponemal test) is usually abnormal, it can be normal.
