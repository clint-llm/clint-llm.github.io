Granuloma faciale (GF) is a rare, benign, inflammatory skin disease, usually presenting as isolated, well-defined reddish-brown to violaceous asymptomatic papules, nodules or plaques showing follicular accentuation and telangiectasia. Granuloma faciale is most commonly seen in middle-aged white males between their second and seventh decades of life, although it has also been reported in childhood. It usually appears as a single lesion on the face, but can also present with multiple lesions on the face or elsewhere. Extrafacial GF locations may include the scalp, trunk, nasal cavity or extremities. The facial lesions most commonly present on the forehead, nose, or cheeks. This activity reviews the evaluation of a patient with granuloma faciale and the role of the interprofessional team in the management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the presentation of granuloma faciale.
- Explain when granuloma faciale should be considered on differential diagnosis.
- Outline the treatment of granuloma faciale.
- Explore modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to optimize outcomes for patients affected by granuloma faciale.
