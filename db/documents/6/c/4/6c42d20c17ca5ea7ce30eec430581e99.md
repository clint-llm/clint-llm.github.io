The severity of the disease is classified as follows:

- Provoked: Due to acquired states (surgery, oral contraceptives, trauma, immobility, obesity, cancer)

- Unprovoked: Due to idiopathic or endogenous reasons; more likely to suffer recurrence if anticoagulation is discontinued

- Proximal: Above the knee, affecting the femoral or iliofemoral veins; much more likely to lead to complications such as pulmonary emboli

- Distal: Below the knee
