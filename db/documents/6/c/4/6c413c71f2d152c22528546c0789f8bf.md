Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) is often a normal variant and seen in individuals with a high vagal tone without evidence of structural heart disease. However, this rhythm can result from inferior myocardial ischemia, medication toxicity (AV nodal blocking agents), hyperkalemia, cardiomyopathy (Lyme disease), or following cardiac surgery.

Common drugs that are known to cause AV block include beta-blockers, digoxin, calcium channel blockers, and many antiarrhythmic agents. Recently the immunosuppressant agent,Â fingolimod, used to treat relapsing multiple sclerosis was also found to cause AV block.

Mobitz type II is rarely seen in patients without structural heart disease. It is often associated with myocardial ischemia and fibrosis or sclerosis of the myocardium. This rhythm often progresses to third-degree atrioventricular block.

Other causes of AV block include the following:

- Infiltrative heart disease- amyloidosis, hemochromatosis

- Acute rheumatic fever

- Malignancies- lymphoma

- Hyperthyroidism, myxedema

- Collagen vascular disorders

- Cardiac tumors

- Following transcatheter placement of valves

- Ethanol injection for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

Genes

In some patients, the AV conduction block may have a genetic trait. Several mutations in the SCN5A gene have been linked to familial AV conduction block.
