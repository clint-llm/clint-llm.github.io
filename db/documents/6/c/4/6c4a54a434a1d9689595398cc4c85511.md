Pharyngeal narrowing and closureÂ during sleep is a complex phenomenon, and likely multiple factors play a role in the pathogenesis. Sleep-related reduced ventilatory drive and neuromuscular combined with anatomic risk factors are likely to play a significant role in upper airway obstruction during sleep.

**Anatomic Factors**

- Micrognathia, retrognathia

- Facial elongation

- Mandibular hypoplasia

- Adenoid and tonsillar hypertrophy

- Inferior displacement of the hyoid

**Nonanatomic Risk Factors**

- Central fat distribution

- Obesity

- Advanced age

- Male gender

- Supine sleeping position

- Pregnancy

**Additional Factors**

- Alcohol use

- Smoking

- Use of sedatives and hypnotics

**Associated Medical Disorders**

- Endocrine disorders (e.g., diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, acromegaly, and hypothyroidism)

- Neurological disorders (e.g., stroke, spinal cord injury, and myasthenia gravis)

- Prader Willi syndrome

- Down Syndrome

- Congestive heart failure

- Atrial fibrillation

- Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS)

These relationships between OSA and various medical disorders are based mainly on observational studies and not necessarily randomized clinical trials.
