The "diamond concept” was introduced by Giannoudis et al., aiming to describe what is needed to achieve adequate fracture healing.osteogenic cells, osteoconductive scaffolds, and growth factors, and a fourth factor known as mechanical stabilization. If one or more of these factors are altered, adequate fracture healing will be threatened.
