In the United States, the number of sepsis cases appears to be increasing over the last 30 to 40 years, but the overall mortality of patients from sepsis has declined. It is estimated that the mortality rate from urosepsis is 30% to 40%. The severity of the disease also appears to be increasing and is typically associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC).
