Implicit bias is the attitude or internalized stereotypes that unconsciously affect our perceptions, actions, and decisions. These unconscious biases often affect behavior that leads to unequal treatment of people based on race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, health status, and other characteristics. In medicine, unconscious bias-based discriminatory practices negatively impact patient care and medical training programs, hinder effective communication, limit workforce diversity, lead to inequitable distribution of research funding, impede career advancement, and result in carriers and disparities in the access to and delivery of healthcare services. This activity will address strategies to reduce the harm of implicit bias, clinician self-awareness and self-assessment of personal biases, and the role of the interprofessional team in increasing awareness and reducing bias-based discriminatory behavior.

**Objectives:**
- Recognize how implicit bias affects the perceptions and treatment decisions of clinicians leading to disparities in healthcare delivery and health outcomes.
- Identify stigmatized groups and strategies to eliminate discriminatory behavior in healthcare delivery for these groups.
- Describe strategies to increase awareness of personal unconscious biases in daily interactions and change behavior accordingly.
- Discuss how interdisciplinary teams can reduce the harmful effects of implicit bias in medicine.
