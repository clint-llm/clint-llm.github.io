Most commonly the ophthalmic artery originates from the internal carotid artery. However, in 2 to 3% of individuals, the ophthalmic artery has a different origin. It has been found to arise from the anterior cerebral artery, middle cerebral artery, posterior communicating artery, or the middle meningeal artery.

The most common variant is that of the ophthalmic artery originating from the middle meningeal artery.
