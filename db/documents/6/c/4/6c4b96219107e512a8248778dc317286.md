An increase in pain intensity a few days after a tooth extraction is the key feature. The absence of a blood clot and moderate to severe pain is pathognomonic of alveolar osteitis, and additional laboratory and radiographic studies are not required. As alveolar osteitis is not an infection but a delayed healing process, no leukocytosis would be expected.

Post-operative imaging, such as a panoramic radiograph, could rule out remaining tooth fragments or bony sequestra. Markers of fibrinolysis have been investigated for risk prediction in cardiovascular disease but are not helpful in a clinical setting with AO.
