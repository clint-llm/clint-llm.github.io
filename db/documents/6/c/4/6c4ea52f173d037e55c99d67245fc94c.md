The cells which form the tongue are hybrid in nature. The connective tissue component, as well as vasculature of the tongue, is derived from cranial neural crest cells (CNCC). These cells initiate the formation of the tongue bud and the interstitial connective tissue. The myoblasts which are responsible for the formation of the muscle components of the tongue derive from the occipital somite. Cells from this somite migrate into the primordium of the tongue, thus, forming the muscle cells in the tongue.
