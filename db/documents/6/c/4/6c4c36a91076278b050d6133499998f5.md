While the middle meningeal artery primarily is derived as a branch from the maxillary artery and then passes through the foramen spinosum into the middle cranial fossa, rare anatomical variations have been observed. It is important to be aware of the possible variations of the middle meningeal artery, to reduce the risk of thromboembolism during the operative treatment of a lesion in the area. In cases where the foramen spinosum has been absent, the middle meningeal artery enters the cranial fossa through the foramen ovale alongside the mandibular nerve. The middle meningeal artery may also originate from the lateral aspect of the internal carotid artery. In this case, it will travel in the carotid canal, along with the internal carotid artery, and enter the skull through the foramen lacerum where it will then take a normal path and divide into anterior and posterior branches. The middle meningeal artery has also rarely originated from the posterior cerebellar artery, basilar artery, ascending pharyngeal artery, or ophthalmic artery.
