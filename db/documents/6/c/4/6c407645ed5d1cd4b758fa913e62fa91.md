Chronic myeloid leukemia: It comprises 0.5% of all new cancer cases in the United States. As per recent SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) national cancer database from the US, CML is commonly diagnosed in older age groups, ranging from 65 to 74 years, and the median age of diagnosis is 65 years. It is more common in males, with an incidence rate of about 2.4 new cases per 100,000 versus 1.4 new cases per 100,000 in females. About 67.6% of patients have a 5-year survival rate, and the median age of death is about 77 years.

Polycythemia vera: The median age of diagnosis of PV is 60 years. It is more prevalent in males as compared to females, with a male to female ratio of 1.8: 1. The estimated incidence of PV ranges from 0.4 to 2.8 per 100,000 per year.

Essential thrombocythemia: The median age for diagnosis of ET is 60 years. It is more common in females, with a male to female ratio of 1:2. The estimated incidence of ET ranges from 1 to 2.5/100,000/year, and incidence increases with increasing age.

Primary myelofibrosis:  The median age at the diagnosis is 67 years. The incidence rate varies from 0.8 to 2.1/100,000/year.

Other MPNs such as CNL, CEL, and unclassified MPN are rare; exact incidence and prevalence are not known due to the rarity of the disorders.
