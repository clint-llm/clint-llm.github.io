Inborn errors disrupt carbohydrate metabolism, protein metabolism, fatty acid oxidation, or glycogen storage. In the body, dietary substances are broken into glucose (the primary energy source of the body) and other metabolic products that are eventually excreted. Glucose that is ingested but is more than what is needed is stored as glycogen in the liver and muscles for use in times of fasting. When the body needs glucose, it utilizes glycogen stores. When these stores are depleted, the body will make new glucose from amino acids (gluconeogenesis) and then, finally, will use fatty acid oxidation to create a substrate for the Kreb's cycle.

Although there are detailed entries in StatPearls for specific inborn errors of metabolism, it is helpful to understand these diseases as a whole. Diseases that result in errors of metabolizing and breaking down food will often cause hypoglycemia. Diseases that interfere with excretion of metabolites will cause intoxication (i.e., hyperammonemia). DiseasesÂ that interfere with fatty acid oxidation result in hypoglycemia and acidosis. Glycogen storage disorders do not generally present acutely, and will not be discussed here.
