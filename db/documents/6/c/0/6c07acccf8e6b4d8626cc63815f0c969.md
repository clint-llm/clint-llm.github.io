Diagnostic flow cytometry is considered the gold standard test for PNH diagnosis. It utilizes various monoclonal antibodies, and special reagent called fluorescent aerolysin reagent (FLAER) that binds directly to glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored protein, specifically their glycan portion. This test is capable of evaluating a variety of GPI-anchored proteins, most notably as CD55 and CD59, with high sensitivity and specificity.

Aerolysin is the principal virulence factor found in Aeromonas hydrophila. Its inert form is secreted as proaerolysin, which selectively binds to GPI anchor protein with high affinity.

There are two types of flow cytometry tests available: low sensitivity and high sensitivity. Although low sensitivity flow cytometry tests are adequate for the diagnosis of PNH, a high sensitivity test is better at picking up PNH with another bone marrow disorder. Based on the clinical picture and laboratory test results, PNH can be categorized into three types. 1. Classic PNH. 2. PNH with another bone marrow (BM) disorder 3. Subclinical PNH. In PNH with BM disorders, there is evidence of hemolysis as well as primary bone marrow disorder. The most common BM disorders that occur with PNH include aplastic anemia (AA), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). In Subclinical PNH, there is no clinical or laboratory evidence of hemolysis. It is crucial to reassess patients at 6 to 12 months interval for the size of the PNH clone to keep an eye on disease evolution. Similarly, if there is a significant change in clinical condition or laboratory exams, patients should be reassessed.

Even though these are not diagnostic tests per se, there is valuable information to be gained by ordering lab work such as complete blood count with differential (CBC w/ diff), basic metabolic panel (BMP), and urinalysis (UA). As mentioned above, recurrent episodes of intravascular hemolysis and cytopenias, and hemoglobinuria or hemosiderosis can be seen in PNH. Thus markedly increased LDH, low haptoglobin, and unconjugated bilirubinemia would be seen due to intravascular hemolysis. On a CBC w/ diff, reticulocyte count will be increased as a compensatory response. Evidence of anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia will be seen. Evidence of renal dysfunction with an increase in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) as well as electrolyte abnormalities seen in chronic kidney disease (CKD) can be expected in a BMP. Urinalysis can show evidence of hemoglobinuria and hemosiderosis. Hence, clues from routine CBC w/ diff, BMP, and UA are a further indication for ordering a more specific diagnostic test for PNH, such as flow cytometry.

Generally, when flow cytometry testing shows granulocyte clone of greater than 20%, patients should undergo a thorough assessment of hemolysis, silent thrombosis, and end-organ damage. In this case, the additional test such as D-dimer, brain natriuretic peptide, liver function panel, iron panel, bone marrow aspirate or biopsy, and cytogenetics are helpful. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy aids in the setting of another bone marrow abnormality to further characterize PNH.

Imaging also plays an important role. Echocardiography can help assess pulmonary hypertension. Doppler abdominal ultrasound can be helpful to assess hepatic blood flow or identify any thrombosis. If there is a concern for silent pulmonary embolism, then computerized tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is useful. Computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen can be helpful is the suspected cases of Budd Chiari syndrome. MRI of the head can be helpful if there is a concern for central nervous system thrombosis.
