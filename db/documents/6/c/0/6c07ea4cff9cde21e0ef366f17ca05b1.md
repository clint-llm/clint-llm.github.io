Skin infection spreads through a break in the skin, directly invading the lymphatic system and causing erysipelas. Insect bites, stasis ulceration, surgical incisions, and venous insufficiency have been reported as portals of entry to the skin. Some risk factors that predispose people to develop erysipelas are obesity, lymphedema, athleteâ€™s foot, leg ulcers, eczema, intravenous drug abuse, poorly controlled diabetes, and liver disease. Recurrent erysipelas has also been reported, with the infection typically reoccurring in the same site.
