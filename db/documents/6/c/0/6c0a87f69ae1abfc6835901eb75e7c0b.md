Dental caries is a highly prevalent disease, especially among young children.

Stainless steel crowns are the most commonly used restorative option for repairing and preserving the remaining tissue of severely damaged and decayed teeth. They were introduced into pediatric dentistry in 1947, first described by Engel, and then popularised by Humphrey in 1950. Stainless steel crowns have outperformed other materials, such as amalgam and composite, in terms of durability and longevity for more than a half-century. In fact, no restorative material has provided the benefits of low cost, reliability, and durability when interim full-coronal coverage is required.

Scientific evidence favors stainless steel crowns as restoration of choice in young children with high caries risk.
