**Skin**

**Epidermis**

- Seborrheic keratosis (SK) shows proliferation of basaloid cells with keratin-filled cystic inclusions and variable hyperkeratosis. The papillomatous variant of SK has more hyperkeratosis. The adenoid variant has less hyperkeratosis and contains more elongated epithelial strands. The lesion is histologically located above the skin surface. Irritation of the lesion can cause chronic inflammation of the dermis.

- Dermatosis papulosa nigra (DPN) displays an irregular thickened layer of squamous epidermal cells (acanthosis) and the elevation of dermal papillae above the skin (papillomatosis), and hyperkeratosis of the epidermis.

- Inverted follicular keratosis is considered an inflamed variant of SK by some experts. It is a subdermal lesion and displays prominent squamous eddies as well as papillomatosis and acanthosis.

- Verruca vulgaris lesions are typified by a large amount of papillomatosis, acanthosis with hyperkeratosis that demonstrates apical parakeratosis. Infected cells within the lesion demonstrate contraction of the nucleus and cytoplasmic clearing (koilocytosis). A mixed inflammatory infiltrate is often present in the dermis.

- Molluscum contagiosum has pear-shaped lobules of invasive acanthosis within the epidermis. There is a central cavity filled with sloughed-off epithelial cells that contain characteristic virus-containing inclusion bodies within the cytoplasm (molluscum bodies).

- Squamous papilloma (acrochordon or skin tag) consists of a papillomatous structure with a fibrovascular center. It contains squamous epithelium with variable degrees of acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, and sometimes parakeratosis. Inflammation may be present.

- Epidermal inclusion cyst. Cystic structure in the dermis lined with stratified keratinized squamous epithelium with the cyst lumen filled with desquamated keratin.

- Cutaneous dermoid cyst. The same as epidermal inclusion cyst except for the presence of dermal adnexal structures in the cyst wall and adnexal structures and secretions in the cyst lumen.

- Keratoacanthoma is distinguished by thickened epidermis in the shape of a cup surrounding a central plug of keratin. The epidermis will contain squamous epithelium often infiltrated with neutrophils.

- A cutaneous horn is associated with several benign and malignant lesions and is a descriptive term for any lesion that has massive hyperkeratosis. The histopathologic analysis focuses on the tissue at the base of the cutaneous horn.

**Melanocytic**

- Ephelis (freckles) display hyperpigmentation of the basal cells of the epidermis. There is no elongation of the rete ridges.

- Lentigo simplex lesions display an increase in the number of nevus cells (melanocytes) as well elongation of the rete ridges and the presence of melanophages in the upper dermis.

- Solar lentigo lesions also display an increase in the number of nevus cells as well elongation of the rete ridges. In addition, the rete ridges assume a club shape and are more tortuous.

- Nevi
- Congenital nevi contain nevus cells in the deep dermis as well as around blood vessels and hair follicles
- Split nevus (also known as a "kissing nevus") has the histopathology of a compound nevus.
- Oculodermal melanocytosis (ODM, nevus of Ota) displays dendritic and plump polyhedral nevus cells in the deeper dermis layer.
- A giant hairy pigmented nevus contains Nevis cells in the deeper two-thirds of the dermis, including around the adnexal structures. Collagen is present as well.
- Mongolian spot nevus displays a similar distribution and type of nevus cell as ODM.
- Blue nevus is different in that dendritic nevus cells are deeper in the dermis.


- Acquired
- A Spitz nevus has the histopathology of a compound nevus with mitotic figures. Spitz nevi contain more epithelioid nevus cells.
- A Reed nevus is like a Spitz nevus with more spindle-shaped nevus cells.
- Melanocytic nevus. A nevus contains nevus cells in the dermis and/or the dermo-epithelial junction. Nevus cells are a variant of melanocytes; they are larger, without dendrites, and have more cytoplasm containing larger granules.

- Junctional: nevus cells are located in the dermo-epithelial junction of the skin.
- Intradermal: nevus cells are located in the dermis.
- Compound: nevus cells are located in both the dermis and the dermo-epithelial junction.
- Dysplastic:  four features, intraepidermal lentiginous hyperplasia, cytological atypia of nevus cells, lamellar and concentric fibroplasia, and architectural atypia, are present in dysplastic nevi. Atypical nevus cells may form "irregular nests" within the epidermis above the basement membrane in pockets called "shoulders" that push into the dermis. These nests can be joined with bridges to "nests" in adjacent "shoulders." Any disruption of the epidermal basement membrane by atypical nevus cells is a sign of malignant melanoma.

**Adnexal Lesions**

- External and internal hordeola present as an abscess containing polymorphonuclear leukocytes and necrotic tissue in the Zeis and meibomian glands, respectively.

**Hair Follicles**

- Trichoepithelioma reveals differentiation of the germinative cell portion of the follicle. It contains abortive hair papillae, branching nests of basaloid cells, and horn cysts. They are considered hamartomatous lesions. These lesions may have histopathological overlap with BCC.

- Trichofolliculoma reveals mesenchymal differentiation of the hair follicle. It presents as a central dilated cystic hair follicle lined with stratified squamous and epithelial strands and buds showing different stages of pilar formation protruding from the wall of the lesion. It usually contains several hair shafts.

- Trichilemmoma reveals differentiation of the infundibulum part of the follicle. It presents with lobules of squamous epithelial cells along with palisading cells in the periphery. The lesion often contains hair follicles.

- Pilomatrixoma reveals matrical differentiation of the follicle.

**Sweat Glands**

- Apocrine hidrocystoma (cyst of Moll):  Presents with one or more cystic spaces surrounded by an inner layer of columnar epithelial cells and an outer layer of myoepithelial cells. Fluid in the cyst is clear or milky.

- Eccrine hidrocystoma: Presents with one cystic space surrounded by two layers of cuboidal epithelial cells (no myoepithelial cells are present).

- Trichilemmal (pilar) cyst: Presents with a cystic space lined with epithelium with basophilic palisading nuclei that contain keratin and may contain calcifications.

- Syringoma is composed of small ductal elements lined with two layers of epithelial cells (no myoepithelial cells) inside dense fibrous tissue.

- Pleomorphic adenoma contains epithelial cells arranged in nests and bands that may contain apocrine, eccrine, or mixed glandular components. In the eyelids, the epithelial cells rest in a myxoid matrix.

- Eccrine spiradenoma contains one or more nodules filled with central cells with vesicular, large, and pale nuclei surrounded by small basaloid cells with hyperchromatic nuclei.

Accessory lacrimal glands are located at the conjunctival fornix (glands of Krausse), the distal edge of the tarsal plate (glands of Wolffring), and within the caruncle (glands of Popov)

- Pleomorphic adenoma presents with a lobular lesion containing a myxoid stroma with cords of epithelial cells and small areas of cartilaginous differentiation.

- In one study of 15 excised oncocytomas, three different histological types were identified with the lesion containing (1)  tubules with dilated lumens filled with mucin and lined by tall columnar epithelium, (2) cysts with epithelial projections of the cyst wall, (3) a trabecular pattern of cuboidal or polygonal cells combined with tubules and cysts.

**Sebaceous Glands**

- Chalazion originates in the meibomian gland or gland of Zeis and presents as a mass of granulation tissue and inflammatory cells, including lymphocytes and lipid-laden macrophages surrounding clear spaces.

- A sebaceous cyst (steatocystoma) and cyst of Zeis has a squamous stratified jagged lining with sebaceous glands lining and connecting to the cyst lumen.

- Sebaceous gland hyperplasia presents as an umbilicated lesion containing sebaceous glands that are larger than normal.

- Sebaceous gland adenoma presents similarly to sebaceous gland hyperplasia except that dense layers of blue basaloid cells surround the glands. Cystic spaces and more immature sebocytes are also present compared to sebaceous hyperplasia.

**Stromal Lesions**

Xanthelasma: lipid-laden histiocytes are visualized in the superficial dermis around blood vessels and adnexa.

**Vascular Lesions**

- Pyogenic granuloma presents as a collection of capillaries organized into lobules, each with a central feeder vessel. These thin-walled capillaries are embedded in a fibrous stroma that contains fibroblasts and inflammatory cells.

- Capillary hemangiomas are classified as hamartomas or abnormal proliferation of normal tissue in a normal location, namely endothelial cells. Histologically, the appearance of these lesions depends on the stage of the evolution. Early lesions may be very cellular, with solid nests of plump endothelial cells and little vascular lumen. Established lesions comprise well-developed, flattened, endothelium-lined capillary channels of varying sizes in a lobular configuration. Involuting lesions show increased fibrosis and hyalinization of capillary walls with luminal occlusion.

- Angiofibromas present proliferation of stellate and spindled cells around blood vessels within the dermis with the overlying epidermis pushed up and atrophic.

- Nevus flammeus (port-wine stain) presents with a high density of telangiectatic capillaries containing a single cell layer of endothelial cells located in the dermis and subcutaneously.

**Neurogenic**

- Each plexiform neurofibromatosis unit is surrounded by a thickened perineurium and contains axons, Schwann cells, and endoneurial fibroblasts.

- The solitary neurofibroma presents without a clear perineurium but is enclosed within a pseudo-capsule instead. The lesion contains collagen in the stroma and bundles of peripheral nerve sheath cells.

- Schwannoma presents as an encapsulated lesion containing compact spindle cells and/or larger, round, clear cells with Antoni A and Antoni B patterns, respectively. Cells should have strong S-100 immunoreactivity.

**Lipomatous**

- Lipomas contain mature adipocytes with a small eccentric nucleus alongside thin fibrous septa containing blood vessels. Lipoblasts should not be present.
