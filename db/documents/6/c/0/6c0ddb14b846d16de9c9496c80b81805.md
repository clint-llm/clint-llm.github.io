Respiratory bronchiolitis (RB) primarily involves macrophage accumulation in respiratory bronchioles in response to smoking. That subsequently incitesÂ interstitial inflammation and fibrosis in a time sensitive manner. The characteristic findings of pigmented macrophages, therefore, have a distinct bronchiolocentric distribution with centrilobular ground-glass opacities in chest imaging.
