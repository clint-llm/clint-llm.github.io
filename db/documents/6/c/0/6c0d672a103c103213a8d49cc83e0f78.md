Bile acids get conjugated in the liver to increase their water solubility because bile salts have a decreased pK, which favors the basic anionic form in the acidic duodenum. As amphiphiles, conjugated bile salts have a hydrophobic and hydrophilic side that, hence, their function as surfactants. The hydrophobic portion faces lipids, the hydrophilic portion facing the water, which allows them to act as bridges at the lipid/water interface, where they can make micelles when sufficiently concentrated.

Other functions of bile acids include removing the body's cholesterol, powering bile flow to remove various metabolites (like bilirubin), and facilitating the removal of bacterial flora of the small bowel and biliary tree (e.g., by disrupting their cellular membranes).
