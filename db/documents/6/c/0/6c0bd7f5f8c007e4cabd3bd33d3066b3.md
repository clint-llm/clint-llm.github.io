When aspergillosis is suspected, remembering the following pearls is helpful:

- Send all tissue and fluid for cytology, culture, and histopathology.

- If invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is suspected, anti-fungal therapy and CT chest should be ordered. Bronchoscopy should be considered if possible.

- Galactomannan is a valuable adjunct in diagnosing invasive aspergillosis in patients with hematological malignancies and those with a history of hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

- Fungal rhinosinusitis is a medical emergency, and the patient should be evaluated by otolaryngology urgently for consideration of surgical management.

- The halo and air crescent signs are radiographic signs of invasive aspergillosis.
