Nerve ablation has typically been used to treat facet-mediated axial back pain of the cervical and lumbar spine that has failed conservative therapy.

Additionally, it has otherÂ uses, such as relief of chronic neck pain after whiplash and chronic headache syndromes due to occipital and trigeminal neuralgia. Ablation is performed after successful analgesia of the suspected trouble-causing nerve with a local anesthetic. There continue to study investigating the role of ablation in peripheral nerve-mediated pain outside of the spinal column, particularly in knee osteoarthritis and plantar fasciitis.
