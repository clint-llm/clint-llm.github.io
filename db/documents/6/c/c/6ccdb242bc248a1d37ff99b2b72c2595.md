The management of crescentic glomerulonephritis is best done by an interprofessional team because of the complexity of treatment.Â Poor prognostic factors include:

- Crescents in more than 80% of glomeruli, especially circumferential fibrocellular or fibrous/acellular crescents

- Initial serum creatinine level of more than 500 micromol/L or glomerular filtration rate of less than 5 mL/min at presentation

- Oliguria

- Presence of anti-GBM antibody

- Age greater than 60 years

Patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy should be educated about early signs of infection and advised to see their physician or healthcare worker at any sign of infection and to monitor the WBC count.

Patients on high-dose prednisone should be monitored for the development of diabetes and peptic ulcer disease and receive therapy to prevent steroid-induced osteoporosis.
