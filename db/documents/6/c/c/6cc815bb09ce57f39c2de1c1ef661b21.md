Clinical uses of dofetilide include maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation. Dofetilide is indicated in adults for the conversion of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter to normal sinus rhythm and the preservation of normal sinus rhythm in patients with highly symptomatic atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter of more than one week whose pathological sinus rhythm has converted to normal. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, pharmacology, monitoring, and relevant interactions of dofetilide, pertinent for interprofessional team members in treating patients with cardiac disorders that will respond to such therapy.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of dofetilide.
- Review the indications for dofetilide.
- Outline the potential adverse effects of dofetilide use.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients when using dofetilide.
