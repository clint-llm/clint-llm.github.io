The most common reported adverse effects of quinolones include gastrointestinal events such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Antibiotic-associated colitis is a common sequela of quinolone use due to its effect on the gut flora. The use of quinolones may result in higher rates of clostridium difficile infection compared to other antibiotics.

Rare adverse events of note are tendinopathies and tendon rupture associated with quinolone use. Tendon rupture is often bilateral and is most commonly associated with the Achilles tendon. When using quinolones for extended periods, more severe adverse events like tendon rupture, nerve damage, and fluoroquinolone-associated disability syndrome can occur, causing damage that researchers theorize to be potentially permanent.

Reports exist for a large range of serious adverse events for novel quinolone agents, some of which have led to the withdrawal of these agents from the US market.
