The prevertebral muscles of the head and neck include the rectus capitis anterior, rectus capitis lateralis, longus capitis, and longus colli muscles. The prevertebral muscles are posterior to the prevertebral fascia, the posterior border of the retropharyngeal space, and anterior to the cervical vertebral column.

This article will briefly discuss some of the features of these muscles, including their origin, insertion, blood supply, innervation, embryology, and surgical and clinical significance.
