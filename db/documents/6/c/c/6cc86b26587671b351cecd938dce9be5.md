The clinical significance of the blood-thymus barrier is still extensively studied because of its potential role in limiting autoimmune diseases. Mouse studies demonstrate that intrathymic inoculation of antigen has led to apoptosis of CD4 and CD8 cells.

The blood-thymus barrier is also clinically significant because it becomes compromised under various conditions. Factors that increase permeability to the blood-thymus barrier include ACTH, stress, sex hormones, and glucocorticoids, which allows for foreign antigens to enter the thymic cortex leading to impaired immunity

Myeloma antigens in mice have been phagocytized and presented by dendritic cells within the thymic cortex.
