Complications associated with catheter ablation depends on the type of arrhythmia and the site of ablation.

- Death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (0.05% to 0.01%) although the stroke risk is higher with curative atrial fibrillation ablation.

- Heart block, which requires a permanent pacemaker (0.5%) and is mainly dependent on the proximity of the ablation lesion to the atrioventricular node.

- Cardiac trauma and perforation leading to tamponade (1% to 2%).

- Thromboembolic complications including systemic and venous embolism (pulmonary embolism) vary according to the procedure.

- Vascular accesses complications, including arteriovenous fistula, aneurysm, and retroperitoneal bleeding are far more common (2% to 4%).

- For atrial fibrillation ablation, there are complications like pulmonary vein stenosis and phrenic nerve damage, but they can be avoided by identifying the site of the phrenic nerve.

- The incidence of thromboembolic events is common, especially with the increased time of ablation in the atrial-esophageal fistula

- Pulmonary vein stenosis and atrio-esophageal fistulae are the rare complications of atrial fibrillation ablation.
