The nurse has a crucial safety role during a cesarean section. During the time-out, if an essential part of the safety checklist is absent, the nurse must speak up and alert the team. During the surgery, if one of the surgeons breaks sterility, it may be the nurse who notices. If the newborn is not doing well, the nurse is the one who calls for additional assistance. The nurse needs to monitor the following post-operative observations:

- Vital signs of the woman

- Vital signs of the newborn

- Symptoms and/or signs of infection

- Symptoms and/or signs of breast engorgement

- Maternal urine output

- Uterine involution

- Ambulatory level of the woman

- Wound dressing

- Amount of blood loss

- Amount of blood and/or serous discharge from the drain, if any
