The term "anabolic" means the use of body energy to promote growth and regulate constructive metabolism. Anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) are steroidal androgens, which include natural androgens such as male sex hormone testosterone or could be synthetic to mimic the action of the endogenous male hormone. Androgen use has become a major public health concern due to the transition of the use of androgens from strictly sports to a much wider spectrum of the population. The lifetime prevalence of anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) use worldwide is estimated to be 1% to 5%

Androgens stimulate and precipitate the development of male sex characteristics. Anabolic steroids and androgens are medically prescribed (orally or injectable) to treat hormonal imbalance for hypogonadism, impotence in men, delayed puberty in adolescent boys. For women, they can be used to treat breast cancer, endometriosis, osteoporosis, and muscle loss in patients with cancer or HIV. Misuse or abuse is commonly seen in athletes to enhance performance and prolong endurance. Non-athletes misuse anabolic steroids to increase their body weight and lean muscle mass without increasing the body's fat mass.
