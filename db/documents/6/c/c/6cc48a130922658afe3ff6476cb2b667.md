Evaluation of a patient suspected of havingÂ hypermagnesemia includes:

- Serum magnesium level

- The basic metabolic panel focusing on renal biochemistry: glomerular filtration rate (GFR), blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, urine specific gravity

- Arterial blood gas

- Clinical evaluation of renal function with urinary output

- Potassium, phosphate, calcium levels (plasma and urinalysis)

- ECG

During the high dose magnesium therapy for eclampsia, it is necessary to measure serum magnesium levels periodically to prevent hypermagnesemia.
