Dysfunction of the islet cells can lead to pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. These are rare tumors that account for about 7% of all pancreatic masses. They are generally slow-growing and well-differentiated and can be either functioning or non-functioning. Between 50 and 75% of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are nonfunctioning and therefore are not associated with the hormone-related clinical syndrome.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 is a rare endocrine tumor syndrome that can cause insulinomas, glucagonomas, and nonfunctioning tumors of the pancreas in addition to tumors of the parathyroid and pituitary glands. It occurs due to an inactivating germline mutation in the MEN1 gene on chromosome 11 in the majority of cases, although 20% of patients with the MEN1 syndrome do not have a mutation in this gene. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors can occur in 30 to 75% of patients presenting with this syndrome, and nonfunctioning neuroendocrine tumors are more common than functioning ones. A thorough medical and family history is crucial in making an early diagnosis of MEN1, which can be lifesaving as this syndrome is associated with a high mortality rate.

**Nonfunctional Islet Cell Tumor**

Non-functioning tumors represent most pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and between 60 to 90% of them are malignant. These tumors may release certain substances, such as pancreatic polypeptide and chromogranin A, which are also useful as tumor markers in patients. They do not present clinically with a hormonal syndrome, which can cause a delay in the diagnosis. More than 50% of these tumors are diagnosed incidentally in asymptomatic patients undergoing diagnostic evaluations for other unrelated conditions.

**Insulinoma**

Insulinomas are the most common functioning tumors and are composed of pancreatic beta cells. They occur in adults between 31 to 63 years old and have a slight female predominance. Morphologically they are small tumors, with up to 80% of them being less than 2 cm and are distributed equally throughout the head, body, and tail of the pancreas. Although between 5 and 15% of insulinomas can be malignant, most of them are benign and amenable to surgical excision.

These tumors secrete high amounts of insulin, a hormone that binds to specific receptors in the liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle and causes glucose uptake in these cells. Therefore, the clinical manifestations of insulinomas are related to hypoglycemia. The neuroglycopenic symptoms include weakness, loss of consciousness, and confusion, and the autonomic symptoms include palpitations, tremors, hunger, and sweating. A feared complication is hypoglycemic coma, which can occur suddenly and lead to brain death. The periods of hypoglycemia occur most commonly after a period of fasting or physical exercise but can also occur without any relationship to meal times or exercise. Fasting hypoglycemia with a glucose level of less than 45 mg/dl with concomitant hyperinsulinemia and elevated level of proinsulin and C-peptide can confirm the diagnosis of insulinoma.

**Glucagonoma**

Glucagonomas are rare tumors, making up 7% of all functioning pancreatic endocrine tumors composed of pancreatic alpha cells. They occur in adults in their fifth decade of life and have an even distribution between males and females. Morphologically, they are encapsulated and firm, vary in size from 2 to 25 cm and occur most commonly in the tail of the pancreas. The majority of these tumors are malignant, and 50 to 80% of patients have metastasis to the liver at the initial presentation.

These tumors secrete high amounts of glucagon, a hormone that increases the blood glucose concentration by converting stored glycogen to glucose within the liver. The clinical manifestations of these tumors are unique. While the most common symptoms are weight loss and necrolytic migratory erythema, patients can also present with cheilitis, diabetes mellitus, anemia, diarrhea, venous thrombosis, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The rash of necrolytic migratory erythema is often the presenting symptom of an underlying glucagonoma; it begins with erythematous papules and plaques on the face, perineum, and extremities.Â These lesions later enlarge, coalesce, and have a central clearing with peripheral crusting and scaling. It is also often associated with intense pruritis and pain.

**Somatostatinoma**

Somatostatinomas are very rare tumors of the pancreatic delta cells, occurring in 1 in 40 million people per year. These tumors can arise in both the pancreas and the duodenum, and the vast majority are malignant. They are most commonly found incidentally as they contain immune-reactive granules but cause no functional syndrome. Symptoms due to somatostatinomas are due to mass effect and include abdominal pain, weight loss, and jaundice.
