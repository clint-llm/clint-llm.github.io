Rotavirus is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis in the world. Studies estimate that approximately 200,000 people die annually from infection. Although the infection rate has decreased with the advent of vaccines, infections are still common throughout the world. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of rotavirus infection and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of rotavirus.
- Outline the evaluation of a patient with rotavirus.
- Explain the treatment of patients with rotavirus.
- Summarize how communication between the patient, family, nurses, emergency room physicians, primary care physicians, infectious disease physicians, and pediatricians is required to decrease the incidence as well as morbidity and mortality associated with the infection.
