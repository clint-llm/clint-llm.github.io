The first system to develop due to the growing embryo's ever-increasing metabolic demands is the cardiovascular system. Initially, simple diffusion of necessary nutrients is sufficient but eventually becomes inadequate to supply oxygen and nutrients. Cardiac development is a complicated interplay of molecular communication, ensuring the proper formation of structures and spatial configuration changes in the appropriate timing. Interference with this process, whether genetic or environmental, leads to the formation of congenital heart diseases.
