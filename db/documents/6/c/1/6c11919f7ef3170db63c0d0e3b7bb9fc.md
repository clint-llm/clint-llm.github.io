Shock is a life-threatening manifestation of circulatory failure. Circulatory shock leads to cellular and tissue hypoxia resulting in cellular death and dysfunction of vital organs. Effects of shock are reversible in the early stages and a delay in diagnosis and/or timely initiation of treatment can lead to irreversible changes including multiorgan failure (MOF) and death. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of shock, and explains the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of shock and describe the types of shock.
- Outline the evaluation of a patient potentially in shock.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for shock.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients in shock.
