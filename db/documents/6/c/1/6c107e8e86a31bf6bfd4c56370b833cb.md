Night terrors are a common sleep disorder in young children and describe a condition in which a child wakes up from sleep in a terrified state. For the majority of these episodes, the child will not have any recollection of this event ever happening. A night terror is considered a parasomnia due to its characterization of unusual physical and verbal behaviors. This activity illustrates the etiology, evaluation, and treatment of night terrors and the importance of an interprofessional team approach to management.
