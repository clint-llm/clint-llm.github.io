The CDC reports the incidence of nocardiosis in the US as 500-1000 cases per year. Globally, the incidence of Nocardia infection is not well known. The incidence of nocardiosis is thought to be increasing due to an increasing population and an increased number of immunocompromised individuals worldwide.Nocardia typically manifests as an opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients, with 60% of patients with nocardiosis having immunosuppressive conditions.

Immunocompromised conditions associated with Nocardia infections include:

- HIV (most common underlying condition)

- Cancer

- Chemotherapy treatment

- Corticosteroid treatment (present in more than half of patients with Nocardia infection according to one report)

- Solid organ transplant recipients (especially lung transplant)

- Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients

- Diabetes

- Autoimmune diseases

- Chronic lung diseases such as COPD (many patients on corticosteroid therapy)

- Any condition that results in deficient cell-mediated immunity
