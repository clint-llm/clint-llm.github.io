Carbon monoxide (CO) is released into the environment by the incomplete combustion of carbonaceous materials. The sources of CO are plentiful, and except carbon dioxide (CO2), CO is the most abundant pollutant in the lower environment. It is tasteless, odorless, and colorless, and victims are usually rendered unconscious before they realize they are being poisoned. The effects of CO poisoning on humans are variable, and healthcare professionals are just beginning to understand these effects better.
