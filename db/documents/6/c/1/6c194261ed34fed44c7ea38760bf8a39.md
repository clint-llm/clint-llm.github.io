Ossicular chain dislocation occurs following trauma. Ossicular chain discontinuity can occur due to cholesteatoma or congenital disease,Â but this is usually due to erosion of the ossicles or a requirement during cholesteatoma surgery.

The most common injury to result in ossicular chain dislocation is temporal bone trauma.

Other injuries that have been reported to result in dislocation include:

- An indirect blow to the contralateral side

- Blast injuries

- Direct traumatization via instrumentation of the external auditory canal

- Barotrauma

The most common mechanisms of injury are road traffic collisions (RTC), falls, and interpersonal violence.
