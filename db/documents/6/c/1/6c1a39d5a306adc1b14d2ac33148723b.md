Rotor syndrome is a benign condition and persists for life. There are no recommended management options for patients suffering from Rotor syndrome. There is no morbidity or mortality associated with Rotor syndrome; hence its prognosis is good. Mortality and morbidity occur if there is another coexisting liver disease.
