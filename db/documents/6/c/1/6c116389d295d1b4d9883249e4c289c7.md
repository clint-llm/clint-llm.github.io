Educating patients on the high incidence of pelvic organ prolapse can deter associated stigmas and psychosocial factors that delay diagnosis. Both the International Urogynecology Association (IUGA) and the American Urogynecologic Society (AUGS) have provided education pamphlets and printable information that can explain symptoms expected workup, and treatment options. Education pamphlets explaining home maintenance and self-care of pessaries have significantly reduced pessary complications and have increased patient confidence in treatment.
