Spinal motion restriction using a long spine board and cervical spine collar is implemented in the case of trauma, when certain criteria are met, to help reduce the chance of spinal cord injury. The indications for applying spinal motion restriction are a GCS of less than 15, evidence of intoxication, midline neck or back tenderness or pain, focal neurologic signs and/or symptoms, anatomic deformity of the spine, and distracting circumstances or injuries. This activity outlines and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, treating, and managing patients who undergo spinal motion restriction.

**Objectives:**
- Review the indications for utilizing spinal motion restriction.
- Summarize the potential complications of spinal motion restriction.
- Review the anatomy and pathophysiology of spinal column trauma and how it can lead to spinal cord injury, necessitating immobilization..
- Outline some interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination in cases where spinal immobilization is necessary, improving patient outcomes.
