Current guidelines published by the CDC suggest treating patients with clinical features consistent with LGV infection such as proctocolitis or genital ulcer disease and lymphadenopathy.

A second approach is an option in patients with symptoms consistent with LGV proctocolitis. Clinicians can consider initiating empiric therapy with doxycycline 100 milligrams orally, twice daily for seven days in conjunction with ceftriaxone 250 milligrams once intramuscularly while lab tests are pending. If lab testing confirms Chlamydia infection, treatment should continue for a total of 21 days or as long as the patient manifests symptoms.
