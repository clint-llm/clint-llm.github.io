Toxicity with clomipramine is often associated with doses over 300 mg per day.

Clomipramine, combined with S-RI, MAOI, or other serotonergic medications, may result in serotonin syndrome, with a triad of altered mental status, myoclonus, and autonomic hyperactivity. The antidote in serotonin syndrome is cyproheptadine, along with supportive care of vital signs.
