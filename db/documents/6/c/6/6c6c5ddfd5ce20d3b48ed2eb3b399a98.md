The thoracodorsal nerve is a pure motor nerve that innervates the latissimus dorsi muscle. The latissimus dorsi muscle is a large, fan-shaped muscle that originates from the spinous processes of T7 to L5, the thoracolumbar fascia, and iliac crest. It inserts in the intertubercular groove of the humerus bone and acts to extend, internally rotate, and adduct the arm. The primary blood supply of the latissimus dorsi muscle is the thoracodorsal artery. The dorsal divisions of T6 to T12 provide the sensory innervation of the skin of the latissimus dorsi muscle.

In about 13% of the population, thoracodorsal nerve innervates the teres major muscle.
