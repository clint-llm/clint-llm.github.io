Primary amenorrhea poses a diagnostic dilemma. These patients present with specific signs and symptoms which point toward the underlying etiology. A detailed history and thorough physical examination help in reaching the diagnosis in most cases. However, diagnosis is further supported in some patients by an array of laboratory investigations, including serum measurement of thyroid function tests, FSH, LH, and prolactin, using radiological imaging, and obtaining the karyotype. Treatment is aimed at correcting the primary cause of amenorrhea. Treatment is primarily surgical in which congenital anomalies are found to be the cause of primary amenorrhea. Cyclic hormonal therapy is instituted in all cases of premature ovarian failure and gonadal dysgenesis. An interprofessional team that includes clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), specialists (particularly endocrinologists and gynecologists), nurses, and pharmacists must workÂ collaboratively, openly share information, and coordinate in educating the patient and monitoring treatment, leading to optimal patient outcomes with the fewest adverse events.
