Pseudocholinesterase deficiency is often only diagnosed after the patient experiences prolonged neuromuscular blockade following standard doses of succinylcholine or mivacurium.

Patients with a history of specific disease states, including malignancy, extensive burn injuries, myocardial infarction, CHF, pregnancy, liver disease, hemodialysis, and chronic infections may present with the acquired form of pseudocholinesterase deficiency.

There are no specific physical exam findings attributed to pseudocholinesterase deficiency. Patients will either present with normal physical exam (inherited form) or physical exam findings consistent with their disease state (acquired form).
