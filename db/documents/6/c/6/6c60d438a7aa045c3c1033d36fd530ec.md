NF2 should be differentiated from Schwannomatosis which is another form of neurofibromatosis, however genetically distinct from both NF1 and NF2. Schwannomatosis is most frequently sporadic with 20% cases being familial. Schwannomatosis is characterized by the development of multiple schwannomas involving the peripheral nervous system without concomitant involvement of the vestibular nerves. Nonvestibular cranial nerve schwannomas are uncommon but can be seen in these patients.
