Erosive lichen planus (ELP) most typically affects the oral mucosa or genitals. However, it may rarely involve the eyelids, esophagus, larynx, anus, bladder, or external auditory canal.

Vulvar and vaginal erosive lichen planus typically presents with complaints of pain, dysuria, a burning sensation, and dyspareunia, often with post-coital bleeding.

In oral erosive LP, lesions may occur on the buccal mucosa, labial mucosa, tongue, or vermillion border. Often, the lesions are bilateral and symmetrical.

Vulvovaginal-gingival (VVG) syndrome is a specific variant of erosive lichen planus, which involves the vulva, vagina, vestibule, and oral mucosa, as well as potential additional sites, such as the skin and esophagus.
