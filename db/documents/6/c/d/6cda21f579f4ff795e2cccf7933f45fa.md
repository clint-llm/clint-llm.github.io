The common histological finding of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma includes follicular pattern and diffuse pattern. Follicular lymphoma shows a follicular pattern where uniform nodularity is seen throughout the lymph node and little variation in the size and shape of the follicle. The diffuse pattern shows the normal architecture of the lymph node effaced by the infiltration of small lymphocytes. In Burkitt lymphoma, the lymph node is completely effaced with a monomorphic infiltrate of lymphocytes. There are clear spaces interspersed with reactive histiocytes containing phagocytic debris.

Mantle Cell lymphoma can have a histologic pattern of diffuse, nodular, mantle zone, or a combination of all. Most cases are composed exclusively of small to medium-sized lymphoid cells with slightly irregular or "notched" nuclei. On histologic review, tumor cells are usually monomorphous small to medium-sized B lymphocytes with irregular nuclei. The degree of irregularity is usually, but not always, less than that of the centrocytes found in germinal centers and follicular lymphoma.
