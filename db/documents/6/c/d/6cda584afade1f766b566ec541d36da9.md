Low serum T3 level is correlated with an increased length of hospital stay, intensive care unit admission, and the need for mechanical ventilation in patients with acute heart failure. The serum T4 value also correlates with the outcomes in critically ill patients; values under 2 microg/dL have been associated with mortality rates in excess of 80%.

In a recent study from China, an increased rT3 level was associated with worse outcomes, and it was mostly observed in the most severely ill patients.

In other recent reports of Covid-19 infected patients, the presence of euthyroid sick picture was associated with poor prognosis and worse outcomes even in the early stages of the disease.

In patients with hip fractures, the presence of euthyroid sick syndrome was associated with an increased need for blood transfusions and the development of anemia after a surgical repair.
