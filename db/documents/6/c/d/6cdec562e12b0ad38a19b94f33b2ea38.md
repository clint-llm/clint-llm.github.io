Trigonocephaly is a post-neurulation defect that leads to premature fusion of the metopic suture, usually occurring before birth.

The specific etiology of craniosynostosis is unknown.

Rare non-syndromic cases have been described in which there is the fusion of both the metopic and the sagittal suture producing significant behavior and cognitive and motor impairment.

The most notable genetic mutations recently identified in non-syndromic metopic synostosis are FREM1 and SMAD6.
