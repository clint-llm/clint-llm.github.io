Three surgically extracted samples in Tsai et al.â€™s study were examined for histopathologic changes. The membrane was composed of hypocellular fibrous tissue with bundles of immature collagen bundles mixed in with mature collagen fibers. Mild vascularity was noted in two of the three, and no other ocular cell type was observed in the fibrosis. Additionally, T-cells and macrophages were scarce in two of three samples, indicating a lack of inflammation that may be associated with other anterior chamber membranes.PAX6 mutations could also predispose patients to fibrotic membranes and could be the root cause.
