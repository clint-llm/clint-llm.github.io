Timely and safe weaning is important.

Protocol-based algorithmic weaning process helps prevent hyperoxia.

This process is dependent on the algorithmic approaches comprising of:

- Stringent screening for the readiness of the patient for weaning

- Weaning modes in ventilation

- SBT methods, and

- De-escalating sedation and facilitating the mobilization of the patients.

Newer approaches to facilitate the process include:

- Early noninvasive ventilation

- Neurally-adjusted ventilatory setup, and

- Point of care ultrasound.
