Once the need for prophylaxis is established, the following consensus-based principles of care should be adhered to improve the success of prophylactic treatment:

- Start medications with the highest evidence-based effectiveness.

- Avoid agents that may exacerbate comorbid conditions.

- Begin with the lowest effective dose and increase every two to four weeks to achieve the therapeutic effect and stop if the patient develops adverse effects.

- Successful treatment is described as a 50% reduction in the episodes of headaches or days, a significant shortening of episode duration, or an increase in response to acute therapy.

- If headaches are under control for at least 6 to 12 months, therapy should be slowly tapered and discontinued.
