Most commonly, the patient will be a child under the age ofÂ two years presenting with irritability, fussiness, lethargy, fever, ear pulling, ear pain. The adult patient will typically complain of severe ear pain, fever, and headache. Physical examination in both children and adults will reveal postauricular erythema, tenderness, warmth, and fluctuance with protrusion of the auricle.

The otoscopic examination will reveal a bulging of the posterosuperior wall of the external auditory canal and bulging of and pus behind the tympanic membrane. Often the tympanic membrane can be ruptured and draining pus. Some important considerations include the following. A normal tympanic membrane usually, but not always, excludes acute mastoiditis.
