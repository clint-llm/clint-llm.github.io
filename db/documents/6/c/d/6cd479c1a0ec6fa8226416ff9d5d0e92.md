MPO deficiency was adjudged as an extremely rare disease, and only 17 known cases had been reported up to 1979. In the United States and Europe, an estimated frequency is 1 per 2,00 to 4,000 individuals, and in the Japanese population, it is 1 per 55,000 people. However, modern diagnostic techniques have provided a better approach to the diagnosis of this disorder, and it is a more common condition than initially believed.
