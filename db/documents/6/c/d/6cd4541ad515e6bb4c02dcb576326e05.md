Insufficient venous outflow from the left gonadal vein (LGV) can cause dilatation of the LGV walls and rupture,Â varicocele in men, and pelvic congestion syndrome in women.

Hypertensive venous collateral in the paralumbar territory might cause the uncommon association of NCS and MTS. Correction of one might aggravate unopposed hypertension, and worsen the symptom.

A 2016 retrospective evaluation of 75 patients who underwent endovascular stenting at a single center reported stent migration occurred in 5 patients (6.7%) during a mean 55 months of follow-up. The stent migrated into the left side of the LRV in one patient, IVC in two patients, right atrium in one patient, and right ventricle in one patient. They concluded that preoperative LRV measurements, stent choice, stent deployment, close follow-up, and early detection and treatment are needed to reduce the number of stent migrations, particularly into the heart.
