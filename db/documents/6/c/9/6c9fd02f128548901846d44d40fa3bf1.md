Intraventricular meningiomas show similar characteristics to those found in the extra-axial space. Their cells of origin are the same. However, extra-axial meningiomas are derived from the arachnoid cap cells, naturally occurring near venous sinuses and dural edges. Intraventricular meningiomas originate from the choroid plexus' stroma and arise at the tela choroidea. Here, arachnoid cells are found secondary to the embryologic origin of the choroid plexus. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of intraventricular meningiomas and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of intraventricular meningiomas.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation of intraventricular meningiomas.
- Outline the management options available for intraventricular meningiomas.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication in patients with intraventricular meningiomas and improve outcomes.
