Symptomatic relief is the mainstay treatment for Chikungunya fever, including adequate hydration, rest, and pain/fever relief preferably with acetaminophen.

Chronic manifestations, including persistent or relapsing-remitting polyarthralgia, polyarthritis, and myalgia, have been found to respond adequately to hydroxychloroquine in combination with corticosteroids or other disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).

Management of CHIKV is based on avoidance of mosquito bites. Use of repellents containing DEET, wearing protective clothing, bed nets, and air-conditioned buildings are great ways to prevent exposure.Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus has been of increasing concern.
