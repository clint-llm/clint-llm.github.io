InÂ PG, the skin lesions are caused by an autoimmune process implicated anti-basement membrane zone auto-antibodies. The target autoantigen is BP 180 also designated BPAG2 and collagen XVII. PG is strongly associated with the maternal HLA-DRs DRB1*0301 (HLA-DR3) and DRB1*0401/040X (HLA-DR4). This strong association indicates the important role of MHC class II in the pathogenesis of the disease.
