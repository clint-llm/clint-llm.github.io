The signs and symptoms for the idioventricular or accelerated idioventricular rhythm are variable and are dependent on the underlying etiology or causative mechanism leading to the rhythm. In most cases, the patient remains completely asymptomatic and are diagnosed during cardiac monitoring. Infrequently, patients can have palpitations, lightheadedness, fatigue, and even syncope.
