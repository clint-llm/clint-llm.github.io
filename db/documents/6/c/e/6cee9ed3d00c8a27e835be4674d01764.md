As a response to an environmental factor, Th1 mediated inflammation develops against melanocytes. Tyrosinase peptide is a known target of T-cells, specifically in melanocytes expressing HLA DRB1-04*05.

This inflammatory cascade leads to the formation of non-necrotizing granulomas in affected organs. In the eye, these are seen as sub-retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) aggregates named Dalen-Fuchs nodules, which may also be seen in other granulomatous processes, especially sympathetic ophthalmia.
