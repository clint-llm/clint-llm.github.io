In individuals with suspected ecthyma gangrenosum, prompt treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated after obtaining blood and wound cultures.

Initial empiric therapy includes antipseudomonal beta-lactams (piperacillin/tazobactam), cephalosporins (cefepime), fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin), and carbapenems (imipenem). Combination therapy is recommended in high-risk individuals, such as those with neutropenia and septic shock.

Surgical excision of necrotic lesions or abscesses is often necessary. Incision and drainage of abscesses are important for source control of the infection. For necrotic skin lesions, aggressive debridement and grafting may be necessary for lesions larger than 10 cm.

Treatment in the hospital intensive care setting is appropriate for patients with sepsis or neutropenia due to the high case fatality rate. For those with non-bacteremic EG, treatment in the outpatient setting may be appropriate. In this setting, oral antipseudomonal agents, such as ciprofloxacin, can be considered.
