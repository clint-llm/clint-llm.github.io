Primary polydipsia is common in patients withÂ developmental disorders like autism and intellectual disability.

Other psychiatry patients with nonpsychotic axis-1 psychiatric disorders also have polydipsia, which is more like compulsory water drinking. These people rarely become hyponatremic unless there are other contributing factors like being on thiazide diuretics.
