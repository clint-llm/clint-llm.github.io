In recent years, the atypical antipsychotics or second-generation antipsychotics have become the drugs of choice for acute psychoses. They are "atypical" as they are differentiated from "conventional" or first-generation antipsychotics based on their clinical profile. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, safe administration, adverse effects, contraindications, toxicology, and monitoring of atypical antipsychotics in psychosis management.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the indications for using atypical antipsychotic agents.
- Identify the mechanism of action of the atypical antipsychotic class of drugs.
- Review the adverse event and interaction profile for atypical antipsychotics.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance appropriate clinical outcomes with atypical antipsychotics leading to optimal patient outcomes.
