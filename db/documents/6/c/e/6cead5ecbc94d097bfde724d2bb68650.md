In general, the presence of an overt palatal cleft constitutes a sufficient indication for repair, primarily due to the speech and swallowing sequelae of the anomaly. Patients are typically at least 6 to 18 months old when the repair is undertaken. Similarly, patients with submucous palatal clefting may be candidates for surgery if they experience those same symptoms, mainly if they have unsuccessfully completed a course of speech therapy previously. Additionally, the persistence of speech and swallowing dysfunction after cleft palate repair and speech therapy should cause the surgeon to consider a revision operation.
