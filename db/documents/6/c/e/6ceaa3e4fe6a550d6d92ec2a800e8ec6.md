Caring for a victim of sexual assault is a complex process that requires a multifaceted approach. There should be a restricted number of patient interactions during the examination. Limiting the number of providers and visitors strengthens the patient’s trust with the sole examiner, ensures patient privacy, and lessens the risk of evidence contamination. However, once the patient is stable and their story and exam documented, many additional services may be provided to the patient.

Law enforcement is typically involved in the patient’s care from the start. They, along with EMS, might be the ones to bring the patient to a care center. Law enforcement is also the entity that may retrieve clothing from the victim’s house if they have left behind the clothing worn during the incident. Contact information for local law enforcement should be given to the patient upon discharge for follow up on their case or to make a report at a later time.

The patient should follow up with a primary care provider in a week or two, especially if they experienced physical trauma or developed an STI. Referral to an OB/GYN is crucial if the patient is pregnant or begins to have gynecological complaints such as pain with sex or irregular or missed menses.

Due to the psychological distress experienced by victims of sexual abuse, follow up with a therapist or other trained professional should be advised. Survivors of sexual assault benefit from referral to local advocacy or crisis centers, which provide support to the patient for the successful return to their life after this trauma. Patients should receive instruction to seek a higher level of care through the Emergency Department if suicidal or homicidal ideation occurs at any time.
