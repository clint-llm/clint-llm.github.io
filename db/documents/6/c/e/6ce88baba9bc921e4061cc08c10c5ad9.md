The sacroiliac (SI) joint lies between the sacrum and the ilium bones of the pelvis. There are two joints, one on each side of the sacrum. The joint serves to transfer weight from the upper body to the lower limbs. Strong ligaments and muscles stabilize the joints. The motion of the sacroiliac joint is minimal and limited to 2 mm to 4 mm in any direction. Up to 25% of low back pain could arise from the sacroiliac joint. This activity describes the causes of sacroiliac joint pain, methods to diagnose, and the management options.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of sacroiliac joint pain.
- Review the presentation of a patient with sacroiliac joint pain.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for sacroiliac joint pain.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of sacroiliac joint pain and improve outcomes.
