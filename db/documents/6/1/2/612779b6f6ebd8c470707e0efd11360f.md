Saifuddin et al. examined MRI images of 231 men andÂ  273 women with a mean age of 46 and found the mean position of the conus to be at the lower third of L1, with a mean variation from the middle one-third of T12 to the upper one-third of L3. There were no significant variations related to gender or increasing age.

Wilson et al. studied MRI images of 184 children ranging from neonates to 20-year-olds. They found that the position of the conus in the 0 to 2 year age group was from T12 to L2-L3 with an average being L1-L2. For the 19 to 20 year age group, the range was L1-L2 with the average being L1-L2. Based on these findings, they concluded that the conus does not ascend throughout childhood as previously believed but attains the adult position sometime during the first few months of life. A conus located at L2-L3 or above is considered normal for any age.
