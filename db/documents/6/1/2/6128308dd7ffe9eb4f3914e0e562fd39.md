Periprosthetic proximal femur fractures are complex orthopedic issues that carry significant morbidity and mortality. The demand for primary total hip arthroplasty is projected to grow to 572,000 procedures performed in 2030, a 174% increase from 2005. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of periprosthetic proximal femur fractures and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of periprosthetic proximal femur fractures.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of periprosthetic proximal femur fractures.
- Review the management options available for periprosthetic proximal femur fractures.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance periprosthetic proximal femur fractures and improve outcomes.
