Despite the initial lousy reputation of ablative psychosurgery, modern cingulotomy offers positive outcomes in nearly 70% of patients with OCD and about 75% of patients with major depression on the five-year long-term follow-up. Anterior capsulotomy with radiosurgery in patients with intractable OCD offers more than 70% of response at a 5-year follow-up. For alcohol dependence and intractable AN, bilateral stereotactic radiofrequency ablation of the nucleus accumbens offers remission rates of 64-82%. Bilateral cingulotomy for heroin addiction offers a remission rate of 45%.

For DBS, the response rate varies depending on the psychiatric disorder and the target.

- For OCS, the internal capsule  provides a response in 55% of the patients, the anterior capsule/striatum a response in 62% with remission in 6%, the inferior thalamic peduncle a response in 100%, the nucleus accumbens a response in 38%, and the subthalamic nucleus a response in 50%

- For mayor affective disorder, the anterior capsule/striatum provides a response in 40% with remission in 25% of the patients, the cingulate a response in 58% and remission in 28%, and the nucleus accumbens a response in 48% and remission in 5%

- Only case reports and case series have been published for TS, documenting a wide range of improvements (46% to nearly 100%).
