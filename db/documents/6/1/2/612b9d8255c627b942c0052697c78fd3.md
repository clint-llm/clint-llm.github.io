An untreated opposite eye has a 40% to 80% chance of developing an acute attack of angle-closure glaucoma over 5 to 10 years as it shares the same anatomic predisposing factors as the first eye.

The gender and ethnicity predisposing factors to acute angle-closure glaucoma hint at a genetic predisposition to the disease in certain populations. Recent large-scale studies have shown a clear association to several genes and genetic loci with primary open-angle glaucoma, but evidence for acute angle-closure glaucoma is sparse. So far, only one study has shown a genetic locus on Chromosome 11 that can cause acute angle-closure glaucoma. Studies have been conducted on possible therapeutic targets in patients with early-onset glaucoma based on molecular and cellular events caused by MYOC, OPTN, and TBK1 mutations.
