Urinary bladder catheterization is performed for both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes.

There are three types of urinary catheters based on the approach of insertion.

- External catheters adhere to the external genitalia in men or pubic area in women and collect the urine. They are useful for the management of urinary incontinence.

- Urethral catheters are inserted through the urethra, with the tip advanced into the base of the bladder.

- Suprapubic catheters are inserted into the bladder surgically via a suprapubic approach.

Urethral catheterization is most commonly performed in routine clinical practice and is discussed in this article.
