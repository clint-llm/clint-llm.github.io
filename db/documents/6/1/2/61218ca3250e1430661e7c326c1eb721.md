Hypercalcemia is the most common adverse reaction reported in at least one-third of patients taking systemic calcitriol. Early signs of hypercalcemia include fatigue, weakness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, vertigo, tinnitus, ataxia, arthralgia, and irritability.

Less than 10% of reported adverse reactions include headache, skin rash, polydipsia, nausea, abdominal pain, and urinary tract infection. Less than 1% of reported adverse reactions include hypertension, increased hematocrit, increased hemoglobin, drowsiness, hyperthermia, lymphocytosis, increased neutrophils, anorexia, constipation, and ophthalmic conditions, such as conjunctivitis and photophobia.

Hypercalciuria and nephrolithiasis have been confirmed in patients receiving systemic calcitriol treatment, and further laboratory abnormalities associated with late signs of hypercalcemia include elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. Because calcitriol also increases the intestinal absorption of phosphorous, hyperphosphatemia can occur in patients with renal failure and may further contribute to elevated serum creatinine levels, ectopic calcification, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and renal osteodystrophy.

Hypersensitivity reactions, including pruritus, rash, and urticaria, may occur in susceptible patients,Â and studies of intravenous calcitriol have found rare cases of anaphylactoid reactions attributed to systemic calcitriol.
