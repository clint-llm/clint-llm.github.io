Tonsillar herniation is a medical emergency and requires urgent assessment. Intervention may require a wide variety of interprofessional team members, including emergency medicine clinicians, anesthesiologists, intensivists, traumatologists, and neurosurgeons. Patients with intracranial pathologies require close nursing observations and monitoring. Nurses will identify early signs of herniation and will consult with the intensivist and neurosurgery for adequate management. If the patient survives the acute episode, rehabilitation will likely be required. This includes a variety of healthcare professionals, including physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, dieticians, and psychologists. If timely treated, a functional recovery is indicated by a return to activities of daily living.

Collaboration between the healthcare team members and communication are crucial elements for good results. The interprofessional care provided to the patient must follow an evidence-based approach to improve outcomes.
