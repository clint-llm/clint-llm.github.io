Overuse injuries are a common entity in medical practice. Stress reactions and fractures make up a significant portion of patients in a typical sports medicine clinic. Though rare, an isolated cuboid stress fracture should be considered in a patient presenting with lateral foot pain. Due to the repetitive mechanical forces dissipated in the area, the foot is prone to overuse injuries, especially stress fractures. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of cuboid stress fractures and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the risk factors for developing a cuboid stress fracture. 
- Explain the common physical exam findings associated with a cuboid stress fracture. 
- Summarize treatment considerations for patients with cuboid stress fractures. 
- Summarize the importance of the interprofessional team in treatment considerations for patients with cuboid stress fractures.
