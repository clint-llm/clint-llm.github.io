Child abuse is a public health problem that leads to lifelong health consequences, both physically and psychologically. Physically, those who undergo abusive head trauma may have neurologic deficits, developmental delays, cerebral palsy, and other forms of disability. Psychologically, child abuse patients tend to have higher rates of depression, conduct disorder, and substance abuse. Academically, these children may have poor performance at school with decreased cognitive function.

All healthcare providers have a legal, medical, and moral obligation to report suspected abuse. The majority of child abuse problems present to the Emergency Department (ED); hence, nurses and physicians in the ED are often the first to notice the problem. The key is to be aware of the problem; allowing abused children to return to their parents usually leads to more violence and sometimes even death. The social worker must be informed of suspected child abuse so that the child can be followed as an outpatient.

**Evidence-based Outcomes**

Child abuse is a serious problem in many countries. While there is an acute awareness of the problem, many children fail to be referred or reported and consequently continue to suffer abuse, sometimes even death. In a busy emergency room, healthcare workers must be vigilant of abuse in any child who presents with injuries that are inconsistent or unexplainable.
