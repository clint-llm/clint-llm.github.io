Diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency requires suspicion. Hyponatremia with hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia may be present. Serum cortisol, ACTH, renin, aldosterone, and chemistry panel should be obtained early. Serum cortisol levels can help make diagnoses in the presence of elevated ACTH and plasma renin activity. The ACTH test can be performed to determine if the cause is central or peripheral.

Patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency are more likely to have hypoglycemia but will not have dehydration, hyperkalemia, or skin hyperpigmentation.

Consider testing for HIV and tuberculosis in patients with unclear etiology.

The most common laboratory findings in chronic primary adrenal insufficiency are anemia, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia.
