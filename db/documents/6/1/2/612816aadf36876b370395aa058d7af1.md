Benzathine penicillin is contraindicated in patients who have had a previous anaphylactic reaction or serious skin reaction to any penicillin, for example, Steven-Johnson or toxic epidermal necrosis. There have been reports of patients with anaphylactic or severe skin reactions from cephalosporins or carbapenems having a type of cross-reactivity reaction that also results in serious adverse events when they are administered any penicillin antimicrobial, including benzathine penicillin, but these reports are believed to be much less prevalent than previously suspected.
