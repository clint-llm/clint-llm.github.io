Left ventricular false aneurysm, also known as pseudoaneurysm, is a rare and highly morbid pathology. It most commonly presents as a complication of myocardial infarction (MI). It occurs when an ischemic left ventricular free wall rupture (due to acute infarction) is contained as a hematoma communicating with the ventricular cavity. The rupture could become sealed by an adherent pericardium, organizing hematoma, thrombus, or scar tissue and gives the appearance of an aneurysm.
