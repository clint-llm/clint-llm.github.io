Treatment is not usually necessary for a Baker's Cyst unless the patient is symptomatic.

**Non-operative management:**

- Rest/activity modification

- NSAIDs

- PT/rehab regimens are often effective in patients with minimal symptoms, and in the setting of smaller degenerative meniscal tears

- Aspiration and steroid injection

- The knee joint itself can be treated with a cortisone injection in the setting of moderate to advanced tricompartmental degenerative knee arthritic conditions.  This can help manage patients' symptoms and clinically differentiate the contribution of the popliteal cyst itself on the patients daily symptoms
- Ultrasound-guided aspiration and injection can be performed by an experienced interventional radiologist

- Recurrence rates are much lower in younger patient populations
- Recurrence rates are higher in older patient populations and degenerative meniscal tears with associated cysts

**Operative management**

- Arthroscopic debridement, cyst decompression, meniscal repair vs partial meniscectomy

- less invasive than the open approach
- often results in cyst recurrence, especially in older patients with moderate-advanced knee degenerative conditions

- Open cyst excision

- Posterior approach to the knee is utilized
- Not indicated in the setting of underlying knee degenerative conditions secondary to the risk of cyst recurrence

It is important to treat the underlying joint disorder, if one exists, in all patients with symptomatic Baker's cysts. This will help reduce the accumulation of synovial fluid and enlargement of the cyst.
