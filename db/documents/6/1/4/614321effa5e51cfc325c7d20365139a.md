Anesthesiologists have several tools for diminishing pain, awareness, movement, and the hemodynamic derangements of stress in the surgical patient. Gaseous anesthetics used most commonly today are a single gas nitrous oxide and volatile fluorinated liquids (isoflurane, desflurane, sevoflurane) administered via specific vaporizers that transform the liquids into gases that diminish and, at higher doses, eradicate patient awareness. This activity reviews the history, proposed function, clinical significance, and pertinent issues concerning of gaseous anesthetics.

**Objectives:**
- Review the use, advantages, and disadvantages of sevoflurane, isoflurane, desflurane, and nitrous oxide.
- Explain the risk and treatment of malignant hyperthermia.
- Outline the physiologic effects of sevoflurane, isoflurane, desflurane, and nitrous oxide.
- Summarize the types, advantages, and disadvantages of gaseous anesthetic agents and outline the role of the interprofessional team in providing pain relief using these medications.
