Patients often need a multi-disciplinary team with a patient-centric approach for comprehensive care. This should include a neurologist/ physician, physiatrist, physiotherapist, nurse, occupational therapist, social worker, and geneticist. Depending on the need, experts in orthopedics, pulmonology, speech therapy, and nephrology give inputs as and when required. The health care provider should coordinate with the other team members to prevent injuries and complications, limit disability, optimize care, and improve the overall quality of life of these patients.
