Some pseudogenes that researchers studied in different species share conserved mutations. Pseudogenes from humans, chimpanzees, dogs, cows, mice, and rats were found to have conserved point mutations at various gene locations. This idea of shared mutations amongst different organisms is thought to have correlations to a common ancestor or evolutionary descent. Mutations that are not deleterious to pseudogenes allow them to persist and undergo evolution with acquired random mutations and genetic drifts. These established pseudogenes can, therefore, be powerful tools for phylogenetic studies investigating the evolution of specific genes.

Pseudogenes can classify into nonprocessed or processed pseudogenes. Processed pseudogenes appear near their paralogous gene form through retrotransposition. The process of retrotransposition occurs through the reintegration of a reverse transcribed mRNA transcript (cDNA) at a new location within the genome. Unprocessed pseudogenes differ from processed forms by retaining their intron-exon structure.
