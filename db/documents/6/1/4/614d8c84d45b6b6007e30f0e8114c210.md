Mast cells are oval or irregularly shaped cells. Under light microscopy, a dense granular cytoplasm is seen, often obscuring the nucleus and other organelles. When it can be visualized, the nucleus is central, and the cell is mononuclear.

Mast cells are found throughout the body in loose connective tissue. Some are randomly dispersed in the tissue. They tend to concentrate near blood vessels, where the cell is more elongated. In the skin, concentrates can also be found near follicles, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands.

There are three morphologies of mast cell noted by light microscopy;

- **Intact Cells**are found near blood vessels as well as deep in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Granules are packed very close, making it hard to make out other cellular structures. As noted above, these cells are spindle-shaped in appearance.

- **Spreading Cells**are found in the superficial connective tissue, near the upper dermis. There are still many granules but fewer than in the intact cell type. This allows a distinction between each granule to be drawn.

- **Degranulated Cells**are no longer metachromatic. They are pale staining, now appearing light pink with a blue nucleus.
