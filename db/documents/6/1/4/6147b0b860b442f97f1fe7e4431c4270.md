Healthcare workers need to be aware that milia are benign and transient dermal cysts of keratin affecting different areas of the skin, most commonly the face (nose, gums, and palate). Despite that these lesions are often seen in about half of full-term newborns, they receive little attention.

The natural course of milia is self-limited and, in most cases, will resolve without scaring at one month of life. However, if present in older children, they could be associated with an underlying inherited skin disorder or be secondary to skin trauma. Thus in older age groups, these possible etiologies may need to be considered by physicians and nurses based on other historical and clinical findings to improve outcomes. But when in doubt about the diagnosis, the patient should be referred to dermatology. Finally, neonatologists, primary care providers, and nursing staff working in nurseries should provide education to caregivers and their families about this skin condition to improve patient-centered care.[Level 5]
