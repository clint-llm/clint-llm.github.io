The location of the fovea is approximately two disc diameters (3 mm on average) temporal to the temporal margin of the optic disc. The physiological blind spot on the visual field corresponds anatomically with the optic disc. In the visual field, the blind spot is located usually at 15 degrees temporal to the point of fixation (anatomically corresponding to fovea).

The Oxford dictionary defines metamorphopsia as 'defective visual perception in which objects appear distorted in shape, size, etc.' The proposed mechanism of metamorphopsia include

- Displacement of photoreceptors causing a defective localization of perceived image

- Using optical coherence tomography (OCT), it has been noted that in epiretinal membrane thickening of the inner nuclear layer (INL) is associated with metamorphopsia while inner segment-outer segment junction status affects visual acuity

- The hypothesis is that 'the structures of horizontal, bipolar, amacrine, and Muller cell bodies, which comprise INL, may change
- This inhibits the function of synaptic junctions and lowers photoreceptor sensitivity, causing metamorphopsia
- Additionally, thickening of GCL (ganglion cell layer) and INL may induce aberration in the retina, and quality of vision may undergo 'deterioration'

- Other visual processing may be involved in the perception of metamorphopsia; this includes cortical processing, and the details of the stimulus/scene might have a role
