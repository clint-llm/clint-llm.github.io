Based on the fact sheets by FDA EUA of casirivimab plus imdevimab, bamlanivimab plus etesevimab, and sotrovimab, these monoclonal antibodies:

- Are not authorized for use in patients or hospitalized with COVID-19, or****who require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19, or who require increasing baseline oxygen therapy due to COVID-19 in those who were previously on chronic oxygen therapy at baseline due to a non-COVID-19 related comorbidity

- Must not be administered to patients with known hypersensitivity to any ingredient of casirivimab, imdevimab, bamlanivimab, etesevimab, or sotrovimab.

The FDA also cautions against the use of casirivimab and imdevimab or bamlanivimab and etesevimab in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation as it may be associated with worse clinical outcomes.

Patients treated with monoclonal antibody therapies should continue self-isolation measures and follow infection control measures such as wearing masks, practicing social distancing, cleaning and disinfecting surfaces, and washing hands frequently according to CDC guidelines.
