Procedural sedation permits the safe performance of procedures that a patient cannot tolerate in the fully conscious state. Through this activity, the practitioner will learn how to assess the airway by direct visual examination, tabulate risk factors by analysis of baseline risk, and will be able to properly choose a medication that we will get the patient safely through the proposed procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the proper medication for procedural sedation based on specific patient risks.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to procedural sedation.
- Review the potential complications and clinical significance of procedural sedation.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance procedural sedation and improve outcomes.
