The prevalence of enuresis is similar across cultures.

Additionally, 20 to 30% of patients with enuresis also suffer from at least one psychological, behavioral, or psychiatric disorder, a rate twice as high as that of the general population.

Also, there is an association between sleep-disordered breathing and enuresis.

Patients with sickle cell disease also show a higher incidence of enuresis.
