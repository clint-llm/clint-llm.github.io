Several factors interfere with the readings obtained from a CVC/PAC. These include patient-related factors such as improper positioning, wrong vein selection, patient movements, or the presence of a thrombus. Faulty device calibration and zeroing are technical issues that affect readings. Catheter-related snags include improper placement of the catheter tip or kinking of the catheter.
