Treatment depends on the severity of brain trauma.

**If no hemorrhage is present on CT or the patient meets criteria that CT is not indicated:**

If the patient has a GCS of 15 and no focal neurologic deficits, the patient has a mild TBI and may be safely discharged. Post-concussive symptoms are possible and should be discussed with the patient. As previously discussed, some symptoms include headaches, mood changes, difficulty concentrating, or nausea. The patient may exhibit no symptoms and have a full recovery, or they may have symptoms that last for days to weeks. Some patients, especially those with a history of recurrent TBIs, may exhibit life-long symptoms. The patient should be cautioned to return for persistent nausea or vomiting, changes in mental status, seizures, weakness, numbness, severe headache, drainage from the ears or nose, or visual changes.   If the patient had GCS of less than 15 or has any concerning exam findings, the patient may require further evaluation. Remember, it is possible to have medical reasons, including ischemic stroke, carotid or aortic dissection, or metabolic etiologies, which can lead to accidental traumatic injuries. The patient may require further laboratory studies or imaging. CT angiography or MRI may be a consideration if a non-contrast CT is non-diagnostic

**If hemorrhage is present on CT:**

Airway

- Maintain SpO2 of at least 92%

- In patients with GCS under 8, intubation should be a strong consideration, as it is unlikely that they will be able to maintain their airway.

Intubation:

- Patients should be pre-oxygenated as the risk of hypoxia outweighs the risk of hyperoxia.

- Historically lidocaine has been used for pre-treatment to blunt sympathetic response to airway manipulation during laryngoscopy, but studies have shown no definitive benefit.

- Etomidate allows hemodynamic stability and is a commonly used first-line agent for induction, though it has a reported risk of adrenal insufficiency. Propofol may be useful in lowering blood pressure, and thus the intracranial pressure in hypertensive patients. It may also have anti-epileptic effects. Ketamine has a theoretical risk of increasing intracranial pressure, though more recent studies have been equivocal on this. It may be useful in hypotensive patients to increase MAP and CPP.

- Paralytic agents such as rocuronium, vecuronium, or succinylcholine may be considered; however, these agents will limit the ability to perform a neurologic exam after administration.

Breathing

- Hyperventilation is somewhat controversial. It may be transiently helpful in patients with increased intracranial pressure as hypocapnia may induce cerebral vasoconstriction and transiently decrease the expansion of hemorrhage; however, this is a temporizing measure to definitive management. Prolonged hypocapnia may cause cerebral ischemia. Targeting low-normal pCO2 of approximately 35 is reasonable.

Circulation

- Maintain normotension with target SBP greater than 90 and less than 140

- Initiate fluid resuscitation with normal saline with the goal of euvolemia.

- If the patient has hypotension that is refractory to fluid resuscitation, vasopressor support should be initiated. Phenylephrine may be the best choice for neurogenic shock as it has pure vasoconstriction effects, and studies have shown that it increases cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) without increasing intracranial pressure (ICP). In patients who are bradycardic due to Cushing's reflex, norepinephrine may be a better choice.

- Packed red blood cells should be transfused for a goal of Hb over 10 mg/dL in severe TBI.

- Coagulopathy should be corrected.

Increased intracranial pressure

- Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) = mean arterial pressure (MAP) - intracranial pressure (ICP)

- Elevation of the head of the bed to 30 degrees or reverse Trendelenburg positioning can lower ICP

- Hyperosmolar therapy via mannitol using bolus of 1 g/kg and/or hypertonic saline (dosing depends on the concentration available and vascular access) may be given to reduce ICP

Seizures

- Patients with severe TBI, including GCS less than 10, cortical contusion, depressed skull fractures, subdural, epidural, subarachnoid, or intracerebral hemorrhage, penetrating head injury are at risk for seizures.

- Seizure activity that is apparent clinically or on EEG should be managed with benzodiazepines and anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs).

- Propofol may be optimal for post-intubation sedation.

- AED prophylaxis should be considered in severe TBI patients. Phenytoin or fosphenytoin are first-line, levetiracetam is an alternative that may have fewer side effects. Prophylaxis should be for 7 days.

Neurosurgery consultation is necessary for patients with intracranial hemorrhage. While some patients may be monitored clinically and have repeat imaging studies to visualize if there is expansion, definitive management may be required. A Burr hole may help to evacuate a hematoma in an emergent setting with herniation. Patients may require a decompressive craniectomy. Patients may require close monitoring of intracranial pressure via an extraventricular drain (goal 10 to 15).

A multi-factorial approach is crucial to the long-term management of patients who have experienced brain trauma.

Rehabilitation

Many patients who have experienced brain trauma benefit from early initiation of rehabilitation services. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy are all considerations. After the initial stabilization, patients may benefit from care in an acute rehabilitation service or hospital, which allows the patient to undergo more intensive therapy. Patients will often need to continue therapy as an outpatient and may require new assistive devices or modifications to their homes or vehicles. Goal-directed treatment focuses on maximizing functional capacity is pursued during rehabilitation.

Psychological impacts

In addition to cognitive dysfunction and residual neurologic deficits, patients who have experienced brain trauma have increased rates of psychological disorders, including mood disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and schizophrenia. Psychotherapy or medications directed toward treating comorbid disorders can improve mental health and decrease the risk of suicide. Patients also benefit from having a network of support in their close friends and family as well as in the community as a whole. Case management or social workers can assist in providing outpatient resources in the community.
