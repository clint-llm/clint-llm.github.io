The main challenge is to distinguish patients with LADA from those with T2DM, with which it is often confused. By definition, T2DM has absent autoantibodies to islet cell components, a high normal or often elevated fasting and stimulated C-peptide, and does not need insulin for an extended period. If the risk factors of T2DM are reduced, there is a good chance of control with non-pharmacological measures with or without minimal medications. Physicians should consider screening for LADA in patients with T2DM who do not achieve adequate glycemic control within a reasonable period despite compliance to therapy. This is particularly true if they are not obese, lack the features of the MetS, or they, or their first degree relatives, have other autoimmune disorders,Â including Hashimoto thyroiditis, Graves disease, celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or pernicious anemia.

T1DM presents dramatically, often with ketoacidosis, needs insulin on detection, and has more than one autoantibody and is easily differentiated from LADA.

Sometimes, a young adult with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is mistakenly diagnosed as T1DM, T2DM, or LADA. MODY is rare, has a strong family history, has residual C-peptide, and absent humoral and cellular immunity to islet cell antigens and can thereby be distinguished from LADA.
