Following surgery for spontaneous intestinal perforation, infants should receive intravenous antibiotics and total parenteral nutrition. The stoma site should be monitored. Intensive medical care, including monitoring intake and output, checking and correcting electrolyte abnormalities, preventing anemia, etc., should be continued post-operatively. Most infants may also require ventilatory support. The introduction of enteral feeds after the surgery should be decided by the primary team and the surgical team based on the postoperative course.
