The primary complications associated with FVD relate to the barriers to communication and social isolation that ineffective phonation may produce. When speaking is difficult or results in ineffective communication, frustration, low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression may result. In psychogenic FVD, the longer the FVD exists, the worse the underlying behavioral health problem may become,Â which can further exacerbate the FVD.
