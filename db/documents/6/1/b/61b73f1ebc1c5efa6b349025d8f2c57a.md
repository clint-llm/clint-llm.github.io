Typically, the superior thoracic artery is the first and only branch off of the first division of the axillary artery. It runs medially along the superior border of the pectoralis minor muscle, inferior to the subclavius and distal to the lateral border of the first rib â€” branches of the superior thoracic artery supply the first and second intercostal spaces. Additionally, the superior portion of the serratus anterior gets its vascular supply by terminal branches of this artery. The intermediate and inferior portions of the serratus anterior muscle are supplied by the lateral thoracic and thoracodorsal arteries, respectively. The superior thoracic artery anastomosis with the several branches of the internal thoracic (mammary) artery.
