The likelihood of Dornase alfa related to systematic toxicity is rare due to its short half-life and poor systemic absorption. In isolated incidences of overdose where patients used 16 times the maximum daily dose tolerated the medication well. Animal data suggests no evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, or teratogenicity was observed. Dornase alfa has been tested negative in genotoxicity assays: the in vitro Ames assay, in vitro mouse lymphoma assay, and in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay.
