A normal finding in a sterile body fluid should be the absence of any pathologic organism in the smear. The organisms are identified based on color and shape. Gram-positive organisms are either purple or blue in color, while gram-negative organisms are either pink or red in color. Bacilli are rod-shaped, while cocci are spherical.

**Findings on gram stain that suggest underlying bacterial infections:**

- Gram-positive cocci in clusters: Usually characteristic of Staphylococcus species such as S. aureus.

- Gram-positive cocci in chains: Usually characteristic of Streptococcus species such as S. pneumoniae, B group streptococci

- Gram-positive cocci in tetrads: Usually characteristic of Micrococcus spp.

- Gram-positive bacilli, thick: Usually characteristic of Clostridium spp., such as C. perfringes, C. septicum.

- Gram-positive bacilli, thin: Usually characteristic of Listeria spp.

- Gram-positive bacilli branched: Usually characteristic of Actinomyces and Nocardia.

- Gram-negative diplococci: Usually characteristic of Neisseria spp., such as N. meningitidis.

(Please note: Moraxella spp., and Acinetobacter spp., are often diplococcal in morphology. Acinetobacter can sometimes appear as Gram-positive cocci, and they can be pleomorphic.

- Coccobacilli: Usually characteristic of Acinetobacter spp., and they can be gram-positive, gram-negative, or gram variable.

- Gram-negative bacilli, thin: Usually characteristic of Enterobacteriaceae, such as E. coli.

- Coccobacilli: Usually characteristic of Hemophilus spp., such as H. influenzae.

- Curved: Usually characteristic of Vibrio spp.,; Campylobacter spp., such as V. cholerae, and C. jejuni.

- Thin needle shape: Usually characteristic of Fusobacterium spp.

Gram variable organisms: these organisms do not group into either gram-positive or gram-negative organisms.
