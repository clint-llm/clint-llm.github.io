Foot deformities are a major source of disability in CMTs. They develop over time and may worsen despite physiotherapy and the use of orthosis. Such patients need surgery to establish plantigrade foot and correct muscle imbalance.

Worsening of CMT related symptoms may occur during pregnancy. There is an increased risk of an abnormal fetal lie, post-partum hemorrhage, and the need for emergency intervention during delivery, and therefore a regular ante-natal checkup is recommended. Neurotoxic drugs and chemotherapeutic agents and co-morbid neuropathic diseases also worsen neuropathy in CMT.
