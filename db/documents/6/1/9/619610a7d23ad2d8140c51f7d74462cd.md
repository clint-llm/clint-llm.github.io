Ropivacaine is a long-acting amide local anesthetic. It exhibits a similar mechanism of action to other local anesthetics in that it reversibly inhibits sodium ion influx in nerve fibers. Amides preferentially bind and inactivate sodium channels in the open state—thereby blocking the propagation of action potentials. The dose-dependent inhibition of potassium channels potentiates this action.

Ropivacaine has a few properties that make it unique. Ropivacaine is less lipophilic than other local anesthetics, such as bupivacaine, and is less likely to penetrate large myelinated motor fibers. It, therefore, selectively acts on the nociceptive A, B, and C fibers over the AB (motor) fibers. Ropivacaine is also manufactured as a pure S(-) enantiomer; the S(-) enantiomer has significantly less cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity.
