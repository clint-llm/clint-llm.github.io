The clinical significance of cardiac index comes from the fact that it is a measure of cardiac function that can be normalized for the patient's body habitus, which means that the clinician can gain critical insight into the patient's heart function given the variations in body type. Often, physicians need to make decisions on medications, treatment options, and educate patients on prognosis given these objective parameters. For example, bedside echocardiogram monitoring in patients with septic shock can help guide the administration of vasopressors and/or dilators to certain patients.

Cardiac index is a hemodynamic measurement used to help evaluate the different forms of shock (circulatory disorders that lead to poor tissue perfusion). There are four main forms of shock:

- Cardiogenic – underlying heart dysfunction (e.g., as a result of myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, or severe mitral/aortic regurgitation)

- Obstructive – obstruction of the heart or its great vessels (e.g., as a result of cardiac tamponade, massive pulmonary embolism, or tension pneumothorax)

- Hypovolemic – loss of intravascular blood volume (e.g., as a result of hemorrhage or non-hemorrhagic fluid loss [diarrhea, vomiting, burns, third spacing, diuresis, adrenal insufficiency])

- Distributive (e.g., septic or anaphylactic shock) – redistribution of body fluid due to vasodilation with/without capillary leakage

One would expect to see a decrease in cardiac index in cardiogenic, obstructive, and hypovolemic shock. In contrast, there is usually a normal to increase in cardiac index in septic and anaphylactic shock.
