Cushing disease is a rare pituitary gland disorder best managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes a neurosurgeon, radiation consultant, endocrinologist, radiologist, primary care provider, nurse practitioner, and an internist. These patients are prone to several complications, including peptic ulcer disease, weight gain, osteoporosis, diabetes, depressed immune system, and hypertension. Hence the patient has to be closely monitored.

Large pituitary lesions usually require resection, but small lesions may be treated with medications. These patients need lifelong follow-up with regular monitoring of cortisol levels.Â  Recurrence of disease is not uncommon, and too much or too little cortisol can be life-threatening.

The prognosis for most patients is somewhat guarded.
