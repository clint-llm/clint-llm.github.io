Overall, the prognosis is good for both the mild and the proximal varieties of hypospadias, provided the defect is repaired early. Lower urinary tract symptoms, including obstructive urinary flow, hesitancy, etc. are common in men after surgical repair of hypospadias, particularly the posterior type. Meatal stenosis, fistula, and urethral stenosis are common complications of hypospadias surgery. Therefore, long-term follow-up until the attainment of “genital maturity” is needed.
