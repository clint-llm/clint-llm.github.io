The clinical course of cystitis cystica is yet undetermined though removing the cause of the irritation can cause the cystic inflammation to regress. Successful treatment and prevention of UTIs can lead to the disappearance of the mucosal changes.

The malignant potential of cystitis cystica remains controversial; however, some anecdotal cases have been reported of a widespread cystitis glandularis and nephrogenic adenoma turning into adenocarcinoma.

Cystitis glandularis intestinal type with dysplastic histology most likely still requires periodic surveillance, while other types of cystitis cystica and cystitis glandularis probably don't.

Nephrogenic adenoma has a high recurrent rate, so periodic follow-up cystoscopies are suggested.
