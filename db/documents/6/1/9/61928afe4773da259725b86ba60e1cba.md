Less than 1% of patients with 22q11.2 microdeletion have complete DGS, the most severe subtype of DGS with a very poor prognosis. Without thymic or hematopoietic cell transplantation, these patients die by 12 months of age. Even with a transplant, however, prognosis remains poor. In a study of 50 infants who received a thymic transplant for complete DGS, only 36 survived to two years.

Patients with partial DGS do not have a defined prognosis, as this depends on the severity of the pathologies associated with the disease. While some do not survive infancy due to severe cardiac anomalies, many survive into adulthood. DGS may be vastly underdiagnosed, and many undiagnosed adults with DGS thrive in the community with undetectable congenital anomalies and minor intellectual and/or social impairment. Improvements in genetic diagnostics will hopefully improve understanding of DGS in the future.
