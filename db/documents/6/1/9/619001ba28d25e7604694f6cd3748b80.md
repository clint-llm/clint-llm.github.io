**Application of the Schirmer's Test in Patients Undergoing Upper or Lower Blepharoplasty**

For patients who are undergoing upper or lower blepharoplasty, it is important to ensure that symptoms and signs that may indicate current or postoperativeÂ dryness of the eyes should be assessed carefully. These include:

- History of prior eyelid surgery

- History of prior corneal laser surgery

- History of dry eyes

- Symptoms of scratchiness or grittiness

- Scleral show

- Slow blink (Parkinson disease, myasthenia gravis)

- Lagophthalmos

- Negative malar vector

- Lower eyelid laxity

- Lower eyelid snapback test

The value of routine preoperative Schirmer's tests in patients undergoing blepharoplasty has been debated. McKinney reported that abnormal tear film breakup time and Schirmer's test were not good predictors of postoperative dry eyes after blepharoplasty. However, if a patient presents with symptoms and signs which indicate current or future dryness, Schirmer's test can be useful. A reading below 5 mm should suggest that the patient be investigated and treated by an ophthalmologist. There is decreased tear production with increasing age, and pathology studies have shown progressive acinar atrophy and fibrosis of the lacrimal glands with increasing age.
