Determining the true incidence of MALA is challenging since it represents a spectrum of illnesses ranging from coincidental metformin use in critically ill patients to acute metformin overdose in the absence of other causal pathology. Additionally, data show a poor correlation between metformin levels, pH, and lactate levels leading to speculation regarding causality and diagnostic accuracy of attributing hyperlactatemia and metabolic acidosis to metformin overdose.
