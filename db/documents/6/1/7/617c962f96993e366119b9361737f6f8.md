**Guidelines and Recommendations**

The 2015 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (AAAAI), and American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (ACAAI) anaphylaxis practice parameter describe inadequate evidence for the use of H2-blockers in the treatment of anaphylaxis; however, H2-blockers can be considered adjunct therapy after the administration of epinephrine.

The 2009 American College of Gastroenterology guideline for the prevention of NSAID-related ulcer complications conclude that double-strength H2-blockers may reduce the risk of NSAID-induced endoscopic peptic ulcers. However, this guideline also concludes that H2 blockers are inferior to proton pump inhibitors for this indication.

The 2016 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommend H2-blockers or proton pump inhibitors be used in patients with risk factors for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The 2016 American Society of Anesthesiologists guideline for obstetric anesthesia suggest consideration of non-particulate antacids, H2 blockers and/or metoclopramide to prevent aspiration.
