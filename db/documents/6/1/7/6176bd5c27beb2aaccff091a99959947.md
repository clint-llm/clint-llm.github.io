While it may appear that ascites is a GI related problem, the pathology affects almost all organ systems and has very high morbidity and mortality. Ascites is not a benign disorder and depending on the cause can have a mortality exceeding 20%.

Countless articles on a multidisciplinary approach have been published so that the morbidity and mortality can be improved. Besides the gastroenterologist the following interprofessional group of health professionals is highly recommended:

- Pharmacist to oversee all medications and be alert for drugs that cause liver injury

- Nurses to monitor body weight, abdominal girth, prevent deep vein thrombosis, encourage ambulation and educate the patient and family about the importance of a low sodium diet

- Internist to monitor coagulation parameters and general health of the patient

- Surgeon in case the patient needs decompression of the portal system or a liver transplant

- Nephrologist to monitor renal function

**Outcomes and Evidence-based Medicine**

Overall the prognosis is much worse for patients who have decompensated cirrhosis compared to those with compensated cirrhosis. Even patients who are ambulatory and have cirrhotic ascites have a 3-year mortality rate of 50%. Patients with refractory ascites have a 1-year survival of less than 50%. There are many evidence-based studies on managing patients with ascites.
