The severity of symptoms in patients with PSVT depends on any underlying structural heart disease, the frequency of PSVT episodes, and the patient's hemodynamic reserve. Usually, patients with PSVT present with symptoms of dizziness, syncope, nausea, shortness of breath, intermittent palpitations, pain or discomfort in the neck, pain or discomfort in the chest, anxiety, fatigue, diaphoresis, and polyuria secondary atrial natriuretic factor secreted mainly by the heart's atria in response to atrial stretch. The most common symptoms are dizziness and palpitations. Patients with PSVT and a known history of coronary artery disease may present with a myocardial infarction secondary to the stress on the heart. Patients with PSVT and a known history of heart failure may come in with acute exacerbation. Frequent PSVTs in a patient can result in new-onset of heart failure secondary to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.

A detailed history of the patient with PSVT should include past medical and cardiac history, time of symptom onset, prior episodes, and treatments. The patients' current medication listÂ must be obtained. Investigations of involvement in physical activities such as exercise or outdoor sports should be made, as patients who have symptomatic PSVT's avoid such hobbies. Patients presenting with PSVTs should get a thorough physical exam, including vital signs (respiratory rate, blood pressure, temperature, and heart rate) to help assess their hemodynamic stability.
