Prognosis can vary significantly in tibial neuropathy. Mild cases can respond well to conservative treatments such as therapy, orthotics, and over-the-counter anti-inflammatories. Although, if symptoms are severe or do not improve, further workup should be pursued. If the cause of tibial neuropathy is diagnosed and treated quickly, recovery is likely.

As with other neuropathic injuries, there can be residual pain and numbness depending on the degree of nerve injury. Prolonged nerve injury may result in significant weakness and atrophy in the tibial innervated muscles. Surgical intervention is less likely to succeed in larger tibial nerve lesions or patients requiring re-operation.
