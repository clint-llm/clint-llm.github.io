Any patient presenting to the outpatient department or with a family history of glaucoma should be thoroughly screened for glaucoma. Ophthalmologists play a crucial role in diagnosing and deciding the type of intervention for glaucoma severity. The ophthalmologist chooses the type of MIGS needed to reduce the IOP. The optometrists, nursing staff, operation theater assistants, and counselors play a vital role in the mild to moderate glaucoma management with MIGS.
