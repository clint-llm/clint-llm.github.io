First degree AV block can originate from various locations within the conduction system. The levels of conduction delay include the atrium, AV node (most common in first-degree heart block), Bundle of His, bundle branches, fascicles, Purkinje system. Mobitz type I second degree AV block usually occurs within the AV node, while Mobitz type II second degree AV block mainly originates from conduction system disease below the level of the AV node (in the bundle of His and in the bundle branches). In third-degree AV block, no atrial impulses reach the ventricle- it can occur in the AV node or in the infranodal specialized conduction system.

The following medications can affect different levels of conduction delay:

1) Increased parasympathetic tone, digoxin (which upgrades vagotonic action), calcium channel blockers (which obstructs the inward calcium current responsible for depolarization) and beta-blockers can affect the AV node

2) Medications such as procainamide, quinidine, and disopyramide can block sodium channels and delay conduction in the bundle of His

3) Similarly though rarely, medications such as procainamide, quinidine, and disopyramide can also delay infra-Hisian conduction system
