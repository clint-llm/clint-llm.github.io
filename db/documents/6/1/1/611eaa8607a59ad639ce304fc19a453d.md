To begin, place the transducer below the xiphoid process in the transverse alignment. Perform a complete scan through the bifurcation of the aorta around the level of the umbilicus. Several consecutive videos may be necessary to image the entire aorta. Measure the abdominal aorta at its maximal diameter to include each outer wall. Dimensions are most precise with the probe positioned completely perpendicular to the aorta. Perform a similar scan in the sagittal view with the transducer position towards the patient’s head.

Be sure to include any visible thrombus. Thrombus will appear as an echogenic substance within the aorta. However, it is easily overlooked. Generally, it is best visualized along the anterolateral wall and may create a false lumen that underestimates the actual extent of an aortic aneurysm.

In unstable patients, providers should routinely complete a right upper quadrant ultrasound to evaluate for pathologic fluid. The majority of AAAs rupture in the retroperitoneum (70% to 90%), where ultrasound cannot assess routinely. Nevertheless, one study established a sensitivity of 97% for identifying ruptured AAAs when point of care ultrasound was combined with clinical gestalt.

Lastly, sonographic assessment of the aorta includes assessing for the occurrence of an undulating intimal flap, the pathognomonic finding that is 100% specific for aortic dissections. Strict blood pressure management and emergent surgical consultation are mandated.
