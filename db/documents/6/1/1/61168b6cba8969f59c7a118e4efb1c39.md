Refractive errors can result in several visual deficits.

The clinician should carefully take note of the specifics of the particular astigmatic dial being used, as they have slightly different interpretations and procedures. Clinicians must also ensure that the correct axis and powers of astigmatism are dispensed to the patient, as this can be another source of error even after a good examination.

In cases where the patient reports discomfort or spectacle intolerance, an over-refraction process is useful in determining any residual refractive error.
