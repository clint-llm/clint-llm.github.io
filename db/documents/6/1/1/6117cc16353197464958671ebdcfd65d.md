The most common adverse drug reactions of transdermal fentanyl are nausea (incidence of 10 to 90%), vomiting (incidence of 10 to 90%), and constipation.

As is characteristic of opioids, the withdrawal of transdermal fentanyl may result in additional adverse side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and shivering. These symptoms may occur when decreasing dosage, abrupt cessation of use, or changing to an alternative opioid medication.
