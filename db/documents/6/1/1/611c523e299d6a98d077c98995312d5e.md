The complement system is a crucial part of the innate humoral immune system. The purpose of the complement system is to orchestrate opsonization, facilitate cytotoxic destruction and formulate membrane attack complexes (MAC), and liberation of peptides that promote the inflammatory response. Complement deficiencies are primary immunodeficiencies that cause various clinical scenarios depending on the specific complement protein that is deficient. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of complement deficiency and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of complement deficiency.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of complement deficiency.
- Review the management options available for complement deficiency.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of complement deficiency and improve outcomes.
