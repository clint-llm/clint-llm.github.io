Aseptic meningitis can be complicated by seizures and progress to status epilepticus. This complicationÂ requires treatment, but prophylaxis is not recommended.

A variable component of encephalitis may occur concomitantly with viral meningitis. Sensorineural deafness and aqueductal stenosis, causing hydrocephalus, can result from mumps meningoencephalitis. Hydrocephalus, infarcts, epilepsy, mental regression, neurological deficits, and cranial nerve palsies can be caused by tuberculosis meningitis.
