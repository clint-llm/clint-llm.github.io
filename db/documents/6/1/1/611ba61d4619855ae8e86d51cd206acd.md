Lipoprotein disorders are clinically important due to the of the role of lipoproteins in atherogenesis and the associated risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). For patients with known ASCVD (secondary prevention), cholesterol-lowering leads to a consistent reduction in cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular events in men and women and middle-aged and older patients. Among patients without cardiovascular disease (primary prevention), the data on reduction in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events with statin drugs is also well documented. This activity reviews the cause and pathophysiology of hypercholesterolemia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Recall the risk factors for hypercholesterolemia.
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with hypercholesterolemia.
- Summarize the treatment options for hypercholesterolemia.
- Explore modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by hypercholesterolemia.
