**Consent**

Part of the preparation process includes informed patient consent. The surgeon should discuss the postoperative course expected timeframe for donor and recipient site healing and the concept of skin grafting with the patient.

**Wound Bed**

Aside from preparing the equipment mentioned above, the most crucial aspect of preparation is creating a clean wound bed suitable to accept a split-thickness skin graft. Debridement of the wound bed is possible in multiple ways. The recipient bed should be debrided with a scalpel, Norsen debrider, dermatome, or hydrosurgery device until the wound bed has healthy bleeding tissue at the base.

Without a clean wound base, the split-thickness skin graft cannot undergo the normal phases of skin graft healing.

**Donor Site**

The donor site should be chosen based on the amount of skin graft needed, surgical positioning of the patient, ease of donor site harvest, and aesthetics. Broad, flat regions like the anterolateral thighs, back, trunk, lateral arm/forearm, lateral lower leg serve as the easiest donor sites when using a mechanical dermatome because they are firm surfaces against which the dermatome operator can push. The thighs and back provide a large surface area from which to harvest a skin graft. Aesthetically, donor sites that will be routinely covered by clothing are typically chosen, such as the thighs.Â  Skin from the back and the thighs is typically thicker than skin from other parts of the body; thus, skin graft harvest thickness requires adjustment for this (thicker graft used in the area of high stress, thinner graft used to match thin recipient skin). In large wounds or burns, donor sites are subject to limitation by the location of remaining healthy skin.
