Conservative treatment is usually sufficient for injuries to the peroneus brevis tendon; surgery to reattach or reconstruct the tendon may be necessary for highly active individuals. Different repair techniques are appropriate depending on the specific injury and grade of damage to the peroneus tendon. Peroneal tendon subluxation, for example, can be managed via a direct retinaculum repair, a deepening of the retro-malleolar groove, tendon grafting, or rerouting procedures.

The peroneus brevis muscle is used in reconstructive and plastic surgery of the lower extremity, most commonly in non-healing wounds related to diabetic lower extremity ulcers. Plastic surgeons use the peroneus brevis muscle flap to reconstruct small defects in the lower third of the anterior leg.
