The first approach to a CADR is to initiate the withdrawal of medication. This approach can be used if the offending medication can be replaced with another drug, or if the skin reaction is severe enough to require the rapid cessation of suspect drugs (evaluation of the risk/benefit ratio).

The search for bibliographic information and the pharmacovigilance statement is essential.

Treatment of CADR is mainly symptomatic consisting of topical corticosteroids and oral antihistaminics. Oral corticosteroids (0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone) are frequently used, but no evidence of their efficacy has been reported. Severe toxidermia may occur with a systemic corticosteroid.

Hospitalization is indicated when there are certain signs of severity:

- Cutaneous: Skin surface > 60%, erythema confluence, facial edema, skin pain, palpable purpura, skin necrosis, bullae or epidermal detachment, positive Nikolski sign, mucosal erosions, urticaria, and/or tongue edema

- General: High fever, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia or arthritis, expiratory dyspnea, hypotension

- Biological: Eosinophilia greater than 1000 / mm3, lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes, liver function abnormalities
