**DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Substance Use Disorder**

Two or more of the following in a 12-month period manifests a problematic pattern of use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress:

- Often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended

- A persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control use

- A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain, use, or recover from the substance’s effects

- Craving or a strong desire or urge to use the substance.

- Recurrent use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home

- Continued use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by its effects

- Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of use.

- Recurrent use in situations in which it is physically hazardous.

- Continued use despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by the substance

- Tolerance

- Withdrawal

**Disorder Severity**: DSM-5 specifies mild, moderate, and severe based on the number of diagnostic criteria met by the patient at the time of diagnosis:

- Mild: Two to 3 criteria

- Moderate: Four4 to 5 criteria

- Severe: Six or more criteria

**DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder**

- Recurrent drinking resulting in failure to fulfill role obligations

- Recurrent drinking in hazardous situations

- Continued drinking despite alcohol-related social or interpersonal problems

- Evidence of tolerance

- Evidence of alcohol withdrawal or use of alcohol for relief or avoidance of withdrawal

- Drinking in larger amounts or over longer periods than intended

- Persistent desire or unsuccessful attempts to stop or reduce drinking

- A great deal of time spent obtaining, using, or recovering from alcohol

- Important activities are given up or reduced because of drinking

- Continued drinking despite knowledge of physical or psychological problems caused by alcohol

- Alcohol Craving

**Disorder Severity**: The severity of alcohol use disorder at the time of diagnosis can be specified as a subtype based on the number of symptoms present:

- Mild: Two to 3 symptoms

- Moderate: Four to 5 symptoms

- Severe: Six or more symptoms

**Laboratory Tests**

**Substance Abuse**

- Drug of abuse screen

- Urine drug levels

- Blood drug levels

- Hair drug levels

- Saliva drug levels

- Breath drug levels

**Alcohol**

Diagnosis of alcohol problem can be made in the outpatient department by using the CAGE questionnaire, which includes the questions: (need to) cut down, annoyance (on drinking), guilt (about drinking), an "eye-opener."

Screening tools like the 10 question Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) and the abbreviated 3-question audit-consumption (Audit-C) are recommended for screening.

Laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis include:

- Serum alcohol concentration

- Direct alcohol biomarkers: Ethyl glucuronide.

- Liver enzymes: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, and albumin test for liver damage. An AST: ALT ratio of 2:1 is indicative of alcohol-induced liver disease

- Hemoglobin, complete blood count (CBC): To determine the presence and severity of anemia, pancytopenia, and macrocytosis. A mean corpuscular volume greater than 100 fL constitutes macrocytosis. Pancytopenia and macrocytosis usually require very heavy and prolonged use and often liver disease.

- Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT): Is an indicator of excessive alcohol use when elevated (normal reference ranges: 8 to 40 units/L for females and 9 to 50 units/L for males).

- The patient's social network, especially family, should be involved in treatment to the extent possible (and agreed to by the patient, if a legally competent adult), to provide additional history and therapeutic support and help monitor the patient's progress and adherence to treatment.
