When a clinician prescribes a patient a low residue diet, they should also be encouraged to maintain daily records of which foods they consume. Documentation will allow the healthcare team to support and ensure that patients are adherent to the dietary changes. The primary responsibility belonging to the patient will enable them to contribute to their care. This integrated approach is essential to deliver the best possible care and to improve patient outcomes.
