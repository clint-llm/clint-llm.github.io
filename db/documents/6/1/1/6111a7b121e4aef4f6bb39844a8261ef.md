Exenatide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist released from the gut and acts to increase glucose-dependent insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells, suppress glucagon secretion, delay gastric emptying, and reduce food intake. The binding of the drug to pancreatic GLP-1 receptors mediates these actions.

The incidence of hypoglycemia is lower with exenatide than other diabetic therapies due to the glucose-dependent release of insulin. Administration of exenatide has shown restoration in the insulin response that is usually defective in type 2 diabetic patients. Researchers also observed the prolonged release of insulin in response to elevated glucose levels was also observed in patients treated with exenatide.

Treatment with exenatide leads to the decreased release of glucagon during hyperglycemic periods, which reduces hepatic glucose output as well as decreases insulin demand. Delayed gastric emptying decreases the rate at which glucose arrives in the bloodstream.

The release of insulin and the suppression of glucagon occur during hyperglycemic and euglycemic conditions. Exenatide reduces the likelihood of a hypoglycemic episode when administered to a diabetic patient when used by itself. If combining exenatide with other medications that cause hypoglycemia, there is an increased likelihood of a hypoglycemic event.
