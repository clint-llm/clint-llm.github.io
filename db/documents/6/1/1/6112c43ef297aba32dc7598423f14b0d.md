Miliary tuberculosis has high morbidity and mortality if not managed properly. Delay in diagnosis and lack of initiation of specific antituberculosis treatment appears to be the most important factor responsible for mortality. The mortality related to miliary TB is about 15 to 20 % in children and is slightly higher in adults [25% to 30%].
