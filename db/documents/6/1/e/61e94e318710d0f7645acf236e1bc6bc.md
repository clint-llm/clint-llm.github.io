Age is the most common factor for rotator cuff disease. It is a degenerative process that is progressive.

Partial tears are at risk for further propagation. These risk factors include: tear size, symptoms, location, and age. Tear size: A small tear may remain dormant, while larger tears are more likely to undergo structural deterioration. The critical size for sending a small tear towards a larger or complete tearÂ has yet to be defined.
