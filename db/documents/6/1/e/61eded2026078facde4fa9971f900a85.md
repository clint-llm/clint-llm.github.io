Cervical spondylosis is a term that encompasses a wide range of progressive degenerative changes that affect all the components of the cervical spine (i.e., intervertebral discs, facet joints, joints of Luschka, ligamenta flava, and laminae). It is a natural process of aging and presents in the majority of people after the fifth decade of life.
