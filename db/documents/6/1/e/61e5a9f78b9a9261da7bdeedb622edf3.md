**Lab Findings**

- In X-linked AHC with adrenal insufficiency, lab findings show electrolyte disturbances, including hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, and metabolic acidosis.

- Adrenal functions show a high ACTH level and low or baseline cortisol level.

- There is increased plasma renin activity, decreased aldosterone level, and no response to high-dose Cosyntropin stimulation.

- The 17-OH-progesterone level is normal or low.

- Androgen secretion is also impaired, and there are low androstenedione and low testosterone levels.

- Growth hormone deficiency may be present. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) test may show impaired gonadotropin secretion.

**Genetic Screening**

Precise genetic screening is advisable when adrenal hypoplasia is suspected. Identify the carrier status of women in the family.

**Imaging Studies**

- Adrenal imaging, including CT and MRI, are necessary. Imaging may show small size adrenal glands. An ultrasound of adrenals may demonstrate small for age adrenal glands.

- A detailed gastroenterological and neurological evaluation should take place.

- Rarely, the patient may present with respiratory distress or other respiratory symptoms. Adrenal hypoplasia should be taken into account if a child is having respiratory symptoms along with electrolyte disturbances, and hypoglycemia. In AHC, due to DAX1 mutation, elevated 11-deoxycortisol levels have been noticed if checked very early in life.

- Schirmer test is a recommended procedure in Triple-A syndrome.
