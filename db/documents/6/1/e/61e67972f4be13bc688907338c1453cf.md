A typical presentation is in a post-menopausal woman or, uncommonly, in a younger woman. Ovarian tumors in children and adolescents could be associated with Gorlin syndrome.

Symptoms related to ovarian tumors could remain indolent for a long time unless the tumor secretes steroid hormones. Androgen excess may present as virilization, and estrogen excess may present as abnormal uterine bleeding, endometrial neoplasm, and in a child as precocious puberty. Other symptoms related to the tumor are abdominal distension due to a large tumor, uterine prolapse, urinary incontinence, fatigue, weight loss, and pedal edema.

Symptoms related to pleural effusion include dyspnea, dry cough, and pleurisy. The pleural effusions are usually right-sided, even though the left and bilateral effusions are possible. The size of the pleural effusion is independent of the size of the ascites.

Symptoms related to ascites include abdominal distension.

The physical exam may show palpable adnexal masses on abdominal or transvaginal examination, signs of pleural effusion like diminished breath sounds, egophony on pulmonary auscultation, dullness on chest percussion, jugular venous distension, and/or signs of ascites such as distended abdomen with fluid thrill. A thorough lymph node and skin examination should be conducted to look for skin cancers, especially basal cell cancer.
