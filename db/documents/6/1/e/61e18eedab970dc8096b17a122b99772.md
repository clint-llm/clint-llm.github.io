The direction and strength of the force imparted may predict the type of injury.

- Flexion

- Extension

- Rotation

- Lateral bending

- Distraction (stretching)

- Compression (axial loading)

Multiple forces may be generated in complex mechanism injuries such as high-speed rollover motor vehicle collision.

Beware that, the full extent of the injury may not be apparent initially.

Lesions that appear incomplete initially may evolve into a complete lesion.

In spinal cord injury, many pathophysiologic processes occur. This is due to free radicals, vasogenic edema, and altered blood flow resulting in clinical decompensation.
