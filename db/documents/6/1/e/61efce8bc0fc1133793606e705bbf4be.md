Children with radial dysplasia will present with a wide variety of abnormal thumb and forearm manifestations, as the disease represents a spectrum ranging from mild to severe. They will often present with a radially-directed angulation deformity of the hand such that the hand is often perpendicular to the forearm. The thumb is generally hypoplastic or absent. The bony abnormalities are most apparent, but underlying muscles, tendons, nerves, and joints are affected as well. The ulna is also short and bowed radially as well, generally matching the degree of radial deficiency.
