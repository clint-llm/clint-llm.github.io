Palpation of peripheral pulses in a patient with strong systolic blood pressure in a controlled setting by an experienced clinician is an important and reliable physical examination skill. However, several studies show that when those ideal conditions degrade through the presence of pathology, time or environmental pressures, or clinician inexperience, the reliability of the maneuver decreases. In these cases, modern medical technology, as mentioned above, can assist in assessing peripheral pulses and determining the presence of pathology.
