Diagnosis is typically made on plain radiographs demonstrating Pellegrini-Stieda sign accompanied by pain or restriction of range-of-motion of the knee joint. Pellegrini-Stieda sign is typically described by a longitudinally linear opacity, characteristic of calcification in the soft tissue located medial to the medial femoral condyle. This calcification seen on imaging represents the ossification of the medial collateral ligament, which typically does not develop until approximately three weeks after the initial injury.
