An M-plasty is an excisional technique used to remove standing cutaneous deformities, also known as dog ears, from the end of a linear wound repair. This technique is also used for limiting the total length of a linear scar, typically to prevent extension across aesthetic subunit boundaries. This CME activity describes the indications, contraindications, and techniques involved in performing M-plasties and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the pre-operative and post-operative care of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for performing an M-plasty.
- Describe the technique involved in performing an M-plasty.
- Review the complications associated with M-plasty.
- Outline the importance of enhancing care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients undergoing M-plasty.
