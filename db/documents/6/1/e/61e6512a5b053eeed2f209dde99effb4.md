Stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide, with a prevalence of about 2.5%.

In other words, one hour of ischemic brain damage can be compared to 3.6 years of normal brain aging. Acute stroke therapeutics aim to contain the tissue damage happening at the 'penumbra' level and restore the penumbra's functionality. Alteplase, a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), is the only United States FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved clot-busting medication used to recanalize the thrombosed / occluded vasculature in an ischemic stroke.
