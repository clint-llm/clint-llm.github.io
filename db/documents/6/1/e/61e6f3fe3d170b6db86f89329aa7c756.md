EBV positive mucocutaneous ulcer has a favorable prognosis. Most cases regress spontaneously or with a reduction of immunosuppressive therapy. Some case reports have described a relapsing and remitting course without progression. Persistent cases have been reported to resolve with radiation, chemotherapy, or other localized treatments.
