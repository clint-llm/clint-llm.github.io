Multifocal, diffuse demyelination, axonal loss, and myelopathic spongy vacuolation, particularly in the white matter of the spinal cord, are the first changes observed in subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Demyelinating changes predominately affect the dorsal column and lateral corticospinal tracts, and sometimes the spinothalamic tracts.

Microscopic examination shows initial swelling of the largest myelin sheaths fibers, which progresses to the destruction of myelin. There is an accumulation of macrophages and lymphocytes on the myelin sheaths. If treatment is not administered promptly, dense gliosis of the tissue is observed.
