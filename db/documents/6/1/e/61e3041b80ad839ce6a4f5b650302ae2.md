A corneal foreign body (FB) may present in an insidious manner or, more frequently, with an acute onset of multiple ocular symptoms. Symptoms include hyperemia, eye pain, decreased visual acuity, blepharospasm, and photophobia. Timely removal of an FB reduces the potential for corneal compromise. The nature of the event may determine the course of healing. Small, superficial FB are easily removed with little risk of negative sequelae. Foreign bodies more deeply embedded or located centrally are likely to result in visually significant scarring. The external debris may be contaminated inoculating the eye with bacterial, viral, or fungal elements leading to subsequent infection. Penetrating ocular injuries may have dire effects leading to blindness. A positive Seidel sign indicates a corneal perforation. Iris and pupillary abnormalities, hyphema, and lenticular trauma are signs suggestive of serious ocular trauma. Suspect intraocular penetration if, despite meticulous examination, no FB is found. It is imperative to seek emergency ophthalmic care if intraocular trauma is suspected.
