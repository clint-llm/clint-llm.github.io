Cerebral edema can be asymptomatic, merely seen on imaging, or it can cause life-threatening complications. The history can help provide insights as to the etiology of the cerebral edema.  Patients may have a history of trauma, a hypoxic event, cancer, metabolic diseases or other factors which can help identify the possible etiology of the cerebral edema.

The physical exam findings of cerebral edema can vary widely depending on the location and extent of the cerebral edema.  Localized cerebral edema can cause dysfunction of the edematous brain and include weakness, visual disturbances, seizures, sensory changes, diplopia, and other neurologic disturbances.  For diffuse cerebral edema, the patient may have headaches, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, altered mental status, confusion, coma, seizure or other manifestations.  With diffuse or focal cerebral edema the patient can develop increased intracranial pressure (ICP) which typically presents with headaches, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, cranial neuropathy, altered mental status to coma and death.
