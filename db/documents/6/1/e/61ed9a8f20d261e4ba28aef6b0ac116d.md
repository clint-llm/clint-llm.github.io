Regional anesthesia techniques require a thorough knowledge of the potential complications associated with a given procedure. The complications associated with peripheral nerve blocks include infection, bleeding, nerve damage, and local anesthetic toxicity. Systemic toxicity of local anesthetics is related to either intravascular injection or an excessive dose beyond the toxic dose limits. Treatment in this emergency includes the immediate administration of intravenous intralipid and hemodynamic supportive measures.

The Second American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine Practice Advisory on Neurologic Complications Associated With Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine sheds particular light on the complications associated with mechanical, ischemic, or neurotoxic lesions of the peripheral nervous system.

Since the PENG block is a new regional anesthesia technique, we do not have enough epidemiological studies to describe the main specific complications of this type of block.

Thanks to the practice of PENG block only under the ultrasound-guided technique, the risk of femoral nerve damage or vascular damage (with hematoma) remains extremely rare at the current time. The incidence of long-term peripheral nerve damage represents 2 to 4 cases per 10,000 peripheral nerve blocks of all types.
