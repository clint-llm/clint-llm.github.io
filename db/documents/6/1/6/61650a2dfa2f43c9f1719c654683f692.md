HCM is a complex clinical syndrome of multiple different potential etiologies that has considerable potential for morbidity and mortality.

Early recognition of HCM is important to limit morbidity and complications

Exogenous causes of HCM require careful exclusion before embarking on investigation for endogenous etiologies.

The diagnosis of endogenous HCM involves a three-tiered approach that includes comprehensive screening, diagnosis confirmation, and anatomic localization of the causative lesion(s).

While surgical intervention generally offers the best potential for the cure of HCM, several medical adjunctive treatment options can enable management of the metabolic state of HCM even if surgery is not feasible or curative.
