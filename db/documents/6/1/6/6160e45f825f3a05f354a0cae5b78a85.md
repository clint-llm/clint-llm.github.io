The production of TxA2 is via a sequential process that begins with arachidonic acid (AA). Arachidonic acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid present in the phospholipid membrane of the body’s cells. In the setting of inflammation, phospholipase A2 cleaves arachidonic acid from the cell’s membrane and, through one pathway, is converted to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) via the action of the enzyme COX. There are two evolutionarily conserved COX isoforms, including COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is constitutively expressed in platelets, and COX-2 is an inducible form found only in a small fraction of circulating platelets under normal conditions. COX-2 is shown to have increased expression in newly formed platelets and during times of inflammation and other provoked settings compared to normal conditions. PGH2 ultimately converts into the product TxA2 via the enzyme TXAS.
