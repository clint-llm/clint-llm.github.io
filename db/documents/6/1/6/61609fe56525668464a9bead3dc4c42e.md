Degenerative spondylosis is a general term for degenerative changes in the spine and a common cause of non-specific neck and back pain among older adults. When degenerative changes result in the narrowing of the spinal canal, myelopathy, or neurologic deficits related to spinal cord compression, can result. Stenotic damage to the spinal cord is thought to be the result of two processes: direct compression of the neural elements and ischemia related to disruption of arterial and venous structures surrounding the spinal cord.

MSCC from a solid tumor typically results from hematogenous spread of malignant cells to a vertebral body. In the case of pelvic tumors, i.e., prostate cancer, Batson venous plexus is hypothesized to account for the promotion of vertebral metastasis via shunting of venous blood from the abdomen and pelvis to the epidural venous plexus during Valsalva maneuver. In approximately 10% of cases, direct spread from a paraspinal mass can occur; this is most commonly seen with lymphoma. Over time, an enlarging vertebral mass can compress the spinal vasculature, thecal sac, and spinal cord resulting in pain and neurologic deficits. Destruction of the vertebral body can also result in a compression deformity with direct compression of bony fragments on the spinal cord. The thoracic spine is most commonly implicated in MSCC, followed by the lumbar and cervical vertebral levels. Spinal cord tumors make up a rare percent of spinal malignancy, representing 4% to 10% of CNS tumors and only 1% of all cancers.

SEA most commonly results from the hematogenous spread (26% to 50% of cases). As the epidural space is a vertical sheath, SEA can spread over several vertebral levels. SEA can also occur from the extension of a contiguous soft tissue/bony infection, i.e., psoas abscess, vertebral osteomyelitis, or via direct inoculation from a spinal procedure or surgery. Risk factors for SEA include IV drug use; any condition resulting in bacteremia (i.e., dental abscess, infection of an indwelling vascular catheter, infective endocarditis); epidural catheter placement; and paraspinal analgesic/steroid injection. Other risk factors include diabetes, immunosuppression secondary to HIV or medications, alcoholism, trauma, or acupuncture. Staphylococcus aureus is identified as the causative organism in over 50% of cases; other bacterial species identified include Escherichia coli, Streptococcal species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Damage can be caused either by direct compression from abscess formation or inflammatory vascular thrombosis; the latter is responsible for sudden neurologic deficits that can be observed among patients with spinal epidural abscess.

Any procedure involving puncture into the spinal canal, most commonly neuraxial analgesia, can result in hemorrhage and resulting SEH formation. Although bleeding most commonly originates from the epidural venous plexus, subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage can also be seen. SEH formation within the spinal canal results in increased pressure, spinal cord ischemia, and subsequent infarction resulting in neurologic deficits. Risk factors for procedure-related SEH include preexisting coagulopathy (i.e., anticoagulant use, advanced renal disease, thrombocytopenia, preeclampsia), procedural difficulty, advanced age, and anatomic spinal abnormalities. SSEH has achieved increased recognition concurrent with the increased use of direct oral anticoagulants and vitamin K antagonist therapy for various conditions, including venous thromboembolism, atrial fibrillation, and mechanical valve placement.
