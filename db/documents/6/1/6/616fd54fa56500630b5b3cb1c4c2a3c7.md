The most feared complication with medical management is the rupture of the false aneurysm. Of those who survive medical management, stroke is the next most concerning due to thrombus that is often within the false aneurysm sac. Complications following surgery are similar to those for other complex open-heart operations, including death, hemorrhage, arrhythmia, stroke, and infection. Rarely, patients may form recurrent false aneurysms after the initial repair, presumably due to inadequate apposition of the patch to healthy myocardium or if the patch was sutured to the pseudoaneurysmal tissue.Â  Other complications after surgery can result from the excessive reduction of left ventricular cavity volume.

After a transcatheter approach to close the false aneurysm, the patient can have bleeding, hematoma formation, and infection at the site of the femoral incision. The catheter itself can lead to the perforation of myocardial walls and the development of new arrhythmias necessitating the use of pacemakers.
