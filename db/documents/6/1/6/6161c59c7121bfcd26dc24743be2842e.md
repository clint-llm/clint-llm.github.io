The chronic liver failure (CLIF) organ failure score can be used to predict mortality in patients with ACLF. The score is directly proportional to the number of organ failures. A CLIF score above 64 always requires immediate consideration of liver transplantation. The etiology of the precipitating factor leading to ACLF does not alter the prognosis. The most common etiology of ACLF is infection and patients with infections are de-listed from the liver transplant list and ultimately have poorer outcomes. Patients with respiratory failure have the worst outcomes.

ACLF is a dynamic syndrome, which may improve, worsen, or have a mild protracted course, allowing us the opportunity for a possible liver transplant.
