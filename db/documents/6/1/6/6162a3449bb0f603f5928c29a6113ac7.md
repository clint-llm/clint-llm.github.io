Ovaries originate from the intermediate mesoderm. The ovary differentiates into the medulla, which is the central aspect and has a layer of germinal epithelium across the surface. The dorsal endoderm of the yolk sac produces cells that will become immature ova, these cells migrate to the hindgut and then on to the gonadal ridge, which forms by week 4 of development. These cells continue to mature and multiply by mitosis as they migrate. At the end of the migration at the gonadal ridge, they are considered to be oogonia. The oogonia will continue to mature within a layer of connective tissue, which will become the granulosa cells. Altogether these aspects form the basis of rudimentary ovarian follicles.

The ovaries will descend as they mature, however unlike their male counterparts, the testicles, the descent will end in the abdomen. The ovaries are attached to the gubernaculum, a strip of mesoderm. The other aspect of the gubernaculum connects to the uterus, preventing the ovaries from descending lower. The proper ovarian ligament arises from the remnant of the gubernaculum.
