No abnormalities are seen in fibromyalgia in routine clinical laboratory testing or imaging. However, in research studies, functional MRI and other specialized imaging have revealed certain abnormalities in patients with fibromyalgia compared to control subjects.

**Diagnosis**

**1990 ACR classification criteria**— It was used in many clinical and therapeutic trials but has not been useful in diagnosing fibromyalgia in clinical practice

The 1990 ACR fibromyalgia classification criteria included:

- Symptoms of widespread pain, present on both sides of the body and both above and below the waist

- Physical findings of at minimum 11 of 18 defined tender points

- Suboccipital muscle insertion bilaterally

- Anterior aspect of C5 to C7 intertransverse spaces bilaterally

- Mid upper border of trapezius bilaterally

- Origin of supraspinatus muscle bilaterally

- Second costochondral junctions bilaterally

- 2cm distal to the lateral epicondyles bilaterally

- Upper outer quadrants of buttocks bilaterally

- Greater trochanteric prominence bilaterally

- Medial fat pad of the knees bilaterally

The pressure appropriate for detecting these tender points should be equal to 4 kg/cm^2,  enough to whiten the nail bed of the fingertip of the examiner.

For the purposes of classification, the patient is said to have fibromyalgia if both criteria are met.

**2010 ACR preliminary diagnostic criteria**—

There were a number of limitations of the 1990 diagnostic criteria which include the following.

- Physicians not knowing how to examine tender points, performing the exam incorrectly, or simply refusing to do so.

- A number of symptoms that were previously not considered were increasingly appreciated as key symptoms of fibromyalgia

- The criteria set the bar so high that it left little room for variation among fibromyalgia patients. Also, the patient whose symptoms improved failed to satisfy the 1990 criteria.

There was a 2011 modification of the 2010 ACR preliminary criteria (2011 modified criteria), followed by a 2016 modification.

**American College of Rheumatology preliminary diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia and measurement of symptom severity**

A patient fulfills the diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia if the following three conditions are met:

- Widespread pain index (WPI) is 7 and symptom severity (SS) scale score is 5, or WPI equals 3 to 6, and SS scale score of 9.

- Symptomatology has been present at a similar level for at least 3 months.

- The patient does not demonstrate any other disorder that would otherwise explain the pain.

Ascertainment

- WPI: note the number of areas where and in how many areas the patient has had pain during the prior week. The score will be between 0 and 19. Shoulder girdle, left hip (buttock, trochanter), left jaw, left upper back shoulder girdle, right hip (buttock, trochanter), right jaw, right lower back upper arm, left upper leg, left chest neck upper arm, right upper leg, right abdomen lower arm, left lower leg, left lower arm, right lower leg, right

- SS scale score: Fatigue, waking unrefreshed, and cognitive symptoms. For each of the three symptoms above, indicate the severity level over the past week utilizing the following scale: 0 no problem; 1 slight or mild problems, generally mild or intermittent; 2 moderate, considerable problems, often present and/or at a moderate level; 3 severe: pervasive, continuous, life-disturbing problems. Considering somatic symptoms in general, indicate whether the patient has: 0 for no symptoms, 1 a few symptoms, 2 a moderate number of symptoms; 3 for many symptoms. The SS scale score sums the severity of the 3 symptoms (fatigue, waking unrefreshed, cognitive symptoms) plus the severity) of general somatic symptoms. The final score is between 0 and 12.
