PET/CT (positron emission tomography) is a widely utilized nuclear medicine imaging modality used to evaluate the staging, treatment response, or recurrence of various cancers. While mammography remains the first-line imaging exam used in detecting and screening cancer, currently used secondary imaging modalities include ultrasound, MRI, and in special instances, PET/CT. This activity reviews the use of PET/CT as an adjunctive imaging modality used in the evaluation of patients with breast cancer. Furthermore, this activity highlights the indications, imaging technique, patient preparation, and the use of PET/CT by the interprofessional team in the setting of breast cancer.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications of PET/CT in its use in breast cancer.

- Explain the technique involved in PET/CT acquisition.
- Summarize the clinical value of 18F-FDG PET/CT in breast cancer.

- Outline some interprofessional strategies that can improve patient results when using 18F-FDG PET/CT in breast cancer cases.
