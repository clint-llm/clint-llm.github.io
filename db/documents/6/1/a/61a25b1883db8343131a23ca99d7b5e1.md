The hepatic P450 enzyme CYP2D6 metabolizes the drug, and its half-life is approximately 30 hours. It gets excreted from the body via urine and in bile. Studies have shown the correlation between chlorpromazine's therapeutic level and the improvement of psychiatric symptoms. Researchers have noted that the patients receiving chronic treatment with chlorpromazine have lower plasma levels as compared to the patients acutely treated on an oral dose of chlorpromazine. Also, the concomitant use of anticholinergics can affect the plasma concentration of chlorpromazine. However, the plasma level and the response threshold for clinical improvement of symptoms and toxicity using chlorpromazine differ both for children and adults.
