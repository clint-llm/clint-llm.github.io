The atlantoaxial segment consists of the atlas (C1) and axis (C2) and forms a complex transitional structure bridging the occiput and cervical spine.

The functional result of the joint is two-fold: to provide support for the occiput and the greatest range of motion and flexibility possible while maintaining stability.

Instability in this joint is usually congenital, but in adults, it may be due to an acute traumatic event or degenerative disease.

Atlantoaxial instability can be classified into three generalized categories: inflammatory, congenital, and traumatic.

The "Rule of Spence" classically determines the stability of C1 fractures by measuring the lateral overhang of the lateral masses of C1 on C2 when viewing an AP radiograph. If the sum of both lateral masses of C1 on C2 is greater than 7mm, the fracture is considered unstable. This measurement tool is also generally used to assess CT scan images.

Treatment of atlantoaxial instability varies widely, and intervention is usually tailored to patients on an individualized basis. Asymptomatic patients can be monitored over time with dynamic imaging and MRI to monitor disease progression.

The prognosis in symptomatic patients who are treated early is good. Posterior spinal fusion can help restore function and reverse symptoms like pain and myelopathy.
