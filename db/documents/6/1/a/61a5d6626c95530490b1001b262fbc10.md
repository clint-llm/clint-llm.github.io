Because there are many causes of sinus bradycardia, an interprofessional team approach is necessary for making an early diagnosis. Nurses on the floor and in the emergency department should understand bradycardia and its treatment. The pharmacist should ensure that the cause is not potentially related to any patient medications; if there is a risk, the clinical team should be contacted. The primary care provider should refer all symptomatic patients to the cardiologist for further workup. If a pacemaker is inserted, then the patient should be closely followed by a pacemaker nurse.

Educating patients at risk for this rhythm and making a closed-loop communication between them and their providers can help further improve the management of these rhythms.
