Splints may be applied by appropriately trained physicians, physician assistants, nurses, technicians. A thorough history and physical exam must be obtained before any intervention. Medical professionals may serve as the primary treating clinician or splinting assistant. Regardless of the role assumed, knowledge about the goals of immobilization and proper splinting techniques will improve patient care. Coordination with an orthopedic specialist is necessary for any unstable injuries.

Non-orthopedic medical professionals frequently treat patients with acute injuries that require splinting. However, few of these professionals are comfortable splinting injuries, and many have not received dedicated education on proper technique. Incorporating an inter-residency and interprofessional approach between orthopedic surgeons, emergency medicine physicians, family practitioners, and advanced practitioners can significantly improve these skills.
