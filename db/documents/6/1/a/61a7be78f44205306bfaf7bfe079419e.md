Fractures of the spine are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes clinicians (including PAs and NPs), specialists (orthopedists, neurologists), orthopedic and neurology nurses, and therapists. Physical therapy may play a role in rehabilitative recovery in surgical and non-surgical cases. This interprofessional approach will result in improved patient outcomes. [Level 5]

Clinicians should be aware that imaging is critical for the diagnosis of a hangman's fracture. CT scan is the most important modality for determining fracture etiology and ruling out an injury regarding a C2 fracture. Even if plain films are negative and clinical suspicion is high, a CT scan is warranted. CT scan does not directly evaluate the spinal cord, soft tissue, or ligamentous construct. It is important to recognize the importance that complete imaging will require dedicated thin-cut CT reconstructions. Non-contrast CT scan is adequate for evaluating the bony anatomy for fracture. This can be coupled with a CT angiogram for evaluation of the vascular anatomy. A missed injury can prove fatal.

Most patients can be managed with external support, and full recovery is possible with time.
