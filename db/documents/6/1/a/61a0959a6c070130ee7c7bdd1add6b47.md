Hypovolemic shock is a potentially life-threatening condition. Early recognition and appropriate management are essential.

Early recognition and treatment with volume resuscitation to restore euvolemia are life-saving. When the etiology of hypovolemic shock is determined, prompt replacement of volume together with source control should be performed to minimize tissue ischemia.
