Cholesterol synthesis initiates from acetyl-CoA, which itself is made from amino acids, fat, and carbohydrates. Thereafter, a series of enzymatic reactions occur and divide into four main steps, each with unique products. The process starts with mevalonate. Second, it transforms into activated isoprenes. The third step is where it becomes squalene, and the fourth and last step is where cholesterol forms. 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductaseÂ (HMG-CoA reductase) makes mevalonate, and this step is a critical enzyme reaction in regulating cholesterol formation and is the rate-limiting step. HMG-CoA reductase is also the target of statins to lower high LDL-cholesterol.

Acetyl CoA can also get converted to triglycerides, which ultimately form into lipoproteins. Each lipoprotein has a unique composition with different apolipoproteins on its outer surface. Chylomicrons are of intestinal origin are very large and carry dietary lipids. They are associated with the following apolipoproteins: AI, AII, AIV, B48, CI, CII, CIII, and E. VLDL are particles that carry endogenous triglycerides and some cholesterol from the liver. It is associated with B100, CI, CII, CIII, and E apolipoproteins. IDL carries cholesterol esters and triglycerides and carries apolipoproteins B100, CIII, and E. LDL carries cholesterol esters and is associated with B100. HDL carries cholesterol esters and is associated with apolipoproteins AI, AII, CI, CII, CIII, D, and E.
