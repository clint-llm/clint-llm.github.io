Lanugo fulfills its role by serving as a physical anchor between the skin and vernix. Lanugo imparts an increased surface area to the fetus, allowing more interactions between itself and the vernix, which strengthens the anchor. Without lanugo, the vernix would not remain affixed to the skin and, therefore, would not be able to protect the fetus from harmful substances in the environment.

When it comes to regulating fetal developmental rate, oscillations of lanugo hairs surrounded by the vernix during fetal movements in amniotic fluid activate sensitive mechanoreceptors connected to unmyelinated C-afferent fibers. These afferents function to relay impulses originating from all fetal skin dermatomes via the spinal cord and activate the vagal sensory zone, hypothalamus, and insular cortex. This process results in the promotion of an "anti-stress" effect through oxytocin release, which also results in the stimulation of fetal growth by the incretin effect of various gastrointestinal hormones.
