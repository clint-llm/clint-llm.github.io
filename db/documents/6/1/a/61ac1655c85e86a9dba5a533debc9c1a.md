Traditionally, frostbite has a staging system similar to burns:

- **First degree**- numbness, central pallor, surrounding erythema/edema, desquamation, dysesthesia

- **Second degree**- skin blistering with surrounding erythema/edema

- **Third degree**- tissue loss involving entire thickness of skin, hemorrhagic blisters

- **Fourth degree**- tissue loss involving deeper structures, resulting in loss of the affected part

Another classification based on frostbite on hands/feet has been proposed, which incorporate early imaging studies and may better predict outcomes.

- **Grade 1 -**no cyanosis on the extremity; no risk of amputation or sequelae predicted

- **Grade 2 -**cyanosis on distal phalanx only; amputation to soft tissue and sequelae of fingernail/toenail sequelae predicted

- **Grade 3 -**cyanosis on intermediate and proximal phalanges; amputation to the bone of the digit and functional sequelae predicted

- **Grade 4 -**cyanosis over carpal/tarsal bones; amputation to limb and functional sequelae predicted.

With this classification system, as grade increases, so does the likelihood of limb amputation.
