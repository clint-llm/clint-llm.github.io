Histopathological studies of skin biopsies have contributed to our understanding of blepharochalasis pathogenesis. The common finding in these specimens is the loss of elastic fibers of the dermis. The initial step is probably an IgA immune-mediated reaction directed against these fibers, as several recent studies have demonstrated IgA antibody deposits using immunofluorescence. Positive immunohistochemical staining for metalloproteinases MMP-3 and MMP-9 has also been reported in BS. This is also seen in other elastolytic diseases and suggests that these metalloproteinases may be involved in the pathogenesis of this condition. Other findings include atrophy affecting different structures of the dermis, increasing number and diameter of the skin capillaries, perivascular inflammatory infiltrates, and pigmentation in the papillary and upper reticular dermis.
