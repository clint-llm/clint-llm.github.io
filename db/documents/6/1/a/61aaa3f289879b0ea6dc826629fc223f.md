During fetal development, when fetal-placental circulation gets established, blood flow between the fetus and placenta occurs through the paired umbilical arteries and the unpaired single umbilical vein. The umbilical vein directs oxygenated blood from the placenta towards the fetus, and the umbilical arteries carry deoxygenated blood back to the placenta (see figure). When the umbilical vein enters the fetal umbilicus, it branches into a large ductus venosus and a small portal sinus. The ductus venosus carrying oxygenated blood enters the inferior vena cava directly and subsequently empties the well-oxygenated blood into the left side of the heart through the foramen ovale between the right and the left atrium. The small portal sinus supplies the liver itself with oxygenated blood, which returns to the inferior vena cava with deoxygenated blood through the hepatic vein.

Fetal rat liver models illustrate the development of the hepatic vascular system by gestation day 14 with one ductus venous in the liver parenchyma.
