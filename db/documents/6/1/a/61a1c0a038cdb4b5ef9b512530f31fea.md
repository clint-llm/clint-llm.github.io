The histologic hallmark of PDB is the presence of Paget cells, which are malignant, intraepithelial adenocarcinoma cells of variable sizes usually large in size, present singly or in the form of small groups within the epidermis of the nipple. Cells may be ovoid, round, or signet-ring forms, usually mucin positive, and the cytoplasm may contain periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)–positive, diastase-resistant granules, indicating the presence of neutral mucopolysaccharides. The cells possess microscopic features of glandular cells with pale to clear vacuolated cytoplasm, and nuclei are usually high-grade with prominent nucleoli. It has been postulated that cells may derive from glandular stem cells or epidermal Toker cells (clear cells of the nipple epithelium).

Toker cells are benign and have been found in about 10% of normal nipples and rarely in supernumerary nipples. Like Paget cells of PDB, Toker cells contain prominent, clear vacuolated cytoplasm, and they are considered benign counterparts of Paget cells.
