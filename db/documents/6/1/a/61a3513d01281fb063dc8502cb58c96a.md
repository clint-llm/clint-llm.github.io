Monitoring a patient's pain, nausea, and other vitals should occur before and after the repair. After the repair, the patient is either discharged home with a follow-up visit the next day in the clinic or kept overnight in the hospital for observation. During the postoperative period, especially the first week, all team members should monitor for signs of infection such as increased pain or decreased vision.

On the day of discharge, clear instructions from every team member to educate the patient about follow-up are paramount because many ocular trauma patients will not return.
