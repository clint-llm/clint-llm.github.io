Kratom and its metabolites can cause a variety of symptoms, including neurologic, metabolic, and psychological symptoms. A study by the National Poison Data system in 2019 found that the most common presenting symptoms after kratom ingestion included agitation, tachycardia, drowsiness, and confusion.

Multiple organ systems are at risk for potential injury due to kratom ingestion. Multiple case studies have found a range of toxicities and adverse events associated with kratom use, including hepatotoxicity, seizure and coma, lung injury, kidney injury, and cardiotoxicity.
