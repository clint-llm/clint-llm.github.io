Infection of GIT by mycobacteria can occur in five ways:

- Sputum ingestion by a patient with active pulmonary disease from Mycobacterium tuberculosis

- Hematogenous spread from a distant focus

- Lymphatic spread through infected nodes

- Direct extension from a contiguous site

- Ingestion of milk products infected with Mycobacterium bovis â€“ particularly seen with consumption of raw milk

Some authors have classified abdominal TB into two types: a primary form due to the direct ingestion of M. bovis and a secondary form due to the spread of human bacillus from active pulmonary disease.

The terminal ileum and ileocaecal valve are noted to be the most commonly involved segments.

The mycobacteria have a fatty capsule that resists digestion, which interferes with their release early in the GIT. Thus, proximal GIT lesions were theoretically thought to be rare.
