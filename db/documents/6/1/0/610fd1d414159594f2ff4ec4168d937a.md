Elevated IOP presents as buphthalmos in pediatric patients, so the complications are related to high IOP. These complications include glaucomatous optic neuropathy, corneal damage, amblyopia, and refractive error. Lowering the IOP early may prevent these complications but if present, amblyopia and refractive error will still need to be treated separately. Damage to the cornea may be irreversible and require future surgery.
