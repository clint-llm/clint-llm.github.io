The grasp reflex is an involuntary flexion-adduction movement involving the hands and digits.

There is a similar reflex observed in the foot called theÂ plantar grasp reflex. This reflex is observable by stimulating the medial plantar surface of the foot. When the foot grasp reflex is positive, upon such stimulation, the lateral surface of the foot will react to create an indentation in the plantar surface, resembling a cup.

The grasp reflex is considered a primitive reflex, similar to the suck, snout, and palmomental reflexes.
