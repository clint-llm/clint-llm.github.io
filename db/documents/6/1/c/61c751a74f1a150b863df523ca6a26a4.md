The aorta is an integral part of the vascular supply of the spinal cord. The aorta gives rise to the subclavian arteries, which give rise posteriorly to the vertebral arteries. It is from these vertebral arteries that the medullary arteries arise.

The medullary arteries branch into ten segments and provide the majority of vascularization for the spinal cord. If there is any neurological damage due to a compromise to the blood flow, the damage will depend on where the compromise occurs. Any damage to the posterior flow of blood will likely result in some degree of sensory deficits. In contrast, any damage to the anterior blood supply will likely result in some degree of motor deficits.

The posterior spinal artery supplies the DCML pathway. Thus, infarction of the posterior spinal artery leads to neurological sensory deficits relayed by the DCML pathway. This is the mechanism of injury in posterior cord syndrome, also known as posterior spinal artery syndrome.
