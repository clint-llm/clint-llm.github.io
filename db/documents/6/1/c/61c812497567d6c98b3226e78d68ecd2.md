Holt-Oram syndrome also referred to as the heart-hand syndrome, is an autosomal dominant disorder that is distinguished by upper limb abnormalities in association with congenital heart lesions.

All patients and family members should receive genetic counseling from a qualified clinician.

Individuals with Holt-Oram syndrome are also at an increased risk for cardiac conduction abnormalities. These may manifest at birth as sinus bradycardia or first-degree atrioventricular block and can progress to complete heart block without warning. Arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, are also seen.

Life expectancy for Holt-Oram syndrome varies among affected individuals and predominantly depends on the severity of the congenital heart defect.
