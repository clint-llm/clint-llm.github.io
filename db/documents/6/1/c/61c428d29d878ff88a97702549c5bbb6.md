Sleep paralysis can be distressing for the patient, as it causes a lot of fear and anxiety, which has shown to worsen the frequency of the episodes, and this loop continues until there is an intervention. Therefore, prompt recognition of the condition and early intervention are vital, and possible psychosocial factors merit attention if present. Sleep paralysis often coexists with other medical conditions, e.g., narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, and insomnia disorder.

Most people have reported managing the episodes by techniques that disrupt the episodes, and few others focus on the prevention of the episodes themselves. Disruption of the episodes seems to mitigate some of the anxiety associated with sleep paralysis episodes; therefore, more and more patients show an inclination towards this mode of management.

Researchers have proposed some treatments for the management of sleep paralysis episodes. Pimavanserin has been a proposed therapeutic intervention in one study as the drug is a selective 5-HT receptor inverse agonist, and thus has the potential to target hallucinations caused by sleep paralysis episodes.
