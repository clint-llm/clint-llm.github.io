If untreated, iron deficiency is associated with significant cognitive impairment and poor quality of life.

During pregnancy, untreated iron deficiency can affect fetal brain maturation, cause low birth weight, and predispose the baby to develop iron deficiency. Maternal adverse outcomes include depression, increased risk of sepsis, and maternal mortality.

In patients undergoing cardiac or abdominal surgery, preoperative iron deficiency correlates with poor outcomes.

In patients with heart failure, chronic iron deficiency shows an association with an increase in mortality.
