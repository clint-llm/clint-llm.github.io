The prescription of vismodegib is limited to the oncologist and dermatologist. However, the pharmacist also needs to know the basic principles of this agent. Oncology-trained specialty nurses also need to understand the basic mechanism and administration of the drug. Therefore, interprofessional coordination and information sharing need to be the norm in vismodegib therapy to improve outcomes and reduce potential adverse effects. [Level 5]

Initially approved in 2012, vismodegib is the first FDA-approved pharmacologic agent that targets the Hedgehog signaling pathway (sonic hedgehog, SHH), a pathway involved in many basal cell carcinomas. Not all patients are suitable candidates for surgery or topical therapy due to locally advanced or metastatic basal cell carcinoma; this is when vismodegib has a place in treatment.

The adverse effects of vismodegib have been a limiting factor for the medication. The most common adverse effects include muscle spasm (72%), fatigue (40%), alopecia (64%), dysgeusia (55%), and weight loss (45%). There is renewed concern that the drug may induce the development of squamous cell cancer. Hence, all patients prescribed vismodegib require close surveillance.
