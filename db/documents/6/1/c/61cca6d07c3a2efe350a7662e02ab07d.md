Tendons have a complex vascular supply. Supplying vessels may come directly from the muscular belly and the periosteum surrounding the osteotendinous junction. If peritendinous leaflets or a synovial sheath are present, those vascular networks also feed the tendon.

The circulatory network of peritendinous leaflets varies both within the same tendon and between different tendons. Primary trunks may be arranged in a regular mesh structure; in other cases, they form concentric arches and are irregularly arranged. These vascular networks consist of small and medium-caliber arteries accompanied by one or two satellite venous anastomoses.

Within tendons, three different types of microvascular capillary units can be found. In one type, the capillary travels a long distance with a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the tendon, then becomes recurrent, looping back on itself to flow into a venule. Alternatively, a single arteriole will give rise to several capillary loops that run in different planes within the tendon. Yet another type acts as an arterio-venous shunt characterized by very short capillaries with a straight course. The presence of multiple types of microvascular units facilitates gas and metabolite diffusion within individual tendon bundles.

Tendinous lymphatic drainage exists as a network, with lymph draining toward tendon veins or to other neighboring venous structures.

When a tendon is subjected to mechanical stress, the blood flow to the tendon increases. However, lymphatic drainage does not increase proportionally to mechanical stress.
