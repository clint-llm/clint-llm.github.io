Due to its superficial course, the pulse of the facial artery is palpable at the anteroinferior angle of the masseter muscle against the bony surface of the mandible.

Documentation exists that pulsation of the angular artery (terminal branch of the facial artery) is present and strong in about 70% of internal carotid artery occlusion cases.[

Atherosclerosis of the common carotid artery is a risk factor for embolic events leading to ischemic injury.  If there is a weakness in the superficial facial musculature, it is possible for there to be a vascular compromise of the facial artery.  An embolus from the common carotid may travel and cause ischemic injury to a distal branch of the facial artery. However, this is a rare sequela of carotid artery atherosclerosis.
