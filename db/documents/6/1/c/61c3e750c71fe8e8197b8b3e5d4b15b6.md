History from the patient will be consistent with either a decrease in ambient environment pressure, such as surfacing from a dive or decompression of a plane or spacecraft, or with a recent invasive procedure. Divers may report a history of rapid or panic ascent, loss of buoyancy control, or breath-holding during ascent.  Examples of iatrogenic emboli inducing procedures include placement or withdrawal of a central line, cardiac catheterization, vascular procedures, robotic hysterectomy and gynecological procedures, needle biopsy of pulmonary masses, and virtually any other invasive procedure where vasculature could be cannulated.

Most patients will present with unconsciousness within 10 minutes of gas introduction or surfacing from a dive where an embolism occurred and with crossed neurological deficits. Physicians familiar with the emergency treatment of stroke will note that neurological deficits do not appear to correlate with any single lesion, and this, in and of itself, should make a clinician suspicious of cerebral arterial gas embolism. Crossed neurological signs including motor weakness or paralysis are common, but physicians also should perform a careful series of cerebellar exams as part of their complete neurological assessment as presentations can be subtle.
