Capgras syndrome, or delusion of doubles, is a delusional misidentification syndrome.

- Capgras syndrome is equally found both in males and females.

- Capgras is the clinical diagnosis. However, laboratory workup and imaging must be done to rule out other organic causes.

- Timely and accurate diagnosis of underlying disorders or medical conditions can assist in managing CS.

- Psychodynamic therapy intervention is vital in controlling CS symptoms and violence related to it.

Since managing CS is challenging, an interprofessional team is required to provide care effectively. Psychopharmacology and psychotherapy are important to manage CS. The team could consist of a psychiatrist, psychologist/therapist, physician, social worker, and caregivers/ relatives. Due to the lack of research data on CS, treating CS poses a considerable challenge. Antipsychotics have been found effective in managing symptoms.
