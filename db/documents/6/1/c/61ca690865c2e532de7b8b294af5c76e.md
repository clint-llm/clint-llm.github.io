The purpose of the lungs is to inhale oxygen (O2) and exhale carbon dioxide (CO2). Room air (21% oxygen) enters the lungs through negative pressure due to the pulling pressure of the diaphragm, distributes throughout the alveoli, and ventilates the capillaries at the alveolar-capillary membrane, participating in gas exchange for CO2. The CO2 then travels back through the alveoli and upper airways to be exhaled into the environment.
