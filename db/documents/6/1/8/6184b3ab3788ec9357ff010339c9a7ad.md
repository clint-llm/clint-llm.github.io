The concept of asymptomatic screening is particularly relevant in lower socioeconomic status individuals in high endemic areas, individuals being started on planned immunosuppression with systemic steroids or post solid organ transplants, and also in individuals with hitherto unexplained persistent eosinophilia.

The microscopic examination of stool for larval forms still remains the gold standard of diagnosis. However, a single stool exam has only about 50% sensitivity.

Sporadic excretion of larva in stool makes microscopic stool testing a very unpredictable and low-yield diagnostic tool. It is somewhat mitigated by serial stool testing. The sensitivity of serial stool samples reaches 100% when 7 samples, each from different days, are tested.

Diagnostic sensitivity is enhanced by combining stool testing with serologic testing by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent assay( ELISA). ELISA  has a high negative predictive value and can thus help in ruling out infection, particularly in patients to be subjected to immunosuppressive treatment. However, it identifies IgG and thus does not distinguish between current and prior infection.

IgG antibodies can also be detected by the indirect Immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT). A 1:20 titer or above has a sensitivity of 97.4% and a specificity of 97.9%. It is, therefore, the desired cutoff for screening. Luciferase immunoprecipitation system (LIPS)  provides the highest positive predictive value with a specificity of 100%.

The diagnosis of hyperinfection syndrome is relatively easy because of the high larval load in the stool or body fluids.

Endoscopy and duodenal biopsy may reveal larva or signs of chronic inflammation like edematous mucosa, white villi, or erythematous mucosa.

High serum IgE levels are present in 39% to 58% of the cases. This association between elevated serum IgE levels and strongyloidiasis is, however, rarely present in  HTLV-1 co-infected individuals, indicating an inability of HTLV-I-positive patients to clear S. stercoralis.
