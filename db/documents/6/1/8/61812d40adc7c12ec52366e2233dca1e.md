As stated above, significant long-term complications of LPR can occur if the disease is left untreated or goes unrecognized. Common complications include:

- Chronic cough

- Recurrent laryngitis

- Oral cavity disorders/ulcers

- Recurrent bronchopulmonary injury/infections, such as pneumonia

LPR has been identified as a risk factor for laryngeal carcinoma, though this association is under investigation and remains unclear.
