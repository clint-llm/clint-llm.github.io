Typical cleft hand deformities are the result of an inherited x-linked dominant trait with incomplete penetrance. The central rays develop differently from the thumb and small finger, and this mutation disrupts the central digit growth in the hands and often the feet. Atypical cleft hands, in contrast, are a result of a sporadic mutation and are therefore not inherited or associated with syndromic conditions.
