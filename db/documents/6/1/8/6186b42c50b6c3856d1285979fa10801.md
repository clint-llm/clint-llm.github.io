The pediatric skeletal anatomy has unique properties that lead to varied pathology to that of the adult skeleton. Two of the major differences include the presence of the physeal growth plate and a thicker periosteum with the softer underlying bone.

The appearance on plain X-ray shows the fracture site as two outcroppings of bone, as though the long bone has collapsed or ‘buckled.’ The word "torus" is the Latin word "protuberance. However, if there is a fracture with a cortical breach, it is termed a greenstick fracture if unicortical or a complete fracture if bicortical.

Buckle fractures are incredibly common injuries that present to the emergency department, which are invariably always managed conservatively, and do not routinely require orthopedic input.
