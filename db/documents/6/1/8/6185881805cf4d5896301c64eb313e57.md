OAVS has a varied presentation, and the prognosis depends upon the severity of the disease and timely intervention. A child can be born with life-threatening airway obstruction and other complications, making the prognosis poor. However, early intervention can prevent or manage these complications. Life expectancy is generally comparable to the normal population.

Correction of all facial malformations is complex and requires multistage surgeries. Thus, it becomes difficult to predict the prognosis due to different patterns of abnormalities in different individuals. Visual prognosis is good if early correction of lid coloboma and surgical excision of dermoid is done to prevent amblyopia. Social stigma is a great concern for children's mental health due to significant facial and ear anomalies. Furthermore, school-going children facing social alienation and poor self-image can suffer from depression and feelings of isolation. Moreover, having a deformed child can affect the functioning of the whole family and might affect parents' mental health and social relations. Psychiatric consultation and counseling are essential for overcoming these problems.

The presence of a mental disability can also affect the quality of life. Thus, early management of all anatomical and functional disorders like speech abnormalities is paramount to improving the quality of life.
