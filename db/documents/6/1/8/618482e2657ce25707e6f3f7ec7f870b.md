Patients with abnormal ECG and/or cTnI levels should be admitted for cardiac monitoring for 24 to 48 hours because life-threatening arrhythmias or cardiac failure will most likely present during this time.

Management of dysrhythmias should be approached and treated as in the non-BCI patient. Replete electrolytes accordingly, avoid hypoxia and acidosis, and when clinically indicated, utilize antidysrhythmics and advanced life support algorithms. Although rare with isolated BCI, complete heart block may necessitate a pacemaker. ST segment elevations can be due to either a contused heart or a traumatic myocardial infarction, necessitating coronary angiography.

Patients with severe clinically diagnosed or imaged structural cardiac injury require emergent cardiology evaluation for further management. Temporizing measures such as fluid resuscitation, inotropes, or vasopressors may be indicated in the interim based on the specific clinical findings and associated injuries. Patients presenting with cardiac tamponade, most frequently seen in cardiac rupture, require emergent surgical intervention.
