In its simplest form, the endotracheal tube is a tube constructed of polyvinyl chloride that is placed between the vocal cords through the trachea. It serves to provide oxygen and inhaled gases to the lungs and protects the lungs from contamination, such as gastric contents or blood. The advancement of the endotracheal tube has closely followed advancements in anesthesia and surgery. Modifications have been made to minimize aspiration, isolate a lung, administer medications, and prevent airway fires. Despite these advances, more research to optimize its use is necessary. For example, endotracheal tubes are implicated in the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia, which remains a major concern. This activity describes the indications, contraindications, and techniques involved in endotracheal tube placement and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify indications and contraindications for endotracheal tube placement.
- Describe potential complications of endotracheal tube placement.
- Outline the anatomy that is relevant to the placement of an endotracheal tube.
- Summarize a structured, interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to and appropriate surveillance of patients undergoing endotracheal tube placement.
