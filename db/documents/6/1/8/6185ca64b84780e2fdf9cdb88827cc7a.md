Patient abandonment can be either intentional or inadvertent. An example of intentional abandonment is the refusal to see a patient after, for example, failure to pay for the received medical services. Miscommunication regarding call coverage or negligence that occurs through errors in the scheduling system areÂ examples of inadvertent abandonment. When patient injury or negligence results from a misunderstanding regarding the call schedule, the primary and/or covering provider may be held liable for damages.

If a physician is unavailable for long periods of time, a patient can be inadvertently abandoned, for example, if the physician takes an extended vacation or sabbatical without notifying the patient or arranging for emergency coverage for the patients. Additionally, being unresponsive to patients' questions in an email or phone calls, failure to follow up with a patient after surgery, or after the patient has started a new medication can be considered inadvertent abandonment.
