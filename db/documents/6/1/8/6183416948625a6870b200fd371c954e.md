Cryptosporidium is the second major cause of moderate to severe diarrhea in children younger than two and an important cause of mortality worldwide. It occurs most commonly during waterborne epidemics and in immunocompromised hosts. Cryptosporidiosis may be underrecognized and underdiagnosed. Additionally, treatments are suboptimum, and we do not currently have robust preventative measures. Fortunately, most infections are self-limited in immunocompetent hosts but may be associated with chronic symptoms, malnutrition, and other complications in high-risk patients.
