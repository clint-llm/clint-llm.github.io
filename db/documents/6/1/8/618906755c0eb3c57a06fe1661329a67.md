The management of phobias is usually with an interprofessional team that includes a mental health nurse, psychiatrist, psychotherapist, and primary care provider. In most cases, behavior therapy is the first-line treatment and does work. However, the period of desensitization can take weeks or even months.

To be successful, behavioral therapy requires that the patient be committed to the treatment, there are distinctly identified problems and objectives, and there are alternative strategies for dealing with the patient’s feelings.

Other forms of treatment that may also be considered are virtual therapy in which the patient is exposed to or interact with the phobic object or situation on the computer screen. This field of treatment is relatively new and requires more research. Other treatment modalities include hypnosis, supportive therapy, and family therapy. The goal of all 3 forms of therapy is to help the patient recognize that the feared stimulus is not dangerous and to provide emotional support.

Overall, the prognosis for most patients is fair because relapses are common.
