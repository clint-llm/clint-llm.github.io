Patients should be educated about the entire disease process and reassured about the non-fatality of this condition. Phlebotomy should be explained along with the need for regular appointments to check porphyrin levels in the blood. Avoidance of susceptibility factors like cessation of smoking, alcohol, estrogen, and iron therapies along with the importance of sun-protective measures like sunscreens, hats, and protective clothing should be emphasized. Any prior history of HCV or HIV should be disclosed, and the patient should strictly adhere to the treatment regimens advised by the treating physician.

Testing for ferritin levels, infections, and genetic testing are all part of the treatment strategy for PCT, and the patient should be made aware of this.
