HIV disease in humans can be caused by infection with either HIV-1 or HIV-2. HIV-1 is more prevalent of the two, has higher infectivity, virulence, and greater spread through heterosexual sex. The transmission rate of HIV from mother to child (vertical transmission) is 20% to 25% for HIV-1 versus about 5% for HIV-2.
