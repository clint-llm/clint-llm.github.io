Intra-operative complications:

- Hemorrhaging/Hematoma formation (from branches of the GEA into the omentum and stomach)

- Kinking/twisting of the pedicle as it is brought up through the diaphragm and again at the peri-anastomotic site is another complication due to improper operative technique.

- Arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardias, and bradycardias)

Post-operative complications:

- Perioperative MI

- Graft occlusion

- Low cardiac output

- Vasodilatory shock

- Arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardias, and bradycardias)

- Pericarditis/myocarditis

- Pericardial effusion/tamponade

- Late recurrent angina pectoris
