- Campylobacter is a leading cause of food-borne illness worldwide. C. jejuni is most identified as being the most common culprit in human infections

- Campylobacter is a robust species of bacteria that can survive over a wide range of environments. Small numbers of the bacteria canÂ cause infection.

- Those who are at greatest risk for infection include international travelers, people who come in frequent contact with livestock, particularly poultry, and consumers of untreated water or unpasteurized milk.

- Clinically, Campylobacter infection typically manifests as diarrhea (sometimes bloody) that typically peaks 1 to 2 days following onset. The acute enteritis phase of the infection is typically self-limiting and resolves after 7 days.

- Stool culture, PCR, or EIA establishes the diagnosis.

- Campylobacter is typically self-limiting, and some cases require supportive fluid and electrolyte replenishment. When antibiotics are needed, macrolides such as azithromycin are the treatment of choice.

- There are multiple complications related to Campylobacter infection; most notably, there is an associated with infection and Guillain-Barre syndrome.
