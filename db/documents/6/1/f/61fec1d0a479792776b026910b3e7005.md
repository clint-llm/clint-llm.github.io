Histopathological sections from the lenticonus show a thin central anterior lenticular capsule with normal epithelium. Anterior capsular electron microscopy reveals multiple longitudinal and irregular zones of capsular dehiscence. A few areas of fibrillar and electron-dense material are also seen. In Alport syndrome, irregular adjacent cells are also seen. There is also a reduction in the number of lens epithelial cells, which can be atypically arranged, and partial capsular dehiscence is present with fibrillar material and vacuoles.
