Alveolar osteitis, commonly known as "dry socket," is a self-limiting condition that is one of the most common complications following dental extractions. This review will first explore the etiology and pathogenesis of alveolar osteitis. The activity will then outline the evaluation and present recommendations for the treatment of the disease. After developing a more intuitive understanding of the process, the article will touch on complications associated with the treatment. Current recommendations for the prevention of alveolar osteitis will then be highlighted. The role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition will be more precise after exploring these aspects of alveolar osteitis.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology and pathogenesis of alveolar osteitis.
- Summarize risk factors associated with increased incidence of alveolar osteitis.
- Outline current prevention strategies for alveolar osteitis.
- Identify management strategies to treat alveolar osteitis.
