Lateral humeral condyle fractures are the second most commonly encountered elbow fractures after supracondylar fractures in the pediatric age group. These fractures are peculiar as they are intra-articular and are prone to displacement owing to the attachment of the forearm extensor muscles on the lateral condyle. Due to this, they can produce various complications, including elbow deformity, if not appropriately managed.

Several classification systems have been developed to aid treatment recommendation, with a 2 mm displacement considered the general cut-off for fixation. Displaced fractures are at a higher risk of non-union. Malunion, cubitus varus, avascular necrosis, and post-operative infection are recognized complications following surgery.
