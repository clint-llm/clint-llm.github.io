The exact etiology of Menetrier disease is unclear. However, researchers think the condition is an acquired illness rather than an inherited one. A self-limited variant of Menetrier disease is observed in children, associated with cytomegalovirus infection.Helicobacter pylori infection.

Rare cases in families indicate some genetic association behind the disease as well. There is a case report of aÂ large 4-generation family identified with Menetrier disease, and a dominant 1244_1247delACAG mutation of SMAD4 was identified as a cause of juvenile polyposis syndrome as well as a likely cause of Menetrier disease.
