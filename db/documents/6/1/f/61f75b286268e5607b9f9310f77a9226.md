- The patient should be observed for epistaxis in the immediate postoperative period. Some mild epistaxis is common and usually ceases after 12 to 24 hours.

- If the patient develops significant epistaxis, the usual resuscitation measures should be instigated. Immediate digital pressure should be applied over the anterior nose for at least 10 minutes. The nose can then be packed firmly with either gauze or an epistaxis pack. A return to the operating theatre should be considered with ongoing hemorrhage.

- In external DCR cases, the wound should be kept dry, and the sterile strips skin closures intact.

- Hot drinks should be avoided during the initial 48 hours, as they can contribute to epistaxis.

- The patient should avoid blowing the nose for the first week and sneeze with the mouth open.

- After any epistaxis has ceased (usually day 1), the patient may commence a steroid-based spray such as fluticasone nasal spray morning and night for 4 weeks.

- Topical or systemic antibiotics are not required.

- In external DCR, skin sutures should be removed after 7 to 10 days.

- If silicone intubation has been performed intraoperatively, the tubes can be removed 3 to 4 weeks postoperatively, although some surgeons remove them three months after surgery.
