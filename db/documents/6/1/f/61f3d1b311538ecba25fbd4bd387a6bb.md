The principal complications and co-morbidities of dermatitis herpetiformis relate to GSE and the associated risk of small bowel lymphoma. GSE may lead to malabsorption, resulting in anemia, weight loss, and osteoporosis. In children, short stature is a consequence. Rarely, dermatitis herpetiformis may be associated with neurological diseases such as ataxia and neuropathy.
