Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have always been considered superior to histamine receptor-2 (H2) blockers to prevent stress-related gastritis in critically ill patients at risk. Recent studies have raised the concern of increased mortality in patients who receive PPIs for stress-ulcer prophylaxis. Large trials directly comparing the agents for stress ulcer prophylaxis are lacking, and further studies are needed to determine whether PPIs are harmful. Data also suggest the potential role of angiotensin on gastritis, and studies are being conducted on how to reduce the effects of angiotensin on the gastric mucosa.
