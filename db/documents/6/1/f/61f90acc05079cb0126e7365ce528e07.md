1. Iatrogenic hypercortisolism can cause exogenous Cushing syndrome.

2. Pseudo-Cushing syndrome, also called physiological or non-neoplastic hypercortisolism, is seen in conditions like alcohol use disorder, obesity, insulin resistance, and neuropsychiatric disorders due to HPA axis stimulation.

3. In any acute illness, be it emotional or physical, a stress response can occur via stimulation of the HPA axis, resulting in elevated ACTH and cortisol levels. Evaluation for Cushing syndrome should take place after the resolution of acute stress.

4. Corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG): Approximately 90% of circulating cortisol is protein-bound. Currently available assays measure the total cortisol (free and protein-bound); conditions resulting in elevated levels of circulating CBG, such as pregnancy or use of estrogen-containing medications, or reduced levels of circulating CBG, such as malnutrition or nephrotic syndrome, may lead to spurious results on DSTs.

5. Dexamethasone bioavailability: Malabsorption, altered metabolism, or non-compliance with taking the medication can result in variable bioavailability of dexamethasone, confounding the results. Dexamethasone is metabolized by the liver via CYP3A4.

6. Improper urine collection: An inadequately collected urine sample for urinary-free cortisol (UFC) leads to diagnostic errors. For this reason, the urine sample should include testing for 24-hour urinary creatinine excretion in addition to cortisol.

7. Others: Cyclic Cushing syndrome and glucocorticoid receptor polymorphisms are rare causes of false test results.
