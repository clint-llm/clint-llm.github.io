Tumor cells are immunogenic and lead to the activation of both cell-mediated and humoral immune systems. It is noted that cytotoxic T cells recognize antigens on tumor cells and attack those cells or generate antibodies against the tumor cells.

**Immunologic Mechanisms**

Cell-mediated immunity, T cells attack tumor cell antigens and similar antigens in normal cells. Paraneoplastic antibodies, also known as onconeural antibodies, develop against a target receptor antigen (onconeural antigen) such as type-1 antineuronal nuclear (ANNA-1) antibodies, type-2 antineuronal nuclear (ANNA-2) antibodies, collapsing response mediator protein-5 (CRMP-5) antibodies, Purkinje cell cytoplasmic antibody type-1 (PCA-1) antibodies, anti-amphiphysin antibodies, anti-recoverin antibodies, anti-bipolar cells of the retina antibodies, anti-N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies, anti-acetylcholine (Ach) receptor antibodies, and anti-gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA-A) receptor antibodies.

**Non-Immunologic Mechanisms**

Tumor cells produce hormones or cytokines leading to metabolic abnormalities such as hyponatremia due to excessive secretion of antidiuretic hormone or hypercalcemia due to the excessive parathyroid hormone-related peptide. In addition, hematological malignancies produce immunoglobulins that affect the peripheral nervous system and manifest as peripheral neuropathy.
