Infection with Ehrlichia species begins with the intracellular uptake of the infectious extracellular form of the organism, the elementary body (EB), or dense core (DC). The elementary body/dense core is then taken up by endocytosis, where the organism replicates and matures to form a reticulate body or reticulate core (RB/RC) and then morula before redifferentiating into an elementary body/dense core that leaves the infected host cell to spread infection. During this process, Ehrlichia utilizes many immune evasion mechanisms, including suppressing apoptosis of host cells, modulation of chemokine and cytokine responses, and down-regulation of host pattern recognition receptors that might enable clearance of the infection. Ehrlichia preferentially infect peripheral blood leukocytes, with E. chaffeensis associated with human monocytic cells, including monocytes and macrophages, and neutrophil infections reported in E. ewingii. Multiorgan involvement can occur, with organisms detected in the spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow, and peripheral blood. The clinical manifestations of Ehrlichia infections appear to be due to the host inflammatory response to the infection rather than direct damage from the bacteria.
