Staging is done only for infantile form, not adolescent form. Langenskiold classified disease into VI stages with increasing severity and medial physeal collapse. Physeal bar is present from stage V onwards. Catonn and Laville simplified classification later; it was also modified. Recently MRI based classifications are also in use. Fort-de-France (FDF) is a commonly used MRI based classification, but X ray-based classification is most widely used.
