Approximately 30 to 50% of congenital diaphragmatic hernia survivors find themselves to be healthy, symptom-free, and without limitation. In fact, most adult patients are asymptomatic and require no intervention. Majority of symptomatic patients obtain their diagnosis at a young age, and increasingly, antenatally. Increased attention and continued surveillance in utero are now possible. Vigilance on screening, and subsequently, birth at a tertiary care center to ensure the appropriate support is essential. Multiple comorbidities have been identified, and long-term follow-up is necessary as the population of CDH survivor grows. As such, it is vital to educate patients not only on the symptoms associated with Bochdalek hernia and subsequent repair but on the sequelae, as well.
