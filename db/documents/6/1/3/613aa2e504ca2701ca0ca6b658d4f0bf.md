Many surgeons will have multiple shapes and sizes of implants available while performing the surgery. The final decision as to which implant to use may be based on the pocket that is achieved during the dissection, but this can often be estimated preoperatively with BMI, breast shape and position, and comprehensive physical examination. Lighted retractors may add a benefit during dissection, particularly in tight post-pectoral pockets.
