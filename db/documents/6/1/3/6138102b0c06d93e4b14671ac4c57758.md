**Protein C Deficiency**

- Protein C functional assay - This is the preferred assay in the clinical setting, as this can help identify both type I and type II disorders. Available options include factor Xa-based, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) based, or a chromogenic assay.

- Total protein C - Measured by immunoassay. This helps distinguish type I and type II deficiencies.

- Mutational analysis - PROC1 mutation testing is done once the initial testing suggests underlying protein C deficiency. This can help provide genetic counseling to patients and to understand the natural history of the disease.

**Protein S Deficiency**

- Total protein S - Measured by immunoassay. Other detection methods include ligand-based or monoclonal antibody-based methods.

- Free protein S -Â Measured by immunoassay. Antibody-based methods are also used in some laboratories.

- Protein S functional assay - Measured by a clot-based assay. The amount of protein S activity is proportional to the time to clot formation.

- Mutational analysis - PROS1 mutation testing is done once the initial testing suggests underlying protein S deficiency.
