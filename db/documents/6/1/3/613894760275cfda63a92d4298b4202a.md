Currently, there exist multiple ongoing clinical trials to evaluate emerging treatment strategies for overlap syndrome in the various phenotypic subtypes. One study explores NIV's potential benefit on overlap syndrome (NCT03184714). Another randomized controlled trial examines whether early diagnosis and the initiation of PAP therapy in hospitalized patients will reduce 30-day readmission rates. Lastly, an ongoing intervention clinical trial to compare CPAP vs. BiPAP therapy in overlap syndrome is in progress. These trials will delineate the appropriate treatment for overlap syndrome patients and hopefully improve clinical outcomes.
