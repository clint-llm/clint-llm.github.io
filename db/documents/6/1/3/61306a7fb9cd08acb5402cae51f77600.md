Factors that determine the treatment of Bankart repair are:

- Age of the patient

- Level of physical activity

- Desired future activity level

- History of shoulder pain

- Recurrent shoulder instability

- Associated glenoid or humerus bone loss

**Conservative Management**

The best candidates for nonoperative management are patients older than 30 with noÂ obvious shoulder instability, preserved normal osseous restrain to instability, and no desire to participate in recreational activities. Patients with multidirectional instability (MDI), voluntary dislocators, and minimal demand are further prospects for nonoperative therapy.

**Operative Management**

Indications for operative management- Young athletes (less than 30 years of age) with acute, primary, and traumatic anterior shoulder dislocations who wish to continue playing sports are the best candidates for surgical intervention.

- Post-traumatic recurrent shoulder instability limiting daily activities

- Post-traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation with an associated large rotator cuff tear, bony defect in the glenoid or the humerus head (Hill Sachs lesion)

- Persistent subluxation and pain even after adequate nonoperative management.

- Patients with a propensity for recurrent instability include athletes with overhead activities, construction workers, and climbers.

**Relative Contraindications for Operative Management**

- Uncooperative/ medically unstable patients

- Seizure disorder

- Primary collagen disorders, such as (Ehlers- Danlos or Marfan syndrome)

- Atraumatic shoulder instability

- A neurologic injury such as paralysis of the axillary nerve or suprascapular nerve

- Recurrent instability with post-traumatic arthritis

**Deciding the Surgery -**The patient's expectations, age, and level of the sport (contact vs. non-contact) are the most crucial factors to consider when treating a labral injury.

When glenoid bone loss is 13.5% to 17.3% with a low risk of recurrence and is non-engaging, Hill Sachs patients are treated by isolated arthroscopic or open Bankart's repair.
