Typically, health professionals diagnose anosognosia at the bedside by assessing the patient’s knowledge and insight of their symptoms. In subtle cases, it takes time and a long conversation with the patient to uncover anosognosia as patients may rationalize semi-logical reasons for not being able to perform activities on the affected side. In the setting of dementia, patients do not acknowledge or minimize their memory deficits. In the setting of mental illness, patients rationalize aberrant behavior or psychiatric symptoms and often confabulate (i.e. unconsciously prevaricate). This involves the creation of a false answer or response by combining real and imagined details.
