The clinical features of idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage depend on whether it is acute or chronic. Acute pulmonary hemorrhage, as seen in DAH, presents as a sudden onset of severe dyspnea and hemoptysis, which, if not treated immediately, could be fatal.

In some cases of IPH, iron deficiency anemia precedes other symptoms by many months. In these patients, there is often the need for repeated blood transfusions despite iron supplementation.

Physical examination findings also vary depending on whether it is an acute or chronic presentation. In the acute phase, the physical examination may be completely normal or include respiratory signs such as tachypnea. In the chronic phase, there may be pallor, failure to thrive, weight loss, or hepatosplenomegaly. It may also be unremarkable. If pulmonary fibrosis has set in, there may be digital clubbing and other signs of chronic hypoxia.
