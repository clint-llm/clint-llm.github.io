Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) tends to wax and wane in severity. Drug-induced cases usually resolve spontaneously when the causative agent is stopped.Cutaneous lesions usually heal without scarring whileÂ mucous membrane lesions leave scars and pose considerable morbidity. Desquamative gingivitis may damage teeth. Ocular linear IgA dermatosis may be indistinguishable from cicatricial pemphigoid and can cause blindness.
