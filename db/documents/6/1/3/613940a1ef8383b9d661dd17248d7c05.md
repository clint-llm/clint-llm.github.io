Early presentation is key when having symptoms of a breast condition.Â While the majority of these will be benign fibrocystic disease, it is important to maintain an appropriate workup to rule out malignancy. It is also important to remember that the majority of cyclic mastalgia is not related to an identifiable breast mass and thus can be very difficult to properly treat.

To ensure proper evaluation, women should undergo a triple assessment with any breast mass. This assessment includes history taking and physical examination, imaging by ultrasound or mammography, and finally, histological or cellular diagnosis.
