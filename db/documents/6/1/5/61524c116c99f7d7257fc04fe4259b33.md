Bowers initially described the term turf toe in 1976 as a sprain of the plantar capsule ligament of the great toe metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint. It occurs secondary to forceful hyperextension of the first MTP joint. Injury to the plantar plate of the great toe leads to pain with push-off and reduced agility. It can be a devastating injury in the elite athlete and a nuisance in the general population. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of turf toe and highlights interprofessional team members' role in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of turf toe.
- Review the presentation of turf toe.
- Summarize the treatment options for turf toe.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by turf toe.
