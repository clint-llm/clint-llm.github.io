When lung isolation and OLVÂ are performed in the critical care setting, nurses are primarily responsible for monitoring these patients for any signs indicating a problem with lung isolation. A significant change in respiratory statuses such as hypoxemia, hypercarbia, or high peak airway pressures should prompt notification of an intensivist or anesthesiologist to verify correct device placement. Changes in the quality or quantity of suctioned secretions from each lung should also be monitored.
