A suprascapular nerve block can be utilized to treat chronic, acute, and perioperative shoulder pain.  The first description of this block in 1941 was performed to treat a patient with “intractable” shoulder pain. Patients with chronic pain conditions including but not limited to inflammatory arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, adhesive capsulitis, rotator cuff tendonitis, bursitis, degenerative disease, post-surgical and post-stroke chronic shoulder pain may benefit from a suprascapular nerve block.

A suprascapular nerve block may be even more beneficial in post-trauma or surgical patients due to the particularly intense and disabling quality of acute shoulder pain.

In the perioperative setting, a suprascapular nerve block is specifically indicated to control shoulder pain in patients with significant pulmonary comorbidities that make an interscalene brachial plexus block contraindicated due to the motor blockade of the phrenic nerve.
