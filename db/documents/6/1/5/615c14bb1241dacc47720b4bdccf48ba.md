Orbital atherectomy (OA) is an adjunctive therapy used for lesion preparation of calcified plaque with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and peripheral percutaneous endovascular interventions. The goal of lesion preparation with OA is to modify calcified plaque, changing lesion compliance to allow adequate balloon and stent expansion in segments with heavily calcified lesions. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of coronary artery calcification.
- Outline the indications for orbital atherectomy. 
- Identify the common complications of orbital atherectomy
-  Describe the procedural technique for performing orbital atherectomy.
