Perianal streptococcal dermatitis is a rather simple dermatologic disease to treat. However, patient education is an absolutely essential piece of the treatment plan that often gets overlooked. Patients and their parents require counseling on the importance of follow-up appointments. A repeat perineal swab needs to be obtained to ensure complete eradication of GABHS. Performing this step will reduce the chance of PSD recurrence. During the follow-up appointment, a urine specimen also needs to be collected and sent for analysis to monitor for post-streptococcal nephritis. Finally, patients and families need to be educated on proper hygiene techniques to reduce the transmission of the causative organism.
