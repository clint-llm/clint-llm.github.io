- In patients with hemorrhagic hypovolemic shock, prompt bleeding source control with early balanced blood product resuscitation are key.

- In patients with non-hemorrhagic hypovolemic shock, the etiology of fluid loss must be promptly identified and treated.

- Monitoring electrolytes and acid/base status in patients in hypovolemic shock are of utmost importance.

- Determining a patient's response to fluid resuscitation should rely on various assessments, including ultrasound, pulse pressure wave variation, passive leg raises, or central venous pressure, in addition to relying on clinical presentation and laboratory values such as lactate.

- For replacement fluids, we recommend isotonic crystalloids over colloids.
