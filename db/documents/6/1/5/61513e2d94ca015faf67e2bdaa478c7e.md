Signal transduction is the means by which an electrical, physical, or chemical signal elicits a cellular response by activating a cellular receptor and initiating a chain of biochemical events. Most commonly, signal transduction occurs when an extracellular molecule binds to a transmembrane protein receptor, triggering intracellular protein kinase activation, and protein phosphorylation. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) constitute one class of transmembrane receptors and are characterized by the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of their cytoplasmic regions.

RTKs are expressed in tissues throughout the body both during intrauterine development and in adulthood and play a critical role in regulating cell differentiation, proliferation, survival, metabolism, and migration. Unsurprisingly then, research has found RTK dysfunction to play a role in a variety of human diseases, most notably cancers. An in-depth understanding of specific RTKs, their signaling cascades, and their effects on cell function have allowed for the development of a multitude of targeted drug therapies, with significant improvements in clinical outcomes.
