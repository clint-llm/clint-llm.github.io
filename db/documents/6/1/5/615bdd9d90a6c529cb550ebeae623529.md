**Long-Term Compliance and an Interprofessional Approach**

Maintenance of the exercise program in patients with type 2 diabetes is an important goal because it is associated with long-term cardiovascular benefits and reduced mortality. Primary care physicians and nursing professional diabetes educators caring for patients play an important role in educating these patients of the importance of exercise regimen as a therapeutic option for the disease management. There have been studies which suggested simple behavioral counseling by clinicians and nurse educators during routine clinic visits gave encouraging results for increasing compliance, although long-term follow-up is needed.

Exercise regimens are difficult to maintain for more than 3 months due to intense nature of the programs requiring extra visits for special classes. In a 10-year study of 255 patients with diabetes enrolled in a diabetes education program emphasizing exercise, the rate of compliance fell from 80% for 6 weeks to less than 50% for 3 months. The compliance rate further dropped to less than 20% at 1 year. A coordinated interprofessional approach with educators working with clinicians will help to maximize compliance. (Level V)
