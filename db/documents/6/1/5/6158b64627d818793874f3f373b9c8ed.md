According to the survey-based studies, twenty to ninety percent of the general population is exposed to one or more extreme stressful events in their life.

**Risk Factors**

There is limited evidence on risk factors for developing ASD after a traumatic event. However, the risk factors for PTSD could also be applied to ASD due to its close resemblance. Based on the two metanalyses performed by Ozer et al. and Brewin et al., Sareen J. categorized risk factors in three buckets:

- Pretrauma factors: 

- Female gender
- Intellectual disability
- Lack of education
- History of traumatic events
- History of psychiatric disorder(s)
- Personality disorder(s)
- Genetics

- Peritrauma factors:

- Trauma severity
- Assault
- Rape
- Physical injury

- Posttrauma factors:

- Acute stress disorder (ASD)
- Tachycardia
- Poor socioeconomic status
- Physical pain severity
- ICU stay
- Brain injury
- Dissociative symptoms
- Disability
- Subsequent life stress
