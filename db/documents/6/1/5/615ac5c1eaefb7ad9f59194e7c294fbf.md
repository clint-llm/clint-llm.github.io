The formation of the pelvic bones involves a fusion of multiple elements which allow articulation of the axial skeleton with the lower extremities. The hip bones (ilium, ischium, and pubis) remain separate but attach via the triradiate cartilage in early life. Upon puberty, these bones fuse to form the acetabulum, a socket on the lateral aspect of the hip where the femoral head articulates.

The lateral plate mesoderm forms the ilium, ischium, and pubis. These bones then undergo endochondral ossification, similar to long bones, but an initial blastemal structure forms, which undergoes chondrification. Afterward, sites of primary ossification centers form. The sacrum undergoes this type of ossification as well.
