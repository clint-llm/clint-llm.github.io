First-trimester pregnancy transabdominal ultrasound should be performed with a low-frequency probe, ideally with a large convex footprint. If a transvaginal ultrasound exam is indicated, an endocavitary probe with sheath can improve visualization of the uterus and adnexal structures. A high-level disinfectant system is needed to clean the endocavitary probe between uses.
