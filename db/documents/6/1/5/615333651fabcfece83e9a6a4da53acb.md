After the physical exam, the varicocele can be confirmed with high-resolution color-flow Doppler ultrasound, which will show dilation of the vessels of the pampiniform plexus, typically greater than 3 mm in diameter. Venography is not needed.

Thermal imaging is another non-invasive, painless, and non-contact technique for evaluation and confirmation of a possible varicocele.

Testicular strain elastography is being studied for its potential benefit in identifying varicocele patients who would benefit from treatment.

Always consider the possibility of renal cell carcinoma as a possible cause of any isolated right-sided varicocele.  A right-sided renal vein tumor thrombus can extend into the vena cava causing venous obstruction resulting in spermatic vein obstruction and a right-sided varicocele. If this is considered possible, CT imaging is recommended.
