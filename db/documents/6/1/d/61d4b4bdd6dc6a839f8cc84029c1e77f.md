Almost 50% of the patients are symptomatic at birth and another 50% present within the first six months of life. The patient usually presents with difficulty in feeding and breathing, wheezing, retractions, and cyanosis. There is typically a history of chronic cough and recurrent respiratory infections. Due to overlapping symptoms, some patients are wrongly diagnosed with pneumonia or pneumothorax instead of congenital lobar emphysema.

On physical examination, there is usually wheezing and rhonchi. The affected lobe is hyper-resonant on percussion, and breath sounds are diminished in the area. Congenital cardiac defects are usually associated with congenital lobar emphysema.
