Zinc, cadmium, iron, and aluminum oxides are the most common metals involved in metal fume fever. Cadmium may produce a syndrome of pneumonitis, hypoxia, and even death, which in many respects is distinct from metal fume fever.

Bronchoalveolar lavage of zinc oxide exposed volunteers demonstrates elevated interleukin 6, interleukin 8, and tumor necrosis factor in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.

Metallothionein-transport proteins, mostly found in the cell's Golgi-apparatus, may modulate the response to metal oxides, and it has been hypothesized that this may impact the clinical response to metal fume fever.
