Postoperative ileus is a prolonged absence of bowel function after surgical procedures, usually abdominal surgery. It is a common postoperative complication with unclear etiology and pathophysiology. It is a benign condition that usually resolves with minimal intervention. Management of postoperative ileus relies on supportive care after excluding more serious and reversible surgical conditions such as mechanical obstruction. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of postoperative ileus and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of postoperative ileus. 
- Review the appropriate evaluation process of postoperative ileus.
- Outline the management options available for postoperative ileus.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of postoperative ileus and improve outcomes.
