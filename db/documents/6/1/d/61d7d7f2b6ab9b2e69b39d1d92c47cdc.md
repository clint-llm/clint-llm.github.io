Considering radiographs are the most important and frequently used modality in clinical imaging, standardized patient positioning techniques are essential in evaluating any pathology of the body part being imaged. Frontal and lateral views of the chest allow a radiologist to evaluated for heart size, location of pneumonia, the volume of pneumothorax, among other disease processes.

The importance of appropriate patient positioning is probably most important in the setting of musculoskeletal imaging. Multiple projections assist in characterizing fractures, joint alignment, and other pathologies such as arthritis and tumors. Non-standard projections can potentially lead to missed diagnoses and associated morbidity. The importance of standard flexion and extension positioning is paramount, considering these positions can affect the appearance of standard anatomy on radiographs. The potential for ascribing a diagnosis in the setting of a normal study (i.e., a "false positive") is important to consider when anatomy appears altered due to non-standard positioning and projections. The technologist, therefore, has a crucial role in the delivery of standard techniques in image acquisition.
