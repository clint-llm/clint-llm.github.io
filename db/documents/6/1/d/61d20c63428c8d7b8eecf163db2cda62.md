A diagnosis of mesenteric adenitis is self-limiting and requires no treatment. Hence, the first step in management is to rule out the diagnoses, which require surgical intervention. After establishing the diagnosis of mesenteric adenitis, the treatment is as follows: supportive care with IV hydration and pain control with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications.

It is essential to explain the diagnosis clearly to the patient and family, as there is often no apparent cause; this can cause anxiety and concerns for patients and their families, so it is vital to warn them that improvement may take time and can happen slowly over several weeks.Â  It is appropriate to schedule office visits during this window to monitor their progress and discuss concerns.
