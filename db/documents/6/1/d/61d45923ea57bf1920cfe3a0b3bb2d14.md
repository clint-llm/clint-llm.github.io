Black Cohosh is widely used by many women for the treatment of a range of medical disorders, but solid clinical evidence to back up the claims made by the manufacturers is lacking. Thus, the primary care provider (MD, DO, NP, or PA), pharmacist, and nursing staff should educate the patient on the use of black cohosh and other dietary supplements. Patients should be informed that efficacy in achieving relief of menopausal symptoms has been published for over 50 years. But clinical studies relating to human physiology have been largely inconclusive. Studies do not show any consistent effect on the follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, or estrogen. Studies have shown no consistent impact on tissues of the female reproductive tract. As of now, black cohosh has actions similar to placebo.
