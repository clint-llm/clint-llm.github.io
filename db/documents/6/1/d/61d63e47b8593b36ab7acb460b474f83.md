A semitransparent ridge called the funiculus separans separates the area postrema from the vagal triangle, which lies over the dorsal vagal nucleus, on the caudal end of the fourth ventricle floor. The area postrema is composed of vascular and cellular components. The vascular part is mainly composed of sinusoidal fenestrated capillaries, forming a portal system; with the cellular part composed of flattened ependymal cells, glial cells, and small neurons.

A part of the dorsal vagal complex, the area postrema is well studied as the vomiting center. It also is one of the circumventricular organs, which can detect circulating chemical messengers in the blood and incorporate neural inputs in the brainstem.
