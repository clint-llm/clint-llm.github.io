Before administering bismuth subsalicylate (BSS), the recommendation is to assess the patient's active medication therapies and history of allergies. Dose adjustment of BSS or alternate treatment may be necessary depending on the patient's medical history. Patients should be counseled on the proper administration of BSS and what to do in cases where diarrhea symptoms persist.

The therapeutic efficacy of BSS is demonstrated by the reduction in the number of unformed stools and the relief of symptoms. Most patients should see a positive therapeutic response within four hours of the ingestion of BSS. Toxicity of BSS is rare; as such, salicylate plasma concentrations do not need to be monitored.
