Rectus sheath hematoma is caused by rupture of an epigastric artery or one of its perforating branches. The vessel injury may be due to blunt or penetrating trauma, surgery, or strong contractions of the rectus muscle. Since the epigastric arteries run deep along the posterior rectus sheath, making a diagnosis during a physical exam is difficult, especially in patients who have obesity. The hematoma is usually posterior to the rectus muscle fibers, subcutaneous fat, and skin. Palpating a tender firm bulge is the most common physic exam finding. The fluctuation sign of a fluid collection is not usually possible to detect due to the deep location of the hematoma. The lower quadrants of the abdomen are usually involved because of the long epigastric branches and the lack of a tamponade effect from the loose connective tissues of the rectus sheath.
