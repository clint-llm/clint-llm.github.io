Stable angina, also is known as typical angina or angina pectoris, is a symptom of myocardial ischemia. Stable angina is characterized by chest discomfort or anginal equivalent that is provoked with exertion and alleviated at rest or with nitroglycerin. This is often one of the first manifestations or warning signs of underlying coronary disease. Angina affects 10 million people in the United States (US); given this, it is important to not only recognize the signs and symptoms but also appropriately risk stratify and manage these individuals.
