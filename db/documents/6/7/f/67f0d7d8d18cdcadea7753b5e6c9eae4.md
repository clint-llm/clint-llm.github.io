Rehabilitation goals may aim in balancing the use of primitive reflexes such as ATNR to increase posture, balance, hand function, and movement of patients to achieve a task while reintegrating these reflexes into a higher level of postural control. This process should be part of the neuromuscular re-education programs for stroke patients and is also essential during primitive reflex integration therapy, which includes repeating mimic movement patterns from the first year of life for children with low psychomotor skills and skeletal deformities with correction at the basic neurological level. By introducing carefully the factors producing motor stress, such as gravity, the complexity of the movement required, and requirements of the activity or skill, into the treatment program, the appearance of primitive reflexes gives a hint on the level of difficulty and demand of the tasks. Once the patient is observed to rely on primitive reflex as his maladaptive response, the task should be modified appropriately to allow normal responses and functions. The reflexes then serve as a feedback mechanism to analyze the patient's movement and not as a mere symptom to be corrected.
