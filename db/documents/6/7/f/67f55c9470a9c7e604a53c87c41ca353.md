Amphetamine toxicity generally occurs in the setting of recreational use. METH comes in different forms and can be smoked, inhaled, injected, or orally consumed. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, smoking METH is the most common way of abuse. Patients who smoke or inject METH experience a strong “flash” which sometimes potentiate drug addiction with adverse health outcomes. The etiology is unclear; however, binging can be related to tolerance in which the user may require higher and higher doses to get the same effect. This is the consequence of both down regulations of the postsynaptic receptors and depletion of presynaptic stores of neurotransmitter. There is always a high risk for amphetamine overdose due to its addiction potential. The high from amphetamines can make users feel increased amounts of energy, confidence, and sense of clarity. For these reasons, amphetamines can be very addicting both psychologically as well as physically due to the stimulating effects. This can take a detrimental toll on an individual’s body as there are long-term effects of amphetamine abuse which include damage to nerve cells, seizures, gross psychosis, strokes, and dysrhythmias.
