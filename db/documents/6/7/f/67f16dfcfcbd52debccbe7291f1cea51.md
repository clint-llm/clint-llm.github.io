The mainstay of measles treatment is prevention via routine immunization, which is highly effective in the prevention of measles.

For children residing in or traveling to areas with a measles outbreak or the potential for a measles outbreak when traveling outside of the United States, early measles vaccination (one dose) is recommended for children greater than 6 months but less than 12 months of age (with the continued routine administration of the two-dose regimen after 12 months of age).

In patients without evidence of immunity and are exposed to measles, the following is recommended based on the patient’s clinical circumstances:

- Pediatric patients:

- For infants 0 to 5 months of age, it is recommended that they receive immune globulin within 6 days of exposure.
- For infants 6 to 11 months of age, it is recommended that they receive either a measles vaccination within 72 hours of exposure or immune globulin within 6 days of exposure.
- For children greater than 12 months of age, who are unvaccinated, it is recommended that they receive measles vaccination within 72 hours of exposure (preferred over immune globulin). If the exposure occurred more than 72 hours, but within 6 days, the patient should receive immune globulin if they have not received at least one dose of the measles vaccine (unless the child is severely immunocompromised, see below).

- Pregnant women without evidence of immunity:

- It is recommended that they receive immune globulin.
- Measles vaccination, in conjunction with mumps and rubella, is contraindicated.

- For immunocompromised patients:

- Immune globulin should be administered regardless of immunologic or vaccination status.

- Healthcare workers:

- Two doses of measles vaccine at routine intervals should be administered for unvaccinated healthcare personnel regardless of the birth year who lack laboratory evidence of measles immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease. 
- Health care workers that lack evidence of immunity who were exposed to a patient with measles should be excluded from the workplace from day 5 through day 21 after exposure.

Note: Individuals without evidence of immunity with measles exposure who received immune globulin should subsequently receive a measles vaccine no earlier than six months after immune globulin administration unless measles vaccination is contraindicated.

When presented with a potential case of measles, airborne transmission precautions should be initiated and maintained for four days after the rash presentation in otherwise healthy individuals and the duration of illness for immunocompromised patients.

There is no specific treatment of measles except supportive care to relieve common symptoms associated with this condition. Supportive measures include antipyretics for fevers, hydration, and adequate nutritional support, including the encouragement of breastfeeding.

The World Health Organization recommends the administration of vitamin A for all children with measles, but particularly for children who reside in areas where the case fatality rate is more than 1%, areas with known vitamin A deficiency, and in severe cases of complicated measles. In normal circumstances, vitamin A maintains epithelial tissue and is crucial for immunological function. During a measles infection, vitamin A stores are depleted, resulting in an inability to resist the current and secondary infections associated with measles.

If indicated, the first dose should be provided immediately on diagnosis and a second dose the following day. For infants less than 6 months of age, the doses are 50,000 IU; for children between 6 and 12 months, 100,000 IU; and for children aged 12 months and older, 200,000 IU.

The measles virus is susceptible to the medication ribavirin in vitro, but due to a lack of clinical data, its routine use is not recommended.
