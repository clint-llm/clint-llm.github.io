The last stage of SVS described by Scott et al. involves the ultimate career disposition and has important life-altering provider consequences and institutional impact.

- “Drop out”:  Providers leave their current job, specialty, or clinical care altogether.  This may cost institutions upwards of $500,000 per physician to replace.

- “Survive”: Providers stay in current employment but are haunted by the event and adverse outcome and continue to have long-lasting SVS symptoms.

- “Thrive”: Providers adopt a growth mindset, choosing to turn the experience into one that improves systems processes to benefit future patients and providers, such as quality improvement initiatives or improved support systems for providers after an adverse event.

Though these career disposition categories provide a convenient frame of discussion, not all affected providers fall within a discrete category, nor are the categories mutually exclusive. For instance, a provider may leave clinical practice for a period of time (dropout) but later return and thrive. Or a provider who appears to thrive and learn from the experience may still have moments of self-doubt and intrusive reflections of the adverse outcome.
