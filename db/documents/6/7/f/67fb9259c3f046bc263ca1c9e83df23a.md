The incidence of hip dislocation following a primary total hip arthroplasty is estimated to be anywhere from 2 to 10%.

**Risk Factors for THA Dislocation**

Risk factors include:

- Prior hip surgery (the most significant independent risk factor for dislocation)

- Advanced age (older than 70 years)

- Component malpositioning: Excessive anteversion results in anterior dislocation, and excessive retroversion results in posterior dislocation

- Neuromuscular conditions/disorders (for example, Parkinson disease)

- Drug/alcohol abuse
