The majority of cases do not require consultations. In some complicated cases, consultations may be required such as:

- Formation of abscess or infarction of testicle may require surgical consultation.

- Infectious diseases can be consulted in the case of immune-compromised patients.

- Urology should be consulted if there is a suspicion of torsion on presentation.
