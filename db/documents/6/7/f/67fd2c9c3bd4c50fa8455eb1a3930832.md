For the desired motor function to occur, it goes through three distinct phases: ideation, planning, and execution. Structures involved in praxis are mainly in the dominant parietal cortex, frontal cortex, basal ganglia, and corresponding white matter connecting these areas. Spatiotemporal movement formulas or visual-kinesthetic motor engrams, also known as praxicons, are essential for skilled learned movements. Activation of these models can be visual, auditory, verbal, or tactile—a model for praxis based on the work of Heilman and Rothi (Figure 1).

Neurons in the inferior parietal cortex fire selectively to initiate the process of praxis after recognition of the input provided, especially in left parietal sub-regions.

After conceptualization and semantics, learned motor programs are essential in executing the desired action. The supplementary motor areas in the premotor cortex translate the formulas into specific sequential movements and bilateral coordination. The prefrontal cortex helps sequence fingers, hands, and arms; these are represented functionally in the inferior frontal gyri for the proximal limb and left lateralized for distal limbs.
