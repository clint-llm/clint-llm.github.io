# Continuing Education Activity

Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are one of the most effective forms of contraception available today, with rates of failure similar to various forms of sterilization. There are many benefits of IUDs, including efficacy, ease of use, reversible nature, and patient satisfaction, especially with time commitment for long-term use and cost. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, risks, and benefits of intrauterine device placement and removal. This activity will also detail the role of the interprofessional team in providing patients who undergo intrauterine device placement and removal with the best possible care.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures, indications, and contraindications of IUD placement and removal. 
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to IUD placement and removal. 
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and clinical significance of IUD placement and removal.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding IUD placement and removal and to improve outcomes.

# Introduction

Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are one of the most effective forms of contraception available today, with rates of failure similar to various forms of sterilization.

# Anatomy and Physiology

All IUDs currently available in the United States are T-shaped, with the top of the T resting across the top of the endometrial cavity. IUDs are between 28 mm to 32 mm wide and 30 mm to 36 mm long. Uterine width traditionally has been assumed to be adequate in all patients; however, recent ultrasound studies have indicated that cavity width in nulliparous women may be narrower than device width.

# Indications

Based on the fact that there are two different types of IUDs, including levonorgestrel and copper-containing, it should be understood that there are different indications for each of these. All IUDs are indicated for the use of contraception.

For the levonorgestrel-containing IUD, there are three different strengths of levonorgestrel available, 13.5 mg, 19.5 mg, and 52 mg. They are all equally effective at providing reliable contraception.

The copper IUD is approved for contraceptive use for up to 10 years. However, there is a documented off-label indication to use this as emergency contraception within 5 days of unprotected intercourse. The failure rate after placement for emergency contraception is approximately 0.1%.

IUDs may be placed immediately post-partum within 10 minutes of delivery of the placenta, delayed post-partum within 4-6 weeks of delivery, and post-abortion, so long as it was not a septic abortion.

Additionally, there are also indications for the removal of the IUD. The primary indication for removal is the patient's preference for any reason, including, but not limited to, desire for pregnancy, irregular bleeding pattern, heavy vaginal bleeding, and discomfort or pain, which may represent the displacement of the device.

# Contraindications

Given that there are two classes of IUDs available, there are specific contraindications for each type of IUD. However, there are also universal contraindications that are specific to both types.

Universal contraindications for the use of IUD:

- Pregnancy or suspected pregnancy

- Sexually transmitted infection at the time of insertion, including cervicitis, vaginitis, or any other lower genital tract infection

- A congenital uterine abnormality that distorts the shape of the uterine cavity making insertion difficult

- Acute pelvic inflammatory disease

- History of pelvic inflammatory disease, unless a subsequent successful intrauterine pregnancy has occurred

- History of septic abortion or history of postpartum endometritis within the last 3 months

- Confirmed or suspicion of uterine or cervical malignancy/neoplasia

- Abnormal uterine bleeding of unknown origin

- Any condition that increases the risk of pelvic infection

- History of previously inserted IUD that has not been removed

- Hypersensitivity to any component of the device

For the levonorgestrel IUD, additional contraindications include:

- Confirmed or suspicion of breast malignancy or other progestin-sensitive cancer

- Liver tumors, benign or malignant

- Acute liver disease

For the copper IUD, additional contraindications include:

- Wilson disease

- Sensitivity to copper

# Equipment

Regardless of the type of IUD being used or removed, the equipment remains essentially the same, except for the specific IUD being inserted. The equipment needed to perform IUD placement includes:

- Gloves - two pairs, including a pair of sterile gloves

- Speculum

- An anti-septic solution with applicators

- Sterile uterine sound

- Sterile tenaculum

- An IUD in sterile packaging

- Anesthesia with appropriate materials if planning to perform a paracervical block

- Sterile sharp

- Long-handled scissors

The equipment needed to perform IUD removal includes gloves, speculum, sterile forceps, and a cytobrush.

# Personnel

For a successful IUD placement and/or removal, the healthcare professional performing the procedure must be trained in using the specific inserters and comfortable with the various procedures. The manufacturing companies of the various IUDs provide training for providers and have extensive resources available through their respective websites. It would also be beneficial to have at least one other individual present to help with handing the materials needed. There is a risk of displacement and possible uterine perforation if a less experienced provider places the device.

# Preparation

The first step in setting a patient up for success with an IUD is to provide counseling about the various forms of contraception available. Patients should be counseled that all forms of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC), including IUDs and subdermal implants, are the most efficacious in preventing pregnancy and are similar to the efficacy of tubal ligation and vasectomy.

After a patient decides that the IUD is the most appropriate contraception option, there are several different ways to get the patient ready for insertion. Prior to beginning the procedure, it is crucial to confirm a negative pregnancy test. First, there is the quick start method, which allows for same-day counseling and insertion, improves the rate of patient follow-through, and decreases the rate of unintended pregnancies.

- Less than seven days after the start of regular menses

- No sexual intercourse since the start of last menses

- Consistently using another form of contraception reliably

- Less than 7 days after spontaneous or induced abortion

- 4 weeks postpartum

- Fully or nearly fully breastfeeding and amenorrheic, and less than six months postpartum

If these criteria are not met, it is an acceptable practice to bridge the patient with a non-implantable form of contraception, including oral contraceptives, vaginal rings, transdermal patches, condoms, or medroxyprogesterone acetate injections.

Additionally, if needed, based on the patient's sexual history, a screen for sexually transmitted infections should also be done. Women, who have not been screened for sexually transmitted infection, should be screened at the time of insertion if indicated by guidelines; however, this should not delay the insertion of the device.

Once counseling and a negative pregnancy test are confirmed, the next step is to obtain informed consent. The risks, benefits, and side effects of the procedure must be explained to the patient. Risks to the patient include pain at the time of insertion, uterine perforation, which may necessitate surgery or cause unintended pregnancy, infection, bleeding at the site of insertion, and possible expulsion, which may go unnoticed, leading to unintended pregnancy, and alterations in a patient's monthly bleeding pattern. Additionally, if pregnancy does occur with IUD in place, there is a higher risk of ectopic pregnancy or septic abortion.

There is also some discussion and disagreement regarding the using medications prior to the procedure and during the procedure for pain control. Starting with oral pain medications, researchers have looked at various non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, including ibuprofen and naproxen, as well as tramadol, and found some benefits to prescribing naproxen or tramadol prior to insertion.

# Technique or Treatment

After deciding that an IUD placement is the best choice for the patient, the following procedure is followed:

- Confirm a negative pregnancy test.

- Obtain informed consent.

- Have the patient move into a dorsal lithotomy position.

- With gloved hands, perform a bimanual exam to determine whether the uterus is anteverted or retroverted.

- Insert speculum and identify the cervix.

- Cleanse cervix and vaginal fornices with a cleansing solution, typically povidone-iodine. If the patient has iodine or shellfish allergy, use chlorhexidine gluconate.

- At this time, if desired, consider paracervical block placement or application of the anesthetic gel, as discussed above.

- Switch to sterile gloves at this time, and using a sterile single-tooth tenaculum, grasp the anterior lip of the cervix and apply gentle traction to straighten the cervical canal and uterine cavity. If the uterus is retroverted, it may be beneficial to grasp the posterior lip of the cervix.

- Using sterile uterine sound, determine the depth of the uterine cavity, typically between 6cm to 9 cm. If less than 6 cm, IUD should not be placed. If there is difficulty in placing the uterine sound, try cervical dilators. If cervical dilators are needed, it is recommended to use a paracervical block.

- Once uterine depth is determined, follow package instructions for the specific IUD being inserted.

- Once IUD is inserted and strings are visible, cut strings to a length of 3 cm to 4 cm with sharp scissors; note this length in the chart.

- Remove the tenaculum and make sure there is no bleeding from the site of the tenaculum, and remove the speculum.

- Have the patient follow up in 4-6 weeks for a string check to ensure proper placement.

After the IUD has been in for the approved amount of time, it is time to remove the IUD. If the patient desires further contraception, it is permissible to remove and insert an IUD on the same day. For IUD removal, the steps are as follows:

- Obtain informed consent.

- Have the patient move into a dorsal lithotomy position.

- With gloved hands, insert the speculum, and identify the cervix and IUD strings. If IUD strings are not immediately identified, twirl cytobrush in os to help identify strings.

- Grasp IUD strings with ring forceps.

- Place gentle traction on the IUD strings and remove the device from the uterine cavity.

- Ensure that the IUD is intact and no portions are missing.

# Complications

When counseling patients about the risks associated with the insertion of IUDs, it is important to realize that there are specific factors that contribute to a poor or unexpected outcome. One study looked at predicting complications based on various characteristics of patients and providers.

There are very few complications associated with the procedure of IUD insertion. The most common complication is displacement or accidental removal of the IUD after insertion, usually occurring within the first three months of insertion.

The most concerning complication for a patient is unintended pregnancy. While becoming pregnant with an IUD is exceedingly rare, this can happen in a small percentage of patients. The percentage of patients to become pregnant with the copper IUD is approximately 0.6%, and for the 20 mg levonorgestrel IUD, the rate is approximately 0.2%.

Additionally, in a small percentage of patients, there is also a risk of possible uterine perforation when inserting the IUD. There is conflicting data on the rate of this as sometimes the initial perforation is not identified at the time of insertion.

With both insertion and removal of IUDs, there is a risk of vasovagal symptoms with associated bradycardia that may occur when engaging with the cervix. These patients should be managed symptomatically. These symptoms are more likely to occur in nulliparous women or women who perceive greater pain at the time of insertion or removal.

# Clinical Significance

As noted above, there are two types of IUDs available in the United States, which include copper-containing and levonorgestrel-containing devices. These two types of devices have different methods of action to prevent pregnancy. The copper IUD works by preventing sperm motility and viability within the uterine cavity by causing a localized cytotoxic inflammatory response.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

There has been great improvement in increasing access to various forms of LARC in recent years. However, some barriers remain, especially for nulliparous women and adolescents. There are groups of healthcare providers that have not been fully educated on the use of LARC in nulliparous patients, including adolescents. There is evidence to suggest that these methods should be encouraged in these populations because of their reversibility, effectiveness, and patient satisfaction. Additionally, the barriers that remain for adolescents and nulliparous women include unfamiliarity and/or discomfort with the device, initial cost of device and insertion, lack of parental acceptance, and unfamiliarity of the healthcare provider providing the consultation. However, research has shown that when patients are educated at length on the various forms of contraception available with no worry of cost, 67% of women chose a form of LARC, with 56% choosing an IUD.
