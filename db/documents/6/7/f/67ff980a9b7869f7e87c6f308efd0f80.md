AML should be suspected in anyone with unexplained cytopenias (decreased cell count of white blood cells, hemoglobin, or platelets), the presence of circulating blast cells in the peripheral blood, easy bruising or bleeding or recurrent infections. In some cases, they can present with renal failure secondary to tumor lysis syndrome which is an oncologic emergency.

Some patients may have elevated LDH and hyperuricemia, suggesting tumor lysis syndrome, which is a medical emergency.

The blood smear will reveal circulating blasts and schistocytes if DIC is present.

The presence of at least 20% blasts in the bone marrow or peripheral blood is diagnostic of AML. It can be diagnosed with bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. Additional diagnostics include flow cytometry, cytogenetics, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The presence of Auer rods (clumps of azurophilic granules resembling elongated needles) is diagnostic of AML. Auer rods can be seen in many subtypes of AML, but abundantly seen in APL.

Oncologic emergencies associated with AML include neurologic or respiratory distress due to leukostasis, APL-induced DIC, tumor lysis syndrome, and central nervous system (CNS) involvement.

Other tests include a chest x-ray, MUGA scan to assess the heart, and ECG.
