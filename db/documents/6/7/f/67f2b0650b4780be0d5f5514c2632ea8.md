Active tuberculosis is a condition in which Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes infection; typically in the lungs, although many systems can be involved. The World Health Organization estimates that, annually, around 8 million people develop active tuberculosis globally, and nearly 2 million people die from the disease. Of every 10 people infected with M. tuberculosis, one may develop an active infection sometime in their lifetime. After infection, the risk of developing active tuberculosis is highest in the first year, but the active disease usually occurs many years later in most patients. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of active tuberculosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the etiology of active tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
- Describe the treatment options available for active tuberculosis.
- Outline the screening tests for tuberculosis.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team members to improve patient outcomes.
