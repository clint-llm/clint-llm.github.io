A non-toxic goiter is a benign entity and only causes aesthetic problems. However, if the size is large, it may compress the trachea, laryngeal nerves, and the esophagus. Most benign goiters have an excellent prognosis. A small percentage may cause hyperthyroidism and some may become malignant, hence life long surveillance is necessary. In people with compression, after surgical removal, the tracheal narrowing reverses and results in improved lung function.
