There are a variety of approaches to rehabilitation and maintenance of patients with opioid use. Rehabilitation begins with a cognitive-behavioral approach similar to that used in the treatment of other chronic conditions. Maintenance programs should include psychological support. Patients are encouraged and motivated to change through education, reward cooperation, and medications. The goal of therapy is to minimize drug use relapse. Patients with substance-use disorders are encouraged to participate in self-help programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous. The combination of education, motivational enhancement, and self-help groups helps patients change how they think about the ways that opioids affect their lives.

Together various forms of rehabilitation help patients recognize that change is possible, and there is a need to decrease behaviors that perpetuate illicit-drug use while developing new behaviors that diminish drug-related problems.

Opioid replacement, maintenance, or substitution therapy involves replacing an opioid with a longer-acting but less euphoric and addicting opioid. The commonly used drugs are buprenorphine and methadone prescribed and given under medical supervision. The combination of buprenorphine and naloxone is the most widely used. Opioid maintenance drugs help the patient experience reduced symptoms of drug withdrawal, reduced cravings, and little or no euphoria. Almost half of the patients can maintain abstinence from additional opioids while receiving replacement therapy.

Methadone, an oral mu agonist, is commonly used in opioid replacement. It has been widely used and studied worldwide, and methadone maintenance is a well-established approach. In the U.S., methadone is offered only for specially monitored clinics. Patients with an opioid-use disorder with physiologic features or who are likely to relapse would be eligible for a methadone clinic. The advantages of methadone treatment include blocking euphoric effects, decreasing narcotic craving, and reducing transmission of infectious diseases. Methadone maintenance is non-sedating and is medically safe, provided there is no concomitant use of other prescription or illicit drugs. The maintenance phase begins approximately six weeks after the initiation of therapy. The length of the maintenance phase can last years to an entire lifetime. Tapering off methadone can take weeks or months, depending on the patient's opioid dependence.

An alternative oral, long-acting opioid is buprenorphine for maintenance therapy. Buprenorphine treatment reduces morbidity and mortality. The recommended for buprenorphine is the minimum treatment of 12 months, although, as with methadone, risks of relapse and overdose increase following discontinuation of buprenorphine. Reliable and consistent data support the effectiveness of buprenorphine maintenance. Initiating buprenorphine maintenance as soon as possible can enhance efficacy. Oral buprenorphine is processed in the liver but absorbed as a sublingual tablet or buccal film. It demonstrates a reduction in opioid withdrawal symptoms and partially blocks intoxication from other opioids. Office-based maintenance with buprenorphine can prescribe for up to 275 patients as of 2016. Buprenorphine effects last for 24 to 36 hours. The induction phase of buprenorphine lasts approximately seven days in patients who are misusing a short-acting opioid such as heroin. The stabilization phase begins when there is a marked reduction in craving; opioid misuse is diminished or absent, and withdrawal symptoms are absent. It typically takes eight weeks to reach maintenance status. Buprenorphine does not precipitate withdrawal unless it is in its intravenous form. In this case, the withdrawal symptoms can be sudden and severe.

Patient selection criteria for buprenorphine maintenance resemble that of methadone maintenance. Considerations of buprenorphine compared to methadone include the cost, the availability of methadone clinics, as well as access to physicians licensed to prescribe buprenorphine. Comparing methadone and buprenorphine, they both improve outcomes. Methadone maintenance is associated with higher rates of patient retention. Moreover, buprenorphine is more expensive than methadone. The cost of buprenorphine might be more than going to a methadone clinic. Buprenorphine is safer than methadone during the induction of labor, and its administration can take place in offices. Buprenorphine is associated with less respiratory depression compared to methadone. There is no universal agreement on who should receive what therapy.

Naltrexone works by blocking opioid effects and helps maintain abstinence from opioids by being a mu-receptor agonist. The initiation of naltrexone treatment is only when the patient is free of physiological opioid dependence. Seven days without acute withdrawal symptoms is a requirement before starting the medication. Both oral and intramuscular naltrexone is superior to placebo in maintaining abstinence from opioids, but other studies have shown them to be ineffective.

Clonidine or lofexidine treats the signs and symptoms of withdrawal as an adjunctive therapy. In some countries, not including the United States, long-term injecting drug users who fail methadone are treated with pure injectable diamorphine. Dihydrocodeine in both extended-release and immediate-release forms are useful in the maintenance treatment as an alternative to methadone or buprenorphine.

A methadone taper stabilizes a patient to prevent withdrawal but does not oversedate. Doses are decreased, 10% to 20% every one to two days over two to three weeks or longer. The taper can occur over approximately one week for hospitalized inpatients. In a methadone reduction program, the patient receives enough methadone to avoid withdrawal symptoms. Then after a period of stability, the dose is tapered until methadone can be discontinued or switch to an opiate with a more relaxed withdrawal profile, such as buprenorphine. Buprenorphine should be given 12 to 18 hours after the last dose of methadone. This delayed administration reduces the change of withdrawal in patients who are receiving long-acting drugs such as methadone. After the patient’s condition stabilizes for three to five days, the dose decreases over two or more weeks.
