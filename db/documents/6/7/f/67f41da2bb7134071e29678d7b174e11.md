The management of cryptosporidiosis is with an interprofessional team that consists of the emergency department physician, infectious disease specialist, internist, nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. Once the disorder is diagnosed, besides hydration, in immunocompetent patients, nitazoxanide is the treatment of choice and FDA-approved for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis. Unfortunately, it is not always successful in reducing symptoms. Paromomycin or azithromycin may also be used. However, in immunocompromised patients, these treatments may fail without immune reconstitution. Intact cellular immunity is essential for resolution of symptoms.

Environmental control of the pathogen is important. Interestingly, studies have shown that drinking bottled water alone does not decrease the risk of infection in endemic areas, highlighting the multiple possible avenues of environmental exposure that mustÂ be addressed. Good hand-washing and careful consideration of food and water sources are essential. Alcohol based hand sanitizers do not kill the oocysts. Importantly, cryptosporidia are resistant to typical ozone and chlorine-based water purification measures, which increases the risk of outbreaks associated with inadequately treated water supplies. Filtration is required to remove the organism from water supplies. Patients diagnosed with Cryptosporidium infections are advised to avoid swimming in public pools for at least two weeks after resolution of symptoms. Use of condoms is recommended to avoid anal-fecal transmission during intercourse.
