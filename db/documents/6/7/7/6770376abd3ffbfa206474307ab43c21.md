The primary contraindication for PE is the inability to achieve clear surgical margins free of malignancy (R0) in a well-informed patient.Â Because of the postoperative morbidity that may accompany PE, there is generally an unspoken consensus that exenteration should be offered only with resectable disease and with curative intent.

The appropriate role of PE in patients with metastatic disease is also unanswered. In general, PE should not be offered to patients who would not be candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy within conventional timeframes following PE due to the anticipated prolonged recovery interval.
