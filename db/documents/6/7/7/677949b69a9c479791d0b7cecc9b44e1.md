- Acute pericarditis/Myocarditis

- Symptomatic severe aortic stenosis

- Uncontrolled Arrhythmias causing symptoms or instability

- Acute aortic dissection

- High-risk Unstable Angina

- Decompensated or unstable heart failure with left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 35%

- Acute pulmonary embolism or pulmonary infarction

Relative
