Pleuropulmonary blastomas are rare, malignant mesenchymal tumors that typically present with non-specific symptoms. Radiologic features may increase the clinical suspicion for this condition, however, the diagnosis of a pleuropulmonary blastoma is based on microscopic features. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of pulmonary blastomas and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of pulmonary blastoma.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with pulmonary blastomas.
- Review the treatment and management options available for pulmonary blastomas.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the diagnosis and management of pulmonary blastoma and improve patient outcomes.
