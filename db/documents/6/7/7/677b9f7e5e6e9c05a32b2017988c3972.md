Cardiac amyloidosis has a variable prognosis. The treatment modalities differ with the etiological type. Understanding the disease course is vital on the patient's end. The patient needs to be aware of the systemic nature of the disease involvement.

The patient must understand the need for a multidisciplinary team required for the treatment, including a cardiologist, hematologist, gastroenterologist, and transplant specialist. Treatment of heart failure in cardiac amyloidosis differs from the standard guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure. Patients are usually sensitive even to the smallest possible doses, making a very slow titration necessary. This means a more generous follow-up schedule than heart failure due to other causes.
