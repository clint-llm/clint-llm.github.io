Hemolytic transfusion reactions are one possible complication from transfusions. Hemolysis is the rupture of red blood cells, and can occur intravascularly, or in the circulation, or extravascularly, or in the reticuloendothelial system. Hemolytic transfusion reactions can be immune or non-immune mediated. Immune hemolytic transfusions reactions occur due to mismatch or incompatibility of the patient with the donor products. Immune hemolytic transfusion reactions are divided into acute versus delayed hemolytic reactions. This activity illustrates the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of hemolytic transfusion reactions and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in prevention of these reactions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of a hemolytic transfusion reaction.
- Descibe the presentation of a patient with a hemolytic transfusion reaction.
- Review the management options available for hemolytic transfusion reactions.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and communication in order to prevent hemolytic transfusion reactions and improve outcomes.
