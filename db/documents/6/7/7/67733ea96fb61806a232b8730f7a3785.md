Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is almost universally fatal if untreated but improves to 60% to 70% survival with partial revisions.

Patients with tricuspid atresia are typically better with intervention, noting 90% survival at one year of age and 80% survival at ten years.

The prognosis for other causes of single ventricles vary by etiology; nevertheless, more than half survive two years with the average length of up to 30 to 40 years.
