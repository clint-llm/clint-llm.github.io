Multiple strategies have been proposed for the prevention of perineal trauma at the time of vaginal delivery. There is no consensus on the best ways to prevent or reduce the severity of lacerations.

Perineal massage has been shown to decrease the incidence of lacerations requiring suture, although the reduction was minor.

Perineal support or a “hands-on” approach, can be protective of the perineum and decrease the severity of perineal lacerations at the time of delivery.

Delayed or immediate pushing after a woman reached ten centimeters of dilation showed no difference in the incidence of perineal lacerations. However, there was a higher incidence of delivery with intact perineum in women who delivered in the lateral position with delayed pushing compared to immediate pushing in the lithotomy position.

Warm compresses can be used during the second stage of labor to decrease the risk of third- and fourth-degree lacerations.
