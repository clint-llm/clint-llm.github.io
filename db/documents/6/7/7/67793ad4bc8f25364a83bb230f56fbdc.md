The initial and ongoing management of napalm injuries may require consultation with trauma surgeons, pulmonologists, burn specialists, plastic surgeons, intensivists, physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians, physical and occupational therapists, psychiatrists, and psychologists. Early toxicologist input may be helpful in those more seriouslyÂ injured or those with altered mental status and concern for carbon monoxide or cyanide exposure.
