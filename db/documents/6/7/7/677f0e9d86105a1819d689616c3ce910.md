The operating team is made of the orthopedic surgeon, the surgical assistant, scrub nurse, and circulating staff. The anesthetic team and operating theatre practitioner are an essential part of the team as well. Most certainly, in all cases, image intensifiers have to be used, so the presence of radiographers is very important.
