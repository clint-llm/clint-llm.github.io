Although this mechanism has not been substantiated, phenazopyridine is believed to exert an analgesic action locally on the urinary tract mucosa.

The pharmacokinetic characteristics of phenazopyridine are known but have not been evaluated in depth. The drug is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract quickly following oral administration and achieves a Tmax in the plasma after 2 to 3 hours.

Studies show that the kidneys excrete roughly one-half (41 to 65%) of phenazopyridine as an unchanged drug following an oral dose.
