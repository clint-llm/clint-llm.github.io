Tetramine synthesis was first documented in Germany in 1949. The substance's toxicity was discovered through occupational exposure to rayon fabric-impregnated flame retardants. Upholstery workers exposed to the fabric experienced multiple symptoms, including seizures. Further investigation confirmed that the flame retardant agents in the fabric (sulfamide and formaldehyde) reacted and formed tetramine.

Most documented cases are in China, with more than 14,000 instances reported between 1991 and 2010.

No intentional poisoning cases have been documented in the United States. A notable case in China occurred when a food vendor poisoned his competitor's food with a tetramine rodenticide. In all, 300 customers were poisoned, and 42 deaths occurred.

Due to its use in rural areas as an effective rodenticide, mass exposures are common in the countryside. In 2001, 200 individuals were exposed to tetramine in a rural area. In addition, due to the stability of tetramine in water for 6 weeks, there have been concerns that poisoned rats eaten by roaming dogs in rural areas may have toxic concentrations in their tissues through bioaccumulation.
