Children presenting in the neonatal period have a very poor prognosis and usually die within the first year of life. Patients who present in later childhoodÂ can develop progressive liver disease/failure and have slightly longer survival after diagnosis as compared to the neonatal form. Patients who present in adolescence have a slightly longer survival but usually develop progressive neurological symptoms, including spasticity and peripheral neuropathy later in life.
