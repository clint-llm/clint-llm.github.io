Primary treatment and management of wheat allergies is avoidance of both food and inhaled wheat allergens.

In cases of exposure and an anaphylactic reaction, the administration of epinephrine is the lifesaving treatment. Epinephrine comes in either a 0.15 or 0.3 mg intramuscular injection and is typically injected into the lateral thigh. All patients should go to the emergency room for further evaluation and antihistamines, glucocorticoids, and beta-agonist are additional secondary treatment options.
