Thyroiditis causes damage to thyroid follicular cells, resulting in no new thyroid hormone production and excessive release of large amounts of triiodothyronine(T3) and thyroxine(T4). These excess hormones contribute to clinical and biochemical hyperthyroidism and inhibition of TSH (negative feedback). With the release of the stored thyroid hormone and the absence of new thyroid hormone production, the phase of hyperthyroidism can last only for 2 to 8 weeks. During this early inflammatory state, the thyroid gland is mildly enlarged and is tender to palpate.

After the inflammation is subsided, new thyroid follicular cells are generated and resume thyroid hormone synthesis. This whole process may take 2 to 8 weeks, during which time the patient goes through a short phase of euthyroidism and hypothyroidism before returning to normal thyroid function.

Hyperthyroidism in subacute thyroiditis is usually mild and transient, but it can rarely cause ventricular tachycardia and even thyroid storm.
