Retained dental roots arise most commonly due to prior dental extraction procedures, during which they are intentionally or unintentionally left behind. They can also arise from facial trauma that results in dental fractures. Their removal may be warranted to make way for a future dental implant or dental prosthesis or due to odontogenic pain, infection, or associated pathology. The extraction of retained root tips is a surgical procedure frequently performed in the outpatient setting by dentists and dental specialists. Appropriately managing retained roots requires knowledge of dental morphology, current root removal techniques, indications, and contraindications. This activity reviews the proper evaluation and treatment strategies used to extract dental roots. Additionally, it highlights the roles and responsibilities of healthcare team members when performing this type of surgery.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the morphogenesis and anatomical considerations of tooth roots.
- Review indications, contraindications, and preparatory considerations for the extraction of tooth roots.
- Summarize techniques commonly employed in the extraction of tooth roots.
- Outline potential complications associated with root extraction surgery and explain the importance of clinical proficiency in managing fractured and retained root fragments.
