Baxter and Collegues (2005) reviewed more than 85,000 men treated for prostate cancer between 1973 and 1994 and found a direct relationship between radiotherapy and the development of rectal cancer when compared to patients treated with surgery alone. The hazard ratio was found to be 1.7 (95% CI: 1.4 to 2.2). Various modalities have been developed to enhance the efficacy profile of radiotherapy to the target organ and reduce its side effect profile. Some of these include 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), but the possibility of microscopic disease broadens the treatment field and ultimately leads to exposure of normal tissues.

German Rectal Cancer trial showed that preoperative chemoradiation leads to lower toxicity rates as compared to the postoperative method.
