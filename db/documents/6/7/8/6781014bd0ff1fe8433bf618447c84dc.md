Primary peritoneal cancer is idiopathic cancer arising from peritoneal layers of the abdominal cavity. Its subtype, EOPPC, resembles serous ovarian carcinoma and occurs exclusively in women (mean age, 56-62 years). There are just a few reports of its occurrence in males. It can be caused by germline mutations in the BRCA 1 gene which has been reported in 17.6% of cases.

Disseminated peritoneal leiomyomatosis is associated with a high estrogenic state in postmenopausal women. Leiomyosarcoma is a secondary tumor occurring in Li Fraumeni syndrome along with retinoblastoma. Desmoplastic round small cell tumor occurs in adolescents (median age 19 years) and 85% in Caucasians. It is caused by [t(11;22)(p13;q12)] translocation.

Secondary peritoneal carcinomatosis is commonly caused by invading malignant cells from tumors involving the stomach, colon, pancreas, gall bladder, appendix, breast, uterus, ovary, and lungs. The peritoneal involvement in appendiceal cancer is called pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP). It is successfully managed and results in a lifetime without relapse. The metastasis from ovarian, gastric, and colorectal malignancies is associated with increased chances of recurrence and fatality, and they are also the three most common etiologies of metastatic spread in the peritoneum.
