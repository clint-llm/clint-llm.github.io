As noted previously, there are many indications for gastrojejunostomy, which will alter how the procedure is performed. The technique for a gastrojejunostomy as part of a Roux-en-Y bypass has been described in a previous StatPearls article.

**Step 1: Obtain Access to the Abdominal Cavity**

The patient should be placed in a supine position with the arms abducted at right angles and a nasogastric or orogastric tube placed to decompress the stomach. The abdominal cavity can be accessed by making an incision from the xiphoid to the umbilicus and may be extended if greater exposure is needed. If a laparoscopic technique is being used, then the abdominal cavity may be accessed using a Hasson, Veress, or Visiport technique, after which the other needed trocars.Once access is obtained, the liver should be retracted laterally in both the open or laparoscopic techniques.

**Step 2: Determine the Site of the Gastrostomy**

The site of the gastrostomy should be selected 3-5 cm from either the obstructing mass, be it an ulcer or malignancy, or from the pylorus. The area chosen should be low on the greater curvature, as selecting the site too high can lead to intractable biliary reflux and reduced gastric emptying.

**Step 3: Approximating the Jejunal Loop**

Next, a loop of jejunum 10-15 cm from the ligament of Trietz should be selected and approximated near the gastrostomy chosen site using the bowel clamps in an antecolic fashion, although retrocolic techniques exist. If a retrocolic technique is chosen, it is vital to close the transverse mesocolon defect, also known as Petersen space. Care should be taken that the loop is not under tension when near the stomach and is in an isoperistaltic conformation. Once an appropriate loop is in place, a permanent suture is used to fix the jejunum to the stomach using seromuscular bites.

**Step 4: Creation of the Jejunostomy and Gastrostomy**

Openings in the stomach and jejunum are created approximately 1 cm from the seromuscular stitches and about 5 cm in length. The suction irrigator should be at the ready for this stage to remove any leaked gastric or intestinal contents.

**Step 5: Creation of the Anastomosis**

Full-thickness posterior stitches using absorbable suture with the first knot placed outside the lumen of the stomach and the jejunum. The posterior and anterior segments of the anastomosis are sutured using Connel stitches, which is a running horizontal mattress stitch. The anterior outer layer is then oversewn using Lembert stitches in the seromuscular layer.

**Step 6: Hemostasis and Leak Test**

The anastomosis should be carefully inspected for any bleeding, and areas of significant bleeding may be oversewn. The anastomosis should then be placed underwater using the suction irrigator, and the esophagogastroduodenal scope advanced into the stomach. The stomach can then be inflated, and the anastomosis investigated for any leaks.

**Stapled Technique**

Stapled techniques are similar except the stapler is used to approximate the jejunum, and the stomach rather than suture and the gastrostomy and jejunostomy only need to be large enough to allow the stapler in. The gastrostomy and jejunostomy sites can then be closed with suture or an additional staple load.

**Postoperative Care**

Patients are typically admitted after the creation of a gastrojejunostomy, especially if it is combined with a gastric resection. Patients are usually started on a low volume diet of clear liquids and gradually advanced as tolerated. It often takes patients a few days to tolerate enough oral intake to prevent becoming dehydrated.
