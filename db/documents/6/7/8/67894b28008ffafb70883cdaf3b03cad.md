A full diagnostic workup must include a full screen of blood tests, including complete blood count (CBC), thyroid function and auto-antibody tests, renal function, and C-reactive protein. Nasal swabs and blood cultures may be warranted if severe infection is suspected e.g., orbital cellulitis.

Radiological imaging is essential for diagnostic and management purposes. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the gold standard modalities in evaluating the orbit or cranium for causes of severe infection, mass growth, and foreign bodies related to exophthalmos.

As many cases may present with overlapping clinical features and may provide difficulty in confirming the diagnosis, a tissue biopsy may be necessary to ascertain a definitive answer.

Proptosis or exophthalmos may be associated with other deviations of the globe, namely, hyperglobus, hypoglobus, esoglobus, or exoglobus.
