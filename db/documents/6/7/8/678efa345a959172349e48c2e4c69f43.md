The mechanism and degree ofÂ injury involved dictate the fracture pattern and the treatment approach to pilon fractures. The impact from an axial compression mechanism drives the articular surface proximally into the metaphysis, with associated metaphyseal comminution. Associated fibular fractures are commonly present.

Open fractures comprise approximately 20% of pilon fractures.
