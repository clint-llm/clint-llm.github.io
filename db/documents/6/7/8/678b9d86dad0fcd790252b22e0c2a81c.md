Several benign and malignant conditions merit consideration in the differential diagnosis for SC. These tumorsÂ may often mimic a chalazion, especially if they become painful or inflamed, resistant to the usual treatment, or if they recur after surgery. An extensive list of eyelid masses may be part of the differential diagnosis of SC, including apart from the most frequent chalazion, other tumors such us inclusion cyst, papilloma, keratosis, keratoacanthoma, or dermoid cyst, among others.

Benign sebaceous neoplasms such as sebaceous adenomas may present similarly to SC, but these benign lesions are uncommon in the periocular region.
