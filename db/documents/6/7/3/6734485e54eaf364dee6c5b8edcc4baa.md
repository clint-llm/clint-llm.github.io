Deep neck infections are a serious but treatable group of infections affecting the deep cervical space and characterized by rapid progression and life-threatening complications. These infections remain an important health problem with significant morbidity and potential mortality. These infections most frequently arise from the local extension of infections from tonsils, parotid glands, cervical lymph nodes, and odontogenic structures. They classically present with symptoms related to local pressure effects on the respiratory, nervous, or gastrointestinal (GI) tract (particularly neck mass/swelling, dysphagia, dysphonia, and trismus). This activity reviews the proper evaluation and management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the epidemiology of deep neck infections.
- Describe the typical clinical presentation of deep neck infections.
- Identify the management options for deep neck infections.
- Explain the importance of collaboration amongst interprofessional teams to providing optimal management to patients with deep neck infections.
