When an Rh-negative mother is exposed to the Rh D antigen, the D antigen is perceived as a foreign threat similar to how bacteria and viruses are perceived. This leads to a series of activations of immunogenic pathways that culminates in the production of anti-D antibodies. Those antibodies can bind to the D antigen present on the erythrocytes of Rh-positive fetuses to further activate immunologic pathways that lead to the hemolysis of the fetal erythrocytes.
