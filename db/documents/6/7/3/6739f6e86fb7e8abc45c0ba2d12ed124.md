Postpartum thyroiditis is a painless condition. Most of the patients with postpartum thyroiditis are symptom-free or showing mild symptoms during thyrotoxic state, including irritability, palpitation, fatigue, and heat intolerance. The hypothyroid state of postpartum thyroiditis is mostly symptomatic, including constipation, dry skin, fatigue, impaired concentration, cold intolerance, and paresthesia. A study reported that patients with postpartum thyroiditis and positive TPO antibodies were more symptomatic than patients who had negative TPO antibodies.
