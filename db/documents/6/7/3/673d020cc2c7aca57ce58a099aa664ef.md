Burkholderia mallei and Burkholderia pseudomallei can enter cells and spread from cell to cell by polymerizing actin; this can lead to the fusion of cells and the formation of multinucleated giant cells. Both are resistant to a large number of antibiotics because of their ability to pump them out of the cell, and both possess type VI secretion systems. Burkholderia mallei cause damage to and death of endothelial cells lining blood vessels, which increases the likelihood of thrombi formation. Numerous virulence factors of Burkholderia pseudomallei have been described.
