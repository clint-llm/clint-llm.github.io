Cholera is an acute secretory diarrheal illness caused by the bacteria Vibrio cholerae. It is estimated to cause upwards of four million cases per year, worldwide. High-volume fluid loss with electrolyte derangements that can progress to hypovolemic shock and ultimately death characterizes this gastrointestinal disease. This activity describes the evaluation and management of cholera and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of cholera.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with cholera.
- Describe the management considerations for patients with cholera.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the management of cholera and associated acute secretory diarrheal illnesses in order to improve patient outcomes and prevent spread.
