A point of concern regarding the sorbitol pathway is that not all tissues have the enzyme sorbitol dehydrogenase, and these include the retina, kidneys, and Schwann cells. As a result, in diabetic patients or those with extremely high glucose levels, sorbitol accumulates to toxic levels and leads to complications within these organs. This pathway provides some explanations of the formation of complications in diabetic patients. Without early intervention and adequate glycemic control, the complications formed from the polyol pathway can become permanent and significantly decrease quality of life.
