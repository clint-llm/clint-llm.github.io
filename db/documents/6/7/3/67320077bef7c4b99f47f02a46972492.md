**Functional Role of Duffy Glycoprotein**

Duffy glycoprotein acts as a "Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines" (DARC), which binds with the chemicals secreted during the inflammatory process, thereby affecting the intensity of inflammation and the degree of neutrophil recruitment.

DARC ( AKA CD234; ACKR 1) is homologous to the G-protein chemokine receptor (GPCR) family and functions as a scavenger in inflammatory and proinflammatory conditions. The Duffy antigen (DARC) is found on erythrocytes, capillaries, and postcapillary venule endothelial cells. DARC acts as a sort of a repository, retaining or releasing chemokines, thereby reducing or augmenting local inflammation.

During inflammation, DARC releases chemokines that bind to and progress through the endothelium. This promotes transendothelial neutrophil migration. The DARC binds with both the classes of chemokines, i.e., CC (chronic inflammation chemokine), CXC (acute inflammation chemokine), melanoma growth stimulatory activity-alpha (MGSA-Î±/CXCL1), interleukin 8 (CXCL8), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (CCL2), RANTES (regulated upon activation normal T-expressed & secreted (CCL5), neutrophil-activating protein 2 and 3, epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide-78, (CXCL5), growth-related gene alpha, and angiogenesis-related platelet factor-1.
