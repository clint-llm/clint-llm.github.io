The differential diagnosis of the manifestations of phenol toxicity is broad, given that phenol exerts effects on nearly all organ systems. Dermal exposure may present similar to other potent acid or alkali exposures, but the characteristic brown-stained skin may be a clue to phenol. Hypopigmented skin may also present with hydrofluoric acid dermal exposures. The combination of seizures and cardiovascular collapse is very non-specific and is observable with a broad range of life-threatening toxin exposures. The characteristic blue-green urine is also a possible feature with the therapeutic use of propofol, a phenol-derived pharmaceutical.
