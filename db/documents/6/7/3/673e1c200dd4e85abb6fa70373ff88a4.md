Although rare, the risk of condom slippage or breakage during sexual intercourse has been reported in roughly 2% of cases. Latex condoms should only be used with water-based lubricants such as K-Y, saliva, and glycerin. Oil-based lubricants (e.g., baby oil, hand and body lotions, massage oil, mineral oil, edible oils, whipped cream) have been shown to interrupt the integrity of latex condoms and should not come in contact with latex condoms.

Latex condoms most commonly last up to 5 years. Expiration dates are required to be placed on the outside of every individual condom pouch. When mixed with other solutions such as spermicide, the condom will have a much shorter shelf life (up to 2 years) due to the breakdown of latex.

ForÂ individuals with a latex allergy, synthetic condoms (polyurethane) and natural membrane (lambskin) condoms are an option. Synthetic condoms can function properly with both oil-based and water-based lubricants. Although natural membrane condoms can be used with both types of lubricants as well, they are porous and may be less effective at preventing viral STDs such as HIV, Hepatitis B, and herpes simplex virus.

Some condoms come with the option of being coated in spermicide, most often nonoxynol-9 (N-9). Spermicide condoms have not been shown to provide any more or less function in contraception, but in fact, they may increase adverse effects such as irritation and increased urinary tract infections in females.
