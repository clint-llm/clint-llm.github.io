**Laboratory Studies**

Alkaline phosphatase is historically the most commonly ordered lab, but may not be elevated early on in HO formation

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is another inflammatory marker that is used. ESR greater than 35 mm/hr can indicate the development of HO

**Imaging**

Plain film radiographs show circumferential bone formation around or near a joint with a radiolucent center (figure 1). X-ray is specific for HO but not sensitive in early disease. Plain films may not be positive until 3 to 4 weeks after HO appears on bone scan. Therefore the triple phase bone scan is the most sensitive. A bone scan can reveal HO as early as 2.5 weeks after injury

CT may be used to delineate the area of bone formation in preparation for surgical, but their role in evaluation/diagnosis of HO is not established
