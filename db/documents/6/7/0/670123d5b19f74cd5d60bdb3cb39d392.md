Radial head subluxation (RHS) is common in children 1 to 4 years of age and represents more than 20% of upper extremity injuries in children. It occurs less commonly in children older than the age of 5 because the annular ligament strengthens with age. There is a slight female predominance, and the left arm is more commonly affected than the right.Â  Recurrence rate is approximately 20%
