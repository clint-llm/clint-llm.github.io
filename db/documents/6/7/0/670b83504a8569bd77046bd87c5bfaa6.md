Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy (THI) is a type of antibody deficiency that affects infant and children typically below the age of 6 years. It characteristically demonstrates recurrent bacterial infections and can be treated with antibiotics or replacement immunoglobulin therapy. This activity reviews the clinical evaluation, diagnosis, and management of THI.

**Objectives:**
- Review the clinical presentation of infants with THI immunodeficiency. 
- Describe the epidemiology and proposed pathophysiology of THI.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for THI.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes.
