Avascular necrosis of the femoral head is a type of osteonecrosis due to disruption of blood supply to the proximal femur. There are approximately 10000 to 20000 new cases reported each year in the United States alone. It can occur due to a variety of causes, either traumatic or atraumatic in origin. These causes include fractures, dislocations, chronic steroid use, chronic alcohol use, coagulopathy, congenital causes; among many others. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head is a debilitating disease, and healthcare professionals must possess strong knowledge regarding the condition. This activity describes the background, evaluation, treatment, and management of avascular necrosis of the femoral head. Additionally, it addresses issues that can benefit members of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of femoral head avascular necrosis.
- Describe the evaluation of femoral head avascular necrosis.
- Summarize the treatment options available for femoral head avascular necrosis.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance femoral head avascular necrosis prevention and treatment and improve outcomes.
