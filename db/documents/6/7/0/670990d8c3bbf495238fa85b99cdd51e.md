Flutamide is indicated for the adult population only in the treatment of stage B2-C and stage D2 metastatic carcinoma of the prostate, hyperandrogenic features of PCOS, and few other indications, includingÂ idiopathic hirsutism. The drug may be prescribed by the urologist, oncologist, dermatologist, gynecologist, primary care physician, and nurse practitioner (as per the prevailing laws of the country's healthcare system). However, it is essential that all healthcare workers who prescribe flutamide be aware of the black box warning related to liver failure. Also, the prescribing physician and pharmacist must make sure that the patient is on no other concomitant hepatotoxic medication or a drug that may interfere with its metabolism leading to toxic elevation of serum levels. Thus, at every visit, the patient must be examined and the liver function evaluated. Nursing can also answer patient questions and provide counsel regarding administration and potential adverse effects. It is advised to discontinue therapy if jaundice develops or if alanine aminotransferase increased to two times the upper limit of normal.
