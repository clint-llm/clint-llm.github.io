The medial longitudinal fasciculus, the tract which ascends to the interstitial nucleus of Cajal, is closely associated with the oculomotor nerve, trochlear nerve, and abducens nerve. These nerves form the extraocular muscle system because they help move the eyes in parallel to have normal conjugate gaze. For the horizontal portion of the oculomotor system, rightward movements get generated by stimulating nuclei of the interstitial nucleus of Cajal to the right of the midline and leftward movements are generated by stimulating nuclei of the interstitial nucleus of Cajal to the left of the midline.

Several projection systems originate from the interstitial nucleus of Cajal. The first projection system goes past the posterior commissure that later transmits many terminal fields in theÂ interstitial nucleus of Cajal on the opposite side of the body, the oculomotor nucleus, and the trochlear nucleus.
