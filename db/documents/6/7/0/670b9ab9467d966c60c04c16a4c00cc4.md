Patient counseling and education include emphasizing specific aspects of a healthy lifestyle to improve prognosis.

- Maintain a healthy weight, and lose weight if necessary.

- Eat a healthy diet.

- Get at least 2.5 hours of exercise per week. Walking is a good choice, but other activities, such as swimming, cycling, running, or playing tennis or team sports, are also good choices.

- Do not smoke since it increases the risk of blood clots. Clinicians can assist with stop-smoking programs and medicines to improve the patient's chances of quitting permanently.
