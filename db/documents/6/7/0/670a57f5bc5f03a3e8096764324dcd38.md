To help maximize patient care and patient safety, it is important for the healthcare team to:

- Recognize early if a patient needs pre-treatment for vancomycin - patients should be asked if they have had any issues with vancomycin infusion in the past.

- Ensure that there is ongoing surveillance of patient response to treatment and an appropriate handover at shift change to minimize errors during ongoing transfusion

- Ask the supervisor or the physician or healthcare provider who prescribed the medication if there is a question about the patient's response to treatment or dose.

- Ask pharmacists about the medication and how it should be restarted.

- Be familiar with the infusion protocols for the healthcare facility in which they work.
