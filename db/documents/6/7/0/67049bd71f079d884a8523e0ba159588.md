Rods and cone photoreceptors are the main cellular units responsible for visual phototransduction. Phototransduction is a process by which light signals are converted into action potential within the retina and facilitate the brain's perception of an image. During this process, light-sensitive pigments are generated and recycled. RD occurs due to abnormalities in photoreceptors as well as defects in phototransduction.

Depending on the type of photoreceptors affected,Â retinal dystrophies can be subdivided into rod-dominated diseases, cone-dominated diseases, and generalized form, which involves both rods and cones. Cases may be syndromic and non-syndromic, sporadic, or familial. In familial cases, inheritance patterns could be autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X linked. Syndromic cases have clinical features that extend to multisystemic involvement rather than non-syndromic varieties, which affect only the retina.
