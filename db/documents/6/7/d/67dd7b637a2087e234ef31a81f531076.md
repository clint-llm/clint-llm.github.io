The vertebral arteries are by far the most important in the contextual location of the head and neck. The atlantoaxial joint as a whole receives blood supply from surrounding branches of the deep cervical, occipital, and vertebral arteries. In relation to the atlantoaxial joint, the vertebral arteries exit the axis transverse foramen, then course slightly laterally to the transverse foramen of the atlas as they enter the cranium.

The collateral branches of the vertebral arteries supply the vertebral bodies of the cervical spine and the cervical radicular arteries. Arising from the subclavian arteries, the vertebral arteries travel cephalad bilaterally; they converge together to form a single structure called the basilar artery, which directly supplies the brainstem.
