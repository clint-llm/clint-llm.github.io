Stages of chronic primary mitral regurgitation can be categorized as follows with consideration of hemodynamics, valvular anatomy with echocardiographic features, and symptoms which are typically present only in stage D, i.e., severe symptomatic MR.

A. At risk of MR - mild MVP, mild leaflet thickening, normal coaptation- no MR or small central jet (20% of LA), vena contracta less than 0.3 cm

B. Progressive MR - severe MVP, rheumatic changes as leaflet thickening and loss of central coaptation, history of IE- central MR jet (20% to 40% of LA), mild LA enlargement, normal LV size, and function, normal pulmonary pressure.

C. Asymptomatic severe MR - severe MVP, flail leaflet, rheumatic changes as leaflet thickening and loss of central coaptation, history of IE, radiation-induced thickened leaflets - moderate/severe LA enlargement, LV dilation, pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery systolic pressure PASP greater than 50 mmHg), central MR jet (greater than 40% of LA), holosystolic eccentric MR jet, vena contracta ≥0.7 cm, regurgitant volume (RV) ≥60 mL, Regurgitant fraction (RF) ≥50%, ERO ≥0.40 cm

-  C1: LVEF >60% and LVESD <40 mm

-  C2: LVEF ≤60% and LVESD ≥40 mm

(LVEF= LV Ejection Fraction, LVESD= LV End Systolic Dimension)

D. Severe symptomatic MR- severe MVP, flail leaflet, rheumatic changes with leaflet thickening & loss of central coaptation, history of IE, radiation-induced thickened leaflets- moderate/severe LA enlargement, LV dilation, pulmonary hypertension, central MR jet (greater than 40% of LA), holosystolic eccentric MR jet, vena contracta ≥0.7 cm, RV ≥60 mL, RF ≥50%, ERO ≥0.40 cm. Symptoms- impaired exercise tolerance, dyspnea on exertion.

Similarly, stages of chronic secondary MR can be briefly summarized with valve hemodynamics and anatomy as follows; in all the categories, symptoms from coronary artery disease or CHF may be present, but only in the last category symptoms can be attributed to underlying MR.

A. At risk of MR- Normal valve apparatus in a patient with known coronary artery disease- No MR jet or small central jet (<20% of LA), Vena contracta <0.3 cm

B. Progressive MR- Regional wall motion abnormality (RWMA), LV dilation, annular dilatation, mild tethering of leaflets, mild loss of central coaptation- ERO <0.40 cm, RV <60 mL, RF <50%

C. Asymptomatic severe MR- RWMA, annular dilation, severe tethering of leaflets, severe loss of central coaptation- ERO ≥0.40 cm RV ≥60 mL, RF <50%

D. Symptomatic severe MR- RWMA, annular dilation, severe tethering of leaflets, severe loss of central coaptation- ERO ≥0.40 cm RV ≥60 mL, RF <50%.
