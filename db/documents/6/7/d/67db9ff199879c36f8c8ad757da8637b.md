Hepatitis B surface antibody titers increase quickly following vaccination and then decrease over time.

Health care workers who completed the vaccine series and had a subsequent positive titer (â‰¥10 mIU/mL anti-HBs) are considered hepatitis B immune and do not need any further routine testing for protection so long as they remain immune-competent.
