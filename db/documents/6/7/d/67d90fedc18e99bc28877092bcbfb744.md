As the primary cause of bilateral vocal cord paralysis is post-surgical nerve injury, it is predominantly seen in adults with a history of thyroid or other bilateral neck surgery. Idiopathic causes may show a slight female predominance, but there is no high-quality data published on this subject at this time.

Although uncommon, vocal cord paralysis is a well-known cause of stridor in neonates, most congenital cases are unilateral. Murty et al. estimate the incidence of bilateral vocal cord paralysis to be 0.75 cases per million births per year.
