Various public safety campaigns exist to educate aspiring athletes about the dangers of using anabolic steroids. Most major sports associations continuously test their athletes for banned substances, which include AAS. It is essential to acknowledge that testing will never catch up to cover every single anabolic compound, but new compounds are regularly added to the list of banned substances. Primary care physicians should suspect AAS misuse if any of the following are present:

- Participation in sports in which an increase in physical strength, speed, and agility is advantageous

- Males

- Increased musculature or accelerated rate of muscle gain

- Increase in acne

- Oligospermia

- Gynecomastia

- Early puberty

- High hematocrit

- Hirsutism in females

Clinicians should educate the patients regarding the use of AAS and advise them that possession of AAS is a criminal offense as well as a violation of anti-doping rules of most sports organizations.
