Neisseria gonorrhoeae, an obligate human pathogen, is a sexually transmitted disease that causes consequential worldwide morbidity both in resource-abundant and resource-limited nations, and its diagnosis and treatment require costly expenditures annually. Like other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), gonorrhea disproportionately impacts young adult populations. The obligate pathogen N. gonorrhoeae infects only humans in nature and most commonly manifests as urethritis in men and cervicitis in women. This activity illustrates the presentation, evaluation, and treatment of N. gonorrhoeae and the interprofessional team's role in treating patients, and their partners, with gonococcal infections.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the etiology of N. gonorrhoeae.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of gonorrhea.
- Outline the treatment options available for gonorrhea.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with N. gonorrhoeae infection.
