Liddle syndrome is a congenital disorder due to a single gene mutation. Patients inherit the disorder in an autosomal dominant with early penetrance. Diverse populations can be affected by the syndrome. Genetic studies showed that this syndrome occurs from a gain of function mutations in the epithelial sodium in the distal nephron. In 1995, Hansson et al. discovered the germline mutation in the SCNN1G gene as a cause of the Liddle syndrome.SCNN1A, SCNN1B, and SCNN1G genes.
