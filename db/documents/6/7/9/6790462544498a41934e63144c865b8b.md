Children with PHA AD have milder disease confined to the kidneys and may improve as they get older, whereas, those with PHA AR have more severe disease extending to involve the sweat and salivary glands, have frequent respiratory infections, skin rashes, ocular manifestations like retained meibomian gland secretions, and respiratory distress in the neonatal period.

PHA III patients will be cured once their UTI or obstructive uropathy resolves.

Rare syndromes with congenital abnormalities may have HA as a component.

In adult patients, a good history will reveal the offending medications causing HA. Rare instances of life-threatening arrhythmias due to hyperkalemia have been reported in patients treated with conventional heparin.

A high index of suspicion should be maintained in hospitalized, the critically ill, those with diabetes, nephropathies from various causes, sickle cell disease, and HIV to facilitate early recognition and intervention of HA.

Patients who undergo adrenalectomy for unilateral ALD producing adenoma(Conn's syndrome) can have prolonged ZG suppression of the normal gland. Risk factors include advanced age, long-standing hypertension, large adenoma size, preoperative and postoperative renal function, and preoperative usage of NSAID.
