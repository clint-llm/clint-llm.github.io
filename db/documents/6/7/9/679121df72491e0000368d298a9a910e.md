Clinical nurses and assistants can reliably and accurately obtain height measurements in pediatric and adult populations. Although traditionally, home measurements performed by parents/caregivers have been noted to have considerable variation and error, this can be corrected with adequate training. In the era of remote medicine, this may be particularly useful. A recent study stated thatÂ remote height and weight collection could be obtained with minimal differences in the various measurement methods after proper training.
