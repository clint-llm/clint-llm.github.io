Removal of tattoos is performed by many healthcare workers including primary care providers, nurse practitioners, cosmetic and plastic surgeons, and dermatologists. However, all healthcare workers should be aware of the potential complications of lasers and inform the patient prior to the procedure. Laser safety is mandatory to protect both the staff and the patient. Patients need to be told that not all tattoos can be removed with laser and the potential to cause more harm than good is a possibility.
