Diagnosis of neuro-angiostrongyliasis is made of clinical history, suggestive signs, and symptoms and supporting laboratory findings. Clinical history should include a focus on travel to or from an endemic area, consumption of poorly cooked foods or raw vegetables contaminated with snail/slug components, crab, shrimp, etc.Â Although not confirmatory, CSF eosinophilia (usually exceeds 10%, can be as high as 70%) is required for the diagnosis in the right clinical setting. Eosinophilia in the CSF is defined as 10 or more eosinophils per microliter of CSF fluid or greater than 10% of total CSF leukocytes (with at least 6 in absolute count per microliter of fluid). CSF opening pressure and protein are usually elevated, with CSF leucocytosis typically ranging from 150-2000 cells/mm. Peripheral eosinophilia is often reported; however, it does not correlate well with CSF eosinophilia or the clinical course. The article editor has personally encountered and made the diagnosis by observing a larva coming out of the spinal needle with the CSF during lumbar puncture, quite a memorable experience. Brain imaging with CT or MRI is generally not too helpful in making the etiological diagnosis.

Serological immunoassays such as dot blot ELISA or western blot can aid in the diagnosis but are not widely available. PCR and real-time PCR-based tests are reported to have good sensitivities, but again not as readily available.A. cantonensis. The diagnostic immunoblot band is usually 29 kDa.
