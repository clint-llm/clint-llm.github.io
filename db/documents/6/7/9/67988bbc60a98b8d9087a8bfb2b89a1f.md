The mandibular branch of the mandibular nerve, which branches off of the trigeminal nerve, passes through the foramen spinosum and innervates the posterior portion of the dura mater of the middle cranial fossa. This nerve is otherwise known as the nervus spinosus. The nervus spinosus also supplies sensation to the cartilaginous part of the Eustachian tube. The mandibular branch then continues between the squamous and petrous portions of the temporal bone where it then enters and supplies the mastoid air cells and mastoid antrum.
