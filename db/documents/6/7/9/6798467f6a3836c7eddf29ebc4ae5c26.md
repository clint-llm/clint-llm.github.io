A thorough history and physical examination are significant in recognizing a pancreatic fistula. Depending on the location, size, and pathway of the fistula, a variety of signs and symptoms can occur. Patients' clinical features range from being asymptomatic to showing signs and symptoms from a result of the fluid accumulation.

As fluid accumulates in the abdomen, patients can develop ascites. The ascites are noticeable with the physical findings such as abdominal distension, fluid wave, shifting dullness, and dullness to percussion at the flanks. Another location that can potentially be affected is the thorax, as seen in the setting of thoracopancreatic fistulas leading to a pancreatic pleural effusion. Patients will present with pulmonary symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, wheezing, or pleuritic chest pain.

On the other hand, with external fistulas, there is effluent that is mainly pancreatic fluid that is noticeable from the skin wound of the abdomen. With the loss of pancreatic fluids, it can lead to symptoms like dehydration and weight loss from malnourishment. The exposure of a fistula to the external environment makes it susceptible to infection to emerge around the fistula site. The surrounding skin wound can be warm, erythematous, and show signs of excoriation or skin breakdown. Both internal and external pancreatic fistula can eventually manifest in patients as fever due to infection leading to patients becoming septic.
