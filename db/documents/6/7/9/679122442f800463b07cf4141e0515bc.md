Clonus is a rhythmic oscillating stretch reflex that is related to upper motor neuron lesions. Therefore, clonus is generally accompanied by hyperreflexia. Testing for clonus is performed as part of the neurological exam. This activity describes how to elicit clonus and its clinical relevance and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with clonus.

**Objectives:**
- List the causes of clonus.
- Explain how to elicit clonus on a physical exam.
- Explain the clinical relevance of clonus.
- Explain the importance of optimizing care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with clonus.
