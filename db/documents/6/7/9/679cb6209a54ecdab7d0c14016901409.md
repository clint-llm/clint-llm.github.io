Patients and parents should be educated on the differences between bacterial and viral pharyngitis. Patients diagnosed with group A streptococcus infectionÂ should be encouraged to complete a full course of antibiotics to prevent the risk of rheumatic heart disease. Patients with viral pharyngitis should be instructed to treat the symptoms with OTC pain relievers and that there is no need for antibiotics. This will help to decrease antibiotic overprescribing and bacterial drug resistance. All patients with pharyngitis should be educated on the importance of handwashing, rest, and hydration.
