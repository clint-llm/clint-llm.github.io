Patient education plays an important role in the management of kyphosis if the condition leads to functional limitations. Individuals need to focus on conservative measures such as physical therapy, proper posture, and body mechanics. Developing core stability muscle strength may play a role in spine stability.

In age-related kyphosis, it is important to tell the patients, especially the female population, to avoid flexion exercises since research has shown that flexion induced movements can increase the risk of fractures when bone strength is impaired.
