**Primary Otalgia**

- Most cases of primary otalgia in children are acute otitis media (AOM) in children ages six months to 24 months, peaking between 9 and 15 months. Watchful waitingÂ for 24 to 72 hours is reasonable in non-toxic appearing children. The American Academy of Pediatrics has excellent guidelines on immediate treatment and delayed treatment

- If AOM is associated with purulent conjunctivitis, use amoxicillin with clavulanic acid.

- Breastfed infants in their first six months of life have lower rates of acute otitis media. This situation may be due to infant position and pressure differentials during feeding.

**Secondary Otalgia**

- Secondary otalgia has an extensive differential diagnosis.

- Recall red flags and risk factors for serious diagnosis.

- Regular dental exams every six months to 1 year helps prevent dental pathology.

- One hundred fifty minutes of moderate-intensity exercise every week helps prevent cardiac pathology.
