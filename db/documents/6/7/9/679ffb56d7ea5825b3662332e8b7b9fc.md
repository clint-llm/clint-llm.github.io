Four chambers comprise the heart. The superior two chambers are the right and left atria while the bottom two chambers are named the right and leftÂ ventricles. Atrioventricular valves separate the atria and ventricles. There are two semilunar valves: the pulmonic valve separates the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery, while the aortic valve separates the left ventricle and the aorta. The right side of the heart pumps blood at a lower pressure into the pulmonary vasculature to be oxygenated. The left side of the heart pumps blood in the systemic circulation at a much higher pressure. Therefore the valves on the left side of the heart are subject to higher pressures.

During the Ross procedure, it is critical to know the anatomy of the left main coronary artery and its take-off. In addition, the surgeon should know the course of the left coronary artery, its proximal septal branches and their relationship to the aortic root and the right ventricular outflow tract. In addition, when harvesting the pulmonary autograft the surgeon should have an appreciation of the subpulmonary conal musculature to facilitate the dissection. Finally, if the left ventricular outflow tract needs enlargement (Ross Konno procedure) the surgeon must be familiar with the location of the conduction system.
