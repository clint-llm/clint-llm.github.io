Predicting the prognosis of the standard surgical approach of the adrenal cortical hyperplasia depends on a variety of factors. However, medical responsiveness to specific potassium-sparing diuretics, like spironolactone might be a reliable one and suggestive of good prognosis. On the contrary, chronic elevation of blood pressure, along with multiple organ failure, predicts a poor prognosis. Multiple organ failure, by definition, attributes to evidence of end-organ damage in at least a couple of vital organs.

The overall survival of Cushing syndrome of all causes has significantly changed over the last 70 years from slightly more than 4.5 years in the early 1950s. Vascular compromise in the cardiac and nervous system, along with infectious related morbidities, were all found to be strong negative predictors on general outcomes and escalate the standard mortality ratio.
