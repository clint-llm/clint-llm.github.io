Breast implants have an expiration date and a lifespan, and may need to be replaced to avoid complications such as implant rupture. The rate of implant rupture can be directly related to the age of the implant (in the absence of obvious, severe, trauma). With over 3.5 million breast implants in the United States, it is imperative for medical professionals to understand the common presentation, diagnostic exams, common imaging findings, and management.
