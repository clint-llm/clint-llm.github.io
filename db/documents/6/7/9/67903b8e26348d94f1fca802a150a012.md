In areas with greater risk of Eastern equine encephalitis virus transmission, EEE should be considered by health-care professionals in any case with aseptic meningitis or encephalitis. Suspected infections should also be reported to the local health department. Differential diagnosis includes other viral encephalitides, such as measles, mumps, echovirus, and less likely prion disease such as Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease.
