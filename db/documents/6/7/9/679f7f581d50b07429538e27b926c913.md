EGFR was the first discovered epidermal growth factor receptor. Growth factor binding results in receptor dimerization, subsequent tyrosine kinase activity and autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues including Y992, Y1045, Y1068, Y1148, and Y1173. Eventual downstream activation of signal transduction cascades, including MAPK, Akt and JNK pathways, leads to DNA synthesis, cell proliferation, and differentiation.

In considering EGFR, also known as ErbB-1, it is important to also consider the three related receptors of the ErbB family: ErbB-2, ErbB-3, and ErbB-4. ErbB-2 is also known as HER2 in humans and neu in rodents. In humans, the HER2 oncogene is associated with breast cancer and has become a target of therapy for associated breast cancers. ErbB-3 binds to heregulin and NRG-2. The function of ErbB-3 is yet unknown. ErbB-3 homodimers are non-functional; consequently, ErbB-3 is thought to be an allosteric activator of the other ErbB receptors. Finally, ErbB-4 binding results in mitogenesis and differentiation. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms of ErbB-4 have been implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis type 19.
