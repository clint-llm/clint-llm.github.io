Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor is used in combination with another antiplatelet agent such as aspirin during PCI increasing the bleeding risk. The following steps are necessary before the administration of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors.

- Check coagulation labs such as the international normalized ratio (INR), prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).

- Make sure the patient is not allergic to the agent before its administration.

- Confirm the dosage of the antiplatelets and anticoagulants that the patient is receiving.

- Check for any absolute and relative contraindications.

- Perform post-administration labs.

- Monitor the patient for signs and symptoms of bleeding after its administration.

- The patients require monitoring for adverse events.

- The glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors may need to be continued after the procedure in patients at high risk for thrombus burden. Such patients should be monitored closely in an intensive care unit.

Given the above, the entire interprofessional healthcare team, including clinicians, specialists, mid-level practitioners, nurses, and pharmacists, all must understand the indications, adverse events, and monitoring ofÂ glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors so that patients can derive maximum therapeutic results when these drugs are indicated, and avoid adverse events, leading to optimal outcomes.
