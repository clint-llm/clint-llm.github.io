The diagnosis of sleeplessness and circadian rhythm disorders is primarily based on a thorough history. A comprehensive history helps in the differentiation of transient disorders from chronic disorders and primary disorders from secondary disorders, which also influences the direction of evaluation and treatment plans. In cases of sleeplessness, it is essential to distinguish individuals with difficulty initiating sleep from those with trouble maintaining sleep, those with significant daytime impairment, and those with nonrestorative sleep. The detailed history includes asking questions about the duration of symptoms, a pattern of the sleep-wake cycle, total sleep time, shift work, recent travel, psychological assessment, a medication history, any self-treatment attempts, environmental cues, and any medical problem.

The physical examination supplements the history of patients with sleep disorders. The focus of the physical examination is on identifying risk factors for other conditions that may precipitate, augment, or mimic insomnia which may include depression, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and neurodegenerative disease. The exam evaluates body mass index(BMI), craniofacial morphology, chest examination, digital clubbing, and neurologic examination.
