Cephalexin and other cephalosporins are contraindicated in patients with a penicillin allergy, as this poses an increased risk of an allergic reaction to cephalexin and other cephalosporins.

Cephalexin is also contraindicated in patients who have known hypersensitivity to cephalexin or other medications of the cephalosporin class.
