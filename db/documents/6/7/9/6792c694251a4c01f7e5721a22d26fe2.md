The fundamental work up in the patient constitutes of:

- High-resolution volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with seizure protocol including the short tau inversion recovery (STIR), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and the susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) sequences

- Video scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and

- Thorough neuropsychological assessment.

If there is difficulty in the localization of the epileptogenic zone, phase 1 investigations need to be appropriately undertaken

- Diffusion tensor imaging for assessing the epileptic networks

- Interictal high-resolution EEG, magnetoencephalography (MEG) and the functional MRI (fMRI) for identifying ictal origins and

- Interictal positron emission tomography (PET) or interictal PET showing areas of hypometabolism

The assessment of the post-operative neural deficits can be assessed through theÂ  complementary phase 1 investigations constituting of

- fMRI, MEG, and Wada test for lateralization and localization of language functions and memory decline

- Tractography of Meyer loop and visual field testing for visual field defects, and

- fMRI and tractography of the pyramidal tract fo assessing motor deficits.
