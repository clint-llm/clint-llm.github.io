Hypomagnesemia can be secondary to decreased intake, as seen in the following:

- Starvation

- Alcohol use disorder (with a reported prevalence of 30%)

- Anorexia nervosa

- Terminal cancer

- Critically ill patients who are receiving total parenteral nutrition

It also can be secondary to the following medications:

- Loop and thiazide diuretics

- Proton pump inhibitors

- Aminoglycoside antibiotics

- Amphotericin B

- Pentamidine

- Digitalis

- Chemotherapeutic drugs, such as cisplatin, cyclosporine

- Antibodies that bind to epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors (cetuximab, matuzumab, panitumumab)

- Laxative abuse

It can also result from redistributionÂ from the extracellular to the intracellular compartment:

- Treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis by insulin

- Refeeding syndrome

- Correction of metabolic acidosis

- Acute pancreatitis

- Ethanol withdrawal syndrome

Lastly, hypomagnesemia can be induced by gastrointestinal and renal losses, including but not limited to the following conditions:

- Acute diarrhea

- Chronic diarrhea (Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis)

- Hungry bone syndrome (an increased magnesium uptake by renewing bone following parathyroidectomy or thyroidectomy, causing a decrease in serum magnesium)

- Acute pancreatitis

- Gastric bypass surgery

- Genetic disorders

- Gitelman syndrome
- Bartter syndrome
- Familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis
- Renal malformations and early-onset diabetes mellitus caused by HNF1-beta mutation
- Autosomal recessive isolated hypomagnesemia caused by EGF mutation
- Autosomal dominant isolated hypomagnesemia caused by Na-K-ATPase gamma subunit, Kv1.1, and cyclin M2 mutations.
- Intestinal hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia

- Acquired tubular dysfunction

- Post-kidney transplant
- Recovery from acute tubular necrosis
- Postobstructive diuresis
