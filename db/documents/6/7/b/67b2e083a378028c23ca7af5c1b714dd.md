Medicine has made significant progress in understanding circulation in the past few hundred years. For millennia medicine believed in the "four humors" and used bloodletting as a treatment. In the 1600s, William Harvey demonstrated how the circulatory system functioned. Shortly after that, scientists became interested in transfusion, initially transfusing animal blood into humans. Dr. Philip Syng Physick carried out the first human blood transfusion in 1795, and the first transfusion of human blood for treating hemorrhage happened in England in 1818 by Dr. James Blundell.

Blood is typically stored in components. Fresh whole blood has always been thought of as the standard for transfusion; however, medical advancement has allowed the efficient use of theÂ different components, such as packed red blood cells (PRBCs), individual factor concentrates, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), platelet concentrates, and cryoprecipitate. Consequently, current indications for whole blood transfusion are generally very few. The US military buddy transfusion system is the most widespread system of whole blood transfusion.
