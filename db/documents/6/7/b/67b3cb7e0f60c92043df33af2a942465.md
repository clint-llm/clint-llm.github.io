The treatment depends on the age of the patient and the extent of the disease. Surgery alone is sufficient primary treatment for most patients, and chemotherapy/radiotherapy/biologic therapy is reserved for treating recurrent or metastatic disease. These treatment options may improve survival or increase the length of disease-free time before a recurrence.

After completing the treatment, individuals should continue to have regular visits with their providers to check for recurrences. These visits should include updating the medical history, performing a pelvic exam, and possibly requesting tumor markers. If there are any suspicious findings during these visits, an imaging test such as a CT scan may be done.
