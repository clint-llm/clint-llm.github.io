TTP is a systemic disorder which if not promptly diagnosed and managed has a very high morbidity and mortality. Experts recommend that TTP is best managed in an integrated manner with a team of healthcare professionals specializing in neurology, nephrology, hematology, infectious disease and critical care. There is little room for error as the disorder can progress rapidly leading to multiorgan failure. Once the patient is treated, observation and monitoring are critical. Nurses should regularly assess the mental status, urine output, coagulation status, bleeding and vital signs. The patient and the family must be educated on proper care of the intravenous catheters used for plasmapheresis. The pharmacist must be aware of the medication used to manage refractory cases of TTP. When drugs like corticosteroids and vincristine are initiated, the side effects need to be monitored. Close communication with other specialists is vital if one wants to lower the morbidity and mortality.

**Outcomes**

For patients who are managed promptly with plasmapheresis, the outcome is good, but it still carries a 15-20% mortality. Long-term survival is dependent on other comorbidities like renal failure, cancer or chemotherapy for an organ transplant. Patients with comorbidities have a less than 50% survival at ten years. Even patients who survive tend to have at least one relapse. Further, there is evidence that TTP predisposes patients to autoimmune disorders like Sjogren disease or lupus.
