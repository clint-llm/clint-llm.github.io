The most common prerenal cause is reduced blood flow to the kidney secondary to intravascular volume depletion, heart failure, sepsis, or as a side effect of medication. Oliguria secondary to prerenal causes usually resolves with the restoration of normal renal perfusion. As a result of the decreased renal blood flow, various neurohormonal pathways are activated, that result in the increased production of renin, angiotensin, aldosterone as well as catecholamines and prostaglandins. Activation of these pathways leads to increased water and salt reabsorption resulting in the production of low quantitiesÂ of concentrated urine while maintaining adequate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal blood flow (RBF) to meet the metabolic requirements of the kidneys. In case fluid corrections are not done, decremental reductions in GFR and RBF will result in acute renal failure (ARF).

Renal causes of oliguria arise as a result of tubular damage. As a result of the tubular damage, the kidney loses its normal function i.e., production of urine while excreting the waste metabolites. In addition to this, direct damage to the renal tubules leads to a back leak of filtered uremic metabolites from the tubular lumen into the bloodstream. Hence, in these cases, decreased production of urine leads to oliguria.

In post-renal causes, urine production is normal, but as a result of an obstruction in the urinary tract, urine output is greatly diminished.
