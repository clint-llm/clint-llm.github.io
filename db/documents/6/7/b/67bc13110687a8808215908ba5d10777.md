Familial chylomicronemia syndrome presents with fasting triglycerides above 1000 mg/dL generally over 2000 mg/dl in the blood. Notably, the “refrigerator test” is performed to diagnose the elevated chylomicron levels in the blood; this method involves evaluating serum samples one day following overnight storage in the refrigerator: if the serum has a creamy supernatant only, then the patient has chylomicronemia (Type 1 hyperlipidemia).

The elevated circulating triglycerides in the blood can pose a risk to the pancreas and cause acute pancreatitis, along with their deposition in both the liver and spleen, causing hepatosplenomegaly. It is also recommended to evaluate the total cholesterol at the time of the highest triglyceride level along with the ratio of the triglyceride to total cholesterol. TG/TC ratio elevation is with circulating chylomicrons and VLDL. The TG/TC ratio exceeds 5.0 with type1 and types 5 hyperlipidemia.

For patients suffering from symptoms of acute pancreatitis, a computerized tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen should be done to confirm the diagnosis and severity of the condition, along with the serum lipase and amylase levels which present as elevated.

Rarely, patients with autoimmune diseases, such as SLE, can make autoantibodies to LPL, resulting in severe chylomicronemia, which should be kept in mind when dealing with adult patients, especially.
