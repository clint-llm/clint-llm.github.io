Isoflurane should only be administered by qualified health professionals who have been trained in managing a patient under general anesthesia. Communication between the surgeon and the anesthesia provider is essential to time the emergence of the patient from general anesthesia appropriately. This is due to isoflurane's increased blood solubility coefficient leading to increased times for both induction of and emergence from general anesthesia. Interprofessional teamwork is a large part of patient safety in the operating room, and good communication will improve operating room efficiency and help increase patient safety.
