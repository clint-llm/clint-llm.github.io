Endovascular papillary angioendothelioma, also known as Dabska tumor and papillary intralymphatic angioendothelioma, is a rare tumor of deeper skin. The diagnosis is made with a biopsy. Because of the vast differential for a painless skin lesion, the management should be by an interprofessional team that consists of a dermatologist, plastic surgeon, oncologist, and general surgeon.

Primary clinicians who are not familiar with the management of such lesions should refer the patient to an oncologist. EPA has an overall favorable prognosis, but it does have the potential for local recurrence and low-grade metastasis. Thus, long term follows up is required.
