The prognosis of Hunter syndrome depends upon the phenotype of the disease. Patients with severe phenotype have high mortality. The majority of the patients die by the second decade of life due to pulmonary dysfunction, cardiac valvular abnormalities, or a combination of both. Patients with attenuated phenotype have a better life expectancy than the severe form. Patients have an average life expectancy until the fifth decade. The main cause of death in the attenuated phenotype is the same as the severe form.
