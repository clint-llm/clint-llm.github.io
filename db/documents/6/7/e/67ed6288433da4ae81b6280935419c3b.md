As previously mentioned, the most common precursors to AAS are atherosclerotic disease and hypertension. Other than these, any pathological condition which affects the media, trauma, or infective processes can also lead to AAS. Tearing of the intima from shearing forces of blood flow or interference with the media leads to the separation of layers of the aortic wall.

Though traditionally it is thought that IMH is caused by rupture of the vasa vasorum, recent pathological studies also suggest the presence of micro intimal tears, which would infer possible common pathophysiology of the development of IMH and AAD, the difference being the lack of a large enough re-entrant tear to preserve the patency of the false lumen. PAU develops as atherosclerotic plaque invades through the intimal layer towards the adventitia, and it may progress to IMH, AAD, or pseudo-aneurysm.
