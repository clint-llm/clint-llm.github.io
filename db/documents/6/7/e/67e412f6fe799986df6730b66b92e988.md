An incision is made in the patient's natural suprapubic crease (often, this will be the inferior base fold of the panniculus). The incision is extended laterally towards the anterior superior iliac spine, stopping at the lateral edges of the pubic hair. The incision is deepened, and dissection is continued through the Scarpa fascia and down to the muscle.

Following the musculoaponeurotic fascial plan superiorly, the abdominal skin and subcutaneous tissue are excised. The wound is closed in multiple layers, with attention paid to the Scarpa fascia, deep dermis, and intradermal layers. Permanent or long-lasting absorbable sutures are used in these strength layers.

Avoiding dog ears on the lateral aspect when closing the wound is very important. Before the wound is closed, suction drains are placed under the flap and brought out through a small incision in the pubic region. Compression garments should be worn to prevent seroma formation while drains are present. Once the output of the drain is less than 30 mL/day, they can be removed, and compression garments can be continued for patient comfort.
