Trauma and sports injuries, most commonly due to a FOOSH, may lead to fractures and require immediate evaluation to prevent complications. Greenstick fractures require immediate immobilization to prevent recurrent fractures, complete fractures, or displacement. Activities with a high risk of falling should be avoided while the patient is healing, as there is a high risk of refracture and complete fracture.
