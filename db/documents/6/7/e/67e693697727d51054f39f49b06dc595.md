Clavulanic acid alone has been shown to have no antibacterial effects, and administration must accompany amoxicillin. It is available in both solid and liquid forms. For the solid form, the patient must chew the chewable tablets before swallowing, and there are also immediate and extended-release tablets that must be swallowed whole. The oral liquid suspension should be shaken before administration and is the recommended formulation for children who are unable to chew tablets or swallow whole pills. Administration of all forms of the drug should be done at the start of a light meal to enhance oral absorption and avoid gastrointestinal irritation. Clavulanic acid may increase the absorption of amoxicillin. This drug regimen is to be administered twice to three times daily, depending on dosage, at regular time intervals to maintain constant serum concentrations.
