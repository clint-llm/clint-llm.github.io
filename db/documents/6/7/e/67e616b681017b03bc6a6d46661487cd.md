Intrathoracic goiters are subdivided into acquired and truly intrathoracic or aberrant ones. The acquired goiters originate from thyroid glands, which expand rapidly or over the years from the cervix to the retrosternal space, and are the most common category. The truly intrathoracic goiters arise from ectopic thyroid tissue congenitally located in the mediastinum and account for less than 1% of surgically removed goiters. The great majority of substernal goiters occupy the anterior mediastinum, in front of the brachiocephalic and subclavian vessels. Only 10% to 15% of these extend posteriorly to the trachea, while a very small subgroup expands in a retro esophageal position.

Because several different definitions about intrathoracic goiters have been proposed, Huins and colleagues suggested a classification in 2008, which relies on the anatomical expansion of the goiter and which can be useful in determining appropriate individualized pre-operative planning for different patients. This defines three grades of substernal goiters. Grade 1 defines thyroid tissue located above the aortic arch, grade 2 tissue between the aortic arch and the pericardium, and grade 3 tissue extending to the right cardiac atrium.
