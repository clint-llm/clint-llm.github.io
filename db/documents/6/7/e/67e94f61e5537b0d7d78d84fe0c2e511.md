There are different types of inner ear anomalies, and they currently get placed into categories numbered 1 through 7. These categories primarily have their basis on defects in the modiolus and the scala vestibule. Because there are several anomalies, there are many associated hypothesized pathophysiologies. Some, in particular, include high cerebrospinal fluid pressure, defective endosteum, large quantities of endolymph, and decreased cochlear vascular supply.
