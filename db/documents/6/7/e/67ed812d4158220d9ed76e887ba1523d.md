Sebaceous carcinomas are rare malignant tumors of the sebaceous glands. They most commonly develop on the eyelid, but may arise from anywhere sebaceous glands are present. These tumors may arise spontaneously or in association with Muir-Torre syndrome. This activity reviews the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of sebaceous carcinomas and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of sebaceous carcinomas.
- Review the process for the evaluation of sebaceous carcinomas.
- Outline the management options available for sebaceous carcinomas.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance sebaceous carcinoma treatment and improve outcomes.
