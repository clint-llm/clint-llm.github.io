Due toÂ the fact that the majority of GEP-NETs tumor cells express a large number of SSTRs on their surface, peptide receptor radiotherapy (PRRT) is a systemic radiotherapy modality that uses radionuclide complexes targeting these receptors. Such complexes are composed of a radionuclide isotope, in addition to a carrier (typically octreotide or octreotate), and a chelator. PRRT was found to be effective against GEP-NETs.
