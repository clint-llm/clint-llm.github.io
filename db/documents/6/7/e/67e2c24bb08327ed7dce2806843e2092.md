Radiology technologists that have completed training in the imaging modality to be performed are required to administer the radiotracers, operate the appropriate scanner with indicated protocols, and perform post-scan image reconstruction.

A radiologist or nuclear medicine physician must analyze the images obtained and provide a report for the ordering service or clinician.
