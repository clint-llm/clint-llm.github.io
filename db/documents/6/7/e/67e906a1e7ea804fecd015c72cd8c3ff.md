There are four basic mechanisms by which hydrocele can develop. These are mentioned below:1. Connection with the peritoneal cavity through a patent processes vaginalis (congenital).2. Excessive production of fluid (secondary hydrocele).3. Defective absorption of fluid. 4. Interference with the lymphatic drainage of scrotal structures as in filarial hydroceles.  In children, patency of processus vaginalis, allowing peritoneal fluid to flow into the scrotum, is the main cause of hydrocele. However, in adults, filariasis caused by Wuchereria bancrofti is the main culprit globally, affecting 120 million people in more than 73 countries.
