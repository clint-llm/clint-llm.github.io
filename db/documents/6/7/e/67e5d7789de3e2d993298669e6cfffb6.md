Ranibizumab is a medication used to manage and treat neovascular age-related macular degeneration, macular edema following retinal vein occlusion, diabetic macular edema, myopic choroidal neovascularization, and diabetic retinopathy. It is in the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) inhibitors class of medications. This activity describes the indications, action, and contraindications for ranibizumab as a valuable agent in treating ocular diseases with abnormal angiogenesis. This activity will also highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., indications, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the interprofessional professional team in the management of neovascular age-related macular degeneration, macular edema, diabetic retinopathy, and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of ranibizumab.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of ranibizumab.
- Review the appropriate monitoring necessary during ranibizumab therapy.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance ranibizumab and improve outcomes.
