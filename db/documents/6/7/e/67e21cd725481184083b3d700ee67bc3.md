The prognosis for multiple myeloma is quite variable, and many factors can affect outcomes. However, perhaps the two main drivers in prognosis would be stage and disease biology.

The R-ISS staging was developed when evaluating newly diagnosed MM from a combination of 11 international trials. When dividing by stage, they found that in R-ISS I, the five-year overall survival (OS) was 82%, and progression-free survival (PFS) was 55%. In stage II disease, five-year OS was 62%, and PFS was 36%. Stage III demonstrated a five-year OS of 40% and PFS of 24%.

High-risk cytogenetic abnormalities can adversely affect outcomes. 4:14), t(14:16), and f(14:20) are all considered high risk and have been shown to decrease OS.Â  In one study, the presence of t(14:16) resulted in a PFS of 2.1 years and OS of 4.1 years.

These factors help understand the general prognosis and can guide discussions with patients. However, it is important to note that significant therapeutic progress has been made over the last several years, with OS changes yet to reflect these advances.
