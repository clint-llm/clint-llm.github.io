G-cells secrete gastrin into the systemic circulation, which allows the delivery of gastrin to parietal cells and enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells in the gastric fundus and cardiac. Gastrin stimulates the proliferation of gastric mucosal endocrine cells (parietal cells, ECL cells). This trophic quality of gastrin may be related to the potentiation of some cancers. Gastrin has also been found to interact with acinar cells of the pancreas, gastric smooth muscle cells, endocrine cells, and some white blood cells.

Gastrin has been found to modulate immunity and inflammation via CCKB/gastrin receptor-expressing white blood cells. Â Specifically, CCKB expression has been recorded in some polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), mononuclear cells, and endothelial cells. It has demonstrated the ability to stimulate mast cell release of histamine, lymphocytic secretion of IL-2, endothelial expression of VCAM-1 and P-selectin, and endothelial secretion of IL-8.
