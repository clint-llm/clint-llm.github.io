Management of cyclothymia, along with the rest of the bipolar disorders, often requires an interprofessional teamÂ approach, including the primary care clinician, psychiatrist, psychologist or social worker, as well as family and friends. Often this goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, which contributes to morbidity and mortality. Early consultation with psychiatry or inpatient hospitalization may be required if there are significant symptoms or if there is suicidality or progression to psychosis. The team must work together to achieve successful patient outcomes.
