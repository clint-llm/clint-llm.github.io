Despite advances in cardiovascular health and interventional cardiology, coronary restenosis continues to be a challenge for interventional cardiologists. Treatment options are complicated and ever-evolving. Understanding the epidemiology, pathophysiology, lesion characteristics, diagnosis, and full treatment options allows the interventionalist to make the best individualized clinical decisions. This activity reviews the current knowledge of etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, evaluation, and pros and cons of available therapeutic options with restenosis. The role of the interprofessional team is reviewed.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention.
- Describe the pathophysiology of restenosis.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for restenosis.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to ensure the best clinical outcomes in patients with coronary restenosis
