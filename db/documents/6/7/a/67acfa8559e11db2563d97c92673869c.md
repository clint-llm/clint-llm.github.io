Ascariasis is one of the most common human parasitic infections. It is found worldwide. Ascariasis has been a disease that has affected the world population for centuries. It was described in ancient Egyptian papyruses and has been identified in Egyptian mummies from around 800 B.C. Even Hippocrates and Aristotle described the helminth. This disease has been described in children and adults in tropical and subtropical areas with poor sanitation and poor personal hygiene and in places where human feces are used as fertilizer. There is a higher risk of infection in nonendemic areas due to the increased rate of migration and travel.
