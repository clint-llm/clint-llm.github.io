CG is a rare disease of undefined incidence and prevalence. One study estimated incidence to be 0.08% of the general population. It may have an onset in all age groups but is most commonly seen in adults with peak incidence reported between 20 to 40 years of age. It rarely affects children. However, in two recently published articles, 30 cases in pediatric patients have been described. Most of the literature suggests an equal sex distribution; however, some authors reported that it is more frequently reported in females. Rare familial cases have also been reported.
