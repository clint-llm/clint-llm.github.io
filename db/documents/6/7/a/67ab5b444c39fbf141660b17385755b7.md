The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is a pure sensory nerve vulnerable to compression as it passes from the lumbosacral plexus towards the inguinal ligament and into the subcutaneous tissue of the anterior thigh. Meralgia paresthetica is a clinical condition that involves pain and dysesthesia in the anterolateral thigh associated with compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. Meralgia paresthetica is also known as Bernhardt Roth syndrome, lateral femoral cutaneous nerve syndrome, or lateral femoral cutaneous neuralgia.
