When evaluating a patient with acute, traumatic facial paralysis, the two most important pieces of information to elucidate are the **timeline**of the paralysis and its**severity**. When the paralysis is immediate and complete, there should be a high index of suspicion for a facial nerve transection; however, if the paralysis is delayed and/or incomplete, the nerve must be at least partially intact. If nerve transection is suspected, exploration should be undertaken to repair the injury. If the nerve is at least partially intact, the patient can typically be observed closely with the general expectation of a good recovery. The caveat to this last point is that facial paralysis from temporal bone fractures often takes days to weeks to reach its peak because the edema produced within the Fallopian canal of the facial nerve may develop very slowly. If the paralysis becomes complete, however, patients with temporal bone fractures may be candidates for facial nerve decompression, which is why it is critical to follow them closely until they begin to recover function, meet decompression criteria, or two months have passed since the injury.

While it may seem very straightforward to determine the timeline and the severity of the paralysis in most cases, there are occasions when it may not be. Examples include long surgeries in which an iatrogenic injury caused early on may be immediately apparent on emergence from anesthesia but could still represent a delayed onset and polytrauma patients (particularly involving the temporal bone) that present intubated and sedated without the ability to follow commands or to provide a history of paralysis onset. Nevertheless, it is incumbent upon the clinician to obtain the best history possible, sometimes from relatives, friends, paramedics, or bystanders, and to assess facial nerve function as systematically as possible. There are many different classification systems used to describe impaired facial nerve function, but the most common is that popularized by House and Brackmann in 1984.

- Grade I: normal function

- Grade II: mild dysfunction, symmetric at rest, slight asymmetry with movement but complete eye closure with gentle effort, possible mild synkinesis

- Grade III: moderate dysfunction, symmetric at rest, moderate asymmetry with movement but complete eye closure with full effort, possible moderate synkinesis

- Grade IV: moderate dysfunction, symmetric at rest, moderate asymmetry with movement, and incomplete eye closure with full effort

- Grade V: severe dysfunction, grossly asymmetric at rest, marked asymmetry with movement, and incomplete eye closure with full effort

- Grade VI: severe dysfunction, grossly asymmetric at rest, no movement at all

The House-Brackmann scale is simple and rapid to employ and is, therefore, quite popular. However, it was created to characterize facial paralysis of otologic or otological iatrogenic origin, and for this reason, it is really only useful for describing hemifacial flaccid paralysis. Its description of synkinesis is limited, and it is incapable of describing segmental abnormalities. Other classification systems, such as the Yanigahara, Sidney, Sunnybrook, House-Brackmann 2.0, and eFACE scales, provide more granularity when describing facial paralysis, but for the sake of documentation, it may be both simpler and more precise to convey the findings in a detailed and systematic way that describes the functional status of each major extratemporal facial nerve branch.

- Frontal: elevate brows, furrow brows (scowl).

- Zygomatic: close eyes gently (or watch for natural blinks), close eyes tightly - the distinction between the ability to close the eye with normal effort vs. with full effort is the difference between House-Brackmann grades II and III.

- Buccal: smile, pucker lips.

- Marginal mandibular: depress lower lip to show bottom teeth.

- Cervical: contract platysma.

- Overall: look for asymmetry at rest, particularly in brow height, lower eyelid position, nasolabial fold depth and orientation, the position of the upper lip philtrum, and the position of the oral commissures.

It is important to consider the non-emotive functions of the facial nerve as well, which are generally evaluated during the history by asking questions about hearing, taste, nasal breathing, eye dryness or pain, and eye tearing. When patients present after skull base surgery or injury, the corneal sensation should be assessed with a wisp of cotton to rule out corneal hypesthesia. Patients who undergo acoustic neuroma resections are at particular risk for corneal hypesthesia, which can mask the progress of exposure keratopathy and increase the risk of long-term ocular surface problems. These patients are candidates for early eyelid weight placement, as are patients who are less able to protect their corneas due to a poor Bell's phenomenon (upward rotation of the globe with eye closure). Lastly, the emotional status of any patient with facial paralysis should be assessed, as the psychosocial impact on patients, particularly young females, can be profound and may require behavioral health intervention.

In the case of polytrauma patients, particularly temporal bone fracture patients, it is critical to look for other injuries, particularly cervical spine fractures, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, and other intracranial pathology, which accompany temporal bone fractures in up to 90% of cases.
