Pusless ventricular tachycardia can lead to cardiac arrest and insufficient organ perfusion, which is the main cause of most complications. Anoxic brain injury and lifelong neurological complications can result from tachycardia that lasts for greater than 3 minutes.

Other complications of the post-cardiac arrest syndrome include post-cardiac arrest myocardial dysfunction and systemic ischemia/reperfusion response. Myocardial dysfunction from ischemia can lead to transient global dysfunction and is a common cause of early mortality after cardiac arrest.
