In patients with conditions of the heart or circulatory system, the intravenous administration of dopamine is contraindicated. These conditions may include ventricular arrhythmias and tachycardia, blood vessel blockage, low blood-oxygen content, decreased blood volume, acidosis, and adrenal gland dysfunctions resulting in high blood pressure such as pheochromocytoma. For patients recently treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors, DA is initially used in fractional doses (one-tenth usual dose) and closely monitored for further effects. Medications to treat hypertension, such as beta and alpha-adrenergic inhibitors, antagonize the therapeutic effects of DA. Haloperidol also blocks the systemic effects of DA. The anticonvulsant phenytoin has been reported to cause hypotension and decreased heart rate when used with DA. On the other hand, tricyclic antidepressants increase the DA response, similar to anesthetic agents such as cyclopropane and halogenated. In combination with oxytocin, the use of DA can lead to chronic hypertension and may also cause cerebrovascular accidents.
