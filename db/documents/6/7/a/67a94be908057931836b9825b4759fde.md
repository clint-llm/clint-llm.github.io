When subcutaneous in location, the differential diagnosis of a palpable hibernoma on the physical exam includes benign and malignant lesions.

Lipoma-like variants of hibernomas can resemble lipomas on imaging and histopathology, owning to their higher composition of white fat cells. When small, hibernomas can resemble other capillary-rich neoplasms, including hemangiomas and angiolipomas. Fat necrosis will appear as a complex fat-containing lesion and may have features of increasing fibrosis or calcification over time. Fibromatosis can be considered in the differential, although imaging can distinguish between these two entities. Hibernomas can be warm to touch on physical exam, and as such, an abscess can be considered in the differential diagnosis. In summary, benign common subcutaneousÂ lesions in the differential diagnosis include:

- Lipomatous lesions (lipoma, ALT including angiolipoma)

- Fat necrosis

- Hemangiomas

- Fibromatosis

- Other primary malignancies

- Metastatic disease

- Abscess

On imaging, a liposarcoma can be difficult to distinguish from hibernomas. On rare occasions, hypervascular hibernomas can also resemble lymphoma on CT imaging. A history of malignancy should also raise the suspicion for metastasis. Cutaneous and subcutaneous metastasis often originate from melanoma, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and lung cancer. Malignant subcutaneous lesions in the differential diagnosis include:

- Liposarcoma

- Lymphoma

- Merkel cell carcinoma

- Subcutaneous metastases

- Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans

- Angiosarcoma (radiation-induced)
