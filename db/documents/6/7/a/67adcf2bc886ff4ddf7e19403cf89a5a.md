The stress in the lungs is mainly the result of external pathogens and toxins, such as those from smoke, pollution, bacteria, and viruses, among others. As mentioned above, the chronic exposure to such toxins allows for the bypass of the airways' defense. TheÂ particles are both too small to cough out via the mucociliary escalator or to engulf via alveolar macrophages and they rather induce the ISR.
