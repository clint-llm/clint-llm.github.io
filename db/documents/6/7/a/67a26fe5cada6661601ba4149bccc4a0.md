The osseous structures of the radiocarpal joint include the distal radius, the scaphoid, the lunate, and the triquetrum.

The distal radius has two concaved surfaces involved in the radiocarpal joint, the scaphoid fossa and the lunate fossa. These concavities provide a surface for direct articulation between the radius and the two carpal bones.

The soft tissue structures of the wrist are mainly comprised of the triangular fibrocartilage complex and the intrinsic and extrinsic ligaments. The ligaments of importance regarding the radiocarpal joint are the extrinsic ligaments which serve as a connection between the distal radius and the carpal bones.

The dorsal radiocarpal ligament originates on the dorsal surface of the radius spreads medially distally until it inserts on the lunate and triquetrum.

The short and long radiolunate ligaments are volar ligaments that originate on the ulnar aspect of the radius and insert onto the lunate. The role of the long radiolunate is to limit the motion of the lunate distally and medially (towards the ulna).

The radioscaphocapitate ligament is another volar structure that originates at the radial styloid and inserts on the scaphoid and proximal capitate. Of importance, is the fact that it runs in parallel with the long radiolunate ligament which forms a space. This space is an area of weakness that can predispose to carpal instability known as the space of Poirier.

Lastly is the radioscapholunate ligament, also known as the ligament of Testut. This structure is technically not a ligament since it provides no structural support.

A two-layered capsule covers the articulation of the above osseous and soft tissue structures. The outer portion of the capsule is composed of fibrous connective tissue which provides added structural support to the joint complex. The inner layer is a synovial membrane responsible for the secretion of synovial fluid to keep the joint lubricated.

The radiocarpal joint also serves as the primary site for dispersion of force traveling through the wrist. Studies demonstrate that when the wrist is held in a neutral position the radiocarpal joint experiences 80% of the force that travels across the joint compared to the 20% experienced by the ulnocarpal joint.

The radiocarpal joint allows proper hand movements, this includes flexion, extension, adduction, and abduction of the wrist but the supination and pronation of the hand, movements known as rotation, cannot be done by the hand as a unit or independent in relation to the forearm. Hand rotation is possible because the forearm needs to rotate too
