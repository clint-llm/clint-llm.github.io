Complications associated with vestibular disorders, in general, are results of increased fall risk and decreased quality of life. In elderly patients particularly, the sequelae of serious falls can be debilitating or even deadly. Regardless, patients with severe vertigo suffer significant quality of life decrements because of the inability to perform many activities of daily living that other people rely upon regularly, such as driving automobiles, operating machinery, riding bicycles, running, or even walking. Many patients with vertigo lose the ability to work in the fields in which they had previously been employed or even to work at all. When vestibular dysfunction is due to a peripheral pathology, hearing loss may accompany it and exacerbate the disability, just as other cranial neuropathies or neurological symptoms may coexist with CNS etiologies.
