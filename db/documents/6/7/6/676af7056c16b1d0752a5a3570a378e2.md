Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a dysrhythmia originating at or above the atrioventricular (AV) node and is defined by a narrow complex (QRS &lt; 120 milliseconds) at a rate &gt; 100 beats per minute (bpm). Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), also known as paroxysmal SVT, is defined as intermittent SVT without provoking factors, and typically presents with a ventricular rhythm of 160 bpm. This activity describes the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of SVT and stresses the importance of an interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of SVT.
- Outline the presentation of a patient with SVT.
- Summarize the treatment options for SVT.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by SVT.
