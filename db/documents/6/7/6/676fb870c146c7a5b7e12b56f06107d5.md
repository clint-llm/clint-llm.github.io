S. schenckii was first isolated in 1896 by Benjamin Schenx, a medical student at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Sporotrichosis was first thought to be caused by a single organism but is now known toÂ contain several species including S. brasilienis, S. globosa, and S. Mexicana, so it has been renamed S. schenckii complex or S. schenckii senu lato.
