Angiodysplasia is an abnormal, tortuous, dilated small blood vessel in the mucosal and submucosal layers of the GI tract. It is the most common vascular abnormality in the GI tract. Although usually readily seen by colonoscopy and angiography, they are often difficult to diagnose in pathologic specimens. This activity reviews the evaluation, histopathology, and treatment of angiodysplasia. It explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of angiodysplasia.
- Explain the histopathology of angiodysplasia and know the differential diagnoses.
- Identify the evaluation and management of angiodysplasia.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to ensure appropriate management and to enhance outcomes.
