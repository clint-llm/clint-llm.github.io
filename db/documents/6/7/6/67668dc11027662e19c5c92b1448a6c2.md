Macrocytic anemia refers to macrocytosis (mean corpuscular volume (MCV) greater than 100 fL) in the setting of anemia (hemoglobin less than 12 g/dL or hematocrit (Hct) less than 36% in nonpregnant females, hemoglobin less than 11 g/dL in pregnant females, or hemoglobin less than 13 g/dL or Hct less than 41% in males). It is divided into two forms, megaloblastic (hypersegmented neutrophils) and non-megaloblastic. The megaloblastic form is due to impaired DNA synthesis from folate and/or vitamin B12 deficiencies, while the non-megaloblastic moiety occurs from multiple mechanisms.There are many etiologies for macrocytic anemia, decreased hemoglobin with elevated mean corpuscular volume (>100 fL), several of which are easily treatable and some that that are life-threatening. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of macrocytic anemia and highlights the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of macrocytic anemia.
- Summarize the evaluation of a patient with macrocytic anemia.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for macrocytic anemia.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance treatment of macrocytic anemia and improve patient outcomes.
