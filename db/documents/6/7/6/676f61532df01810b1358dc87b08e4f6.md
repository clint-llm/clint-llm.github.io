The first neuropathological description of MFS was described in a case report by Phillips and Anderson in 1984. In this case, the brain of the patient, who died unexpectedly from bronchopneumonia, was prepared for histopathological analysis. Microscopic examination using solochrome cyanine staining (for myelin) showed patchy and extensive segmental demyelination associated with the invasion of foamy macrophages and lymphocytes. These changes affected both motor and sensory roots in the peripheral nervous system, as well as cranial nerves. The brain stem and spinal cord, among other regions of the central nervous system, are relatively spared. Electron microscopy confirmed the above findings and exquisitely showed complete demyelination of axons in Schwann cell cytoplasm with surrounding macrophages and lymphocytes.
