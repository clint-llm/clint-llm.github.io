The selection criteria for patients undergoing vertebral augmentation would not include patients in mild or moderate pain secondary to a vertebral fracture. Conservative and pharmacological management should be the first-line treatment.

Patients with an osteoporotic compression fracture should initially receive medical management. The evidence has not shown vertebral augmentation to be more beneficial than a placebo in this population. Thus vertebral augmentation is not indicated in mild or moderate pain for osteoporotic compression fractures.

The American Society of Bone and Mineral Research advised against the use of kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty in acute osteoporotic compression fractures.

When a vertebral fracture is severe, or a patient’s facet joint has suffered compromise, it may contraindicate vertebral augmentation.

A relative contraindication to vertebral augmentation is a vertebral body fracture with a posterior cortical breach.

A complete vertebral body collapse would be a true contraindication to vertebral augmentation. An underlying fracture of the posterior wall of the vertebra has potentially serious complications; this would include extravasation of cement, leading to catastrophic neurological damage.

Other absolute contraindications include unstable fractures, active infection of the spine or the injection site, and coagulation disorders.
