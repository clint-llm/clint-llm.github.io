Globe rupture occurs when there is a defect in the cornea, sclera, or both structures. Global rupture often occurs after direct penetrating trauma; however, if sufficient blunt force is applied to the eye, the intraocular pressure can increase enough to rupture the sclera. The rupture site is most commonly near the globe's equator posterior to the insertion of the rectus muscles, which is where the sclera is weakest and thinnest.

**Injury Division**

- **Direct or Coup -**Direct blow to the eye. e.g., Corneal abrasion

- **Countercoup -**Due to pressure waves transmitted at the posterior pole. e.g., commotio retinae

- **Anteroposterior Compression and Horizontal Expansion -**Pressure waves in the anteroposterior and horizontal axes. e.g., globe rupture

**Blunt Trauma Division**

- **Direct**-injury to the eye by hand, fist, ball, or blunt instruments like a stick, stone, and iron rod

- **Accidental-**accidental trauma like a fall from a bike, self-fall, stone injury, cracker injury, etc

**Stages of the Mechanism of Blunt Trauma**

- Direct impact

- Compression wave force

- Reflected compression wave

- Rebound compression wave
