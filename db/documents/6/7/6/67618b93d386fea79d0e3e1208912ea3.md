Patients should be counseled that tattoo removal takes anywhere from 4 to 15 treatments depending on the age, color, quality, and mechanism of tattoo placement. It is also important to discuss the importance of sun avoidance pre- and post-treatment due to the risk of hypo- and hyperpigmentation. Photographs and consent should be taken at baseline and prior to every treatment. The risks of the procedure should be discussed such as hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation, blistering, scarring, paradoxical darkening, and unpredictable treatment response.
