Communication between the wound care specialist, the surgeon, and the care team is necessary to ensure that a proper wound bed is prepared and that no infection exists in the wound bed. The care team is essential to this process because they change bandages daily and see the wounds. They are also responsible for the care of the patient after the graft when it is most fragile and must be protected.
