Different entities can resemble BS. In the acute phase, the differential diagnosis might be challenging, especially when inflammatory episodes begin, as all the various causes of acute and acute on chronic eyelid swelling must be considered:

- Allergic reactions

- Local eyelid infection/inflammation (stye, chalazion, etc.)

- Orbital inflammation

- Skin conditions

- Angioedema

- Melkerson-Rosenthal Syndrome

In the quiescent phase:

- Dermatochalasis

- Floppy eyelid syndrome

- Upper lid ptosis

- Acquired cutis laxa

- Eyelid/orbital masses

A comprehensive history and examination should be sufficient to differentiate BS from these conditions, especially when the swelling attacks recur.
