Osteoporosis is diagnosed primarily by a DXA scan. Conditions such as osteomalacia that occurs in patients with cystic fibrosis and liver failure and adynamic bone disease that occurs in ESRD patients may present with a low BMD on the DXA scan. Since a precise diagnosis has specific implications on the treatment of these patients, caution must be exercised, and additional testing such as bone histomorphometry should be considered when necessary to arrive at an accurate diagnosis.
