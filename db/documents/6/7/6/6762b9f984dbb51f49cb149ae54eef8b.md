Patients typically first notice painful growing nodules. The pain of their condition is classically described as aching, stabbing, or burning in quality and it is generally symmetric. Typically, pain worsens with palpation. The most common areas of painful adipose tissue include the proximal extremities, trunk, and buttocks.

On physical exam, patients with adiposis dolorosa are commonly overweight or obese, and pain symptoms are out of proportion to what is found on the exam.
