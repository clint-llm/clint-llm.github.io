The human embryo possesses the capability to develop and differentiate into both male and female reproductive systems. By the timeline of the 6th week of gestation, the fetus would have developed the primordial structures that could either form a male or female reproductive system. In the absence of testosterone, the fetus would develop the female reproductive system. Differentiation of the primordial undifferentiated gonadal ridge into the male reproductive system initiates during the embryonic life by the SRY gene located on the short arm of the Y chromosome. Testosterone produced by the testes leads to differentiation of Wolffian duct in males to form the male internal genitalia, including seminal vesicles, epididymis, and vas deferens. The overlying skin on the external genitalia has the activity of 5alpha-RD2 activity, which helps in the conversion of testosterone to di-hydro testosterone. DHT will then start forming the external genitalia. By 12 weeks of gestation, the male external genitalia differentiates. After 12 weeks, the penis starts to grow in size, and the testes begin their descent into the scrotum.

5 alpha-RD2 deficiency is an inherited autosomal recessive disease. The deficiency is due to mutations in the gene which encodes for the enzyme 5α-RD2 on the short arm of chromosome 2. Up to 40 different types of mutations have been reported leading to this disease. The levels of DHT will be low in these children, which will affect the sexual differentiation of male external genitalia. Although the genotype of these children is 46 XY, the phenotype varies from case to case.
