The mesoderm is the middle layer of the trilaminar disc of tissue formed as a result of gastrulation in a fetus. Surrounded by the endoderm and ectoderm, the mesoderm is the structure giving rise to connective tissue and muscles of the human body aside from the muscles of the head, which develop from neural crest tissue. Thus, the popliteus muscle originates from the mesoderm.

The popliteus muscle has several surrounding attachments and ligaments; the most important ones include ligamentous connections to the lateral meniscus and fibular head that form during the cavitation that ultimately forms the residing bursa and form obliquely consistent with the musculotendinous structures. Although there is no direct ligamentous attachment from the posterolateral femur to the tibia, an indirect relationship exists between the popliteal tendon and the fibular head, known as the popliteofibular ligament.
