All mothers and babies must receive postnatal care within the first 24 hours. New mothers should be offered help to inculcate the best practices in breastfeeding the newborn with the correct technique. Nurse practitioners and midwives have an essential role in preventing, early diagnosis, and prompt referral of lactating mothers with breast lumps. The nurse practitioner plays a vital role in educating the patients and their families about their condition.

Regular follow-up visits must be encouraged to ensure both the mother and the baby are in good health. Patients must be counseled about the importance of breast hygiene during lactation. The importance of proper counseling and education of the mother and taking care of her health cannot be overemphasized. This can be done by using information leaflets and posters or by referring them to educational websites, if available.
