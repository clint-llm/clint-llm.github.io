Biotin consumption for beneficial means remains unclear, but it has been considered a very difficult drug to overdose on or cause injury to the body. When taking anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine or phenobarbital, the requirements for biotin increase due to these medications inhibiting uptake into the brush borders of membrane vesicles.

Biotin can interfere with some hormone assays. In immunoassays using the streptavidin-biotin interaction, the interference may induce both false-positive and false-negative results. The hormone levels affected may include thyroid functions, gonadotrophins, and vitamin D.
