Pulsus bisferiens is commonly seen in mixed aortic disease with severe aortic regurgitation and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

- The incidence of aortic regurgitation is high in the fourth to sixth decade of life, increases with age, and is more common in the elderly. It is more common in men (13%) than women (8.5%). The Framingham study reported the prevalence of aortic regurgitation at 4.9% and severe aortic regurgitation at 0.5% in the US population.

- Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is the most common genetically inherited heart disease. Prevalence rates of HOCM vary across the globe. The prevalence in the US is 1 in 500 (0.2%), and in Germany is 1 in 1,372 (0.07%).

- Rheumatic heart disease and bacterial endocarditis are more common in developing countries (Asia, Africa). The incidence of aortic disease is 10 cases per 100,000 to as high as 374 cases per 100,000 in the Pacific and Australia.
