The laboratory parameter used to determine if warfarin anticoagulation is therapeutic is the INR. During warfarin therapy, a blood sample is taken to determine the INR. Once a patient is in the maintenance phase of treatment, the INR is typically collected at least every four weeks. If a patient's INR becomes supratherapeutic or subtherapeutic, another INR will need to be collected within 1 to 7 days to ensure the patient's level has returned to the therapeutic range. An INR may also be collected when starting, discontinuing, or changing doses of medications known to interact with warfarin.

Since warfarin is an anticoagulant, monitoring for signs and symptoms of bleeding such as black tarry stools, nosebleeds, or hematomas is imperative. Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels should be obtained before the initiation of warfarin and approximately every six months while taking warfarin. Other laboratory tests may be indicated based on a given patient's presentation, including a urinalysis, occult blood, and liver function tests. Drug-drug, drug-herbal, drug-food, and drug-disease state interactions are all important factors that require monitoring to help avoid potential adverse effects related to supratherapeutic or subtherapeutic anticoagulation.
