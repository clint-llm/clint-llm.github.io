Asplenia means the absence of a spleen. Asplenia can occur in a variety of clinical settings, and it can refer to an anatomic absence of the spleen or functional asplenia secondary to a variety of disease states. The spleen is one of the primary extramedullary lymphoid organs. It is located in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. Normally, the spleen is not palpable on physical exam and measures on average 10.65 by 5.16 cm. Normal spleen size can vary by gender and race. For example, men on average have larger spleens than females, and whites, on average, tend to have larger spleens compared to African American individuals.

Functionally, the spleenâ€™s primary physiologic role is the filtration and processing of senescent blood cells (predominantly red blood cells or RBCs) and immunologically helps protect against encapsulated microorganisms and respond to infectious pathogens. It contains both hematopoietic and lymphopoietic elements, providing a basis for extramedullary hematopoiesis when necessary.

Asplenia can be caused by damage to the white pulp, the red pulp, or both. The spleen is a direct and indirect site of potential toxicity that can secondarily arise from underlying disease processes or infection.Neisseria meningitides or Streptococcal pneumoniae, among many others, can become life-threatening if untreated in patients with anatomic or functional asplenia.Purpura fulminans.
