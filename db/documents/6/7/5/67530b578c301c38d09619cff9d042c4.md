Alterations in lipolysis are often associated with obesity. These changes include increased basal rates of lipolysis, which may promote the development of insulin resistance and also diminished responsiveness to stimulated lipolysis.

Obesity is characterized primarily by an excess of WAT due to hypertrophy of adipocytes that results from increased TAG storage. Obesity is a rampant health problem across the world due to its association with several disorders, including insulin resistance, type II diabetes, hypertension, and atherosclerosis.
