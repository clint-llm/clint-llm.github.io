Ciliary muscles and the six extrinsic eye muscles receive vascular supply by branches of the ophthalmic artery. Long posterior ciliary arteries provide blood to the ciliary muscles. The superior, lateral, medial and inferior rectus muscles receive blood from anteriorÂ ciliary arteries. Each rectus muscle receives supply from two anterior ciliary arteries, except the lateral rectus which receives blood from only one artery. The lateral muscular artery also supplies the lateral and superior rectus as well as the superior oblique muscle. The medial muscular branch supplies the inferior and medial rectus and inferior oblique muscles.
