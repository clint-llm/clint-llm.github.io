Interprofessional healthcare team members, including clinicians, psychiatrists, nurse practitioners and physician assistants, nurses, and pharmacists, should be aware that nortriptyline is no longer a first-line choice for its indicated conditions. There are many better and safer antidepressants on the market. The drug has many side effects, which are often not well tolerated.

However, when a patient is taking nortriptyline, all interprofessional team members should contribute from their individual disciplines to ensure proper dosing, the absence of drug-drug interactions, and participate in patient monitoring and education, to drive optimal outcomes with minimal adverse events. Every team member is responsible for monitoring and counseling the patient and must be alert for signs of therapeutic failure, possible drug interactions, or adverse events, including toxicity. If they note an issue with the patient, they should report these to the other team members and document their observations in the patient's medical record. A randomized controlled trial aimed at the clinical effectiveness of collaborative care in managing patients with moderate to severe depression showed optimistic results. Coordinated care between health care providers had continued promisingÂ results up to one year after initiation of the depression treatment and was preferred by patients.
