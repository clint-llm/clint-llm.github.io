This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of the aortopulmonary window and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the morphology and resultant physiology of aortopulmonary window.
- Outline the typical imaging findings associated with an aortopulmonary window.
- Summarize the management of aortopulmonary window.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with aortopulmonary window.
