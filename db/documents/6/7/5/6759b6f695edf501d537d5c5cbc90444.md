**Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia**

These patients have symptoms of ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or aortic stenosis. Patients may have tendonitis or arthralgia and a history of unusual skin lesions. Survival beyond 30 years of age is difficult unless treated with unusual methods.

**Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia**

These patients have severe hypercholesterolemia since childhood. Symptoms of ischemic heart disease are common, especially if other cardiovascular risk factors are present. Symptoms of recurrent Achilles tendonitis or arthritic complaints may be present.

**Family History**

Careful family history is essential for the assessment and diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia. Family history of premature coronary artery disease or high cholesterol in first-degree relatives (younger than 60 years in women and 55 years in men among first-degree relatives) are red flags.

**Physical Examination**

Usually, abnormal physical examinations are related to depositions of cholesterol in the eye or skin. It can happen at an early age with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.
