While considering a diagnosis of MALToma, the following differentials must be kept in mind.

- Reactive lesions: Reactive lesions do not destroy the normal epithelial organization, while MALTomas do.

- Splenic marginal zone lymphoma: This diagnosis is a possibility when non-Hodgkin tumors arising from an extranodal site extend to involve the spleen.

- Nodal marginal zone lymphoma: This is a potential diagnosis when non-Hodgkin tumors arising from an extranodal site extend to involve nodes in a widespread fashion.

- Mantle cell lymphoma: Mantle cell lymphoma is also a B cell neoplasm, but in contrast to MALToma, it expresses CD5.

- Follicular lymphoma: Another B cell neoplasm that expresses CD 10 and exhibits t(14;18) rearrangements that involve the BCL2 gene.

- Diffuse large B cell lymphoma: Both diffuse large B cell lymphoma and MALToma are B cell neoplasms, but the former has more rapid growth with a poor prognosis. This differential is possible on morphology only with tumor cells of diffuse large B cell lymphoma having large cell size and nuclei as big as twice the size of a small lymphocyte.
