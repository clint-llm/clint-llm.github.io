DaunorubicinÂ is a member of the anthracycline class of antibiotics. It exerts its anti-neoplastic properties through various mechanisms that include both anti-mitotic and anti-cytotoxic activities. It acts by intercalating between the DNA base pairs, causing the DNA double helix to uncoil and inhibit the topoisomerase II enzyme, resulting in single and double-strand breaks, thus inhibiting DNA and RNA synthesis.

Daunorubicin also inhibits polymerase enzyme activity, dysregulating the gene expression and resulting in free radical damage to the DNA and ultimately resulting in apoptosis, mitochondrial injury, and programmed cell death.
