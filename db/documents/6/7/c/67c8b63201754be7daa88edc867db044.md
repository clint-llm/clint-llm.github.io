Tay Sachs disease is caused by the deficiency of the enzyme Beta hexosaminidase A (Hex A), whichÂ is responsible for GM2 ganglioside degradation. Alpha and beta subunits of Hex A are synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum. Following glycosylation, intramolecular disulfide bond formation, and dimerization in the endoplasmic reticulum, the enzyme is transported to the Golgi network. Post-translational modification of the enzyme with mannose-6-Phosphate is the most important step, which helps the lysosome to recognize the enzyme. The presentation of GM2 ganglioside to the active site of Hex A requires an activator protein GM2A, which makes the enzyme lipophilic.

Gangliosides are the major glycolipid of the neuronal cell membrane, ensuring normal cellular activity.

Other pathological processes in the disease process include abnormal endosomal transport, impaired autophagy, progressive accumulation of alpha-synuclein, and anti-ganglioside antibodies.
