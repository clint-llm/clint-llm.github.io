Most cases of hereditary tyrosinemia in the western world are diagnosed with newborn screening. However,Â newborn screening remains a distant reality in developing countries, and most patients receive a late diagnosis. It has been shown that early diagnosis and treatment improve the long-term outcome of affected individuals.

These disorders involve multiple systems, and optimal management requires an interprofessional team approach involving clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPS, and PAs), nurses, lab technicians, pharmacists, nutritionists, and physicians from various sub-specialties. Clinicians will guide care, but nurses will play a pivotal role in patient care by assisting in patient evaluation, patient counseling and serving as a liaison between the various providers on the case. Pharmacists and dieticians or nutritionists can round out the team and must communicate their concerns or findings with other team members promptly. All care team members must maintain accurate and updated patient records. This interprofessional approach will yield optimal patient results. [Level 5]

Every healthcare professional involved in the care of these patients needs to be aware of the current evidence-based management approaches, especially given the condition's rarity. Adherence to dietary restriction and nitisinone therapy (for HT1) remains the mainstay of treatment and needs to be instituted early for the best outcome. [Level 3]
