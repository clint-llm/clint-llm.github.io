This article is aimed at introducing idiopathic interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) as a separate entity under the umbrella of interstitial lung diseases (ILD). IPAF and other connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD) are essential to differentiate from IPF as the latter has a poor prognosis. Early diagnosis is essential and multidisciplinary management with the involvement of a pulmonologist, radiologist, pathologist, rheumatologist, and a thoracic surgeon is useful for consistent and accurate diagnosis and optimizing patient outcomes. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of IPAF and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the definition of interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF).
- Review the criteria for the diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF).
- Explain the importance of interdisciplinary team communication for the diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF).
- Summarize the potential treatment for interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF).
