In addition to a thorough history and physical examination, electrocardiogram assists in diagnosing cardiac ischemia or myocardial infarction. It is a quick, inexpensive, and relatively less specialized test that can be done at the bedside.

Following are a variety of diagnostic tools utilized to help diagnose pulmonary edema and, more importantly, differentiate between its different types.

**Laboratory Testing**

Brain-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is secreted by the cardiac myocytes of the left ventricles in response to stretching caused by increased ventricular blood volume or increased intracardiac pressures. Elevated BNP levels correlate with left ventricular end-diastolic pressure as well as pulmonary occlusion pressure and can be seen in patients with congestive heart failure.

Troponin elevation is commonly noted in patients with damage to myocytes, such as acute coronary syndrome. They, however, are also noted to be elevated in patients with severe sepsis.

Hypoalbuminemia (â‰¤3.4 g/dL) is an independent marker of increased in-hospital and post-discharge mortality for patients presenting in acute decompensated heart failure.

Obtaining serum electrolyte levels, including renal function, serum osmolarity, toxicology screening, help in patients with pulmonary edema due to toxic ingestion. Obtaining lipase and amylase levels help diagnose acute pancreatitis.

**Radiographic Testing**

Both posteroanterior and lateral views in standard imaging or anteroposterior views in portable imaging are utilized. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is characterized by the presence of central edema, pleural effusions, Kerley B septal lines, peribronchial cuffing, and enlarged heart size. In noncardiogenic etiologies, the edema pattern is typically patchy and peripheral that can demonstrate the presence of ground-glass opacities and consolidations with air bronchograms.

**Echocardiography**

Assists in the diagnosis of left ventricular systolic dysfunction and valvular dysfunction. Through modalities, including tissue Doppler imaging of the mitral annulus, the presence and degree of diastolic dysfunction can be assessed.

**Lung Ultrasound**

A newer technique that is non-invasive and does not involve radiation exposure. It is most commonly used in intensive care units, emergency rooms, and operating rooms. It helps detect the accumulation of extravascular lung water (EVLW) ahead of the clinical manifestations.

**Pulmonary Artery Catheterization**

Often considered a gold standard in the determination of the etiology of pulmonary edema, it is an invasive test that helps monitor systemic vascular resistance, cardiac output, and filling pressures. An elevated pulmonary artery occlusion pressure over 18 mm Hg is helpful in the determination of cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

**Transpulmonary Thermodilution**

It is an invasive testing modality performed in patients typically undergoing major cardiac, vascular, or thoracic surgeries. They are also used in septic shock and monitors several hemodynamic indices such as cardiac index, mixed venous oxygen saturation, stroke volume index, and EVLW.
