Often underutilized, nails can offer an important clue in many clinical scenarios. Not only can they reveal a recent health history, but they can also act as a window to internal pathology. For instance, in the case of hypoxia, under-perfusion, iron-deficiency anemia, and endocarditis, the nails can display clubbing, delayed capillary refill, spooning, and splinter hemorrhages, respectively. Nail dystrophy can be the first sign of inflammatory diseases such as lichen planus and psoriasis.

The nails can be a site of aggressive conditions like melanoma. A histopathologic analysis is mandatory in the setting of suspicious melanoma. A helpful mnemonic that highlights clinical features associated with subungual melanoma is the ABCDEF rule, which stands for

- Age of 50 to 70 years old, Asian, African American, Native American

- Borders irregular, Brown or Black, Breadth over 3 mm

- Changing on own or not Changing with treatment

- Digit affected is most commonly the thumb, great toe, or index finger

- Extension to nail fold (Hutchinson sign)

- Family/personal history of melanoma or a dysplastic nevus

In addition to pigmented lesions, nail biopsies can help differentiate other similar-appearing entities, such as subungual verruca and subungual squamous cell carcinoma, as well as psoriasis and onychomycosis.

**Histopathologic Findings**

- **Spongiosis**: intercellular edema in the epidermis

- **Acantholysis**: loss of intercellular cohesion

- **Parakeratosis**: retention of nuclei in the stratum corneum

- **Hyperkeratosis**: thickened stratum corneum (orthokeratosis specifically defines a thickened stratum corneum without parakeratosis)

- **Hypergranulosis**: thickened stratum granulosum or presence of granular layer where it is normally absent

- **Hypogranulosis**: thinning or loss of stratum granulosum

- **Acanthosis**: thickened stratum spinosum

- **Exocytosis**: migration of cells (inflammatory or blood cells) into the epidermis

- **Papillomatosis**: the irregular fluctuation of epithelial surface overlying dermal papillae

- **Atrophy**: thinning of the dermis or epidermis

- **Pagetoid migration**: abnormal cells spreading upward in the epidermis

- **Koilocyte**: a suprabasal cell with a condensed nucleus and surrounding halo

**Diseases of the Nails and Associated Histopathologic Findings**

- **Subungual verruca**: Hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, papillomatosis, hypergranulosis, koilocytes

- **Subungual squamous cell carcinoma**: Mitotic figures, full-thickness keratinocyte atypia, parakeratosis, dermal invasion, koilocytes

- **Onychomycosis**: Hyphae, pseudohyphae, spores, neutrophil exocytosis, hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, spongiosis

- **Psoriasis**: Hypergranulosis in nail matrix and bed, hypogranulosis in hyponychium, neutrophil exocytosis (Munro microabscesses), hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, spongiosis

- **Lichen planus**: Hypergranulosis, acanthosis, dermal fibrosis, lymphocytic infiltrate in the papillary dermis, hyperkeratosis, necrotic keratinocytes (Civatte bodies), spongiosis

- **Melanocytic activation**: No increase in melanocyte density, increase in pigment

- **Lentigo**: Melanocytic proliferation, solitary melanocytes located in the basal or suprabasal layer, absent or mild cytologic atypia

- **Nevus**: Melanocytic proliferation, nests predominate over individual melanocytes

- **Melanoma**: Melanocytic proliferation with atypical melanocytes, isolated melanocytes predominate over nests, pagetoid migration, dermal invasion
