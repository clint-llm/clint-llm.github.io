The central concern during the clipping of the ACOM aneurysm is to safely clip the neck of the aneurysm following complete preservation and assuring patency of the recurrent artery of Heubner and other perforators. Intraoperatively, the surgeon can confirm this is the case with the visualization of the flow of the indocyanine green (ICG) dye within the recurrent artery of Heubner following permanent clipping of the aneurysm.

The blind areas can be visualized, and minimizing the inadvertent clipping or kinking of the recurrent artery of Heubner is possible with the newer armamentarium, such as intraoperative angiography, adjuvant usage of endoscopy and doppler vascular flow assessment. Vascular mapping is another option wherein the flow assessment within the perforators, as well as the parent and branching vessels, can be both visually and quantitatively analyzed, thereby safeguarding the risk of post-operative vasospasm. Moreover, this study can help dichotomize high-risk patients with decreased absorption intensity (AI) and increased time to appearance of the dye; for early initiation of anti-spasmodic therapy like "Triple-H" and calcium channel blockers.

During the initial retraction of the frontal lobe, the recurrent artery of Heubner is usually the first artery to be noted even before the A1 segment, since it courses anterior to the A1 in 60% of cases.
