The first test to evaluate for SVT is to obtain an ECG.

ECG characteristic includes a narrow complex, regular tachycardia with a rate of approximately 180 to 220 beats per minute. P waves are not detectable. If P waves are detectable, consider sinus tachycardia or atrial fibrillation or flutter as a potential etiology.

The remainder of the evaluation is focused on trying to isolate a cause of SVT, for example, electrolyte abnormalities, anemia, or hyperthyroidism. Consider checking a digoxin level of patients using that drug, as SVT can be secondary to supratherapeutic digoxin concentrations.
