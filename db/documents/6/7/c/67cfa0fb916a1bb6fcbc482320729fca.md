Victims of electrical injuries should be approached as both trauma and cardiac patients. All adult patients that have experienced an electrical injury should receive an electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac monitoring. Prolonged monitoring is warranted for any patient who presents with chest pain, abnormalities on ECG, the known transthoracic path of electrical injury, cardiac arrest, loss of consciousness, or known cardiac history. Most patients that have no significant injury or cardiac abnormalities on initial assessment are unlikely to develop any cardiac abnormalities after 24 to 48 hours.

In general, patients with a normal ECG who have experienced a low-voltage electrical injury, without any cardiac complaints or cardiac history, may be safely discharged home following a thorough physical examination. Similarly, children that experience a low-voltage, household current electrical exposure without any significant injury or pre-existing cardiac history may be discharged following a thorough physical examination.

Laboratory studies that should be considered in any patient that experiences an electrical injury include a complete blood count (CBC), a complete metabolic panel including assessment of electrolyte and creatinine levels, urinalysis, serum myoglobin (if urinalysis reveals myoglobinuria), and an arterial blood gas analysis if the patient presents with rhabdomyolysis or requires respiratory support. Creatine kinase (CK) levels should also be assessed, especially if rhabdomyolysis is suspected. Creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and troponin levels should be assessed as well if the path of electrical current is suspected to have traversed the chest, if the patient complains of chest pain, or if there is any abnormality noted on ECG such as arrhythmia or signs of ischemia.

Imaging studies may also be considered, depending on the type of injury and associated complaints. A chest radiograph is warranted for any patient that presents with cardiac or respiratory arrest, chest pain, shortness of breath, hypoxia, experienced fall or blunt trauma, or required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). A head computed tomography (CT) is warranted for any patient that presents with altered mental status, known trauma to the head, loss of consciousness, seizure, or any focal neurologic deficits. In addition to a head CT, these patients should be immobilized at the cervical spine, and imaging of the cervical spine may also be considered (may not be warranted in a patient with no focal neurologic deficits, no changes in mental status, or no significant injury).

It is important to note that the severity of an electrical injury is not related to the extent of external burns on an individualâ€™s body such that lack of an external burn does not predict the absence of electrical injury to internal tissues. Therefore, some patients may require additional CT or ultrasound imaging depending on the path of electrical current through the body to assess for any internal tissue injuries (imaging modality of choice depending on the tissue being examined).

Finally, high-voltage or prolonged low-voltage electrical exposure may result in tissue damage that necessitates fasciotomy. Surgical consultation should be obtained as soon as possible under such circumstances; as prompt fasciotomy may help avoid further complications like amputation.
