The original Friedewald equation is total cholesterol (TC) = HDL + LDL + Triglycerides( TG)/5, and it is comparable to the ultracentrifuge method of lipoprotein quantification. However, three conditions preclude the use of this equation, explain as follows:

- The first one is when there is chylomicron in the plasma. Chylomicrons contain triglycerides; thus, it can interfere with the formula for VLDL calculation, which is plasma TG divided by five. Fortunately, normal subjects do not have chylomicrons in their plasma. Furthermore, chylomicrons can be present in the plasma of patients that suffer type I (familial hyperchylomicronemia), type III (familial dysbetalipoproteinemia), and type V (combined hypertriglyceridemia).

- The second one is in type III familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). In this disorder, VLDL exists in two forms, which are the normal VLDL with the ratio of TG to cholesterol around five,  and the unique VLDL which the cholesterol's content is abnormally higher with beta mobility on electrophoresis. Therefore, in type III FH, the method of choice is either by centrifugal isolation of the VLDL, checking cholesterol electrophoresis' mobility, or by finding the TG/cholesterol ratio.

- Finally, when the plasma triglycerides concentration is higher than 400 mg/dL. Friedewald et al. noticed that when they incorporate type IV FH patient cholesterol values, they notice outlier values and the decreased correlation coefficient between ultracentrifuge and estimated cholesterol measurement. Subsequently, they found that some type IV FH patients had TG levels above 400 mg/dL. Consequently, after they excluded these patients' values, the correlation coefficient rose.

Therefore, a new estimation method is proposed by Martin et al. Their estimation is more accurate because it does not use fix ratio between TG and VLDL, but it incorporates adjustable factors for the ratios of triglyceride and VLDL. Consequently, when the LDL is very low, or the TG is very high, i.e.,>400 mg/dL, this new estimation gives more accurate results.
