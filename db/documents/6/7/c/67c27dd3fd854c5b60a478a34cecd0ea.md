CHS is a rare genetic disorder with a very high mortality rate. The disorder is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a geneticist, neurologist, ophthalmologist, infectious disease expert, hematologist, and laboratory specialist. The primary caregiver and the nurse practitioner should educate the caregiver on prevention of complications by encouraging hand washing, avoiding NSAIDs, remaining compliant with medications, and undergoing all the recommended immunizations.

Unfortunately, the disorder has no cure and more than 80% of patients are dead before the first decade of life. Survivors tend to have many physiological deficits and lead a poor quality of life.
