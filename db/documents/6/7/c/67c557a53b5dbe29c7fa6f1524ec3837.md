After the diagnosis of NKH has been made, most patients will benefit from evaluations by different specialists, including but not limited to a neurologist, a pulmonologist, a gastroenterologist, an orthopedic surgeon, and an ophthalmologist. Genetic counseling is essential in an effort also to help the families that have to take care of these patients. In the long run, for patients that survive, physical medicine and rehabilitation specialists should also be consulted to help with recovery from complications and, in particular physical disability, if any. Due to the need for multiple medical services, these patients will benefit from dedicated nursing teams and also social workers who can coordinate the care and alleviate some of the burden from parents and families.
