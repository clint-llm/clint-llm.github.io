Approximately 95% of RTT is the due to MECP2 mutations in the region of the gene methyl CpG-binding protein. Recent studies suggest MECP2 has both repressor and activator transcription activities. The exact mechanism of how MECP2 mutations lead to RTT is not yet known. A possible theory is that a deficiency of MECP2 causes an inability of synaptic maturation in the cortex. Another hypothesis is the lack of MECP2 disrupts the metabolism of brain cholesterol resulting in abnormal neuronal development. There have also been studies suggesting the failure of dendritic arborization in the cortex has led to abnormal neuronal signaling resulting inÂ the lack of maturation of the autonomic nervous system, along with the motor and cortical regions. Recent evidence suggests that MECP2 is also expressed in glial cells and glial cell dysfunction caused by a change in DNA methylation could also be involved in the pathogenesis of RTT.
