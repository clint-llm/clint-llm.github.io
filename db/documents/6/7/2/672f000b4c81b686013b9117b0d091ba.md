In saline prostheses, apart from the diminution in breast volume, few other symptoms can be identified. If exploration happens at a very early stage after deflation, the surgeon will notice a certain amount of clear fluid (saline from the implant) still present within the capsular pocket. If surgery is performed long after deflation, water in the capsular pocket will have diminished and only the deflated implant will likely be encountered within the capsule.

In the case of old silicone prostheses ruptures, silicone will be free inside the capsular pocket, and apartÂ from the inflammatory process in the thickened capsule, some free and encapsulated silicone (granuloma) can be found in the surrounding tissue.
