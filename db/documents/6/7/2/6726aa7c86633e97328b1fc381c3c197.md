Kohler disease is often misdiagnosed as osteomyelitis in children. However, basic labs (WBC, CRP, ESR) will help to differentiate between the two diagnoses. If a child has an elevated ESR or CRP, there should be a high index of suspicion for infection. Kohler disease will not have elevated inflammatory markers, and a pediatric patient should not have elevated inflammatory markers. If an infection is suspected, bone aspiration, bone biopsy, or blood cultures may be warranted.
