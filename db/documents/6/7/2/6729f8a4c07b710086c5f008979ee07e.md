The substantia nigra (SN) is a midbrain dopaminergic nucleus which has a critical role in modulating motor movement and reward functions as part of the basal ganglia circuitry. Projections from the SN to the putamen, called the nigrostriatal pathway, are critically involved in the motor deficits observed in Parkinson disease.
