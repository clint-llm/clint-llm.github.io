Naloxone, the antidote for an overdose of opiates, is a competitive mu-opioid–receptor antagonist that reverses all signs of opioid intoxication.  It can be given parenterally, intranasally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, or via an endotracheal tube.  The initial dose of naloxone for overdose is 0.04 mg (if given intravenously), which can be increased every 2 minutes to a maximum of 15 mg. The onset of action is generally less than 2 minutes when given intravenously. The duration of action is 20 to 90 minutes, which is shorter than the opiate effects, often rendering redosing or infusion necessary.
