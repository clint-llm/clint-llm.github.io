Throughout the past several decades, both multiple studies and clinical practice have demonstrated the cardiovascular effects of inhalation anesthetic agents. These anesthetics include the early agents of diethyl ether and nitrous oxide to the latest halogenated agents such as isoflurane, desflurane, and sevoflurane. The halogenated agents all have similar circulatory effects as seen in young, healthy volunteers during maintenance anesthesia.
