The best outcomes with Little League shoulder will occur when the treating clinician is working in close contact with a physical therapist who can confidently perform strengthening exercises for the rotator cuff and core muscles. An orthopedic nurse can also help coordinate care and activity between the team's various disciplines. The physical therapist should also be familiar with a throwing program. Parents and coaches should also be included in the treatment team for Little League shoulder as they have the power to ensure adequate rest for the athlete after an injury has occurred. Parents and coaches can also limit throwing to appropriate levels to mitigate the risk of developing primary or recurrent shoulder and other arm injuries. This sort of interprofessional healthcare team provides the best prognosis in recovery from Little League shoulder cases. [Level 5]
