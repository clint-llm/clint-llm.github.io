Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is an illness in which a person can present with acutely altered mentation, drowsiness or sometimes stupor, visual impairment (e.g., visual hallucinations, cortical blindness, hemianopia, quadrantanopia, and diplopia), seizures (focal or general tonic-clonic), and sudden or constant, non-localized headaches.
