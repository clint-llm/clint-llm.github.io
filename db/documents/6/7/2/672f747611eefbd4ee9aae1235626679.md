Central cord syndrome occurs most commonly in those who suffer a hyperextension injury. This usually happens with a forward fall while striking the chin and having the neck extend backward at the time of the fall. Older patients generally have underlying cervical spondylosis (stress defects). This leads to the posterior cord being either compressed or irritated by the posterior ligamentum flavum or anterior cord compression from underlying spondylosis. These two contusion-type injuries to the cord can lead to clinical symptoms secondary to edema of the cord at the site of injury. It could also lead to bleeding into the cord at the injury site, which understandably has a worse prognosis.

Usually, young patients often suffer from a higher velocity of trauma, leading to cervical spine subluxation or fracture that leads to the above-described compression, contusion, and bleeding.

The physical examination findings result from the compression of the spinothalamic and corticospinal tracts. The upper limb tracts are medial compared to the lower extremity, while sacral segments lie on the most lateral aspect. The central portion becomes more affected than the outer segments when compression occurs in the cervical cord due to external pressure.

First described by Schneider et al. based on medial somatotopy of the arms within the lateral corticospinal tract as described by Foerster.
