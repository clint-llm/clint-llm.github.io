Most patients with temporal bone fracture-associated facial paralysis will demonstrate recovery, often with synkinesis. Only patients who present with House-Brackmann grade VI paralysis are at risk for a final outcome of House-Brackmann grade VI paralysis, but even the majority of these patients improve to House-Brackmann grade III function or better.

Conversely, according to Brodie and Thompson, when paralysis develops in a delayed fashion, regardless of how severe it is or if the paralysis is incomplete (House-Brackmann grade II-V), the worst the final outcome will be is House-Brackmann grade II function

A systematic review published in 2010 by Nash et al. looked more specifically at rates of return to normal function: their patients requiring and undergoing surgery had a 23% chance of returning to House-Brackmann grade I (normal) function; patients not requiring surgery and receiving steroids only had a 67% chance of returning to House-Brackmann grade I function, and patients who were only observed had a 66% chance of returning to House-Brackmann grade I function.
