Like many other areas of the nervous system, the autonomic nervous system forms through the migration of neural crest cells. Migration occurs primarily in dorsolateral and ventromedial directions. The ventromedial migration forms the cells that will become the ANS. Growth factors are involved in this process to orchestrate the migration and growth of axons, and current belief is that these factors stimulate the release of neurotransmitters, which then stimulates the release of more growth factors.
