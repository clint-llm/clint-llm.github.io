At least seven different variety of classification criteria for AOSD are used in research. The Japanese standards termed the Yamaguchi criteria have the highest sensitivity amongst them

Total of five or more criteria including 2 or more significant criteria have a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 92% to classify a patient as having AOSD.

Major criteria are as follows:

- Fever of at least 39°C for at least one week

- Arthralgia or arthritis for at least two weeks.

- Nonpruritic salmon-colored rash on trunk/extremities.

- Granulocytic leukocytosis (10,000/microL or greater).

Minor criteria are as follows:

- A sore throat.

- Lymphadenopathy.

- Hepatomegaly or splenomegaly.

- Abnormal liver function tests.Negative tests for RF and ANA.

The lab findings discussed below are characteristic of AOSD, but not pathognomonic and hence their presence along with clinical manifestations will help the clinician in establishing the diagnosis after ruling out alternate causes.

Inflammatory markers, ESR and CRP are elevated in almost all the patients

Ferritin levels are generally higher than five times the upper limits of normal in patients with AOSD. Elevated ferritin suggests the presence of the disease with an 80% sensitivity and 46% specificity. If combined with a decrease in the proportion of glycosylated ferritin <20%, the specificity will rise to 93%.

Less than 10% of the patients have Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and rheumatoid factor (RF) but generally only in low titer.

The synovial fluid is usually inflammatory with a mean leukocyte range of 100 to 48,000 cells/microL

Radiographs early in the disease typically are either normal or show slight joint space narrowing or periarticular osteopenia. Narrowing of the wrist carpometacarpal and intercarpal joint spaces which may progress to bone ankylosis is a classic radiographic finding of adult-onset Still disease (AOSD)
