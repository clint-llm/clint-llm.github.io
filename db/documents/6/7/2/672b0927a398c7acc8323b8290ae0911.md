Certain findings fall outside the parameters of a normal physiologic pregnancy and require additional evaluation.

- Non-physiologic anemia: A hemoglobin level of less than 10 mg/dl is concerning and requires evaluation. Iron deficiency is common in pregnancy due to the increased iron demand. Iron deficiency is evidenced by new microcytosis or iron studies demonstrating low iron stores.

- Polycythaemia: Hemoglobin levels greater than 16 mg/dl should raise suspicion.

- Leukocytosis: An increase in neutrophils can occur in some cases, even in the absence of inflammatory conditions or infection. Further hematologic evaluation is necessary in case of a white blood cell (WBC) count greater than 20000/microL, marked lymphocytosis, or a differential showing immature myeloid forms.

- Leukopenia: An unexplained fall in the absolute neutrophil count below 1000/microL is concerning.

- Thrombocytopenia: Gestational thrombocytopenia is a common occurrence during pregnancy with platelet counts in the range of 80000Â to 149000/microL.

- Thrombocytosis: An increase in the platelet count of more than 500000/microL is unusual and requires investigation if unexplained.
