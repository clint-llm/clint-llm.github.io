Sensory innervation plays a key role in regulating tear production. Trigeminal nerve (V1) afferent neurons in the cornea and eyelids receive sensory inputs in response to temperature changes and noxious stimuli through mechanoreceptors, polymodal receptors, and cold receptors. In response, they activate autonomic and somatic reflexes, which include increased tear production and blinking.

The lacrimal and meibomian glands, responsible for producing the aqueous and lipid layer of the tear film, respectively, receive both sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation. Together, they form a neuronal circuit that regulates tear secretion. Parasympathetic activation in response to pain, irritation, and cold leads to increased aqueous and mucin production and tear production. Sympathetic inputs lead to increased secretion from conjunctival epithelial cells.
