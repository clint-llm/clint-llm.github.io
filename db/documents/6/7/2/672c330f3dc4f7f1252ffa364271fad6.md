Lamotrigine is best prescribed, administered, dispensed, and managed by an interprofessional healthcare team. This team includes all clinicians (physicians, specialists, and mid-level practitioners (i.e., PAs and NPs)), nursing staff, and pharmacists. The drug is often prescribed by the primary care provider/nurse practitioner, internist, neurologist, and pain specialist to treat several other disorders besides seizures. However, all prescribers should be aware of the United States Boxed Warning, which states that lamotrigine can cause serious rashes requiring hospitalization and discontinuation of this medication. Rash severity varies but includes a risk for Stevens-Johnson syndrome. It also bears mentioning that the discontinuation of lamotrigine may not prevent a rash from becoming life-threatening. Patient education should instruct the patient to continuously monitor for the outbreak for improvement after discontinuing the medication.

All interprofessional team members need to engage in open communication and patient data sharing so that everyone on the team is operating from the same accurate, up-to-date information. This interprofessional team approach will help yield optimal patient outcomes and reduce the potential for adverse events. [Level 5]
