LPS is a virulence factor, and based on its structure and function, is used to classify bacteria in serogroups. Thus, it serves as a pathogen-specific biomarker to aid in serological discrimination of Gram-negative bacteria. Timely identification and characterization of pathotypes are essential for the early mitigation and treatment of infections. Being the primary immune stimulator is in host cells, it serves as an early indicator of acute infection. Thus, LPS testing is more specific and meaningful than other serological assays. The present methods of LPS testing are quite sensitive, but many cannot differentiate between LPS serogroups. Also, the amphiphilic property of LPS projects a critical bottleneck to the sensitivity and ease of use of the assays.  The usual detection methods depend on lipid A antigen detection. However, LPS detection through lipid-A limits its ability to accurately identify a bacterial species because Lipid A is highly conserved among species and serotypes. The testing methods divide into six overlapping categories: in vivo and in vitro tests, modified immunoassays, biological assays, and chemical assays.

**Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate Assay**

It utilizes the property of amoebocytes from Limuluspolyphemus to agglutinate upon the addition of endotoxin through a protease cascade reaction. The detection method uses the lysates of amoebocytes. Hence it was called the Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) assay. LAL is the gold standard for the detection of lipid A. Nevertheless, this assay is subject to variability and inhibition through several chemical reactions. Variants of the LAL assay use chromogenic, turbidimetric, or viscometric methods to measure the degree of clotting. The sensitivity of this assay method depends on the sample type, processing method, time, and the dilution factor. The LAL assay is used in urine, cerebral spinal fluid, synovial fluid, ascites fluid, vaginal and cervical fluids, bronchoalveolar lavage samples, and even seawater.

**Biological and Chemical-based LPS Sensing**

These technologies use biosensors that are activated with proteins or molecules to pull down LPS from a sample. The natural carriers for LPS, such as LBP or serum carrier proteins such as HDL and LDL, as well as synthetic aptamers, peptides, and metal-cation complex, are used to bind and pull down LPS in these assay methods. Different types of signals serve to detect and enhance the readout of the LPS signal. Electrochemical (EC) sensing requires a recognition ligand and a transducer to measure the variation in signal. Fluorescence-based sensing needs a receptor that captures LPS, and another molecule emits a fluorescent signal upon binding to the antigen. Aptamers attached to gold nanoparticles have been used to detect LPS using EIS. This technique has an enhanced detection limit of 0.1 pg/mL. Aptamers are also being used in a magnetic aptasensor to detect LPS. The use of lipid complexes (liposomes) has also been useful as a testing mechanism. This method manipulated the amphipathic nature of LPS. These biosensors provide high sensitivity, up to picogram or femtomolar range. However, these assays are incapable of discriminating between LPS serogroups.

**Immunoassays for LPS Detection and Antibody Selection**

Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent assays (ELISA), based on the reaction between antigen and antibody, have been used to test LPS. However, the amphipathic nature of LPS leads to inconsistent binding on ELISA plates and variable conformations of epitope binding sites. This inconsistency resulted in low sensitivity and reproducibility of ELISA for LPS. There are two basic types of LPS-ELISAs, one which detects LPS antigen, and the other detects LPS antibody titers. An enhanced sandwich ELISA form that minimizes the low sensitivity and reproducibility associated with LPS-ELISA was developed and commercialized as ENDOLisa. It has a sensitivity between 0.05 and 500 EU/mL.

The second type of ELISA format is designed to detect antibodies against LPS. The plate surface is coated with the antigen to pull down antibodies such as IgA, IgG, etc., from serum. This method has its basis in testing the adaptive immune responses; hence it cannot be utilized to check the initial exposure to the pathogen. This type of ELISA format is useful to test population health risks and monitor epidemiology. The major drawback of LPS detection is that many LPS antigens have not been isolated yet. Thus screening methods are only present for the strains for which antigens are available. Alternative methods for antibody screening utilized immunoblotting and flow cytometry. Methods of LPS testing with the above techniques are affected by endogenous endotoxins present on glassware, plastics, or reagents, potentially contributing to false-positive results.

In addition to medical diagnostics, LPS detection also provides a method for detecting Escherichia coli in the food industry, an organism often associated with food-borne illnesses. The successful detection methods for LPS couple sensitive detection platforms with surfaces designed to maximize the binding of amphiphilic PAMPs. Monitoring LPS levels in pharmaceutical products and medical devices is done using LAL assays.
