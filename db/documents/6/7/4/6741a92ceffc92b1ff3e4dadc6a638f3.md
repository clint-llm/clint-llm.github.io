The brachial plexus is the complex arrangement of nerves originating from the ventral roots of four cervical and one thoracic spinal nerve (C5-T1). The brachial plexus innervates numerous muscles and cutaneous regions of the upper limb, thorax, and back. The five ventral rami, or roots of the brachial plexus, rearrange into a superior, middle, and inferior trunk. In turn, these trunks form six divisions (three anterior and three posterior), which are continuous with a medial, posterior, and lateral cord. Along the course of the brachial plexus, 18 nerves arise, including five terminal branches. The musculocutaneous nerve (C5-7) is a terminal branch of the lateral cord. The musculocutaneous nerve innervates the three muscles of the anterior compartment of the arm: the coracobrachialis, biceps brachii, and brachialis muscles. It is also responsible for cutaneous innervation of the lateral forearm.

**Gross Anatomy and Course**

The musculocutaneous nerve may be the most identifiable nerve of the brachial plexus. When viewing the axilla, the musculocutaneous nerve can be seen arising from the lateral cord, at the inferior border of the pectoralis major muscle, and piercing directly into the deep surface of the coracobrachialis muscle. The nerve enters the coracobrachialis an average of 5.6 cm from the muscle’s origination on the coracoid process of the scapula.

Throughout this portion of the arm, the nerve is found deep to the biceps brachii and superficial to the brachialis, and it gives off motor branches to these muscles along the way. Using the acromion process as the origin, the motor nerve branch points for the biceps brachii and brachialis were found to occur at an average distance of 13.0 cm and 17.5 cm along the course of the musculocutaneous nerve, respectively.

The lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm pierces the deep fascia superficially to gain access to the subcutaneous compartment. This terminal cutaneous branch of the musculocutaneous nerve gives off a volar and dorsal branch to supply the skin of the lateral forearm. Cutaneous innervation of the medial forearm is supplied by the medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm (roots C8-T1), a direct branch of the medial cord. The posterior forearm receives cutaneous innervation from the posterior cutaneous nerve of the forearm (roots C7-C8), a branch of the radial nerve.
