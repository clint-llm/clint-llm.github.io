Gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) has a variety of causes. Often, emergency medicine or primary care providers are the first to encounter patients and suspect GOO. A thorough workup to determine the cause of the obstruction must be performed that may include a CT scan and endoscopy. The gastroenterology team should be involved in care. If endoscopic treatments are unsuccessful or the etiology of the obstruction is not amenable to treatment by non-invasive strategies, the surgical team should be consulted for intervention. Emergency department, gastroenterology, and operating room nurses assist in the care of patients and keep managing providers informed of patient status.
