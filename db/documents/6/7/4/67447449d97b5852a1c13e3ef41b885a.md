The mental nerve block is particularly useful in lacerations of the skin of the lower lip or chin, avoiding injecting in the injured site that may bring complications such as edema and distortion of the soft tissues

The technique can also be applied to dermatologic surgery. For example, it remains an alternative to sedation in elderly patients or with multiple comorbidities when performing Mohs micrographic surgery

Dentists use the mental/incisive nerve block either alone or in addition to an inferior alveolar nerve block
