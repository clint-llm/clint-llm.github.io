Plica syndrome can be diagnosed and managed without consultation to a sports medicine physician or orthopedic surgeon as long as the managing clinician is practicing within his or her expertise and is confident he or she is making the correct diagnosis. This clinician can begin conservative management with home stretching and strengthening and/or formal physical therapy. If the patient does not improve after 3 months of conservative measures, an intraplical corticosteroid injection is a reasonable next step treatment option. If there is no improvement at this point and the patient would consider surgery, the patient should be referred to an orthopedic surgeon.
