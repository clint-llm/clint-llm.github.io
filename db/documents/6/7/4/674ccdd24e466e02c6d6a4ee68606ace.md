The cubital fossa contains four main vertical structures from lateral to medial.

- The**radial nerve**is not always strictly considered part of the cubital fossa, but is in the vicinity, passing underneath the brachioradialis muscle. As is does so, the radial nerve divides into its deep and superficial branches.

- **Biceps tendon**Iruns through the cubital fossa, attaching to the radial tuberosity, just distal to the neck of the radius.

- Brachial artery suppliesÂ oxygenated blood the forearm. It bifurcates into the radial and ulnar arteries at the apex of the cubital fossa.

- **Median nerve**leaves the cubital between the two heads of the pronator teres. It supplies the majority of the flexor muscles in the forearm.
