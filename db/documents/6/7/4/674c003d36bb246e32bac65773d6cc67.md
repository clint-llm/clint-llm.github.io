During neurulation, the neural tube closes, and three dilations develop on the cephalic end of the neural tube. These dilations include the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon which collectively make up the embryonic brain vesicles. Within the evolving vesicles there remains a lumen that later will become the ventricular system of the brain. The cavity of the mesencephalon narrows forming the cerebral aqueduct. As the fetus develops the aqueduct lumen decreases in size and continues to contract up until ten weeks after birth.Â Both neuroepithelial and non-neuroepithelial cells secrete embryonic CSF which helps maintain constant intraluminal pressure to help keep the ventricles open. The embryonic CSF is rich in proteins and growth factors which further support the proliferation and differentiation of the ventricles.
