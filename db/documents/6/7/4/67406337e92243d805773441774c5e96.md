Astrocytes derive their name from their radially-arranged foot processes that give them a star-like appearance. These foot processes, which are marked by a protein known as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), allow astrocytes to communicate with and affect surrounding neural vasculature. Astrocytes also couple with each other through gap junctions, forming a network that coordinates their responses to stress and other stimuli.

Interlaminar astrocytes, which are unique to humans and other primates, possess radial tangential fibers and vertical “cable-like” processes.

Protoplasmic astrocytes make up the majority of astrocytes. They are large astrocytes with a high density of tortuous, bulbous GFAP-positive processes that branch into smaller, finer processes.

In contrast to the protoplasmic astroglia, fibrous astroglia reside around white matter tracts.

The last major astrocyte phenotype in the human CNS is the varicose projection astroglia. These astrocytes occupy cortical layers V and VI and, like interlaminar astrocytes, have long foot processes that may connect with cells in other cortical layers.
