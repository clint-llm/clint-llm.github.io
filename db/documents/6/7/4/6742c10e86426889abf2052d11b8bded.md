Overall, Nocardia is a ubiquitous bacteria that can result in many forms of infection. Infection is more likely in immunocompromised individuals, especially the pulmonary and CNS forms of nocardiosis. Patient's diagnosed with HIV should be aware of the various presentations of Nocardia. TMP-SMX prophylaxis can be given for individuals that are at increased risk for nocardial infection, although there are many strains that are resistant to TMP-SMX as a single agent.

While immunocompromised individuals are at greatest risk, immunocompetent individuals are also at risk for infection, particularly the cutaneous form of the infection. The main etiology of infection in these patients is due to a skin lesion that was contaminated with organic matter or soil.  Therefore, a key way to lower the risk of cutaneous nocardiosis is to wear closed shoes and gloves when working in hazardous areas (construction sites, gardens, etc.). If a skin lesion is sustained, it is important to clean the wound thoroughly. If the area becomes red, swollen, and warm or if there is purulent drainage, a primary care clinician should be consulted.

In general, Nocardia infections are very rare but should be considered if the workup is negative for other common causes of the presenting symptoms.
