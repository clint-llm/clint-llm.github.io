Most of the patients with low back pain improve quickly. The difficulty, however, is that in some, the pain becomes chronic and persistent. A systematic review, which included 4994 patients from 24 studies, showed that patients with acute pain made good progress. The pain score on a scale of 0 to 100 was 52 at baseline. It decreased to 23 at six weeks, 12 at 26 weeks, and 6 at 52 weeks. However, the cohorts with persistent pain decreased only to 23 at 52 weeks.
