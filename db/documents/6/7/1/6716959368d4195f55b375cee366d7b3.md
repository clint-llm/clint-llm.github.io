Although biopsy provides a definitive diagnosis, toxoplasmosis can be diagnosed based on non-invasive testing, including labs and imaging.

- Serological testing - This is the primary diagnostic method to determine infection with Toxoplasma by identifying IgM and IgG antibodies. IgM antibodies are usually detectable from day 5 following infection, reaching maximum levels in 1 to 2 months. IgG antibodies are detectable after 1 to 2 weeks of infection, reaching maximum levels in 3 to 6 months. Toxoplasma IgM antibody testing lacks specificity; thus, serologies can be difficult to interpret.

- Molecular testing - T. gondii DNA can be detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in blood and other bodily fluids.

- Radiological diagnosis - Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings show multiple hypodense areas with ring-enhancing lesions in the brain. Minimal inflammatory changes seen during the early stages may not be appreciated well on CT; thus, MRI is preferred over CT for diagnosing brain lesions in cerebral toxoplasmosis. Single-photon emission CT or positron emission tomography (PET) scans have high specificity to rule out differential diagnoses.

- Biopsy - Although this provides a definitive diagnosis by demonstrating tachyzoites and tissue cysts of T. gondii, this is not usually performed. A biopsy is indicated to rule out other differential diagnoses in individuals failing to show clinical or radiological improvement of symptoms within 14 days of starting the therapy.
