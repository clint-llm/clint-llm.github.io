While contemporary Western surgical and medicinal knowledge is part of every practicing osteopathic physician (DO) in the United States, the current MD programs in the country refuse to incorporate the additional tool of OMT within their curriculum. With the 2020 merge of postgraduate medical education for both MDs and DOs, it is clear to us that the only difference between their overall education lies within the acceptance and refusal of OMT.

As discussed in our review, OMT works as a less risky form of treatment that may be supplemented to the traditional medicine and surgery practiced by all physicians (both MDs and DOs); therefore, it is the responsibility of osteopaths to work towards achieving osteopathic recognition for ACGME-accredited residencies of all specialties across the country. This approach will allow for the MDs to learn some of the basic OMT procedures that the DOs have traditionally learned in their OMT classes during medical school, allowing both kinds of physicians to practice traditional medicine with a helpful tool by their side.
