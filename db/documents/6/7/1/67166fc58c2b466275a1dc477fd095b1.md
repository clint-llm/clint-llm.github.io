A provider should always consider other STIs when a patient presents with complaints concerning for trichomoniasis or coinfection when a patient is diagnosed with trichomoniasis. If a female patient presents with complaints and concerns of an STI, the practitioner should always consider pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in their differential diagnosis. PID has significant morbidity implications, including reduced fertility. Trichomonas is not known to cause pelvic inflammatory disease, so if there is concern for PID, there is a different treatment regimen.
