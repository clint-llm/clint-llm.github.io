Pre-procedure planning:

- Assessing theÂ nutritional status before surgery by obtaining an albumin level should be performed. Malnourished patients require preoperative supplements or parenteral nutrition to optimize wound healing postoperatively.

- An ostomy nurse should also meet with the patient prior to the procedure to review the possibility of a stoma and mark the possible site of an ostomy if there is a possibility of one being required.

Patient preparation:

- General anesthesia is utilized. The patient is positioned in the supine position, with care taken to ensure that all pressure points are well padded.
