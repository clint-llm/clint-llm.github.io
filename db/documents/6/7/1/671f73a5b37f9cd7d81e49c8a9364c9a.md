In a systematic review of causes of a sudden and severe headache (thunderclap headache), the authors, Devenney, Neale, and Forbes, conclude, “There are over 100 different published causes of sudden and severe headache, other than aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.”

The 2 most common causes of secondary TCH are subarachnoid hemorrhage and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS).

Other causes include the following:

- Intracerebral hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, cervical artery dissection

- Ischemic stroke, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVT)

- Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH), acute hypertensive crisis

- Intracranial infection, complicated sinusitis

- Intracranial tumor, third ventricle colloid cyst, pituitary apoplexy

- Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)
