The femoral nerve innervates the sartorius, pectineus, quadriceps femoris, and iliacus muscle of the iliopsoas. It receives nerve supply from the nerve roots L2-L4, innervating both the hip flexor and quadriceps muscle groups. The femoral nerve is also responsible for anterior thigh and medial leg sensation. The motor division of the femoral nerve is further divided into anterior and posterior divisions.

The anterior motor division innervates the: sartorius, pectineus (sometimes the obturator nerve also provides additional innervation), iliacus (from the muscular branches of the femoral nerve L1 through L3)

The posterior motor division innervates the quadriceps femoris muscle group (vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius, and rectus femoris).
