The foramen ovale is a tunnel-like space between the overlying septum secundum and septum primum. It closes in 75% of infants when the septum primum and secundum fuse. In utero, the foramen ovale is necessary for the flow of blood across the fetal atrial septum. Oxygenated blood from the placenta returns to the inferior vena cava, crosses the foramen ovale, and enters the systemic circulation. In approximately 25% of people, a PFO persists into adulthood. PFOs may be found in association with:

- Atrial septal aneurysms (a redundancy of the interatrial septum)

- Eustachian valves (a remnant of the sinus venosus valve)

- Chiari networks (filamentous strands in the right atrium)

Clinically significant PFOs results in adverse consequence by two mechanisms:

- Serving as a conduit for paradoxical embolization from the venous side to the systemic circulation

- Because of their tunnel-like structure and propensity for the stagnant flow may serve as a nidus for in situ thrombus formation.
