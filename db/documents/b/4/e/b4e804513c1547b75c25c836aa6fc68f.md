Hydrops fetalis is a condition in the fetus characterized by the abnormal interstitial fluid collection in two or more compartments of the fetal body (peritoneal cavity, pleura, and pericardium). An alternative definition discusses liquid accumulation in two fetal anatomical areas or effusion in one site and anasarca.

Traditionally, the diagnosis was made after the delivery of a massively edematous neonate that was often stillborn. With sonography, hydrops fetalis has become a prenatal diagnosis. With condition progression, edema is invariably a component, often accompanied by placentomegaly and hydramnios. Hydrops fetalis may result from a wide range of conditions with varying pathophysiologies, each with the potential to severely affect the fetus. It is divided into two categories, namely immune and non-immune. If found in association with red cell alloimmunization, it is termed immune hydrops fetalis. Otherwise, it is called non-immune hydrops fetalis. Immune hydrops or erythroblastosis fetalis results from antibodies in the maternal circulation that pass through the placenta and react with the fetal antigens, resulting in fetal hemolysis. Non-immune hydrops result from causes other than antigen-antibody reactions.

Hydrops fetalis is not a consequence of heart failure but rather hypervolemia and the high vascular permeability of fetuses. In contrast, heart failure is a very late consequence of a long-standing overworked heart.
