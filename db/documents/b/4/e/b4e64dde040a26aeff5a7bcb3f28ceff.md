Pregnancy is the most challenging immunological encounter because a genetically different fetus needs to be supported within the pregnant uterus. The maternal-fetal interface is a highly specialized tissue that nourishes the fetus and protects it from immune-mediated injury. This activity reviews the immunologic properties at the maternal-fetal interface. It highlights the role of the interprofessional team in understanding the immunology at the maternal-fetal interface while managing a pregnant woman.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the process of decidualization and placentation.
- Review the leukocyte profile at the maternal-fetal interface.
- Summarize the placental immune defense.
- Outline the clinical significance of understanding the immunology at the maternal-fetal interface.
