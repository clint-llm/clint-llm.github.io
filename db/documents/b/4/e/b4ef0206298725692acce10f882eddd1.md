Histologically carcinoid tumors of the lung are similar to those found in the intestine. They appear as nests and cords of small, round, uniform cells. Atypical carcinoids differ in that they tend to be more aggressive, as evidence by an increased number of mitoses and more pleomorphism.Â  Atypical BCTs have a greater tendency to invade nearby lymphatics. Statistics show that 90% of BCTs are well-differentiated compared to 10% of atypical cases, which have more pleomorphism.
