**Arterial Supply**

Mammary glands are extremely vascular organs. The main arterial supply of the mammary glands is by the following five arteries on each side.

- Perforating branches of the **Internal thoracic artery**coming from the second to the sixth intercostal spaces.

- 
**Lateral thoracic artery**

- 
**Superior thoracic artery**

- 
**Acromio-thoracic artery**

- Lateral branches of **posterior intercostal artery**

Among the above arteries, the lateral thoracic, the superior thoracic, and the acromiothoracic arteries are the branches coming directly from the axillary artery.

**Venous Drainage**

Veins that drain the mammary glands follow the arteries in their course and adopt their names.

These veins form an anastomotic venous circle around the nipple, which divides into superficial and deep sets.

- Superficial veins drain into **internal thoracic and superficial veins of the lower neck.**

- Deep veins drain into **internal thoracic, axillary, and posterior intercostal veins.**

****Importance:****Carcinoma of the breast may spread through deep veins into the Batson plexus of veins that are around the vertebral column. These veins are valveless, allowing a bidirectional flow of venous blood and communicate with the internal vertebral plexus of the veins. Thus metastasis of the breast's carcinoma can quickly spread to the vertebral column and, in turn, to the spinal cord**.**

**Lymphatic Drainage**

**Principal lymph nodes:**The primary site of lymphatic drainage of the breast is to the following group of lymph nodes.

- **Axillary nodes:**The axillary group of lymph nodes classifies into the following five groups. They are present in the axillary pad of fat.
- **Anterior (Pectoral) group:**This group of lymph nodes lies on the lower border of pectoralis minor along the lateral thoracic vessels and drains outer quadrants of the breast.
- **Posterior (subscapular) group:**This group lies on the axilla's posterior wall along the lower border of the subscapularis. It drains the lower outer quadrant of the breast.
- **Lateral group:**This group of lymph nodes lies over the axilla's lateral wall beside the humerus and drains a minimal quantity of lymph from the breast.
- **Central group:**This group lies in the base of the axilla and receives lymph from the anterior, posterior, and lateral groups of lymph nodes
- **Apical groups:**This group of lymph nodes lies deep in the axilla's apex and receives lymph from all the above groups of lymph nodes. It also directly drains the upper medial quadrant of the breast.

- **Internal mammary (parasternal) nodes:**These groups of lymph nodes are beside the sternum's lateral border surrounding the internal mammary artery and drain the medial quadrants of the breast. Some cross to the other side and drain to the opposite group of parasternal nodes; this is precisely the route by which metastasis from one breast (ipsilateral) spreads to the other side and becomes bilateral.

The axillary group of lymph nodes is the primary group of lymph nodes that drain the lymph from the breasts. The axillary group drains almost 75% to 80% of lymph from breasts. Among these, the anterior group is the leading site of drainage. The internal mammary group drains the remaining 20 to 25% of lymph from the breasts.

**Other lymph nodes:**The other locations where the breast drains a small amount of lymph are as follows.

- Supraclavicular nodes

- Cephalic (deltopectoral) nodes

- Posterior intercostal nodes

- Subdiaphragmatic & subperitoneal lymph plexuses: This is the route by which the metastasis from the breast spreads to the abdomen.

**Clinical Importance**: Usually, malignancy of the breast metastasizes through the lymphatics, and hence the surgeons need to have complete knowledge of the lymphatic drainage of the mammary gland; this will allow the appropriate removal of lymph nodes during surgical removal of malignant tumors from the breast in case of a radical mastectomy.
