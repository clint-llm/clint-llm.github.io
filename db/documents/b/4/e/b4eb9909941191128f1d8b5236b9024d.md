Prognosis beyond the initial toxicity depends upon the magnitude of ingestion, the severity of toxidrome, and the extent of organ dysfunction.

Poor prognostic factors include

- Advanced age

- Preexisting impairment of cardiac function

- Multi-organ failure

- Refractory shock requiring salvage measures like extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)
