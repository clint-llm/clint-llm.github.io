Naloxone, a semisynthetic opioid antagonist, is indicated for the complete or partial reversal of life-threatening CNS/respiratory depression induced by opioids. Depending on the dose, naloxone administration to a physically dependent patient on opioids will cause an abrupt return of pain and can precipitate abstinence (withdrawal) syndrome, with symptoms ranging from mild anxiety, irritability, and muscle aches to life-threatening tachycardia and hypertension.
