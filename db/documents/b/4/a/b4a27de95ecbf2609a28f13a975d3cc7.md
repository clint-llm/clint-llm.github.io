Allergic reactions and bleeding are common adverse events related to streptokinase. The GISSI study demonstrated a 3.4% incidence of minor bleeding. The ISSI-2 study demonstrates a 0.4% incidence of significant bleeding. Patients may experience transient bradycardia or hypotension, with an incidence of 10%. Streptokinase is derived from bacterial proteins and thus can result in allergic reactions. Allergic reactions have been noted in up to 4.4% of patients and may present with fever, shivering, or rash. In rare cases, anaphylaxis may occur, which appears to be IgE mediated. Patients who develop anaphylactic signs and symptoms should promptly discontinue treatment and receive epinephrine.
