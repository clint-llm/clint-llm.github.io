The exact pathogenesis is unknown, but most studies hypothesized that gadolinium might dissociate from its chelate and become free Gd.

In patients with advanced kidney disease, the injected GBCA remains for more hours than those with normal renal function. Gadolinium is more likely to dissociate from its chelate when the less stable GBCAs are used.

**Various Hypotheses with Regards to Underlying Pathogenic Mechanisms**

For historical reasons, it is important to include the following discussion as the understanding of NSF has changed a great deal.

- McNeill and Barr

- Mackay-Wiggan et al

- Jiménez et al and Ortonne et al - In 2004, the histopathology of NSF was studied and it was found that the fibrotic process of NSF was not limited to the dermis. Instead, it extended to the subcutaneous tissues, fascia, skeletal muscles, lungs, and myocardium. The skin was observed to contain huge numbers of CD68/factor 13a dendritic cells and an abundance of transforming growth factor-beta1.

- Kucher et al - Nine biopsy specimens of NSF and seven biopsy specimens of scleromyxedema were studied. Immunohistochemical staining was similar for both conditions in terms of CD34, factor 13a, CD31, CD68, smooth muscle actin, and colloidal iron. Procollagen-1 was increasingly expressed in scleromyxedema.
