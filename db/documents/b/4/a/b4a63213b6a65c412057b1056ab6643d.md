Any surgery near the radial nerve holds a potential risk for an injury that will cause adverse downstream effects.

The brachial plexus injury with radial nerve involvement can occur with the use of sternal retraction after sternotomy, particularly with internal mammary dissection during cardiac surgery.

Damage to the superficial radial nerve is a potential complication of surgery for de Quervain tendinopathy.

There is a theoretical risk of radial nerve injury with hyperextension of the elbow, and the forearm should be placed in a slightly flexed position during anesthesia.
