- Adductor strain is a common cause of groin injury and pain among athletes.

- Risk factors include previous hip or groin injury, age, weak adductors, muscle fatigue, decreased range of motion, and inadequate stretching of the adductor muscle complex.

- Most injuries can be managed conservatively by their primary care provider with rest, ice, physical therapy, and a graded return to play.

- Refractory patients can be referred to an orthopedic or sports medicine clinician for further treatment and evaluation after non-musculoskeletal causes have been evaluated.
