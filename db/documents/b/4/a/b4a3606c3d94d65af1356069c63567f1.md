A diagnostic approach to fever or hyperthermia includes the following:

**Diagnostic Testing**

- ESR and CRP

- Procalcitonin-elevated in certain bacterial infections

- Tuberculin skin test

- HIV

- Serum LDH

- Routine blood cultures

- RF, ANA, heterophile antibody in children and young adults

- CPK

- Serum protein electrophoresis

- Imaging studies based on history

- CNS signs should prompt lumbar puncture

- Patients with a travel history to malaria-endemic regions should be tested with thick and thin peripheral smears.

- Rule out thrombophlebitis and infective endocarditis in IV drug abuse

Several other specific tests can be performed based on the history and physical exam findings in patients of varying age groups. A detailed history and thorough physical examination of all body systems can help narrow the list of differential diagnoses.
