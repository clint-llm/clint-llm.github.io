Patients will need to understand their condition and its imposed limitations based on the severity of their particular case. The clinician should review the relevant anatomy and explain the disruption, using spinal models if necessary. A review of the patient's activities and physical demands is prudent (e.g., heavy lifting, prolonged sitting, etc.). Based on the severity of the condition, the clinician may impose physical limitations.
