The buccal nerve is the only sensory branch of the anterior mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve. It innervates the major part of the buccal mucosa, the inferior buccal gingiva in the molar area, and the skin above the anterior part of the buccinator muscle. The buccal nerve divides into superficial and deep branches. The superficial branches end in the skin of the cheek, and the deep branches have their distribution in the buccal mucosa of the molar area.
