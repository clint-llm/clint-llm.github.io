Upadacitinib exerts its mechanism of action by inhibiting intracellular cytoplasmic enzymes Janus kinases (JAK), a group of four tyrosine kinases(JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2) involved in the process of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs).

JAKS function by phosphorylating signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), regulating gene expression, and influencing hematopoiesis and immune cell function.
