Studies have demonstrated the involvement of GPi in different disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD), Touretteâ€™s syndrome, acquired dystonia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Alterations in the resting-state functional connectivity of the cortico-striatal circuits have been implicated in OCD. Indeed, recent studies have noted increased resting-state functional connectivity between the left GPe and the left STN. This increased connectivity was also present between the left GPe and the left GPi. The involvement of these structures in the pathophysiology provides evidence for success in DBS targeted at GPi.

The GP also has implications for parkinsonian motor symptoms. Studies have elucidated that dopamine depletion leads to excessive stimulation (increase in the firing rate) of the GPi neurons causing parkinsonian motor symptoms, as evidenced by increased activity of GPi in PD.

Unlike the putamen and caudate, the GP is spared from ischemic injury after a hypoxic-ischemic insult. There are also case reports of bilateral GP lesions following alcohol and opiate abuse.
