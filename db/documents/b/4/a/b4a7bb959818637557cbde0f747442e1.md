The primary differential diagnosis, when considering congenital pulmonary airway malformation, is bronchopulmonary sequestration (BPS). BPS can also be present on prenatal ultrasound and usually appears as a well-defined, solid, and homogenous mass. The main difference between BPS and CPAM is that BPS has no connection to the tracheobronchial tree and receives its blood supply from the systemic circulation via an anomalous systemic artery rather than the pulmonary circulation, as in CPAM. Other diagnoses to consider when diagnosing CPAM are a congenital diaphragmatic hernia, bronchogenic cyst, congenital lobar emphysema, and pneumatoceles.
