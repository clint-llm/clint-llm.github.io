There are several clinical indications for accessing the buccal fat pad. It may be utilized for closing oroantral communications. Oroantral communication is communication between the maxillary sinus and the oral cavity. It may occur during the extraction of maxillary premolars and molars; it may also occur secondary to dental infections, radiation therapy, osteomyelitis, or trauma.

An OAC of 2 millimeters or less will usually close spontaneously; however, if the defect is greater than 3 to 4 mm, the surgical closure of the defect is indicated. Accessing and advancing the buccal fat pad is a means of closing an oroantral communication. Though perhaps the most recent interest in the buccal fat pad is utilization to reshape the facial contours providing a more aesthetic facial architecture.

The ideal aesthetic surgical candidate for buccal fat pad removal has prominent zygomatic or cheekbones that are masked due to pronounced cheeks. These patients lack an angular appearance to the face; buccal fat pad removal will reduce cheek fullness and highlight their pronounced zygomatic bone. Malar hypoplasia is not an indication for buccal fat pad removal. Buccal fat pad removal in these patients will result in a hollowed appearance of their cheeks. For this reason, it is important to understand that buccal fat pad removal is not a substitute for malar augmentation.
