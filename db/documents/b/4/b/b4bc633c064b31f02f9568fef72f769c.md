The significant clinical symptoms of KBS are produced by the destruction of either the temporal neocortex or the amygdala bilaterally. The full syndrome is rarely seen in humans because the anterior temporal lobe dysfunction is usually less severe in humans when compared to that following total temporal lobe resection in monkeys.

The exact anatomical basis of KBS is still controversial. KBS is thought to occur due to the disturbances in the temporal portions of limbic networks that connect with multiple cortical and subcortical circuits to modulate emotional behavior and affect.

**Theories Regarding the Etiology**

- Norman Geschwind's theory: Interruption of visual input to limbic circuit leading to disconnection syndrome produces KBS.

- Muller theory: Disconnection of the pathways connecting the dorsomedial thalamus with the prefrontal cortex and other limbic areas leads to KBS. These pathways are essential for memory and emotional regulation.

**The Origin of Various Symptoms**

- Rage is produced by the involvement of the ventromedian nucleus of the thalamus and amygdala.

- A permanent "hypersexed state," is produced by discrete bilateral lesions of the lateral amygdaloid nucleus. Temporal lobe seizures may produce a transient state.

- Visual agnosia results from bilateral ventral temporal ablations and temporal lobectomies.
