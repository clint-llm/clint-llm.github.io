The development of the female reproductive system requires an elaborate process. In females, reproductive organs divide into three main groups: gonads, reproductive ducts, and external genitalia. The female reproductive system derives from four origins: mesoderm, primordial germ cells, coelomic epithelium, and mesenchyme. The uterus forms during Mullerian organogenesis accompanied by the development of the upper third of the vagina, the cervix, and both fallopian tubes.
