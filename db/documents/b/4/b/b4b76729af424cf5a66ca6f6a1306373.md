There is no specific treatment for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and supportive care is emphasized. To date, no antiviral agents have been found to be beneficial, nor were glucocorticoids shown to have a beneficial effect.

Once suspected of SARS, the patient needs to be quickly identified and placed in isolation with appropriate infection control measures in place to avoid transmission. Triage using a set of clinical criteria and epidemiologic criteria should be in place to allow the rapid identification of suspected patients. Infection control precautions include contact precautions (gloves, gowns, and eye protection), droplet precautions (additionally a private room and limit movements), as well as airborne precautions (N-95 respirators and negative pressure isolation room).
