The diagnosis and management of CIDP are complex, requiring an interprofessional inpatient and outpatient team that includes a general neurologist, neuromuscular specialist, intensivist, physical and rehabilitation specialist, pain management specialist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, psychiatrist, social workers, and case management staff. Aggressive immunomodulatory therapy combined with physical neurorehabilitation is essential for a long-term favorable outcome. Some barriers that may hinder clinical improvement include social determinants of health, pain control, and aggressive clinical variants. An interprofessional team approach will result in the best outcomes.
