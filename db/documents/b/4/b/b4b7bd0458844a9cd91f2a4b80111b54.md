Appropriate management of neurilemmomas requires a cooperative effort of the interdisciplinary healthcare team. Any mass of unknown etiology should be evaluated by an appropriate healthcare professional. First-line providers should have a basic knowledge of benign nerve sheath tumors to order appropriate testing and help patients choose the best course of management. Referral to specialists such as neurologists and surgeons as appropriate will also be critical for the appropriate monitoring of tumors and guiding the patient towards an optimal outcome.

As always, the cooperation of the entire medical team is critical. Nurses and office staff must be comfortable in their working environment to provide the best possible care, and communication is key to enacting the agreed-upon plan of management. Furthermore, if surgical intervention is required, operating room nurses and staff must be familiar with standard surgical procedures and comfortable with executing the operative plan. [Level 5]
