Selenium deficiency affects anywhere from 500 million to 1 billion people worldwide, due to inadequate intake. In the United States, selenium content in the soil and consequently plant sources is lowest in the Northwest, Northeast, Southeast, and areas of the Midwest abutting the Great Lakes. The Great Plains and the Southwest have adequate selenium content typically.

Of note, patients with phenylketonuria or other diet-related diseases are especially vulnerable to selenium deficiency due to their diet being restricted from many products rich in this element.

Selenium content in most parts of Europe is considerably poorer than in the United States. The average intake of selenium in Eastern Europe is lower than in Western Europe.
