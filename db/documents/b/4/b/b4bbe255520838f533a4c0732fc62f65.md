The sartorius is the longest muscle in the body, spanning both the hip and the knee joints. The word sartorius is derived from the Latin word sartor, which translates to patcher, or tailor, due to how the individual will position their leg while working. It is the most superficial muscle in the anterior compartment of the thigh. It travels obliquely from the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) to the medial side of the proximal tibia at the pes anserine. The sartorius muscle acts synergistically in concert with the other musculature of the hip, thigh, andÂ knee.
