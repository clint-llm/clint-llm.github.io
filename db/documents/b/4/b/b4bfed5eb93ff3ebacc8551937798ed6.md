IPE can co-exist or be mistaken for other diving-related diseases. These include pulmonary barotrauma and decompression sickness. While there is no known association between decompression illness and SDPE, there have been many cases of SDPE with symptoms beginning with ascent resulting in some confusion. There are a number of reasons ascent is associated with worsening of symptoms in IPE. Reasons include damage to pulmonary capillaries from increased pulmonary hypertension caused by pulmonary filtration of bubbles during decompression, hydrostatic positional effects causing negative inspiratory pressures, the natural progression of the disease, expansion of intrathoracic gas redistributing pulmonary edema fluids (Boyle’s Law), or a decrease in pulmonary oxygen pressures during ascent (Henry’s law). It is critical to differentiate SDPE from decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism because a hyperbaric chamber is not indicated in SDPE and could potentially cause harm. In older swimmers and divers, reversible stress cardiomyopathies have been recorded which may explain recurrences triggered by the physiologic effects of immersion. Due to its similarity and potential overlap, aspiration pneumonitis should be excluded.
