Potential complications regarding axial flap include:

- Seroma formation

- Wound drainage

- Donor site dehiscence

- Distal flap necrosis

- There is also the potential for delayed or incomplete wound healing, venous congestion requiring suture release or placement back to original positions for the delay to augment axial supply
