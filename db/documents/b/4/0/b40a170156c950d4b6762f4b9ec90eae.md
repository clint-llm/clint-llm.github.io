**Intracellular**

**Transcription of mRNA in the nucleus 
**

- Genes for pro-a1 and pro-a2 chains are transcribed

**Translation 
**

- mRNA moves into the cytoplasm and interacts with ribosomes for translation.

- After translation, it is referred to as pre-pro-polypeptide chain; this chain then travels to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for post-translational modification.

**Post-translational modification 
**

- Once in the ER, the pre-pro-polypeptide undergoes post-translational processing where three major modifications are made to the pre-pro-polypeptide for it to become pro-collagen.

- The signal peptide on the N-terminal is removed

- The lysine and proline residues get additional hydroxyl groups added to them via hydroxylase enzymes which require vitamin C as a cofactor

- Glycosylation of the selected hydroxyl groups on lysine with galactose and glucose b

- Three of the hydroxylated and glycosylated pro-a-chains assemble by twisting into a triple helix by zipper-like folding. The triple helix configuration is 3 left-handed helices twisted into a right-handed coil

- Now the pro-collagen molecule is ready to move to the Golgi apparatus for final modifications and assembled into secretory vesicles to enter the extracellular space

**Extracellular**

**Propeptide cleavage 
**

- Enzymes known as collagen peptidases preform propeptide cleavage and remove the ends of the procollagen molecule and the molecule becomes tropocollagen

**Collagen Fibril Assembly 
**

- Lysyl oxidase a copper-dependent enzyme acts on lysine and hydroxylysines, and covalent bonding between tropocollagen molecules form a collagen fibril
