New-onset diabetes mellitus after transplantation (NODAT) is the occurrence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in a previously non-diabetic person after solid organ transplantation. NODAT frequently occurs after organ transplantation and increases the risk of infection and mortality rates.

International Consensus Guidelines on NODAT were published in 2003. They recommended that the diagnosis of NODAT should be based on the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria for type 2 diabetes. It is suggested to the use of modified ADA 2003 criteria to define NODAT and impaired fasting glucose in kidney transplant recipients.
