Pure tubular carcinoma accounts for approximately 1 to 2% of invasive breast cancers. Its frequency is higher in populations where there is screening mammography.

As for other forms of breast cancers, tubular carcinoma is very rare in male patients.

Its preferential site of involvement is in the upper outer quadrant of the breast. Multifocality presents in 20% of the cases.
