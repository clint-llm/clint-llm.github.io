Potential complications of massive transfusion include metabolic alkalosis, hypocalcemia, hypothermia, and hyperkalemia. Non-fatal complications have been seen in more than 50% of patients when more than 5 units of blood products are transfused.

Metabolic alkalosis and hypocalcemia result from sodium citrate and citric acid that is added to blood products in storage to prevent coagulation. Each unit of blood can generate a total of 23 mEq of bicarbonate as citrate is metabolized. This can result in a metabolic alkalosis if the kidneys are unable to excrete the excess bicarbonate. Additionally, the alkalosis can result in hypokalemia as hydrogen ions move out of cells to compensate for the alkalosis through an H+/K+ transporter. Citrate also binds ionized calcium, which can lead to significant free hypocalcemia. It typically does not affect calcium bound to albumin. Severe hypocalcemia can result in paresthesias and cardiac dysrhythmias.

Hypothermia can also result from the infusion of blood products. Blood products are stored at 4 C. Rapid infusion of cold blood can lead to lower core body temperatures. Given that this population is already predisposed to hypothermia, which can further worsen coagulopathy, many rapid infusers also have warmers to reduce the risk of hypothermia during massive transfusion. Hyperkalemia is also a possible complication as potassium can increase in blood during long-term storage. It is typically only seen when blood products have been stored for long periods and are infused through central access at high speeds.

Additionally, the traditional complications of blood transfusion, specifically transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) and transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) can occur with massive transfusion. While the pathogenesis of TRALI is poorly understood, the incidence of TRALI increases as the number of blood products given increases. The rapid onset of hypoxemia indicates TRALI within 6 hours of a transfusion. Patients clinically will look very similar to those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a PaP2/FiO2 less than 300 mm Hg, bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray, and no signs of systolic heart failure. TACO can also be seen with overzealous transfusion.
