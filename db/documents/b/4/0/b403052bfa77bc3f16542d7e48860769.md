Nearly half of adults with intralobar sequestration are asymptomatic.

If significant in size and location, extralobar sequestration is usually manifest clinically in early infancy with respiratory distress, high output congestive heart failure (due to right-to-left shunt), and occasional spontaneous pulmonary or pleural hemorrhage. Extralobar sequestrations rarely get infected as they are separated from the tracheobronchial tree by their pleural investment.

Intralobar sequestration frequently remains asymptomatic and gets diagnosed in adults. Apart from asymptomatic patients with incidental diagnosis in chest CT, the most common clinical presentation is of recurrent pneumonia in a localized segment of the lung. It can also be a persistent cough, back pain, or persistent exertional shortness of breath. Intralobar sequestration tends to present with hemoptysis more often.

Associated congenital anomalies occur more frequently with extralobar sequestration than intralobar. About 50% to 60% of patients have another congenital anomaly. It may include congenital diaphragmatic hernia, congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, vertebral defect, congenital heart disease, tracheoesophageal fistula, pulmonary hypoplasia, bronchogenic cyst, and congenital megacolon. A congenital diaphragmatic hernia is the commonest.
