Lambl excrescences, a histological term describing rare cardiac growths that develop at the valvular coaptation sites of the heart which are seen as a thin, hypermobile, and filiform strand on an echocardiogram. These filiform strands can be noted on an echocardiogram either incidentally or in association with serious complications such as embolic stroke or acute coronary syndromes after they break off and embolize to distant organs. This activity describes the pathophysiology of lambl excrescences and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Lambl excrescences.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with Lambl excrescences.
- Outline the management options available for Lambl excrescences.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of Lambl excrescences and improve outcomes.
