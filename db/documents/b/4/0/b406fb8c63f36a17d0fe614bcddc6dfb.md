Alpha-1 adrenergic receptors are present on vascular smooth muscle and myocardial tissue; therefore, stimulation causes vasoconstriction and positive inotropic effects, respectively. Higher acuity indications for alpha-1 receptor agonists include cases of vasodilatory shock, hypotension, and hypoperfusion. Often patients receiving an alpha-1 agonist are concurrently undergoing fluid resuscitation, for example, sepsis or septic shock, cardiopulmonary arrest, and heart failure decompensation.

FDA approved indications for selected alpha-1 agonists (off-label uses indicated when applicable):

**Apraclonidine**

- Indications: Elevated intraocular pressure and as a diagnostic tool for Horner syndrome

- Administration: Eye drops

- Notes: Apraclonidine is also called iopidine. Often the elevated intraocular pressure that necessitates its use is caused by glaucoma. This drug is primarily an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist but does also produce alpha-1 agonist effects.

**Epinephrine**

- Indications: Mucosal congestion, glaucoma, asthma, and emergency treatment of severe hypersensitivity reactions. Epinephrine is also the primary drug used to aid the reversal of cardiac arrest during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

- Administration: Intravenous, inhalation, nebulization, intramuscular injection, and subcutaneous injection

- Notes: Epinephrine is a hormone and a neurotransmitter, also known as adrenaline, that is secreted endogenously by the adrenal medulla as part of the sympathetic response. It is also used in lidocaine drug formulations to prolong the local anesthetic effects of lidocaine and provide local hemostasis.

**Methoxamine**

- Indications: Hypotension (especially due to spinal anesthesia), hemorrhage, adverse medication reaction, and shock caused by surgery, brain damage, or trauma

- Administration: Injection and intravenous

- Notes: Methoxamine causes prolonged peripheral vasoconstriction but has little to no effect on the central nervous system. Unlike many alpha-1 agonists that have mixed alpha-1 or alpha-2 activity and beta action, methoxamine is a selective alpha-1 agonist.

- Discontinued in the USA

**Norepinephrine**

- Indications: Vasodilatory shock (i.e., septic shock and neurogenic shock), acute hypotension (used as a vasopressor), and cardiac arrest (used as an adjunct therapy)

- Administration: Intravenous drip and injection

- Notes: The neurotransmitter, norepinephrine, is the precursor to epinephrine and is also secreted by the adrenal medulla. Norepinephrine and epinephrine are known as catecholamines.

**Oxymetazoline**

- Indications: Nasal congestion, facial erythema due to rosacea, and ophthalmic allergic reactions

- Administration: Topical cream, nasal spray, eye drops

**Phenylephrine**

- Indications: Anesthesia-associated and shock-associated hypotension, conditions or procedures necessitating dilation of the pupil, and nasal congestion (provides local vasoconstrictive effects)

- Administration: Oral, intravenous, and topical (eye drops and rectal ointment)

- Notes: Phenylephrine is used off-label as a first-line treatment for ischemic priapism.

**Pseudoephedrine**

- Indications: Nasal congestion, rhinitis, otitis media, sinusitis, and tracheobronchitis

- Administration: Oral tablet or syrup

- Notes: Medications containing pseudoephedrine are often offered as a combined product with ibuprofen and/or an antihistamine, It causes the release of neuronal norepinephrine

**Tetryzoline**

- Indications: Minor eye irritation (provides short-term relief) or inflammation

- Administration: Eye drops

**Xylometazoline**

- Indications: Nasal congestion and minor nasal inflammation

- Administration: Nasal spray or drops

- Notes: This agent decreases congestion through vasoconstriction effects

It is worth noting that many agents that are “alpha-1 agonists” have at least some mixed alpha-1 and alpha-2 activity, and others have mixed alpha and beta-agonistic activity.
