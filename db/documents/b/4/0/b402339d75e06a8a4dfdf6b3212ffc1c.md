Internal jugular vein thrombosis is asymptomatic in the majority of patients. Due to its subtle manifestation, it is difficult to diagnose for clinicians. However, patients may present with typical signs for deep vein thrombosis such as erythema, tenderness, and warmth. On physical examination, swelling at the left sided neck, mandible angle or the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle can be found. Internal jugular vein thrombosis in the setting of infection as known as Lemierre syndrome (necrobacillosis), fever, headache, swelling of the neck and angle of the jaw along with trismus is another possible presentation.
