Management of painful joint pathology requires an interprofessional approach that includes the patient in his care and supports a return to activities that may be limited by his or her disease process. Non-surgical management is the first-line treatment for a painful joint, and physicians and therapists must communicate and work together to help patients find solutions to their pain limitations. When non-operative measures fail, surgery may be considered.

Any time surgery is undertaken, medical practitioners must have a good surgical team in place. Surgical techs, nurses, and surgeons must work together seamlessly in the operating room to provide the patient with the highest likelihood of a successful outcome. The surgeon must then communicate with the physical therapist, who is vital to providing the patient with the appropriate post-operative protocol to ensure a safe return to function post-operatively.
