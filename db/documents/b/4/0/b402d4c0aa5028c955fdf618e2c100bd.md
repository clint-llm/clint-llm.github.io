Estimating the prevalence of food allergies is challenging for several reasons.  Determining true IgE-mediated egg allergy is limited in patients who undergo appropriate diagnostic workups such as skin allergen testing, egg specific allergen serum IgE, or oral food challenge (addressed below under “Diagnostics”).  Individuals with a real egg allergy may not be aware of their condition if there is inadequate exposure to egg allergen, particularly in populations where egg consumption is minimal. On the other hand, patients who become symptomatic to exposure to egg proteins may attribute their condition to a supposed egg allergy when there might be no true allergy.  In these cases, there could be the presence of another allergen responsible or the patient’s symptomatology may have other plausible, non-allergy explanations (i.e., asthma, gastrointestinal distress, etc.). Another challenge is determining the true prevalence of egg allergy versus egg intolerance and an egg allergy.  Patients or their parents can easily confuse simple food intolerance with a true IgE-mediated allergic response
