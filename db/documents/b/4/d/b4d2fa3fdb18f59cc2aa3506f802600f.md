Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia tends to persist for years and to recur after treatment in more than 40% of the cases. Early age of onset, long disease duration, multiple lesions, and symptomatic disease seem to have a higher recurrence rate. Spontaneous regression can occur occasionally.

ALHE is an entirely benign disease. Even though there were cases of T-cell receptor gene rearrangement and monoclonality, no reports of absolute evidence of malignant behavior in ALHE exist thus far.
