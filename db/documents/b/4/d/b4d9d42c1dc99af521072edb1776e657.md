While the literature lacks concise epidemiologic data, most reports estimate about a 3% to 5% prevalence rate of lumbosacral radiculopathy in patient populations.  Moreover, the condition constitutes a significant reason for patient referral to either neurologists, neurosurgeons, or orthopedic spine surgeons.

While the incidence of low back pain is estimated to be between 13% and 31%, the incidence of radicular symptoms in patients presenting with low back pain ranges from 12% to 40%. In the workforce, low back pain is the second greatest cause of absenteeism behind upper respiratory tract infections. About 25 million people miss one or more days of work due to low back pain, and more than five million are disabled from it. Patients with chronic back pain account for 80% to 90% of all healthcare expenditures.
