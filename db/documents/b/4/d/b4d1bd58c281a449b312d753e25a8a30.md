The primary goal of evaluation of the nipple discharge in a general outpatient setting or the emergency department is to distinguish patients with benign discharge from those with underlying breast cancer, infection/abscess, or those patients who are at high risk of developing pathologic processes. Those patients, whose age, history, and physical examination suggest the benign cause of their discharge, may be reassured and discharged with outpatient follow-up at their primary care provider's office. However, in patients at high risk for a pathologic process as a cause of their discharge or with worrisome history and physical examination, urgent follow-up with a breast surgeon must be sought.

The first step in the evaluation of breast discharge is to rule out whether the discharge is physiological or pathological. Physiological discharge is bilateral and is clear or milky. Pathological discharge is always unilateral and may be bloody. It is hence important to note the color of discharge, whether it occurs spontaneously or occurs with stimulation (which is physiological). Also, associated symptoms are interpreted to make the final diagnosis.

For patients with physiological discharge, TSH levels, and prolactin levels are measured to rule out systemic causes of nipple discharge. For patients lesser than 40 years of age, routine observation is required. For patients greater than 40 years of age, mammography is indicated. In patients with pathological discharge, mammography and/or ultrasound are performed. If abnormal, a breast biopsy is performed. If normal, then breast MRI, or surgical excision of the lump (if an associated lump is present) is done. Fluid cytology can also be acquired to study the malignant cells in patients with blood discharge, where breast cancer is suspected.

In case of a suspected or obvious breast abscess when emergent ultrasound of the breast and a general surgery consultation are needed in the emergency department. Depending on the results of the breast ultrasound and evaluation of the general surgery consultants, the patient may or may not be taken to the operating room for incision and drainage of an abscess. Incision and drainage of a breast abscess in the emergency department are discouraged due to the high pain sensitivity and aesthetic significance of the area, especially when an abscess involves the areola/nipple area. Therefore, appropriate anesthesia is needed, possibly in the operating room, to minimize pain and suffering in a patient, as well as aesthetic considerations.
