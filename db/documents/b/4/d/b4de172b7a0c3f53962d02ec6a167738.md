Though panic disorder and agoraphobia have been differentiated, with two different sets of diagnostic criteria, the treatment algorithms for the two remain similar. The first step is to identify the severity of the disease when the patient presents; this is often a measure of the level of impairment or distress the agoraphobia or panic disorder causes in the patientâ€™s life.

Patients with mild or moderate panic disorder or agoraphobia can choose between psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy to achieve adequate symptom management. Studies have generally concluded that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) effectively addresses and alleviates target symptoms, lessens other anxiety symptoms, and improves the patient's quality of life.
