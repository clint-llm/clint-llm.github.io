Surgeons encounter the sphincter of Oddi in many surgical and nonsurgical procedures, so a proper understanding of potential variations in arterial supply is crucial in avoiding undue harm. About 5% of the population's distance between the retroduodenal artery and the papillary orifice is less than 35 millimeters. This proximity creates a small risk of hemorrhage during procedures that require entry through the sphincter of Oddi, such as an ERCP with sphincterotomy, sphincteroplasty, or surgical interventions.
