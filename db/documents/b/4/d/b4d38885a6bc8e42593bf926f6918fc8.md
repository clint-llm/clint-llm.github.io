The goal for patients with ulcerative colitis is to improve mucosal healing and achieve remission. Symptoms may improve within a week, but remission may take four to six weeks or even longer. A proper understanding of mesalamine and the use of adjuvant therapy is essential for peopleÂ contributing to the management of this disease. After achieving remission, healthcare professionals need to monitor the patient blood work and colonoscopies. A colonoscopy should be done six to twelve months following remission. Laboratory monitoring of inflammatory markers such as CRP, liver function, renal function, anemia, and stool marker (calprotectin) will be helpful in the health maintenance of ulcerative colitis.

Primary care physicians must ensure patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) receive the required and recommended vaccinations. Due to the use of immunosuppressive therapy in patients with IBD, patients need to be informed about the risk of infection, osteoporosis, and certain cancers, including colon, cervical, and skin cancer. As a result of the complexity of this disease, shared decision-making, interprofessional communication, and collaboration between healthcare team members are critical, and doing so will provide the best possible outcome for the patient.

When using mesalamine, an interprofessional team approach is the most beneficial methodology. When the clinician prescribes the drug, a pharmacist should check for drug interactions, verify dosing, and counsel the patient on potential adverse events. Nursing should counsel the patient, monitor and follow up on subsequent visits, and report any issues to the prescriber. This interprofessional coordination will improve patient outcomes with mesalamine. [Level 5]
