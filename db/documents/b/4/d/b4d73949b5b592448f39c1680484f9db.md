**Tips for Other Lab Staff**

It is desirable that echocardiographers, paramedical staff, and anesthesia services be an integral part of the interventional lab or procedure room. Echocardiographers are at more risk as they have to position themselves towards the head end of the bed near the radiologic source. Therefore, they should use personal protective devices to minimize radiation exposure. Scattered radiation after the radiologic procedures is a significant source of radiation exposure to the echocardiographers.

Ionizing radiation has revolutionized Diagnostic and interventional aspects of medicine at the cost of increased risk of carcinoma and other side effects on the body tissuesÂ e.g eyes (Cataracts) and skin (Burns). This increased risk is not only for patients but for the health care providers as well. The pros and cons of radiation usage should be considered and weighed individually on a case-to-case basis. The use of personal protective equipment, employment of shielding methods, strict implementation of ICRP and NCRP guidelines regarding radiation control, and educating health care professionals of possible risks and precautions can substantially reduce the health hazards associated with radiation exposure.
