Once the diagnosis has been confirmedÂ with histopathology and immunohistochemistry, evaluation and workup include imaging of the primary tumor, lymph nodes, and distant metastases. The TNM staging criteria will vary depending on the location of the tumor. The NCCN guideline Version 1.2021 recommends performing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast to determine tumor size, invasion of visceral structures, and neurovascular involvement.

Chest, abdominal, and pelvic non-contrast computed tomography (CT) should be considered when internal viscera or retroperitoneal involvement is suspected. Total spine, head, and neck MRI or CT may be requested in particular cases. There is not enough evidence to recommend sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or positron emission tomography (PET) in UPS. Yet, it is worth noting that a recent systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET scan is a useful predictive tool in patients with STSs and bone sarcomas.
