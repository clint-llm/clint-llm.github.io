**Optical**

In regular astigmatism, the regular treatment consists of prescribing spectacles with cylindrical lenses discovered after correct refraction. Hard contact lenses are another option for correcting astigmatism, which can correct up to 2-3 dioptre of astigmatism. For astigmatism higher than this, toric contact lenses are another option.

**Guidelines for Astigmatism Correction**

**Small Degree of Astigmatism**

Minimal astigmatism up to 0.5 D should be corrected only if there are asthenopic symptoms or producing any symptoms. A low degree of astigmatism should be rectified with meticulous refraction, and care is crucial while prescribing the changes.

**High Degree of Astigmatism**

The higher degree of astigmatism should be corrected fully to minimize asthenopic symptoms. The patients with a high cylindrical correction may not be happy with full cylindrical correction initially and may not accept it; hence the correction should be titrated till the patient is comfortable. These patients should have serial follow-ups, and serial adjustments should be made till full correction is accepted.

**Correction of Axis of Astigmatism**

If the patient is not happy with cylindrical correction, the axis of astigmatism can be rechecked, considering the old axis of refraction. The patient with new correction should be told to wear new correction and walk for a few minutes till he is comfortable.

**New Astigmatic Correction**

New correction should be avoided as it may result in intolerable symptoms, even if there is improvement in the best-corrected visual acuity. If there is a significant change, the patient should be ascertained that there is an improvement in visual acuity, and the new correction adjustment will take time.

Oblique Astigmatism, Mixed Astigmatism, and High Astigmatism are better treated with contact lenses than spectacles.

**Surgical Management of Astigmatism**

**Toric IOL Implantation**

The corneal astigmatism present and cataractous changes in a patient can be managed with toric IOL implantation.

**Refractive Incisional Procedures**

**Astigmatic Keratotomy**

Astigmatic Keratotomy (AK) is a technique of performing arcuate cuts or arcuate cuts in the mid-peripheral cornea, which is perpendicular to the steepest corneal meridian. The AK can be done alone for astigmatism correction or can be coupled with cataract surgery.

**Mechanism**

In AK, the incised meridian flattens while the meridian 90 degrees away steepens by an equal amount. This technique can correct up to 4 to 6 D of astigmatism. The deeper, longer, and more central the incision is, the more the effect, but this may result in more irregular astigmatism, micro-perforations, and overcorrection.

**Technique**

The incision length is usually 5 to 7 mm from the pupillary center. Nomograms are there to adjust for patient age and amount of astigmatism. AK can be done using transverse and arcuate incisions.

**Transverse Incisions**

These incisions are fashioned in pairs in the steepest meridian and extend to 3 mm. The second pair of incisions are often required at the same meridian for a more significant effect. Transverse incisions are given tangential to the optic zone; hence, the flattening power decreases as the incision size increases.

**Arcuate Incision**

The arcuate clear corneal incisions are at a particular distance from the center and are more effective than transverse cuts at a given optical zone size. The flattening effect increases with the length of the incision up to 90 degrees.

**Limbal Relaxing Incision**

Limbal relaxing incision (LRI) is an incision used to correct mild astigmatism (-1 D to -2D). The main advantage is that the procedure produces less glare and discomfort than AK. The incisions heal faster, and the corneal optical quality is preserved by making incisions at the limbus. The incisions are safe and can be easily coupled with cataract surgery.

**Laser Ablation Corneal Refractive Surgeries**

**Photoastigmatic Refractive Keratotomy**

This technique uses a cylindrical ablation pattern in contrast to a spherical pattern. The axis of astigmatism should be marked while the patient is sitting because the position may shift as the patient lies down. In cases with compound myopic astigmatism, elliptical PRK should be performed, which may correct myopic and astigmatic correction.

**Astigmatic Epi-LASIK**

Astigmatic LASIK is the preferred modality over PRK as it reduces pain and postoperative haze.

**Astigmatic LASIK**

Like PRK, the LASIK procedure can be used to correct astigmatism. An astigmatic LASIK can correct up to 0.5-10 D of astigmatism.

**C-LASIK**

Wavefront-guided customized is presently the best modality to correct corneal astigmatism.

**Post-Keratoplasty Astigmatism Management**

**Suture Induced Astigmatism**

Suture-induced astigmatism after keratoplasty can be managed by selective suture removal in steeper meridian and improved irregular and regular to a varying degree. Interrupted suture removal may be performed within three months, depending on the amount of astigmatism. Continuous suture removal should be attempted after one year of surgery. The selective suture removal can be guided by Scheimpflug imaging or keratoscopy.

**Relaxing Incision**

Arcuate incisions along the steepest meridian in the donor area 0.5 mm central to the graft-host junction can correct astigmatism up to 3.5 to 8.5 D. The relaxing incisions are placed under topical anesthesia with the help of a razor blade or bearer blade, or a diamond knife. Two relaxing incisions up to 60-70% of the corneal depth are made up to 180 degrees apart, and the incision may extend up to 60-100 degrees.

**Astigmatic LASIK**

LASIK procedure can correct astigmatism up to 6-8 D. Wavefront-guided C-LASIK is the best technique to correct post keratoplasty astigmatism.

**Relaxing Incisions and Compression Sutures**

This technique can correct astigmatism up to 8.5 to 16 D astigmatism. After the relaxing incision, 2-3 10-0 nylon sutures are applied at the graft host junction, which is 90 degrees from the steepest meridian on each side.

**Corneal Wedge Resection**

This procedure can correct astigmatism up to 10 to 20 D before performing optical keratoplasty. Under peribulbar block, a corneal wedge of 1 to 1.5 mm wide base and 90 degrees is removed from the recipient cornea adjacent to the graft host junction in the flattest meridian. The defect created can be sutured with nylon sutures. The sutures are tightened enough to overcome one-third of existing astigmatism.

**Ruiz Procedure**

This procedure can correct astigmatism up to 10 D astigmatism. A deep horizontal keratotomy incision is made with a guarded diamond blade in a step ladder fashion along with the steepest corneal meridian. The horizontal incisions are assisted by two adjacent radial incisional. The critical thing to be monitored is that the two incisions do not intersect as it may result in poor wound healing and gaping.

**Repeat Optical Keratoplasty**

Repeat optical keratoplasty is needed in a patient with more than 20 D of astigmatism.
