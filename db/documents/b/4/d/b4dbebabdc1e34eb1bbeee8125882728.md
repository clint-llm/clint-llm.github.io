The normal RBC membrane is composed of a lipid bilayer with the cytoskeleton proteins that help in maintaining the membrane integrity and surface area. The different cytoskeleton proteins present in the RBC membrane are spectrin (composed of alpha and beta heterodimers), ankyrin, protein 4.1, protein 4.2, band 3, and glycophorin C. Genetic alterations affecting alpha spectrin, beta spectrin, protein 4.1, band 3, and rarely glycophorin C result in defects in RBC membrane stability and deformability as the RBCs pass through the microcirculation. As a result, RBCs fail to regain their normal biconcave shape as they pass through the microcirculation due to loss of elastic recoil resulting in a fixed morphology of elliptocytes in peripheral blood. These elliptocytes are trapped and removed by the spleen resulting in premature destruction of the RBCs (less than 120 days), leading to intravascular hemolysis that is predominant in hereditary elliptocytosis.Â The severity of anemia is directly related to the extent of the decrease in the RBCs membrane stability.
