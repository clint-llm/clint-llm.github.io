With the rapid advancements being made in diagnostic tools, including imaging or invasive tests, for detection of heart failure, there has been reduced emphasis on physical examination skills. The hepatojugular reflux is a very simple and useful bedside test that can diagnose right heart failure. Performance of the test has been described earlier in the manuscript. We encourage residents and physicians to routinely perform a detailed physical examination including hepatojugular reflux, which can help diagnose or rule out right heart failure.
