Agnosia can considerably limit the everyday functioning of the patients. It can also significantly affect the lives of family and caretakers. There is no direct cure. Treat the underlying cause, when possible. For example, treating and preventing stroke, antibiotics and/or surgery for a brain abscess, and surgery and/or radiation for brain tumors.

Agnosia is managed supportively. Rehabilitation, speech, and occupational therapy play an important role in the treatment of agnosia and mainly focus on teaching patients to use the intact sensory modalities to compensate. Restorative training has limited utility. Interventions tend to focus on helping these patients and their families and caregivers cope and adapt to the condition, and furthermore, to help patients function independently within their context. Counseling of family members and helping them with behavioral changes are equally important.

Rehabilitation approaches need to be individualized and should focus on the specific deficit by developing compensatory strategies.

**Alternative Cues and Strategies
**

Some general strategies that can be used are alternative cues, for example, teaching people with prosopagnosia to learn to identify any facial scars or hairstyles. For patients with visual agnosia, teaching alternative strategies like learning to identify everything by touch; in patients with prosopagnosia, teaching voice recognition for people; and teaching patients with auditory agnosia to lip read and write everything.

**Organizational Strategies
**

- Provide a predictable environment and consistency in performing a task, for example, placing things in the same place every day. Routines help develop consistency in performing a task.

- Declutter, for example, things patients use every day should be kept out in one place. This may help patients with visual agnosia.

- Label everything.
