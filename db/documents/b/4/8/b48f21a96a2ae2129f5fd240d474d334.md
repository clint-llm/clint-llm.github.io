Nitrofurantoin is only available as an oral medication. Nitrofurantoin's optimal dosing remains unknown since regulatory agencies approved its use before modern requirements for rigorous methods for drug development. Current Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines recommend nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals as a first-line antibiotic for uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

Dosage is 100 mg twice daily for five days to treat lower urinary tract infections. A 7-day course of 100 mg twice daily is also considered acceptable. Prescribing nitrofurantoin for less than five days is less effective and is no longer recommended. Dosing for long-term prophylaxis of urinary tract infections is 50 mg to 100 mg once daily at bedtime.
