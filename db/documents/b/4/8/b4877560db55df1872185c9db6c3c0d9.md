Anoxic encephalopathy, or hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, is a process that begins with the cessation of cerebral blood flow to brain tissue, which most commonly results from poisoning, as is the case, for example, with carbon monoxide poisoning or drug overdose, vascular injury, or insult, or cardiac arrest. Many patients who suffer anoxic brain injury expire without regaining full consciousness, and many have very poor neurologic outcomes. However, some advances are being made in this area, and there is a focus on identifying patients with the prospect of improving neurologic morbidity and mortality. This activity examines the factors contributing to positive and negative outcomes in individuals suffering from anoxic encephalopathy. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the presentation of a patient with anoxic encephalopathy.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with anoxic encephalopathy.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for anoxic encephalopathy.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with anoxic encephalopathy.
