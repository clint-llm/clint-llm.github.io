Thyroiditis is a condition that occurs when the thyroid gland gets inflamed. The thyroid gland is responsible for making a hormone called thyroxine, which controls the human body's metabolism and energy utilization. When the gland is inflamed, due to any cause, it could makeÂ insufficient or excessive hormone, which causes symptoms like fatigue, weight gain, depression or palpitations, weight loss, and anxiety, to name a few.

Consult with your doctor to discuss the right treatment as the management varies depending on the type of thyroiditis, and the physician needs to investigate and follow up with laboratory tests to ensure continued management of the thyroiditis.
