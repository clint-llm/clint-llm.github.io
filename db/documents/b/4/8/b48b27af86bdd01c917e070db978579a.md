The actual increase in melanoma incidence is most likely due to an overall increase in the ultraviolet (UV) light exposure. Although melanoma, in general, is thought to be rare, the incidence of melanoma worldwide is rising dramatically, and despite increased efforts at screening, mortality rates have not appreciably improved. In the United States, melanoma is the fifth leading cancer in men and the seventh in women, and its incidence has doubled in the last ten years. In a study of data (1992 to 2004), researchers found that the actual incidence of melanoma (all thicknesses and among all socioeconomic levels) is increasing the case burden. The increase is from 4.7 to 7.7 cases per 100,000 older men and from 5.5 to 13.9 cases per 100,000 females. Although 5% of all melanomas are located on foot, pedal melanoma is relatively rare in whites. Among East Asians and darkly pigmented people, acral lentiginous melanoma is the most common subtype.
