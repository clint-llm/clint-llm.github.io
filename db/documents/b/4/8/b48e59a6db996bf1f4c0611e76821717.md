The sinoatrial node is the natural cardiac pacemaker located in the upper right atrium. The atrioventricular node is a separate cardiac pacemaker located in the inferior-posterior right atrium. The His bundle is a separate cardiac pacemaker located at the inferior end of the atria and ventricle. A junctional rhythm is an abnormal heart rhythm that originates from the AV node or His bundle. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of junctional rhythm and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in educating patients about their prognosis.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the risk factors of developing a junctional rhythm.
- Review the pathophysiology of junctional rhythms.
- Explain the differential diagnosis of junctional rhythm.
- Summarize the interprofessional team's strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding the management of patients with junctional rhythm.
