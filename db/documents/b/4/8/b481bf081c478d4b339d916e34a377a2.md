Approximately 50% of patients with hereditary spherocytosis present with anemia, and 10 to 15% with splenomegaly or jaundice.

Patients who undergo splenectomy are at risk of sepsis. The most common causing organisms are encapsulated and include Streptococcus pneumoniae with the highest incidence, Neisseria meningitides, and Haemophilus influenzae. The risk of sepsis is associated with the age of the patient.

Cholelithiasis is one of the most common complications and usually presents in patients between the ages of 10 and 30 years, although younger patients may also present with cholelithiasis.

Some patients may also present with hematologic crises, which may be hemolytic, aplastic, or megaloblastic.

Aplastic crises are generally worse than hemolytic crises and may be the cause of acute heart failure; it has correlations with parvovirus B19. Children commonly present with chills and fever, abdominal pain, myalgias, and generalized maculopapular rash. The clinical course of aplastic crisis usually starts with a decrease in hemoglobin and reticulocytes, followed by a reduction in bone marrow erythroblasts and bilirubin. During recovery neutrophils and platelets increase first, then subsequently by reticulocytosis and gradual increase in hemoglobin levels.

Megaloblastic crises are infrequent and usually caused by a deficiency in folate levels. These complications are treatable with adequate folate supplementation.
