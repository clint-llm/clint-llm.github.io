**Acute Leukemia**

In acute leukemia, the peripheral blood or bone marrow is characterized by more than 20% blasts. However, regardless of the blast percentage, patients with t(8;21)(q22;q22), RUNX1-RUNX1T1, inv(16)(p13.1q22) or t(16;16)(p13.1;q22), CBFB-MYH11 or t(15;17)(q24.1;q21.1), PML-RARA, are considered and treated as acute leukemia. There is usually increased cellularity noted on bone marrow biopsy that is packed with blasts and a variable number of granulocytic or monocytic cells and erythroid precursors. Traditional markers included in the evaluation are CD7, CD11b, CD13, CD14, CD15, CD16, CD33, CD34, CD45, CD56, CD117, HLA-DR. Also, either peripheral smear or bone marrow aspirate is sent for a mutation panel of multiple genes with therapeutic and prognostic implications, such as ASXL1, CEBPA, DNMT3A, FLT3, IDH1, IDH2, NPM1, RUNX1, and TP53, to mention a few.

There is also increased bone marrow cellularity in ALL, composed of B and T lymphoblasts (with small nucleoli, dispersed chromatin, cleaved and irregular nuclei with undetectable cytoplasm). Common T-cell lymphoid immunostains include TdT, CD2, CD3, CD5, and CD7. Common B-cell lymphoid immunostains include HLA-DR, CD10, CD19, CD22, CD79a, PAX5, and CD20. There should not be any myeloid markers, such as myeloperoxidase (MPO), to confirm the diagnosis of the pure lymphoid lineage. Mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) has both myeloid and lymphoid markers but is a rare entity. Cytogenetics evaluation for Ph chromosome status and Ph-like translocation is a must as newer therapeutic agents are now incorporated into treatment algorithms.

**Chronic Leukemia**

The white blood cell count in chronic leukemia is often elevated, with a smear suggestive of significant left shift/granulocyte predominance. Such a picture is commonly seen during the acute illness phase, but if such a picture persists upon repeat labs, CML should be evaluated.****In CML, the translocation t(9;22) can be diagnosed by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) on peripheral blood. Bone marrow biopsy is not necessary for diagnosis, but if done, it will usually show 100% cellular marrow with increased granulocyte precursors, basophils, eosinophils, and occasional monocytes.

In CLL, the white cell count is elevated, with mostly CD5+ and CD23+ B-lymphocytes. The clonal lymphocyte population has to be greater than 5,000/mcL for diagnosis. If the clonal lymphocyte population is less than 5,000/mcL, the entity is termed monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis of undetermined significance. Flow cytometry is often diagnostic. Patients would need evaluation for del(17p) and TP53 mutation status, immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) gene mutation status, del(11q), del(13q), and trisomy 12 evaluation, which can help in selecting appropriate treatment regimens.
