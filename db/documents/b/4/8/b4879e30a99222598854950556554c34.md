The hallmark of Riedel thyroiditis is the replacement of thyroid tissue with dense fibrotic tissue. Fibrosis involves extra-thyroidal structures, including the trachea, parathyroid glands, neck musculature, laryngeal nerves, and blood vessels. This causes the thyroid to become immobile and fixed and is described as stone-hard or woody on palpation.
