Physical examination includes inspection, palpation, testing of mobility, strength, and stability, and performance of special tests of ACL integrity. One should always examine the unaffected knee for comparison as patients have a baseline increased laxity with Lachman testing that is not due to injury. It is often best to examine the patient immediately after the injury or at least within several hours for a suspected ACL injury to avoid evaluating a knee with significant swelling and hemarthrosis, which may lead to patient guarding and negatively impact testing accuracy.
