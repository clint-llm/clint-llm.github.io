The innervation of the gluteus maximus muscle is from the inferior gluteal nerve, the only muscle this nerve innervates. The inferior gluteal nerve originates from the ventral rami of L5, S1, and S2. The nerve emergesÂ from the inferior border of the piriformis. In contrast, its counterpart, the superior gluteal nerve, emerges from the superior border of this muscle along with the superior gluteal artery.
