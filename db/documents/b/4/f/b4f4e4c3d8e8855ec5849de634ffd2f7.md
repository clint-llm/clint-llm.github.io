The thenar eminence can be easily identified by palpating the base of the thumb on the palm (volar) side of the hand. The abductor pollicis brevis, flexor pollicis brevis, and the opponens pollicis are located here and control the movements of the thumb. These muscles work to provide adduction, abduction, flexion, pronation, and opposition for the thumb.

The abductor pollicis brevis abducts the thumb. This muscle is located superficial and lateral to the other two muscles. Its origin is mainlyÂ from the flexor retinaculum but also originates from the tubercles of the scaphoid and trapezium. It then travels both distal and lateral to insert on the base of the proximal phalanx of the thumb.

The flexor pollicis brevis is located superficial and medial to the opponens pollicis. It has two muscle heads, a superficial and a deep one. Both heads are separated by the flexor pollicis longus. Its origin is the trapezium and flexor retinaculum, and it inserts on the proximal phalanx of the thumb. It functions to flex the thumb.

The opponens pollicis is located deep to the other muscles, and it is also the largest. It originates from both the flexor retinaculum and the trapezium tubercle. It inserts on the anterolateral portion of the first metacarpal shaft and opposes the thumb. Opposition in this context is both adduction and pronation. This movement allows the tip of the thumb to contact the tips of the other digits on the same hand.
