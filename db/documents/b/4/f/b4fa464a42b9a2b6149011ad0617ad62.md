The axillary approach to the brachial plexus nerve block was first described by Dr. Halstead et al. in 1884. Before the prevalence of ultrasound, its superficial location and low risk of complications, such as pneumothorax, made it a useful block for outpatient hand surgery. Its superficial location allows for easier identification of the individual nerve branches with a nerve stimulator or ultrasound techniques. Of note, contrary to its name, this block does not block the axillary nerve and should not be confused with the relatively newer axillary nerve block.
