It is crucial to distinguish non-IgM MGUS from other advanced plasma cell neoplasms since these diseases will require a different management approach. The differential diagnosis of non-IgM MGUS include:

- Plasma cell myeloma (smoldering or symptomatic): Any patient with a non-IgM serum monoclonal protein greater than or equal to 30 g/L or with greater than or equal to 10% clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow should not be diagnosed as non-IgM MGUS. Many providers consider smoldering PCM as a transition stage between non-IgM MGUS and symptomatic PCM. Smoldering PCM is distinguished from MGUS based on the size of the M protein and the percentage of clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow. Smoldering PCM is distinguished from symptomatic PCM by the presence of CRAB symptoms.

- Waldenstr√∂m macroglobulinemia (smoldering or symptomatic): WM is a distinct clinicopathologic disorder that shows lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) in the bone marrow and an IgM monoclonal gammopathy. Symptoms include blood hyperviscosity, lymphadenopathy, or splenomegaly. The WHO (2017) diagnostic criteria of WM include:
- IgM monoclonal gammopathy
- Clonal plasma cells less than 10%
- Absence of end-organ damage (CRAB symptoms)
- Absence of symptoms or signs of amyloidosis

- Monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance: This disease entity is diagnosed when the patient has diagnostic criteria for MGUS as well as renal insufficiency and monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits in the kidney by immunofluorescence.

- Light chain smoldering multiple myeloma (idiopathic Bence Jones proteinuria): The diagnostic criteria of LC-SMM include:

- Monoclonal light chains in the urine (Bence Jones proteinuria)
- No immunoglobulin heavy chain expression in the serum or urine
- No symptoms of PCM, WM, or amyloid light chain amyloidosis

- Primary (amyloid light chain) amyloidosis and light chain deposition disease: This entity of plasma cell neoplasms is associated with the pathologic deposition of monoclonal light chains in tissue. The diagnostic criteria include the presence of amyloid in tissue and evidence of plasma cell neoplasm.

- B cell lymphoproliferative disorder
