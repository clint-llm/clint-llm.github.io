The process of deciding which patients are appropriate for endovascular repair of aortic coarctation is challenging. This requires numerous factors, including the patient's age, presence of concomitant congenital heart defects, and the specific anatomy of the coarcted segment. As such, appropriate patient selection for intervention involves collaboration among adult congenital heart disease cardiologists, congenital heart disease cardiothoracic surgeons, and interventionalists. The multi-team approach to intervention management is referenced in the 2008 American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology (ACC/AHA) guidelines. This is a class 1 level of evidence C recommendation. This coordination of care extends past the periprocedural time frame and includes the lifelong follow-up period. ACC and AHA provide a class 1 recommendation of life long follow up with a cardiologist that has specialization in adult congenital heart disease.
