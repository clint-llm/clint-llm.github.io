Medication errors can be detrimental and costly to patients.

According to a 2016 study of intensive care (ICU)Â nurses, 80% of nurses considered knowledge of drug dosage calculation essential to decrease medication errors during the preparation of intravenous drugs.

High-risk medications such as heparin and insulin often require a second check on dosage amounts by more than one provider before administering the drug. Follow institutional policies and recommendations on the double-checking of dose calculations by another licensed provider.

Published in 2018, one study by a group of oncology nurses in 3 Swiss hospitals discusses the process of double-checking and its limitations in the current healthcare environment and increased nurse workload and time constraints, distracting environments, and lack of resources. The study concluded that oncology nurses strongly believed in the effectiveness of double-checking medication despite reporting limitations of the procedure in clinical practice.
