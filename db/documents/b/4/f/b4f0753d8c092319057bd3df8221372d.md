In general, the treatment and management of persistent depressive disorder do not vary significantly from the treatment and management of a major depressive disorder.  While there may be differences in the individualization of treatment plans based on symptom number, severity, and chronicity, the general principles of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy remain the same.  It is also commonly accepted and well-validated that a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy is more effective than either treatment independently.
