Multiple classification systems for giant cell tumor of bone have been proposed to help with staging. The Campanacci grading system is most common, which stratifies patients based on clinical and radiological appearances:

- **Grade I -**Intraosseous lesion with a well-circumscribed border and a boney border that is intact.

- **Grade II -**Intraosseous lesion that is more expansile with a thinned cortex but no loss of cortical continuity.

- **Grade III -**Extraosseous radiolucent lesion with cortical breakthrough and soft tissue extension.

Unfortunately, this classification system has limited utility as it does not predict local recurrence or metastatic behavior well. Alternatives have been proposed, but none are universally accepted.
