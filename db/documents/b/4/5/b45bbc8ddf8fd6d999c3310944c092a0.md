Atrial size and function are assessable using various modalities, including echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography (CCT), and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). However, an echocardiogram is a more common choice due to easy availability and safety.

Echocardiogram: LA size is measurable by multiple methods using two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiography.****6 ml/m, and the American Society of Echocardiography considers the cut-off for LA enlargement as greater than 28 ml/m (mild greater than or equal to 28; moderate greater than or equal to 34; severe greater than or equal to 40). Newer three-dimensional echocardiography is increasingly an option to assess LA volume and enlargement.

Electrocardiogram (EKG): The presence of any one of the following EKG findings would warrant a further investigation for LAE in the appropriate clinical context.

- P wave in any lead greater than 0.11 s

- Notched P wave with an interpeak duration exceeding 0.04 s; P mitral

- P wave axis less than 30 degrees
