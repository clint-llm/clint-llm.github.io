Cardiac abscesses are rare in the United States. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogen when the disease is present. The mitral valve is most commonly implicated in patients with native valves and heart tissue. A 2009 study by Murdoch et al. looked at the presentation, etiology and estimated the patient incidence of infective endocarditis at about 15%. In regards to prosthetic tissue or prosthetic valves, the infection tends to be entirely peri-annular, extends to the myocardium, and results in paravalvular abscesses from dehiscence of the valve.

The following are organisms noted to be involved in cardiac abscess formation:

- 
Staphylococcus aureus

- 
Haemophilus species

- Enterococci

- 
Escherichia coli

- Beta-hemolytic streptococci

- 
StreptococcusÂ 
pneumoniae

- Bacteroides species

- Parasitic organisms

- Hydatid cysts
