Worldwide, there are more than 20 million inguinal hernia repairs performed annually. About 800,000 of these areÂ performed in the United States. These statistics make inguinal hernias one of the most common medical conditions encountered by a general surgeon. The ureter is a retroperitoneal organ, and ureteral involvement with an inguinal hernia is rare. Only about 140 cases of ureteral inguinal hernia were reported through 2009.
