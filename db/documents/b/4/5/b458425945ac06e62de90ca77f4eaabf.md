Most patients diagnosed with otitis externa will receive outpatient management. The mainstay of uncomplicated otitis externa treatment usually involves topical antibiotic drops and pain control. Pain can be intense and severe; therefore, it should be managed appropriately. Acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been proven to be adequate for mild to moderate pain. Also, opioids (e.g., oxycodone or hydrocodone) are recommended for severe pain and should be prescribed in a limited amount since symptoms for uncomplicated OE should improve within 48 hours of initiating topical antibiotic therapy. If there is no improvement in pain within 48 to 72 hours, a reassessment by a primary care clinician is strongly recommended.

In general, antibiotic otic drops are safe and well-tolerated. Their safety and efficacy compared to placebo have been proven with excellent results in randomized trials and meta-analyses. Some studies have shown that topical antibiotic drops containing steroids may decrease inflammation and secretions, and hasten pain relief.

Common topical antibiotics indicated for otitis externa include:

- Polymyxin B, neomycin, and hydrocortisone 3 to 4 drops to the affected ear four times a day

- Ofloxacin 5 drops to the affected ear twice daily

- Ciprofloxacin with hydrocortisone 3 drops to the affected ear twice daily

Patients with marked edema of the ear canal require placement of an ear wick (compressed hydrocellulose or ribbon gauze) to facilitate medication delivery and reduce ear canal edema.

If perforation of the tympanic membrane is suspected, neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone drops, alcohols, and ototoxic drops (aminoglycosides) should be avoided. Fluoroquinolones have no ototoxicity and are the only FDA-approved drug for middle ear use; therefore, they are recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated OE with associated tympanic membrane perforation.

Although not typically done in the primary care setting, aural toilet or cleansing of the external ear canal is recommended for the treatment of acute OE by the American Academy of Otorhinolaryngology. Gentle lavage or suctioning should be performed only if there is no evidence or suspicion of tympanic membrane perforation. Also, it should be avoided in patients with a history of diabetes because it can potentially induce malignant otitis externa.

Oral antibiotics have not been proven to be beneficial,

- Patients with diabetes and increased morbidity

- Patients with HIV/AIDS

- Suspected malignant otitis externa

- Concomitant acute otitis media

Topical antifungal agents are not considered a first-line treatment for OE. They are only recommended if fungal etiology is suspected by otoscopic examination or culture results.
