Bupropion is an aminoketone antidepressant with a mechanism that is not fully understood.

The onset of the therapeutic effect of bupropion usually occurs in the second week of taking the medication. Peak serum concentration is 2 hours for immediate release, 3 hours for sustained release, and 5 hours for extended-release. The duration of action is 1 to 2 days. The gastrointestinal (GI) tract absorbs bupropion rapidly, with a volume of distribution of roughly 20 L/kg to 47 L/kg. Eighty-four percent of the drug will be protein-bound.

Bupropion is metabolized in the liver by CYP2B6 to hydroxybupropion. Non-CYP metabolism follows to form erythrohydrobupropion and threohydrobupropion. These metabolites are active, with potency in 20 to 50% of the parent compound. Finally, a glycinated conjugate forms, and this undergoes renal elimination. Ten percent of the drug's elimination is in the feces, and 87% in the urine.
