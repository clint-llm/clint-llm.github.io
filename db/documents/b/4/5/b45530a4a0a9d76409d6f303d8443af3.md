**Lupus erythematosus (LE)**:

Clinically, LE presents more commonly on the face and proximal extremities, while SPTCL usually shows on the lower extremities, upper extremities, and trunk. Findings such as fever and hepatosplenomegaly may favor SPTCL. However, they can also sometimes be observed in LE.

Histologically, LEP and SPTCL may display many of the same features, most notably involvement of the epidermis. More often, LEP shows interface change, a mixture of CD4 and CD8 T-cells, lymphoid follicles or B-cell aggregates, aggregates of CD123+ plasmacytoid dendritic cells, plasma cell aggregates and intradermal mucin. A low Ki67 proliferation index in the T-cells rimming the adipocytes is another useful feature for distinguishing SPTCL from LEP, as is the lack of cytologically atypical T-cells

**Primary cutaneous gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma:**

Primary cutaneous gamma delta T-cell lymphoma has a preference for middle-aged adults, and the lesions may be more superficial with surface ulceration

Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type: May sometimes present with subcutaneous involvement.  In contrast to SPTCL, this entity is positive for EBV
