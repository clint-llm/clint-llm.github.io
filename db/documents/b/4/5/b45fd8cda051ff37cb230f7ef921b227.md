The abdominal wall is a complex organ with many functions that contribute to a patient's quality of life. The anatomical core of the anterolateral abdominal wall is mainly comprised of 4 paired symmetrical muscles. Classically the anterolateral abdominal wall has been described as separate layers from superficial to deep as follows:

- Skin

- Subcutaneous tissues (further divided into the more superficial Camper’s fascia and the deeper Scarpa’s fascia)

- External oblique muscle

- Internal oblique muscle

- Transversus abdominis muscle

- Transversalis fascia

- Parietal peritoneum

Each component has its unique contribution to the abdominal wall and will be further described in this review.
