Monocytes are a critical component of the innate immune system. They are the source of many other vital elements of the immune system, such as macrophages and dendritic cells. Monocytes play a role in both the inflammatory and anti-inflammatory processes that take place during an immune response. Monocytes, and their abundance or lack thereof, can provide significant identifying clues for the diagnosis of several hematologic disorders and inflammatory and immune disorders.
