Tracheobronchial tear or laceration or injury is an uncommon injury to the tracheobronchial tree, usually involving the trachea or both the right and left main stem bronchi, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. For this discussion, tracheobronchial tears could be defined as a partial or complete laceration or puncture anywhere in the tracheobronchial tree secondary to a blunt or penetrating trauma or due to iatrogenic interventions.

Almost 80% of the tracheobronchial injuries in blunt trauma are expected to cause death on the site or during transport to the hospital, given multiple severe associated injuries. However, outcomes appear to be improving following better pre-hospital management.
