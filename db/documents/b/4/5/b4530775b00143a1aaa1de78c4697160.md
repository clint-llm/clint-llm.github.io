The word "endophthalmitis" can be broken down in greek to "interior-eye-inflammation" and is used to describe an infection of the vitreous and/or the aqueous humor within the eye. An intraocular infection has devastating consequences, leading to decreased vision and possibly irreversible blindness. The interior of the eye is a sterile environment. Still, it can suffer compromise by exogenous sources such as penetrating trauma and surgery or endogenous sources via bacteria in the patient's circulatory system. Endophthalmitis results from either bacteria or fungi invading and multiplying within the vitreous or aqueous humor. If bacterial endophthalmitis is diagnosed in a timely fashion and is treated accordingly with the proper antibiotic, patients can preserve their vision and make a full recovery. Given the time-sensitive nature of bacterial endophthalmitis, it is of the utmost importance for healthcare providers to be able to recognize this ocular malady and put the patient on the quickest path to recovery.
