Contrecoup brain injury is one type of traumatic brain injury of which several others may coexist in a particular patient. Falls and vehicular accidents are the most common etiologies. These injuries predominate in males at younger ages with a more even gender distribution in older adults. Intracerebral hemorrhage occurs in 13 to 48% of adults with traumatic brain injury. Of these patients, 13 to 77% have contrecoup hemorrhages which most often occur with an occipital and temporal impact.
