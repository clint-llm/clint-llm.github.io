The virus is transmitted into the subcutaneous tissue of the host via the bite of an infected mosquito. The virus then begins replication and synthesis of RNA and protein, usually in the local lymph nodes.Â  Viremia ensues, and if the viral load is high enough, the virus may translocate into the central nervous system across the blood-brain barrier resulting in cerebral and meningeal inflammation and necrosis.
