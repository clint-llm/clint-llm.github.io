The primary role of ESIs is to treat cervical or lumbosacral radicular pain, and in certain cases, bypass the need for operative intervention. Previous investigations into the efficacy of ESIs, including case series, retrospective studies, prospective clinical trials, and systematic reviews, have limitations, including heterogeneous methods and broad inclusion criteria. Published reviews often include a variety of ESI delivery routes, including transforaminal, interlaminar, and caudal, and also include a wide variety of indications in addition to radicular pain, such as axial back pain, failed back syndrome, and spinal stenosis.

Recent studies, including several reviews and meta-analyses, have shown that transforaminal and interlaminar epidural steroid injections can provide reliable pain relief for patients with low back pain associated with radicular symptoms, but not axial back pain.

The studies for cervical ESIs have similarly heterogeneous methods and outcome measures. There is more evidence for interlaminar cervical ESIs than for transforaminal. The evidence demonstrates durable pain relief and improved disability measures at 12 to 24 months. Several of these studies required multiple injections, and there was similar efficacy between the epidural steroid injection with local anesthetic versus local anesthetic alone. The indications included radicular pain, disk herniation, cervical spinal stenosis, and cervical post-surgery syndrome.
