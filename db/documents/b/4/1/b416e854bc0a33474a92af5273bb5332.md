Always consider treating for L. monocytogenes in the following patient populations:

- Neonates (Usually younger than 29 days old)

- Elderly

- Immunocompromised

- Pregnant women

Listeria meningitis presents with fever, neck stiffness, headache, altered mental status, neurological deficits, and other classic signs of meningitis. The patient may demonstrate a positive Brudzinski's or Kernig's sign on physical exam. The patient may have an altered mental status and may not be alert and oriented to their name, location, and date. Inquire about the use of stomach acid suppressors as they increase the risk of L. monocytogenes infection.

Pregnant women or otherwise healthy adults may present with general "flu-like" illness including fever, diarrhea, headache, chills, nausea, vomiting, myalgias. Although, some patients may be completelyÂ asymptomatic.

For additional history, ask about any food the patient has recently ingested, particularly milk, soft cheeses, and cold deli meats or hot dogs.
