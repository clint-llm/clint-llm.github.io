If the macular edema persists for a longer duration (more than six months), the retinal architecture can have visually disturbing changes. There may be cyst formation, occurrences of a lamellar hole, or, uncommonly, a full-thickness macular hole, schitic spaces, fibrosis, and scarring both from edema and underlying uveitis. Once fibrosis and scarring occur, visual prognosis is usually poor. Therefore,Â one should aim at treating edema earlier to prevent long-term sequelae.
