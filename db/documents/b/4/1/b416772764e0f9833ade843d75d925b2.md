Preventing preterm birth, one of the principal complications of twins, needs to be a clinical focus. Unlike women with single pregnancies at risk for preterm birth based on prior obstetric history, intramuscular weekly progesterone from 16 to 36 weeks, or cerclage for short or shortening cervix, neither intramuscular progesterone nor the placement of cervical cerclage reduces the risk of preterm labor in twin pregnancies identified to be at exceptional risk based on abbreviated cervical length or prior history of preterm birth. However, vaginal progesterone may be helpful based on preliminary understanding based on limited research data. Women with twin gestation who have preterm birth before 34 weeks may be offered supplemental progesterone for subsequent single pregnancies because preterm labor etiologies unique to plural pregnancy (for example, excessive uterine distention) may not be a principal explanation and, as such, recur in future pregnancies.
