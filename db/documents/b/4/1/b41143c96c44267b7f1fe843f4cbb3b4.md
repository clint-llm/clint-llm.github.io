Asystole is identified on cardiac monitoring. In asystole, there is no waveform present on the cardiac monitor, only an isoelectric “flat” line. This includes a lack of P-waves, QRS complexes, and T-waves.

An arterial blood gas and potassium levels should be obtained stat. If available, an echocardiogram can be done to document the absence or presence of heart wall motion.
