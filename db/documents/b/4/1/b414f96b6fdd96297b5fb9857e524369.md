Cilostazol is a quinolone derivative primarily used to treat intermittent claudication due to peripheral vascular disease, the FDA-approved indication. Cilostazol is also indicated for secondary prevention in patients with a history of transient ischemic attacks or non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke. Cilostazol improves walking distance by promoting vasodilation and antiplatelet activity with inhibition of phosphodiesterase III and subsequent increases in available cAMP. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and use of cilostazol and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in monitoring the adverse effects of the drug.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanisms of action of cilostazol.
- Describe the adverse effects of cilostazol.
- Review and select appropriate monitoring of cilostazol.
- Summarize how the interprofessional team can collaborate to optimize therapeutic results with cilostazol.
