Rectal bleeding, or hematochezia, is a frequently encountered problem in the outpatient setting. It can herald a pathology in the proximal lower gastrointestinal tract, but it can also be from diseases specific to the rectal region, such as hemorrhoids, fissures, proctitis, and anorectal malignancy. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of rectal bleeding and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of rectal bleeding.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of rectal bleeding.
- Outline the management options available for rectal bleeding.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of rectal bleeding and improve outcomes.
