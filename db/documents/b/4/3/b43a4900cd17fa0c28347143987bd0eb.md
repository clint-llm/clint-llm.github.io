Communication between members of the healthcare team regarding this vulnerable patient population is invaluable in improving patient-centered care and outcomes. Prompt recognition of vital sign abnormalities by nursing and immediate physician notification can help reduce delays in diagnosis or misdiagnosis. Identification of social stressors contributing to or causing the patient's presentation with subsequent referral to case management professionals or social support services prevent bounce-back visits and readmission. Recognition of traumatic causes of headache by members of the healthcare team can lead to a referral to resources for safe-houses and alerting law enforcement authorities. Though healthcare professionals are not mandated reporters of domestic abuse or intimate partner violence, screening for potential abuse is imperative in these patients as the abuser likely presents a danger to the newborn child.
