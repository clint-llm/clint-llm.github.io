Stroke is the primary cause of disability and a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Stroke has a burden of 122 million disease-adjusted life years, with gradual increasing incidences.

The risk of stroke recurrence is 10Â to 15%; hence regular follow up is advised. Early initiation of rehabilitative care is also recommended. Patients with significant neurological deficits have a worse prognosis. The final prognosis depends on various factors including, age, the severity of the stroke, etiology of stroke, location, structures involved, associated risk factors, co-morbidities, and the management.
