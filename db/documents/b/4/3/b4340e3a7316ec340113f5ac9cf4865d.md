Given the involvement of EGFR in the pathology of cancers, EGFR inhibitors have been considered as potential therapeutic agents for cancer. Currently, 2 mechanisms of inhibition are used to inhibit EGFR:

- Anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies

- Anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (cetuximab, panitumumab, erlotinib, and gefitinib) act as competitive inhibitors of EGFR ligand binding

- EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors

- EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib, erlotinib, brigatinib, lapatinib) are small molecules that bind and inhibit the EGFR intracellular tyrosine kinase, which prevents further downstream activation

These therapies have been approved for treatment of some cancers, including lung cancer and colon cancer.   A side effect of both classes of medications is a papulopustular eruption, seen in 90% of patients.

Although these treatments are promising, resistance is often seen. The T790M Mutation and MET oncogene are the 2 primary sources of resistance.
