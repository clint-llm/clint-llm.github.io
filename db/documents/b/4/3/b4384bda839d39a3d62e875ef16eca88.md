Usually, patients will present with a recent stroke (slurred speech, cranial nerve deficits, limb weakness, or visual disturbances), which either has resolved or should be expected to improve within 48 hours, otherwise known as a transient ischemic attack. Typically, history and physical examination are notable for a patient in their 70s and 80s because they may have a history of smoking, high lipid profile, and sedentary lifestyle. It is imperative to realize that carotid artery atherosclerotic disease is not a segmental disease; rather, it has the propensity to involve other arteries in the human body. Of concern are the coronary arteries. Hence, it is prudent for this patient to undergo a cardiac evaluation should surgical intervention be contemplated in treating the degree of stenosis.
