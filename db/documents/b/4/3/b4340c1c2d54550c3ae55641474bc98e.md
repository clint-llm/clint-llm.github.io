Branchial cleft cysts are lined with stratified squamous epithelium and may contain keratinous debris inside the cyst. In some cases, the cyst wall is lined by ciliated columnar epithelium resulting in more mucoid contents. Lymphoid tissue is typically present surrounding the epithelial lining. If the cyst is infected or ruptured, inflammatory cells can be identified in the cavity or stroma.
