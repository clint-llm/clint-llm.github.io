Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are a group of rare tumors that can occur anywhere along the digestive tract, but most commonly occur in the stomach or small intestine. GISTs most commonly occur later in life but can occur at any age. The average age at diagnosis is in the 60s. When GISTs do occur in children, they are often due to rare heritable genetic conditions.Â The most common signs and symptoms associated with GISTs are bleeding of the digestive tract or abdominal pain and fullness. Bleeding of the digestive tract presents as blood in the stool, dark black stool, or bloody vomiting. Depending on the size and location, it may be possible to see GISTs on CT or MRI, or with endoscopy.

The diagnosis of GIST is based on biopsy results showing one of the typical patterns of cell arrangement along with staining of those cells indicating the appropriate genetic mutations. If possible, surgery is the preferred treatment for GISTs, but this may not be possible if the tumor has metastasized or has grown in a way, making it difficult to remove. In some cases, medications known as tyrosine kinase inhibitors can be used to shrink tumors to make them easier to resect. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are also used after surgery for high-risk GISTs and are typically used for 3 years in these instances.

In cases where surgery is not possible, tyrosine kinase inhibitors indefinitely help suppress the tumor.
