**Myelotomy**

- Placing an incision on the surface of the spinal cord is known as myelotomy.

- A posterior median sulcus approach - for most intramedullary gliomas and ependymomas

- Lateral myelotomy - for vascular tumors such as hemangioblastoma or cavernous malformation

- Limited midline myelotomy - for intractable visceral pain

**Cordotomy**

- Cervical cordotomy - the nociceptive pathways in the lateral spinothalamic tract (anterolateral column) are surgically destroyed at the level of C1-C2. This is done for pain relief in unilateral malignancies and lower limb pathologies.
