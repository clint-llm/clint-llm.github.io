The traumatic open abdomen is usually managed by an interprofessional team that includes a general surgeon, trauma surgeon, wound care nurse, radiologist and an infectious disease consultant. The key is to allow the edema to subside and prevent any infection before one undertakes final closure of the abdomen. Many of these patients may require parenteral nutrition and hence a dietary consult is necessary. The outcomes depend on many factors including extent of the injury, comorbidity, patient age, number of organs involved and immune status.
