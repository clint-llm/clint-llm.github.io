The anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap is a versatile flap with broad indications, and it can cover almost any defect in the body from head to foot. It has become a workhorse flap in reconstructive plastic surgery and has a very high success rate of more than 95% when performed by an experienced team. This activity outlines the use of ALT flaps in reconstructive microsurgery and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with difficult and chronic non-healing wounds.

**Objectives:**
- Review the anatomy of the anterolateral thigh flap and outline its indications for use in reconstructive microsurgery.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in the harvest of the anterolateral thigh flap.
- Summarize the potential complications and clinical significance of the anterolateral thigh flap.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication in the management of difficult and chronic wounds, and improve patient outcomes following anterolateral thigh flap reconstructive surgery.
