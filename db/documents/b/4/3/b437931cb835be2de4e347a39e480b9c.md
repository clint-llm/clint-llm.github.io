**Procedure**

Common patient experiences during the vasectomy include pain at the surgical site and pain and pressure within the abdomen. Select patients can become nauseous and experience lightheadedness. The proceduralist can encounter bleeding or difficulty isolating the vas deferens.

**Post-procedure**

Early: Hematospermia is infrequent and resolves without intervention.

Late: The risk of chronic scrotal pain is believed to be about 1% requiring further management.
