Educating factory workers on the clinical symptoms and signs of the disease is very important in preventing bagassosis. Early recognition of the disease leads to immediate separation of the worker from the offending dust leading to complete recovery. Patients should be informed of warning symptoms of recurring disease or worsening features indicative of lung fibrosis and advised to seek medical care urgently. Workers should also receive training on the importance of personal protective equipment, and its use should be mandatory. Work schedules should encourage the rotation of patients working close to bagasse to limit contact. Patients and their coworkers should also be informed that the diseaseÂ is not contagious; however, other workers may be exposed to the same environment.
