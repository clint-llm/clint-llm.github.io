Proteinuria is the hallmark of diabetic nephropathy. The absence of retinopathy makes diabetic nephropathy less likely in T1DM.

The scenario is more difficult in T2DM than with T1DM. The exact time of the onset of T2DM is unclear in most patients. History and physical exam play a crucial role in diagnosing diabetic nephropathy in T2DM.

The criteria for diagnosis include:

- Elevated blood pressure

- Progressive decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR)

- Persistent albuminuria (greater than 300 mg/d) on at least two visits 3-6 months apart.

Urine analysis is used to quantify urea, creatinine, and protein. Microscopy is done to rule out a nephritic cause. Serum and urine electrophoresis is done to rule out multiple myeloma, and renal ultrasound is done to assess the kidney size. A renal biopsy is done when the diagnosis is not clear.
