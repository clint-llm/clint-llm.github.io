Patent foramen ovale closure is not necessary for all patients. However, there are a select number of patients who benefit significantly from PFO closure. The sequelae in this population are many times more devastating especially in those with debilitating strokes. Therefore, it is essential for primary care providers to recognize the indications for PFO closure and refer appropriately. Knowing thatÂ PFOs >25 mm usually are not amenable to percutaneous management and more often than not require surgical closure is critical information to share with the patient.
