The pectoral nerve (Pecs) block I and II are a novel technique to block the pectoral nerves, intercostal nerves 3 to 6, intercostobrachial nerves and the long thoracic nerve. These blocks can be used to provide analgesia for a variety of anterior thoracic wall surgeries, most commonly breast surgery. The technique is simple for the clinician to perform and requires little or no sedation in the pre-operative holding area. Blanco et al. first described the Pecs I block in 2011 as a high volume interfascial block between the pectoralis major muscle and pectoralis minor muscle, targeting the lateral pectoral nerves.
