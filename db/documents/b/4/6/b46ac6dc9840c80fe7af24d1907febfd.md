Megaloblastic anemia (MA) encompasses a heterogeneous group of anemias characterized by the presence of large red blood cell precursors called megaloblasts in the bone marrow. This condition is due to impaired DNA synthesis, which inhibits nuclear division. Cytoplasmic maturation, mainly dependent on RNA and protein synthesis, is less impaired. This leads to an asynchronous maturation between the nucleus and cytoplasm of erythroblasts, explaining the large size of the megaloblasts. This activity reviews the cause and presentation of megaloblastic anemia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of megaloblastic anemia.
- Describe the diagnostic approach towards the evaluation of patients with megaloblastic anemia.
- Summarize the complications of megaloblastic anemia.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by megaloblastic anemia.
