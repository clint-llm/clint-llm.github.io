Most cases of MTLE are sporadic in occurrence, although familial forms are not uncommon.

Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is the most common histopathological abnormality found in patients with drug-resistant TLE. In a European series of 9523 patients with epilepsy undergoing surgery, HS was identified in 36.4%,  long-term epilepsy-associated tumors (LEAT) in 23.6%, and focal cortical dysplasias (FCD) in 19.8%.
