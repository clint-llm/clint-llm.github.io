Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome (HHS) is a clinical condition that arises from a complication of diabetes mellitus. This problem is most commonly seen in type 2 diabetes. Won Frerichs and Dreschfeld first described the disorder around 1880. They described patients with diabetes mellitus with profound hyperglycemia and glycosuria without the classic Kussmaul breathing or acetone in the urine seen in diabetic ketoacidosis. This clinical condition was formerly called non-ketotic hyperglycemic coma, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic non-ketotic syndrome, and hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma (HONK).

Diabetes mellitus is a clinical condition associated with hyperglycemia as the main metabolic disorder.

In type 1 diabetes, there is the autoimmune destruction of the beta cells in the pancreas. Only about 5% to 10% of all diabetes falls into this category. The most common complication of type 1 diabetes is diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Type 2 diabetes accounts for about 90% to 95% of diabetes cases.

HHS is a serious and potentially fatal complication of type 2 diabetes.

The mortality rate in HHS can be as high as 20%, which is about 10 times higher than the mortality seen in diabetic ketoacidosis.
