Trauma is the leading cause of death worldwide. In the United States, trauma is the leading cause of death in young adults and accounts for ten percent of death in all men and women. In the U.S., there are approximately 50 million visits to the emergency department annually related to trauma. The most common causes of mortality in trauma victims include hemorrhage, cardiopulmonary arrest, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes.

The assessment of trauma victims requires an organized and systematic approach. When caring for a trauma victim, physicians, nurses, and support staff must work together and communicate effectively. The goal of assessing trauma victims is identifying immediate life threats and stabilizing the patient.
