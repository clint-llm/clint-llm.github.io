In particular, vascular ultrasound may lead to several artifacts that complicate the evaluation of pathology. Artifacts are secondary to both limitations of instrumentations and incorrect instrument settings. Recognition of artifacts helps prevent misdiagnosis.

Aliasing causes a wrap-around defect on the doppler US display. When the blood flow velocity is too high for the selected velocity range, the peak velocity will be cut-off and displayed on the opposite edge of the spectrum. On color doppler, aliasing causes a change from one color to the opposite color, such as blue to red, with no corresponding black stripe to indicate a reversal of flow. Aliasing or ”wrap-around” artifact may be eliminated by increasing the velocity scale.

If the velocity scale is set too high relative to the speed of blood, areas of low-velocity flow may not be detected. It is important for the technologist always to check the velocity setting, as slow flow areas can be easily misdiagnosed as thrombosis.

Increasing gain on the ultrasound machine makes structures appear more echogenic on grayscale imaging. A high gain may cause a ‘blooming’ phenomenon; this occurs when the color doppler is turned on.

Although spectral broadening is normal during turbulent flow and at branching points, its appearance may be secondary to many artifacts. Too large of a doppler sample volume compared to vessel size may cause spectral broadening, as the inclusion of slow velocity near the vessel wall and faster velocity in the middle of the vessel is recorded. Smaller vessels are more prone to this artifact given the limit of the smallest doppler sample volume that can be set. Placing the doppler sample near the edge of the vessel wall will also cause spectral broadening due to the inclusion of slower blood flow velocity near the wall.
