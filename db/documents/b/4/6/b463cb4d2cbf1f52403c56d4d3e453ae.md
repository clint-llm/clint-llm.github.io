The following criteria should be kept in mind when labeling the labor as abnormal:

**First Stage Protraction and Arrest**

- **Latent Phase Protraction:**
- **In nulliparas women:**greater than at least 20 hours
- **In multiparas women:**greater than at least 14 hours
- ****Due to its variable and slow progression, latent phase protraction alone should not be an indication for cesarean delivery.

- **Active Phase (once 6 cm cervical dilation is achieved)**
- **No cervical dilation after 4 hours of adequate contractions with ruptured membranes**
- **No cervical dilation after 6 hours of inadequate contractions, with ruptured membranes, despite oxytocin administration**

**Second Stage Protraction and Arrest**

- **For nulliparous women:**more than 3 hours without epidural or 4 hours with an epidural

- **For multiparous women:**more than 2 hours without epidural or 3 hours with an epidural

- Longer durations may be appropriate with reassuring maternal and fetal status and the continued descent of the fetal presenting part
