It is essential to note that not everyone exposed to environmental antigens will generate a strong immune reaction described above. Certain people, known as ‘atopics,’ have a genetic predisposition for developing type one hypersensitivity responses to antigens in the environment. Clinically, the manifestations of this type one hypersensitivity reaction are usually due to the actions of the released chemical mediators such as histamine, leukotrienes, and other cytokines. Histamine release causes increased vascular permeability, smooth muscle constriction, and mucus secretion. Leukotrienes B4, C4, D4, and E4 are also often secreted and responsible for chemotaxis, inflammation, and anaphylaxis. Furthermore, if in enough quantity, histamine and other mediators can cause systemic vascular effects such as vasodilation and increased vessel permeability, causing hypotension and edema.

The manifestations can occur in many different areas of the body. Involvement of the upper airway can cause many patients to suffer from mild seasonal allergies or allergic rhinitis. Due to repeated inhalation exposure to pollen and other outdoor antigens, type one hypersensitivity occurs, and mast cell degranulation causes epiphora, rhinorrhea, cough, and other symptoms. Additionally, the involvement of the lower airway in patients with atopic asthma experiences an immune response to aeroallergens resulting in airway smooth muscle constriction, increased mucus production and inflammation that manifests as obstructive lung disease. The skin can often be involved, and due to vasodilation and dermal edema, urticaria or ‘wheals’ can be evident.

Immunoglobulin E has also been implicated in the defense against parasitic organisms such as helminths. Helminthic infections are usually the result of soil transmission and infect up to one-third of people worldwide.

As depicted in this article, Immunoglobulin E has a specific biochemical structure and function that guides its unique role in disease processes such as Type I hypersensitivity reactions, helminthic infections, and more. The research in the past 50 years regarding IgE has established a better idea of its role in disease. Not only has this aided in a more in-depth clinical understanding of IgE-related health disorders, but it has even spurred novel treatment modalities. A humanized monoclonal antibody named omalizumab has been engineered, which targets the IgE antibody, thus rendering it ineffective in producing associated symptoms. This drug has been shown to provide benefits and relief in patients with moderate to severe asthma and intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis.
