Infrainguinal occlusive diseases are one of the commonest diseases faced by patients worldwide. The comorbidities, and atherosclerotic etiology of most, result in an increased chance of limb loss, cerebrovascular and cardiovascular complications.

Some of the less common diseases which cause lower extremity arterial insufficiency symptoms are atheroembolism and Buerger disease.

Arterial occlusive diseases produce signs and symptoms based on the site of artery stenosis or occlusion. In the lower limb, the most common symptoms are intermittent claudication, rest pain, and gangrene.

These are classified according to different stages, using various established classifications, including Fontaine, Rutherford, Wagner, UT, PEDIS, SVS WIfI.

The arteries involved are mainly those inferior to the inguinal ligament, which include,

- Femoral artery branch of the external iliac artery

- Popliteal artery

- Infrapopliteal arteries, including posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis artery
