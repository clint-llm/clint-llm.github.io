**Hearing Impairment:**Pendred syndrome patients have sensorineural hearing loss that is broad and can range from mild to profound.

Vestibular manifestations are usually not obvious but may be noticed during progressive hearing loss period or in performances needing motor skills and balance.

**Thyroid:**Euthyroid goiter is the typical presentation of Pendred syndrome.

Since Iodide organification is not solely dependent on pendrin, patients usually have partial iodide organification defects.

**Renal System:**Patients with Pendred syndrome might develop life-threatening metabolic alkalosis due to acid-base balance abnormalities.
