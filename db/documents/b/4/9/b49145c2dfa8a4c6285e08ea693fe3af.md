Biliverdin is considered a waste product of heme degradation. When red blood cells lyse, either due to hemolytic diseases or by natural apoptosis, heme get released. The heme is metabolized by heme oxygenase using three molecules of oxygen and seven electrons and producing biliverdin IX-alpha, carbon monoxide, and ferrous iron. The biliverdin IX-alpha undergoes metabolism to bilirubin IX-alpha via NADPH-dependent biliverdin reductase. The bilirubin IX-alpha is initially in the unconjugated, fat-soluble, indirect form. It gets conjugated in the liver via UDP-glucuronosylÂ transferase.
