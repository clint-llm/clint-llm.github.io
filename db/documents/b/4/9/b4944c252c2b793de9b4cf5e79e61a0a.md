As a result of mutations within the hepatocellular system, individuals have impaired bile formation resulting in impairment of the mechanisms of secretion, which results in signs and symptoms of cholestasis. Three known subtypes exist, the first two PFIC1 and PFIC2, often present within the first few months after birth, while PFIC3 often presents early in childhood. Three known genes have been discovered that are responsible for this condition. Just as PFIC1 and PFIC 2 present early in life, they also share a defective gene, ATP8B1, and ABCB11. On the contrary, these aforementioned genes are thought to be intact in PFIC3, rather this variant has defects in ABCB4, a gene involved in the production of a protein known as multi-drug resistant 3 which is part of a group of proteins known as “flippases” which assist in translocation of a variety of phospholipids from cell membranes into the bile.
