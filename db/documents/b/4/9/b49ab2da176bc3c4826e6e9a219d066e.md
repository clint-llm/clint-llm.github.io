A Mastocytoma is a tumor of mast cells, which are derived from myeloid stem cells and located in connective tissues, predominantly in the skin and mucosal linings. The cytoplasmic granules of mast cells are filled with histamines, peptides and other cytokines which play an active role in immune responses, especially in allergic and anaphylactic reactions.

Clonal proliferation of neoplastic mast cells can lead to localized and systemic manifestations, categorized under the term 'mastocytosis' and classified as a myeloproliferative disorder in the WHO classification of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues. Majority of patients with mastocytosis have skin involvement, and while the cutaneous disease is localized to the skin, systemic mastocytosis requires the participation of one or more extracutaneous organ. In adults, the disease tends to be chronic and systemic while the purely cutaneous disease is usually seen in childhood. Cutaneous mastocytosis can range from solitary mastocytoma to diffuse erythrodermic mastocytosis, most commonly presenting as maculopapular lesions known as urticaria pigmentosa (UP)
