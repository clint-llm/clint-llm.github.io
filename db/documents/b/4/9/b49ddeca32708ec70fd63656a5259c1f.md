Symptoms of ectropion may include foreign body sensation, hyperemia, epiphora, exposure keratitis, and corneal ulceration. Anterior lamellar shortening is often the primary cause of cicatricial ectropion; any associated connective tissue or other medical disorders must be addressed, controlled, and stabilized before definitive surgical correction is considered.

Patients with congenital, paralytic, mechanical, or involutional ectropion often require different surgical treatments to correct the ectropion and restore normal lower lid position and function. Accurately identifying the etiology before planning any surgical intervention is essential. For example, medial tendon laxity and ectropion of the punctum will require specific procedures to correct, in addition to the eyelid repositioning surgery.
