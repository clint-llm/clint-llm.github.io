Although the median provides a measure of the middle of the data, it may not always be the best measure. Sometimes the mean may be the more desirable attribute to have. Statistical analysis tends to be more robust and may be simpler to compute with the mean value.

There are cases where neither the median nor the mean is a good measure of the middle of the data. The median and mean are better measures when the data has one prominent peak; it is unimodal. When the data has two or more prominent peaks (e.g., bimodal, trimodal, multimodal), the median may not provide the best information. Imagine a curve that looks like two hills on either side of a valley with a bump on the left of the data at the small values and a second bump at the right of the data with large values (a bimodal dataset). The median may mathematically be in the valley if this is where the middle value is, but the median, in this case, may fail to provide the information we find useful, namely where the peaks are and the data clusters.
