Trichilemmal cysts are benign lesions, and they might transform into malignancy on rare occasions. Head and neck are the commonest sites to be affected. Recurrences and metastases have been observed. If the surgeon does not remove the sac completely, then the recurrence rate will be high. Merkel cell carcinoma sometimes might arise from pilar cysts.
