There are many structural variants of the external jugular vein, mostly without clinical significance.  They are important to be cognizant of for head and neck surgeons operating near the external jugular vein.  A documented variant of the origin of the external jugular vein shows the vein forming from the union of retromandibular veins, the anterior jugular vein, and the facial vein.

A related vein is called the vein of Kocher, or the posterior external jugular vein.  It originates in the occipital region and is a tributary of the common facial vein.  It travels anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle, in a similar fashion to the external jugular vein and can be larger than the external jugular vein in some instances. It is important to be aware of this variant for surgical purposes.
