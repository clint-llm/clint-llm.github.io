Morton neuroma is a compressive neuropathy of the forefoot interdigital nerve. Neuropathy is mainly due to compression and irritation at the plantar aspect of the transverse intermetatarsal ligament. It is not a true neuroma as the condition is degenerative rather than neoplastic. It is also referred to as Morton metatarsalgia, interdigital neuritis, Morton entrapment, interdigital neuralgia, interdigital neuroma, interdigital nerve compression syndrome, and intermetatarsal neuroma. The most common locations for interdigital neuromas are between the 3rd and 4th metatarsal heads, termed Morton neuroma.
