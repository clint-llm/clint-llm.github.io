GHB is pharmaceutically manufactured as sodium oxybate for the treatment of narcolepsy. This formulation is considered a Schedule III drug in the United States. In Europe, GHB is also still therapeutically used as an anesthetic and for the treatment of alcohol and opiate dependence.

Withdrawal symptoms have been reported in chronic or dependent users after cessation of the drug. Early or mild symptoms of anxiety, tremors, tachycardia, and insomnia can quickly progress within 24 hours to severe and refractory agitation with autonomic instability. Severe withdrawal symptoms are life threatening and can last up to 15 days. Patients should be treated with benzodiazepines and managed in the intensive care unit.
