The majority of cysts do not need any intervention or follow-up. If a cyst becomes infected, antibiotics are necessary. If a cyst is so large that it is exerting mass effect or pressure on another organ, the two most common procedures for treating simple kidney cysts are (1) aspiration and sclerotherapy and (2) laparoscopic surgery to remove the cyst. Ethanol is most commonly used in sclerotherapy.

Cyst aspiration without sclerotherapy has a high recurrence rate ranging from 20% to 80%. Simple cysts are not treated with surgical exploration.
