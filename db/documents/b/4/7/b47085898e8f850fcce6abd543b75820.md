Approximately one-third of pregnant women suffer from a worsening of their bronchial asthma during pregnancy; in another one-third, asthma severity remains without change; while in the remaining third, their bronchial asthma shows improvement from the basal condition. The explanation of this variability still unexplained.

Symptoms of asthma peak in the late second or early third trimester, but exacerbations are rare during labor and the peripartum period.

Symptoms of bronchial asthma may include chest tightness, wheeze, shortness of breath, and cough. These symptoms are characterized byÂ the following:

- Variability over time and in intensity

- Often are worse at night or in the early morning

- Symptoms are triggered by viral infections (colds), exercise, allergen exposure, changes in weather, laughter, or other irritants

Physical examination in people with bronchial asthma may be normal, but the most frequent physical sign is wheezing on auscultation. Wheezing may be absent in cases of severe bronchial asthma exacerbations as a result of severe reduction of airflow (silent chest).
