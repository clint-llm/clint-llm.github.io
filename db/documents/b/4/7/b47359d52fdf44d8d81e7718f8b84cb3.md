**Narrow Therapeutic Index**

There are an increased response and a steep relationship between dose and concentration. Plasma levels require monitoring in patients with severe renal failure or hepatic disease. Drug overdose could be fatal with flecainide. The prescriber should adjust dosing based on clinical response.

**Monitoring Parameters**

In patients with renal failure or hepatic impairment, it is prudent to monitor EKGÂ and blood pressure and to obtain periodic serum trough concentration. Therapeutic trough concentration is between 0.2 to 1 mcg/ml. Lower trough concentration is sufficient in pediatric patients.
