Patients can present with several complications, a few of which have been discussed above. The most common complication is acute renal failure/urosepsis which is secondary to ureteral reflux caused by neurogenic bladder. It is important to introduce aggressive treatment and surveillance of urologic dysfunction. Many patients will require intermittent catheterization for urinary management. Scoliosis is also a common complication with about 33% of patients affected, followed by chronic pain in 29%, and epilepsy in 12%.
