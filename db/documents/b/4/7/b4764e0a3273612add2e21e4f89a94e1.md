High-resolution CT findings consist of mainly endobronchial plaques, nodules or airway thickening in addition to air-trapping and bronchiectasis. Lung involvement with papillomatosis may show diffuse, poorly defined parenchymal opacities.

Endoscopy may show endobronchial protuberances or atelectasis. CareÂ should be taken when performing biopsy of laryngeal and central endobronchial lesions because of risk of uncontrolled bleeding and airway obstruction.
