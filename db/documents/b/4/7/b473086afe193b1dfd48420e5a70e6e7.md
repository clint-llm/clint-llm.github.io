Achondroplasia is a rare genetic disorder recognized as the most common primary skeletal dysplasia in humans. This form of dysplasia accounts for greater than 90% of cases of disproportionate short stature, also known as dwarfism.

Achondroplasia means “without cartilage formation,” and it is categorized as a physeal (growth plate) dysplasia.

Affected individuals usually present average intelligence and have an estimated mean lifespan of 61 years, about ten years less than the general population.

Achondroplasia is associated with increased mortality in early childhood, otolaryngology problems later in childhood, and increased risk of obesity into adulthood.
