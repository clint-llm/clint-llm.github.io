A 2019 multicenter retrospective study was performed to analyze “the frequency of the types of alopecia in patients consulting at specialist hair clinics and to assess for global variations.”

Over 3000 diagnoses of alopecia were included: 73% were nonscarring, and 27% were scarring.

**Nonscarring alopecia frequency**

- Androgenetic alopecia 37.7%

- Alopecia areata 18.2%

- Telogen effluvium 11.3%

**Scarring alopecia frequency**

- Frontal fibrosing alopecia 10.8%

- Lichen planopilaris 7.6%

- Folliculitis decalvans 2.8%

The frequency of the other alopecia types listed is less than 2%. The article also provides “differences in the frequency of hair disorders” for gender, median age range by gender, and continent.
