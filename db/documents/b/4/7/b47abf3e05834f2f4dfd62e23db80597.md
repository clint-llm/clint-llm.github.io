The tibial nerve,Â an offshoot of the sciatic nerve, innervates the semitendinosus muscle. Proximally, the sacral plexus branches into the sciatic nerve, which involve nerve roots from L4 to S2. The sciatic nerve then travels through the posterior compartment, which branches into the common fibular nerve and the tibial nerve. The tibial nerve, either before or after its separation from the common fibular nerve, innervates the semitendinosus and all other muscles of the posterior compartment of the thigh except for the short head of the biceps femoris.
