Impressions must be thoroughly disinfected to prevent cross infections. After washing the impression to remove residues of saliva and blood, the chosen disinfectant is applied, either by spraying on the impression or immersing it in the disinfectant solution for a specified time.

Hydrocolloids (agar and alginate) and polyether possess hydrophilic features. Therefore, if disinfection guidelines are not followed, it may lead to swelling of the impressions, but when done properly, it does not affect the dimensional stability and accuracy of the impression.

Apart from being used as impression materials, elastomers are also used as permanent soft denture liners in constantly abused tissues.

While continuous attempts to improve impression materials are being made, the ideal one has yet to be developed. Digitization in dentistry provides more restoration options, better esthetics, greater efficiency, and accuracy. New ways for effective and efficient inter-professional and clinician-patient interactions have evolved. Data can be more efficiently used for forensic and epidemiological purposes.
