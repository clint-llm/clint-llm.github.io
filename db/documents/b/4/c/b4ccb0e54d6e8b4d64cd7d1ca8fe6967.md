The spontaneous respiratory drive is among the most vital evolutionary qualities in mammalian existence, and the neurocircuitry and physiology behind the human respiratory drive are complex. While the motivation to inspire oxygen is certainly evident, there is also the consideration that the over-expansion of the lungs via inspiratory drive can be damaging, and therefore requires monitoring and inhibition. Among these interactions, the most widely recognized description of such reflexive respiratory control was first conceptualized by Ewald Hering, and Joseph Breuer in 1868, who illustrated that sustained lung inflation triggers reflexive expiration to prevent over-inflation related lung injury. Since its discovery, the Hering-Breuer reflex (HBR) has been thoroughly investigated within the realm of physiology and pathology and is consistently identical across other mammalian species.

Although adults demonstrated reduced ability to illustrate the Hering Breuer reflex, it is much more prominent among preterm infants and newborns. Furthermore, the HBR may play a vital function, as there are suggestions that it plays a role in controlling lung volume at an early age.

Herein, we discuss the physiologic mechanism behind the Herin-Breuer reflex, the neural circuitry involved, its role in human development, and the clinical and pathologic sequelae associated with malfunctioning with this system.
