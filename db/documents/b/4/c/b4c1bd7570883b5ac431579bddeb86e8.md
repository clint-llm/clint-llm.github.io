The genitofemoral nerve is formed in the midsection of the psoas muscle by the union of branches from the anterior rami of L1 and L2 nerve roots.  The nerve then courses inferiorly within the psoas muscle and finally emerges on the anterior surface of the muscle distally. The nerve then descends inferiorly in the retroperitoneum along the psoas major muscle and courses deeper and on the left to the gonadal vessels, ureter, and the ileocolic vein and artery.

Just before the nerve reaches the inguinal ligament, both the right and left genitofemoral nerves perforate the psoas fascia and then divide into the femoral and genital branches.
