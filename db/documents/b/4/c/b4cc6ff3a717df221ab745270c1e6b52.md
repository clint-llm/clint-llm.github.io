Sodium oxybate is the sodium salt of gamma-hydroxybutyrate(GHB), an endogenous metabolite of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA.

**FDA-approved Indication**

- Sodium oxybate was approved in 2002 by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) treatment in patients with narcolepsy who are seven years of age and older.

- Narcolepsy is a clinical syndrome ofÂ excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucinations.

- Cataplexy is the most severe symptom of narcolepsy, which can result in the impairment of everyday living. If a patient has narcolepsy with cataplexy, the term for this condition is narcolepsy type I (NT1). In patients with narcolepsy, sodium oxybate has been shown to increase slow-wave sleep duration, delta power and improve sleep quality.

**REMS Program**

- Sodium oxybate is limited for distribution to patients enrolled in the drug manufacturer's Risk Evaluation and Mitigation (REMS) program. The program originated to mitigate the risk of abuse and misuse.

- To prescribe sodium oxybate, all prescribers are required to enroll and comply with all requirements of the program. A central pharmacy will only dispense sodium oxybate to patients enrolled in the REMS program who have been counseled on the risks and proper use of sodium oxybate.
