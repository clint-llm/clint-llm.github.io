The incidence of Laryngeal trauma ranges between 1:14000 and 1:30000 of emergency visits. This activity outlines the etiology and epidemiology of laryngeal fracture, it also highlights the clinical presentation of laryngeal fracture, severity grading, and management. It also highlights the role of the inter-professional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of laryngeal trauma/fracture.
- Summarize clinical presentation and clinical grading of laryngeal trauma/fracture. 
- Outline common physical examination findings and endoscopic findings associated with laryngeal trauma/fracture.
- Review the importance of teamwork and monitoring patient for airway compromise or restoration of functions of the larynx in longer-term to reduce complications.
