Lesions that are found to be eyelid papillomas can be observed. If the papilloma is causing irritation or is cosmetically unacceptable for the patient, it can be removed. Most papillomas can be removed with a bedside shave excision. See technique described below. Verruca vulgaris typically responds better to cryotherapy.

One study found intralesional interferon to treat a large eyelid papilloma successfully. A larger study involving 64 patients with eyelid papilloma-like lesions found that using a radiofrequency unit for lesion removal was safe and effective. In this study, 72% of the lesions treated were squamous papillomas.

**Papilloma Excision Technique**

Instill topical tetracaine drop in the ipsilateral eye to prevent eye irritation from the cleaning solution. Use the full strength povidone-iodine solution to clean papilloma area and surrounding eyelid tissue. Place small sterile drape with a hole cut out to isolate eyelid lesion.

Instill 1 mL to 2 mL of lidocaine with epinephrine directly underneath papilloma. Use the least amount of local anesthetic necessary to provide adequate patient comfort.

Using 0.5mm forceps, grasp tissue and elevate gently while using a 15 blade or iris scissor to remove the lesion. Be sure to start cutting at the base of the lesion to remove fully. There should be no need to enter intoÂ deeper tissues. A handheld cautery tool can be used to achieve hemostasis. Typically the remaining defect is small and does not require suturing to approximate the skin. Prescribed antibiotic (i.e., Erythromycin ophthalmic ointment) for the patient to place on healing incision three to four times daily for 1 to 2 weeks until healed to prevent infection.

Consider sending tissue specimen to pathology for evaluation if it has any suspicious characteristics.
