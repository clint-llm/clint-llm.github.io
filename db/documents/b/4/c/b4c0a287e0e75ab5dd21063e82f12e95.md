The evaluation of 5 alpha-RD2 deficiency includes biochemical assays and gene analysis.

**Biochemical Assay**

Traditionally the biochemical test of choice for the diagnosis of 5 alpha-RD2 enzyme deficiency has been the estimation of the ratio between testosterone to DHT after stimulation with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). With this disorder, the children will show an increase in the ratio of testosterone to DHT after hCG administration.

**Gene Analysis**

Human gene SRD5A2 gene encodes for a protein which makes up enzyme 5alpha-RD2 containing 254 amino acids. This variant has more affinity to testosterone than 5alpha-RD1. At least 54 different types of mutations have been seen involving this gene, among which the primary type is missense mutations. The severity of the disease depends on the degree of loss of enzymatic activity due to a gene mutation. About half of these missense mutations result in an enzyme with no functional biological activity, and the rest half of the time, the gene may produce an enzyme with very little measurable biological activity.
