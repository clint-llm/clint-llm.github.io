It may also increase the risk of pyloric stenosis in the newborn. All antibiotics carry a significant risk of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Erythromycin is a motilin agonist, which increases the likelihood of gastrointestinal side effects compared to other antibiotics.

Erythromycin is a cytochrome P-450 inhibitor; this means it carries the potential to interact with a broad range of medications. Given it is an inhibitor of cytochrome P-450, drugs that get metabolized via the cytochrome P-450 system would have increased concentrations, leading to an increased risk of toxicity.

Initially, hepatotoxicity was thought to be more common with erythromycin estolate. However, case reports of jaundice and liver damage have been documented in all formulations of erythromycin. Most cases of erythromycin-induced liver disease are self-limiting; however, rare instances of severe acute hepatic injury leading to acute liver failure and the need for transplantation have been reported. Furthermore, isolated examples of prolonged cholestasis with vanishing bile duct syndrome have been reported. Therefore, patients with erythromycin-induced hepatic injury should be cautioned to avoid further exposure. In addition, it is prudent to avoid using other macrolides in patients with clinically apparent liver injury due to erythromycin.
