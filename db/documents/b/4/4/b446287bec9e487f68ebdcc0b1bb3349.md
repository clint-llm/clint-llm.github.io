Patients with chest pain that is suggestive of pericarditis should seek immediate medical care. Pericarditis can become a life-threatening condition and may lead to compression of the heart. Acute pericarditis usually can not be prevented, but it is treatable. Symptoms of fainting and rapid breathing are signs that pericarditis may be progressing.
