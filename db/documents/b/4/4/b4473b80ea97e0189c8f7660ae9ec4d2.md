Today, resection of a parathyroid adenoma can be done with minimally invasive surgery. The procedure may be done by a general or otolaryngologic surgeon. The monitoring of these patients is usually done by the nurses. While rare, the two major complications after surgery include hypocalcemia injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. In most cases, the patients present with voice change or signs of hypocalcemia within 12 to 24 hours after surgery.
