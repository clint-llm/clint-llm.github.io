Infantile spasms initially are diagnosed in children younger than 12 months of age in 90% of cases. The peak incidence of new diagnoses is between approximately 4 and 7 months of age. There is no predilection for a specific gender or race. When children who are older than 12 months present with spells resembling infantile spasms, they typically are classified as epileptic spasms. Once spasms begin, the natural history is for continued spasms or an increase in spasms over time. Without treatment, the frequency of spasms typically does not wax and wane, such that the patient has long symptom-free periods, as a patient might with other seizure types.
