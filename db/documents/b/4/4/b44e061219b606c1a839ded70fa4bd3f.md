Riehl melanosis typically presents as patchy to diffuse pigmentation, often with a slightly scaly skin surface and satellite pigmented follicular-based macules. The reticular pattern is often observed at the center of the pigmented areas.

Some patients complain of erythema, edema, and pruritus preceding the occurrence of the pigmentation. This inflammatory phase suggests the onset as an ordinary contact dermatitis caused by allergens when they came into contact with the skin.

Different shades of brown could be encountered, depending on the severity of dermatitis, skin type, and causal agents (black, purple, blue-black, pale brown, or gray-brown).

Sites of involvement are variable, depending on the allergen responsible. Pigmented cosmetic dermatitis involves usually the face (forehead, zygomatic and temple regions), whereas textile contact dermatitis more often involves axillary borders; sparing the vault.
