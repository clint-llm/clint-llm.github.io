To defend humanity against the use of such biologic weapons like anthrax ongoing research, surveillance, and awareness of the potential dangers are required. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classifies anthrax as a potential category A agent, which includes the highest priority pathogens that pose the greatest threat to national security. Therefore, recognizing signs and symptoms of this pathogen, understanding its progression, and containing a possible threat are strategies that need to be mastered by a coordinated interprofessional team of physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and government monitoring systems.
