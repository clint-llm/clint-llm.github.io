The main goal of preparation is sterility. Before starting the procedure, the whole chest is shaved and sterilized. The patient is draped based on the institution protocols, and other general anesthesia-related preparations are done. Important landmarks (like jugulum, xiphoid process) are identified and marked before starting the procedure.
