The superior colliculus is on the posterior midbrain, rostral to the inferior colliculus, and caudal to the pineal gland. It has seven internal cell layers, divided into superficial, intermediate, and deep layers. The superficial layers consist of stratum zonale, stratum griseum superficiale, and stratum opticum. These layers respond to bilateral retinal inputs from contralateral visual stimuli and are purely sensory. The intermediate layers consist of the stratum griseum intermedium and the stratum album intermedium, while the remaining deep layers are the stratum griseum profundum and the stratum album profundum. Both of these deeper layers receive various sensory inputs from vision, auditory, and somatosensory pathways and are associated with motor function as well as sensory.

The superior colliculus has motor functions in the generation of eye movements. When head movement is restricted, the superior colliculi are involved in the saccadic motion of the eyes. Otherwise, the superior colliculi are involved in producing gaze shifts, which are initiated by saccades of the eyes, followed by a head movement with the eyes counter-rotating to stabilize. Thus, the superior colliculi are associated with both an oculomotor pathway and a head pathway responsible for producing saccades and movement in the neck muscles, respectively. Important to note is that while the superior colliculus encodes gaze shifts, its function does not include the specific movements needed to accomplish them. The superior colliculus, along with the inferior colliculus, is thought to function to orient the head and eyes toward stimuli that are seen and heard. Other nonmotor functions of the superior colliculus are less studied and include multimodal sensory processing and attention.
