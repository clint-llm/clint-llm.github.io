Typically, the examiner will perform a digital rectal exam first to ensure that no mass or tissue is obstructing the anal canal which could be injured during the insertion of the device. There is insufficient evidence to comment on the efficacy of topical pre-procedure lidocaine application to provide analgesia during anoscopy, but in the absence of known lidocaine allergy, many practitioners consider this a reasonable measure to adopt. The water-soluble lubricant is applied to the anoscope itself pre-insertion to facilitate insertion. This may be accomplished using the topical anesthetic as a de-facto lubricant, thereby providing an opportunity for the lidocaine to be distributed along the path of the anoscope before its introduction. Typically, the device is introduced with the obturator in place which is then removed, allowing the examiner to visualize the anal canal and distal rectum as the anoscope is slowly withdrawn. In the case of slotted anoscopes, which only allow visualization of a portion of the mucosa at the time, the obturator should be reinserted before reinserting or rotating the device due to the discomfort associated with placing traction of the segment of tissue which bulges into the slotted segment.
