Once a diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is made, the management is interprofessional. The goal is to improve the quality of life. A physical therapy consult is recommended because evidence shows that regular physical activity or an exercise program can result in a marked improvement in the symptoms and the quality of life. Nursing will chart and assess the patient's condition along with the pulmonologist. The pharmacist should educate the patient on refraining from smoking and alcohol. The patient may benefit from the use of bronchodilators. To improve nutrition, a dietary consult should be sought. The nurse should educate the patient on the benefits of vaccination as many patients with pulmonary fibrosis do not tolerate lung infections well.

**Outcomes**

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis has a median survival rate of IPF reported in the range of two to five years. The actual range of survival of individual patients is quite large. Up to 20 to 25 percent of patients live beyond 10 years. Most patients have continued dyspnea and limited exercise tolerance with a resultant poor quality of life. Deaths are most common in the winter, even in the absence of any lung infection. Many of these patients develop pulmonary hypertension and are at an increased risk of pulmonary embolism and sudden cardiac death. The prognosis is usually worse for those with severe changes noted on imaging and a lack of response to oxygen.
