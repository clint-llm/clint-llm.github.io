Cromolyn sodium is a mast cell stabilizer that prevents the subsequent release of inflammatory mediators, including histamine and leukotrienes, which cause allergic symptoms and bronchoconstriction.

**Pharmacokinetics**

- This drug is absorbed poorly via oral solution and takes 2 to 6 weeks for onset of action. Similarly, less than 0.07% of administered cromolyn sodium is absorbed from ophthalmic solution or drops.

- The effect of cromolyn sodium on mast cells lasts for approximately 6 hours following administration.

- The bioavailability of cromolyn sodium is 0.5 to 2%, with a half-life of 80 to 90 minutes.

- The majority of the drug (98%) is excreted in the feces unabsorbed, with the remainder excreted in the urine.
