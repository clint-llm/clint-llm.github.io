Alkaptonuria is a rare metabolic disorder with interesting peculiarities. Frontline health providers should consider this diagnosis if parents are concerned for black stained diapers, or if the urinalysis sample darkens upon exposure to air. Unlike the closely associated phenylketonuria and hereditary tyrosinemias, alkaptonuria does not impair cognitive development and growth.
