Foster Kennedy syndrome (FKS) is based on neurological signs characterized by anosmia and vision loss (central scotoma), which may be unilateral or bilateral depending on the stage of the condition. It is defined by compressive optic damage (atrophy) in one eye and contralateral papilledema, resulting from increased intracranial pressure secondary to an intracranial space-occupying lesion.

It is worth noting that the classic presentation of FKS is also found in pseudo-FKS; thus, it is of utmost importance that the attending clinician is astute in selecting and carrying out the proper examination techniques to provide an accurate diagnosis.

There are typically three types of FKS.

Pseudo-FKS has the typical presentation of optic atrophy in one eye and papilledema in the contralateral eye, similar to type 1 FKS.

Meningiomas (See Figures of computerized tomography scans of frontal-temporal meningioma and frontal-sphenoidal meningioma) are space-occupying tumors originating in the central nervous system.

Meningiomas are the most common type of non-malignant tumors found in the brain.

Tumors of the pituitary gland have also been reported to cause FKSÂ and are the second-highest cause of cerebral tumors.
