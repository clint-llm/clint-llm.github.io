Alcoholic ketoacidosis can affect many organ systems and is best managed by an interprofessional team of healthcare workers, including a nurse and clinician. The key is to differentiate alcoholic ketoacidosis from starvation and diabetic-ketoacidosis (DKA). Starvation ketosis is more common than AKA, but starvation ketosis is not often complicated by acidosis. Diabetic ketoacidosis can be confused with AKA. The glucose levels in AKA are rarely above 250 mg/dL. In a hyperglycemic patient, hemoglobin A1C should also be ordered to assess for the presence of uncontrolled blood glucose levels. Also, in AKA, the beta-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate ratio will be much higher with ratios of up to 8:1, whereas in DKA, beta-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate ratios are about 3:1.

Efficient and timely management can lead to enhanced patient outcomes in patients with AKA. However, after adequate treatment, it is equally essential to refer the patient to alcohol abuse rehabilitation programs to prevent recurrence and long-term irreversible damage from alcohol abuse.
