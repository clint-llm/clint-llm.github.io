Ordinarily, the saphenous artery is a vascular branch of the descending geniculate artery that is supplied by the femoral artery. However, some anatomical studies have shown an absent descending genicular artery. In this case, the saphenous artery originates directly from the femoral artery. The saphenous vein also has a multitude of variants that typically subclassify into five different types. The types are dependent on the relationship on whether the vein splits and/or if their location is within the saphenous compartment at the level of the thigh.
