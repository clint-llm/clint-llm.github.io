As is the case with the majority of autoimmune disorders, the precise etiology of Sjogren syndrome is unknown. A genetic predisposition involving the major histocompatibility (MHC) locus is likely with individuals sharing haplotypes in the HLA-DQA_DQB_ region having an increased relative risk, although the diseases are described worldwide. These major histocompatibility haplotypes are hypothesized to result in an aberrant immune response in conjunction with certain environmental triggers. Laboratory studies, as well as some indirect epidemiologic evidence, implicates viruses, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) as participants in disease pathogenesis.
