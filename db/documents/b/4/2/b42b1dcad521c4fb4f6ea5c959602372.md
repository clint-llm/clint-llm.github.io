The risks of chorionic villus sampling are similar to those of amniocentesis and include pregnancy loss, bleeding, infection, rupture of membranes, and uncertain results.

The pregnancy loss rate has decreased with ultrasound guidance and increasing skill and technique; however, chorionic villus sampling has a long learning curve. A systematic review of the complications of chorionic villus sampling determined a total fetal loss of 0.7 percent within 14 days using a transabdominal approach, 1.3 percent within 30 days, and 2 percent for loss anytime during pregnancy. In the amniocentesis group, the total rate of fetal loss within 14 days was 0.6 percent.

With chorionic villus sampling, there is a possibility of identifying confined placental mosaicism, which occurs in 1-2% of cases.

Additionally,Â limb reduction defects and oromandibular hypogenesis have been described in the literature as risks of chorionic villus sampling.

Vaginal spotting has been reported in up to 32% of women and is more common after transcervical CVS.

The incidence of culture failure, leakage of amniotic fluid, or infection after CVS is reported to be less than 0.5%.
