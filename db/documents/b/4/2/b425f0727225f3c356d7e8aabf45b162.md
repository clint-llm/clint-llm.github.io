The clinicians should perform both a detailed history and a methodical, thorough clinical examination to diagnose torticollis and help to determine the management plan.

In reviewing the history of present illness, identifying the characteristics of the torticollis is vital to determine an etiology.  Important aspects include:

- Symptoms associated with torticollis (vomiting, fever or signs of infection, gait disturbances, balance problems, associated headaches, and vision changes)

- Emotional state

- Personal and family context when torticollis occurs in the neonatal period (birth details, the course of the neonatal period, known pathology such as chromosomal alterations, systemic disease, visceral or skeletal malformations, muscle fibrosis, strabismus

- Acute or chronic duration

- Underlying associated pathologic medical conditions

- Permanent versus transient or paroxysmal symptoms

- Recent changes in medication

- Age of onset of the initial episode

-  The age of onset of torticollis makes it possible to immediately distinguish between congenital torticollis (present at birth or during the neonatal period) from acquired torticollis, which would present later in life

- Events leading up to the episode of torticollis (such as recent trauma

- Determining if the torticollis is painful or non-painful is crucial

- Pain present may be bony, central, muscular, or from previous radiation

The physical exam is also important in diagnosing torticollis.  Areas of focus include

- The patient's posture

- Constant or intermittent head tilt

- Presence of any limitation of movement as well as any relieving factors

- Bony or muscular tenderness to palpation

The diagnosis of torticollis is straightforward in the typical form with lateral tilt and contralateral neck rotation, but if the patient presents in spine immobilization by EMS, a rigid form of the head, the inclination or rotation of the head may be isolated.

Moderate and severe forms of torticollis are typically evident from the physical examination.  If left untreated in children, persistent torticollis is unsightly, uncomfortable, and potentially detrimental to the cervical spine and facial development.
