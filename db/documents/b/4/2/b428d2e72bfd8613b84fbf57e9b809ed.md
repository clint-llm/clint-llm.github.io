An embolism is the most common cause of CRAO. The three main types of emboli are cholesterol, calcium, and platelet-fibrin. Both cholesterol and platelet-fibrin emboli typically arise from atheromas in the carotid arteries. Calcium emboli typically arise from cardiac valves. On fundoscopy, calcium emboli appear white, cholesterol emboli (Hollenhorst plaques) appear orange, and platelet-fibrin emboli appear dull white.

In-situ thrombosis also may cause retinal artery occlusion. Thrombi may be due to atherosclerotic disease, collagen-vascular disease, inflammatory states, and/or hypercoagulable states. Predisposing conditions include but are not limited to polycythemia vera, sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, systemic lupus erythematosus, factor V Leiden, prothrombin III mutation, hyperhomocysteinemia, polyarteritis nodosa, giant cell (temporal) arteritis, antiphospholipid syndrome, activated protein C resistance, Behcet disease, and syphilis. Rapid differentiation between thromboembolic versus arteritic processes is important as optimal therapy differs and the rapid administration of steroids for vasculitic causes of CRAO is associated with improved outcomes.
