Pharmacists, physicians, pharmacy technicians, and nurses, etc. must know how to calculate medication doses. There are several formulas that can be used. When in doubt, a second opinion should be sought. Double-checking a calculation with another healthcare team member, e.g., nurses and pharmacists should always be considered if there is any doubt regarding the calculation.
