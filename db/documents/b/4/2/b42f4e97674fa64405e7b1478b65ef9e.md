Beverages containing caffeine are ingested to prevent or relieve drowsiness, stimulate the central nervous system, and improve performance. Regular and chronic use of caffeine produces physical and psychological dependence. The research studies have validated that avoidance of withdrawal symptoms plays a vital role in habitual caffeine consumption in addition to the dread of pure physiologic withdrawal symptoms. Some of the rich sources of caffeine intake are coffee, tea, green tea, yerba mate, energy drinks, caffeinated soda (cola-type), and chocolates (mostly dark).
