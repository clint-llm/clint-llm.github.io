Regardless of the administration route, KCl is used to increase the potassium content of the body. Approximately 98% of all potassium in the body exists within cells, particularly skeletal muscle cells. This intracellular predominance is utilized by all cells for tonicity homeostasis and membrane potential dynamics. In cardiomyocytes and neurons, repolarization occurs through the movement of potassium ions out of cells through channel proteins. Both hypokalemia and hyperkalemia can interfere with normal cardiac electrophysiology, potentially leading to life-threatening arrhythmias. Notably, potassium abnormalities rarely manifest as central nervous system pathologies (e.g., seizures).
