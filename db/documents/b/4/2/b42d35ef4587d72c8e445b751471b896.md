Crisis intervention is a short-term management technique designed to reduce potential permanent damage to an individual affected by a crisis. A crisis is defined as an overwhelming event, which can include divorce, violence, the passing of a loved one, or the discovery of a serious illness. A successful intervention involves obtaining background information on the patient, establishing a positive relationship, discussing the events, and providing emotional support. SAFER-R is a common intervention model used, which consists of stabilization, acknowledgment, facilitate understanding, encouragement, recovery, and referral. SAFER-R helps patients return to their mental baseline following a crisis.

It can be used in conjunction with the Assessment Crisis Intervention Trauma Treatment (ACT), which is a seven-stage crisis intervention model. It consists of assessing the affected person, establishing a relationship, understanding the problem, confronting emotions, exploring coping strategies, implementing a plan, and following up. Utilization of these methods can help restore one’s mental state and prevent any psychological trauma immediately following a crisis. Crisis intervention has also been developed as a possible treatment plan for those with severe mental illnesses.
