The pathophysiology of CSCR is multifactorial, which causes retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) disturbances and circulatory changes in the choroid.

Normally, the RPE keeps the retina in a dehydrated state by pumping out fluid from the subretinal space to the choroid. With the loss of polarity, the pumping reverses and fluid is directed towards the subretinal space. The non-perfusion in the choriocapillarisÂ may lead to the widening of venous channels and increased hydrostatic pressure.

Experiments have shown that intravitreal injection of aldosterone causes dilatation of choroidal veins and congestion, which leads to the accumulation of fluid in the subretinal space.
