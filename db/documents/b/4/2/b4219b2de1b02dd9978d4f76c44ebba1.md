Pleural effusions form as the result of 2 mechanisms: the entry rate of liquid into the pleural space must increase through the visceral pleura, and the exit rate must decrease through the parietal pleura wherein the entry rate of liquid thereby exceeds its removal. Increased entry of liquid into the pleural space may be the result of increased filtration across systemic or pulmonary capillaries, while decreased entry of liquid from the pleural space may be secondary to interference with lymphatic function.

An MPE develops as a result of the above mechanisms and can arise from both direct and indirect involvement of cancer. Direct causes of pleural effusion formation include malignancy interfering with the integrity of the lymphatics system or direct tumor involvement of the pleura.
