Retinal dystrophies (RD) are a group of degenerative disorders of the retina with clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Common presentations include color blindness or night blindness, peripheral vision abnormalities, and subsequent progression to complete blindness in progressive conditions. This activity describes the various entities that fall under the spectrum of retinal dystrophies and highlights the role of genetic testing and counseling in the management of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the differential diagnosis of various disease conditions that are collectively termed as retinal dystrophies. 
- Describe the role of electrophysiology and other diagnostic tests in diagnosing retinal dystrophies.
- Outline current treatment and recent advances in the field of inherited retinal dystrophies.
- Describe the role of genetic testing and genetic counseling in the management of retinal dystrophy.
