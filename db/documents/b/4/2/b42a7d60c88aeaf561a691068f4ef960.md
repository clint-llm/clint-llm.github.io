The history and physical examination are often sufficient for making the diagnosis. In most cases, the patient will have a history of patchy hair loss, which has progressed to complete loss of hair on the scalp, with the physical exam findings described above. The dermatoscope can aid in examination. Trichoscopy, a term for dermoscopic evaluation of hair, reveals perifollicular yellow dots, black dots, tapering hairs, and vellus hairs.

If the diagnosis remains unclear, a biopsy with histologic examination can be utilized. One or two 4 mm punch biopsies of the scalp are often performed. The specimens may be sectioned horizontally or vertically, so some practitioners perform two punch biopsies, one for vertical sectioning and another for horizontal sectioning for a thorough evaluation of the follicles.

In certain patients, lab work may be indicated. Thyroid testing (such asÂ thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with reflex to free thyroxine (T4) is the most important screening laboratory test. Other tests sometimes ordered with alopecia, in general, include a complete blood count (CBC), vitamin and mineral levels, rapid plasma reagin (RPR), plasma testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), and antinuclear antibody (ANA).
