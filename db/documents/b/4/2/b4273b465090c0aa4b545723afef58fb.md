**Gross Pathology**

Congestive hepatopathy secondary to cardiac etiology causes nutmeg liver with reddish central areas, which represent sinusoidal congestion and bleeding in the atrophied regions, with contrasting yellowish discoloration, which represents either normal liver or fatty liver.  Hepatomegaly is very commonly seen with a purple hue.

**Microscopic Examination**

Enlarged sinusoids, atrophied hepatocytes with variable degrees of hemorrhage, and necrosis in zone 3 of the hepatic acinus, fatty change is commonly seen under a microscope.  Mild thrombi are occasionally seen in patients with severe jaundice.  With chronic recurrent exacerbations of heart failure, collagen deposition occurs in zone 3, which eventually extends outwards, indicating portal tracts to the central veins causing cardiac sclerosis resembling micronodular cirrhosis.  With the progression of fibrosis, there may be the correction of rings of fibrosis around the stale portal region with bridging between adjacent hepatic and nodes which characterizes cardiac cirrhosis/cardiac fibrosis. Focal nodular hyperplasia is seen when there is a regeneration of periportal hepatocytes producing discrete nodules.
