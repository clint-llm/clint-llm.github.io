Volvulus is associated with intestinal malrotation, an enlarged colon, a long mesentery, Hirschsprung disease, pregnancy, abdominal adhesions, and chronic constipation. In adults, the sigmoid colon is the most commonly affected part of the gut followed by the cecum. In children, the small intestine is more commonly involved.
