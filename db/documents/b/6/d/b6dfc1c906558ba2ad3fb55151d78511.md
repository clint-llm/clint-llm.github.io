Hexaminidase levels are virtually absent from all the tissues, including plasma and leucocytes. Gangliosides accumulation is seen in all tissues but predominately seen in the central and autonomic nervous system and the retina. Patients with acute infantile Tay Sachs have an excessive accumulation of GM2 ganglioside (at least <12% of dry weight). In contrast, the adult forms have less accumulation, and even it may be restricted to specific regions. For example, the cortex is almost unaffected in adult forms, whereas brainstem nuclei, spinal cord, and hippocampus are markedly affected.

On histologic examination, neurons are ballooned with cytoplasmic vacuoles, which constitute distended lysosomes with ganglioside. Sudan Black B and oil red O are typically positive.

GM2 gangliosides accumulate in the retinal ganglion cells, particularly in the margins of the macula, causing cherry-red spots. The ganglion cells are in high density around the fovea, swelling of which causes a grey-white appearance, whereas the center of the fovea does not have ganglion cells, and those retain the reddish appearance. Toxic accumulation of intra-lysosomal gangliosides causes early visual symptoms.
