Commercially available controls are utilized to compare the movement of the analyte of interest. They are widely used for hemoglobin, serum protein, and nucleic acid electrophoresis.

Caution is necessary when preparing electrophoresis gel, buffer preparation, setting up apparatus, running of electrophoresis, staining, and visualization of the analyte. Monomers used in polyacrylamide gel preparation are carcinogenic. The catalyst used in polyacrylamide gel preparation can cause free radical-related damage to the skin if contacted. None of the solutions should be mouth pipetted. Barbital buffer containing sodium barbiturate is a known central nervous system depressant. Ethidium bromide used in nucleic acid staining is a known carcinogen. Direct exposure of the eye to ultraviolet rays during the visualization of the gel can cause severe damage to the eye.
