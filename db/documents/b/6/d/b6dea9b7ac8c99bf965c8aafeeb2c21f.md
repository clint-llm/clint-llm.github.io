Tobacco use increases the risk of stillbirth, fetal growth restriction, decreased birth weight, prematurity, and sudden unexplained infant death.

No amount of alcohol is deemed safe during pregnancy, and drinking may result in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and congenital malformations. Like tobacco, alcohol may be perceived as safe and socially acceptable because it is legal. As many as 13.5% of pregnant women have consumed alcohol in the previous month, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Alcohol is a known teratogen, and FAS is the leading cause of preventable intellectual disability in the US.

Marijuana is a federally banned substance in the US, but legal in many states. Randomized, controlled studies during pregnancy are lacking, but there is evidence of an association with stillbirth, decreased birth weight, and preterm birth.

Cocaine use is associated with maternal hypertension and placental abruption and may result in low birth weight, small for gestational age, and prematurity in neonates.

Amphetamines are associated with increased maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality, including maternal hypertension, preeclampsia, placental abruption, fetal demise, and neonatal death.

Opioids, both illicit and prescribed, can cause NOWS, which affects the newborn's central nervous, autonomic, respiratory, and gastrointestinal systems and may lead to prolonged hospitalization.

Legal issues can also occur with substance use during pregnancy. Eighteen states in the US define substance use as child abuse, and three consider it grounds for commitment. Many women fear arrest, prosecution, and loss of custody and therefore avoid prenatal care or do not disclose their substance use to their medical providers. Some states mandate reporting all illicit or prescribed substance use, including marijuana and medication-assisted treatment, to Child Protective Services. Clinicians must know their local testing and reporting requirements and share this information with their pregnant patients while advocating for holistic and comprehensive care. Criminalizing substance use will not lead to improved clinical outcomes for mothers or their children.
