**Clinical Use**

- In the primary care setting, it is useful to use the Weber and Rinne tests to help the clinician differentiate between conductive hearing loss and sensorineural hearing loss. This will guide the clinician to the need for further examination, investigation, and management.

- In the postoperative setting, the test is commonly used as a quick bedside test for examining a complication of a dead ear (complete sensorineural hearing loss).

- The Weber and Rinne tuning fork tests can be used to confirm audiometric findings, particularly when the audiogram is not consistent with clinical findings.

- In assessing a patient with bilateral conductive hearing loss, the Weber test is a quick and useful test for the otorhinolaryngology (ENT) surgeon to help determine which side of the ear to operate on first. Usually, the ear with the more significant conductive hearing loss is preferred.
