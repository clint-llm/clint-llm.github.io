Rickettsial infections are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes pharmacists and nurses. The key to rickettsial infections is prevention. Prevention relies on avoidance of exposure to tick and flea bites, particularly when residing or traveling to endemic areas. Currently, there is not a vaccine for the prevention of Rocky Mountain spotted fever or other rickettsial infections, and antibiotic prophylaxis is not routinely recommended in the United States. CarefulÂ inspection for insects after outdoor activities and the use of long-sleeved clothing and insect repellant are advised to minimize the risk of rickettsial infection.
