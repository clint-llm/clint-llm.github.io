Effective collaboration is the key to successful discharge planning. The discharge planning process involves an interprofessional team approach. Physicians are responsible for deciding the patient is safe for discharge, creating the discharge plan in conjunction with the rest of the team, and communicating instructions to the discharge nurse or designated discharge personnel.

The effectiveness of discharge planning is difficult to evaluate due to the complexity of the intervention and the numerous variables involved.
