Phalanx fractures are often initially evaluated on sidelines of sports games, training rooms nearby to practice, primary care offices, urgent cares, and emergency departments in addition to the hand surgeon or general orthopedic surgeonâ€™s office. A large portion of phalanx fractures is ultimately treated by primary care and emergency medicine providers.

Overall, a knowledgeable multidisciplinary team is necessary to properly diagnose and treat patients with phalanx fractures to optimize outcomes. A recent study showed an 8% misdiagnosis rate from emergency medicine and primary care physician referral in pediatric hand injuries.
