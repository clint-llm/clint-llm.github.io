Endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein hormone naturally produced by the peritubular cells of the kidney that stimulates red blood cell production. Renal cortex peritubular cells produce most EPO in the human body, although in a fetus, the liver is the primary site of production.

Erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs) are recombinant versions of EPO produced pharmacologically via recombinant DNA technology in cell cultures. Examples of erythropoietin stimulating agents include epoetin alfa, darbepoetin, and methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta.

ESAs are generallyÂ indicated in conditions where there is impaired red blood cell production. The two primary FDA-approved indications for ESAs are anemia secondary to chronic kidney disease and chemotherapy-induced anemia in patients with cancer.

In CKD, where there is damage to the kidneys and limited EPO production by the peritubular cells, ESAs are beneficial.
