Emicizumab is a medication used in the management and treatment of hemophilia A. It belongs to the bispecific monoclonal antibody class of drugs. Managing patients with HA is complex and requires replacing FVIII for bleeding prophylaxis and treating acute bleeding episodes. Emicizumab was created to circumvent challenges associated with frequent intravenous administration of FVIII and offer a standardized treatment option for Hemophilia A patients with and without inhibitors. This activity reviews the indications, mechanism of action, and adverse events associated with emicizumab administration in treating hemophilia A. This activity also highlights drug monitoring and relevant interferences with coagulation assays, which are pertinent for interprofessional team members in managing patients with hemophilia A.

**Objectives:**
- Describe some benefits of emicizumab in comparison to prior treatments for hemophilia A.
- Identify the mechanism of action of emicizumab and how it may affect laboratory testing.
- Review the rationale behind proper assay ordering practices in patients receiving emicizumab prophylaxis.
- Summarize how the interprofessional team can coordinate care to reduce complications associated with emicizumab to obtain better patient outcomes.
