Research over the last decades has elucidated causes of adrenocortical carcinoma to be driven by several molecular changes that include inactivation of tumor suppressor genes and activation of a myriad of different oncogenes, DNA mutations, and epigenetic changes. At the level of the genome, large scale changes occur in gene expression, chromosomal aberrations such as chromosomal gains, chromosomal losses, and loss of heterozygosity, DNA methylation, and dysregulation of microRNA (miRNA) leading to overexpression of these sequences.

Initially, familial syndromes predisposing to ACC allowed the identification of signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of adrenal tumors. Notably, the Tp53 pathway, the overexpression of IGF-II, and the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway. These were explained in the etiology section. Tp53 pathway via germline mutations is the underlying genetic cause of ACC in 50% to 80% of children with ACC.

Another tumor suppressor gene involved includes Melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R), also known as the adrenal corticotropin hormone receptor (ACTH-R).

Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) is a transcription factor that normally expresses in the hypothalamus, pituitary, and steroidogenic hormone-producing glands such as the ovaries, testes, and the adrenal cortex, playing a crucial role in the development of these glands.

There are reports of chromosomal aberrations leading to chromosomal gains or chromosomal losses in the pathogenesis of adrenocortical carcinoma. Initial studies showed chromosomal gains found to occur at the following loci: 4q, 4p16, 5p15, 5q12-13, 5q32-qter, 9q34, 12q13, and 19p, while researchers observed chromosomal losses at 1p, 21, 11q, 17p, 22p, and 22q 1. Further studies have since confirmed chromosomal gains at chromosomes 5, 7, 12, 16, 19, and 201,7 and chromosomal losses at 1, 2, 13, 17, and 221,7.  Lastly, microsatellite studies have also shown there to be LOH at the following loci: 17p13, 11q15, and 2p16 at a rate of 85%, 90% and 92% of adrenocortical carcinoma cases, respectively.

DNA methylation has also been studied at a genome-wide level in adrenocortical carcinoma, whereby it was found that there was significantly more hypermethylation at CpG sites (CpG islands) in adrenocortical carcinoma patients versus those with normal adrenocortical tissue samples.  The sites of hypermethylated CpG islands were in regions that led to decreased expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis regulation.

The dysregulation of micro RNA (miRNA) is also involved in the pathogenesis of adrenocortical carcinoma as well. MicroRNA (miRNA) small, noncoding regions of RNA that are 18 to 25 nucleotides long, and plays an essential role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and various cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation.
