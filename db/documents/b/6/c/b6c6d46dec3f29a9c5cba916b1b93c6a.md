Recent studies show how other muscle groups are able to directly influence the behavior of the pelvic floor. The muscle insertion of the levator ani goes beyond the superior pubic branch, entering the obturator fascia. The external stimulation of the obturators stimulated the contraction of the levator ani, in particular the anatomical area of the iliococcygeus muscle (also known as the tendon arch).

Remember that the gluteus maximus muscle is also capable of influencing the muscle tension of the pelvic floor, as a tendon arch deriving from the gluteus maximus inserts directly into the levator ani muscle area.
