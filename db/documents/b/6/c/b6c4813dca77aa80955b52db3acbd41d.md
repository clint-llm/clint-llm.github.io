The World Health Organisation launched the Surgical Safety Checklist in 2009, allowing different treatment stages to be checked before commencing a procedure. This can be modified for oral surgical procedures to minimize the risk of adverse outcomes.

Pauses in the form of verbal checks may be utilized before an invasive process, such as local anesthesia administration, or proceeding to use an oral surgical instrument such as an elevator or forceps.
