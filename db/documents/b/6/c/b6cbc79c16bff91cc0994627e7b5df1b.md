The management of alpha thalassemia is ideally done by an interprofessional team that consists of primary care providers, hematologists, geneticists, nurses, pharmacists, and dietitians. This hemoglobinopathy can affect multiple organs, and close monitoring is required. Supplementation with folic acid should be given because there is hemolytic anemia. Patients with HbH are at risk of clinical manifestations with oxidative damage. Blood counts should be monitored, and transfusional intervention may be required during periods of oxidant stress, such as infection or the use of oxidant drugs. Patients must be monitored carefully for complications of chronic transfusion and given iron chelation support as needed, especially during the second and third decades of life. Patients require careful genetic counseling. Primary care providers should refer patients if transfusions are needed. Pharmacists provide education to patients and monitor compliance. Nurses ensure patient follow up and should notify the team if there are issues. [Level 5]
