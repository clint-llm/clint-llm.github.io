An electroencephalogram (EEG) is an essential tool that studies the brain's electrical activity. Despite the development of more advanced imaging techniques, EEG remains an essential paraclinical tool for seizure evaluation. This activity represents an overview of the electroencephalogram (EEG) testing, including the techniques, indication, contraindication, and clinical significance. It also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and performing EEG.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications of the electroencephalogram.
- Describe the technique of electroencephalogram.
- Outline the clinical significance of the electroencephalogram.
- Review the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and performing electroencephalogram.
