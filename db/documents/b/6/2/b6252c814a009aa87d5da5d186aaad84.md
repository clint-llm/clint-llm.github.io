Prazosin is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist. Alpha-1-receptors are present on smooth muscle, as in the blood vessel walls, the prostate, urethra, iris dilator muscle, and brain. Alpha 1 antagonists cause smooth muscle relaxation, which can, in turn, cause a decrease in blood pressure by decreasing systemic vascular resistance. This medication can also cross the blood-brain barrier.

CYP450 enzymes hepatically metabolize this medication. The half-life is approximately 2.5 hours; however, it persists longer in chronic renal failure and congestive heart failure.
