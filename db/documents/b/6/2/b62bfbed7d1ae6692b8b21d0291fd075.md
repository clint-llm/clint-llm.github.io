**Excimer Laser**

There are various excimer lasers approved by the United States Federal Drug Agency (US FDA), each with advantages that may be chosen according to the patientâ€™s needs. Differences among lasers include beam size, beam repetition speed, and other benefits such as eye-tracking.

**Femtosecond Laser**

Flap creation can be made with various approaches, as described in the technique section; however, the general approach with LASIK currently is to create the flap using a femtosecond laser. The advantage of the laser over mechanical techniques is that the flap can be created thinner and with more precision, which leads to better results and fewer flap-related complications after surgery.
