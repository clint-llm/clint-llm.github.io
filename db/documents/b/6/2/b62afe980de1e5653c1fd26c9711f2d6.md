Modafinil is generally a well-tolerated stimulant. The most commonly reported adverse effects of modafinil (less than 10% of users) are a headache, nausea, and decreased appetite. Other commonly reported adverse effects (5% to 10% of users) include anxiety, insomnia, dizziness, diarrhea, and rhinitis.

Regarding serious adverse effects, cases of stevens-johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported in postmarketing surveillance. These life-threatening rashes associated with modafinil appear extremely rare, although the precise incidence rates are not known. Most of the reported cases have occurred within six weeks of drug initiation. Therefore, any patient who develops a rash during this time frame is advised to notify the prescribing physician immediately.

**Abuse Potential**: In clinical trials, modafinil use produces euphoric and psychoactive effects, altering thinking, mood, feelings, and perception like other CNS stimulants. Assess the risk of potential abuse and use it with caution in patients with a history of drug abuse.

**Withdrawal:**In one placebo-controlled clinical trial, after nine weeks of modafinil use, the effects of modafinil withdrawal were observed. No withdrawal symptoms were observed in patients with modafinil treatment cessation during 14 days of observation, but in patients with narcolepsy, sleepiness returned.
