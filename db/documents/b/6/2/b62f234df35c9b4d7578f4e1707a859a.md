Patients with hemophilia should pay regular visits to their doctors and discuss any episodes of bleeding they may encounter. Furthermore, they should avoid taking any over-the-counter painkillers like naproxen or aspirin that may increase their risk of bleeding. They should also take good care of their oral hygiene and visit the dentist regularly.
