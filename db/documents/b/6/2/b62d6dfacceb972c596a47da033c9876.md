Mitral regurgitation (MR) is caused by the retrograde flow of blood from the left ventricle (LV) into the left atrium (LA) through the mitral valve (MV), causing a systolic murmur heard best at the apex of the heart with radiation to the left axilla. MR is the most common valvular abnormality worldwide, affecting over 2% of the total population and has a prevalence that increases with age.

**Anatomy of Mitral Valve**

The mitral valve consists of two leaflets (anterior and posterior) sitting within the annulus. The posterior mitral leaflet originates from the left atrial (LA) endocardium. A subvalvular apparatus, comprising of 2 papillary muscles (anterolateral and posteromedial), arise from the LV myocardium and the chordae tendineae, supporting the leaflets.

**Types of MR**

Mitral regurgitation can subdivide into primary and secondary causes.

**Primary Mitral Regurgitation**

- Also called degenerative or organic

- Any MR resulting from structural deformity of or damage to the leaflets, chordae, and/or papillary muscles causing leaflets to close insufficiently during systole

- Common causes: papillary muscle rupture, mitral valve prolapse (MVP), or leaflet perforation

**Secondary Mitral Regurgitation**

- Also called functional or ischemic

- Due to a left ventricular wall motion abnormalities (i.e., ischemic cardiomyopathy) or left ventricular remodeling (i.e., dilated cardiomyopathy)

- No structural problems with the valve itself

- Leads to mitral annular dilatation or displacement of papillary muscles causing retrograde flow from improperly closed mitral valve leaflets

**Carpentier's Classification**

- **Type 1:**Normal leaflet motion
- Caused by annular dilation or leaflet perforation
- Regurgitation jet directed centrally

- **Type 2:**Excessive leaflet motion
- Caused by papillary muscle rupture, chordal rupture, or redundant chordae
- Eccentric jet directed away from the involved leaflet

- **Type 3:**Restricted leaflet motion
- **IIIa**: Leaflet motion restricted in both systole and diastole
- Caused by rheumatic heart disease commonly
- Normal papillary muscles
- Jet may be centrally or eccentrically directed 


- **IIIb**: Leaflet motion restricted in systole
- Caused by papillary muscle dysfunction or left ventricular dilation
- Abnormal papillary muscles
- Jet may be centrally or eccentrically directed
