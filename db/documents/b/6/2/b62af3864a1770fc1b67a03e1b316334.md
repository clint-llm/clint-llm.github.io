Oppositional problems may be assessed in a child as young as five years of age, though the majority of children usually present at school-age. Children and adolescents who are suspected of having oppositional defiant disorderÂ should have a thorough psychiatric evaluation with multiple informants (parents, siblings, friends, teachers, etc.) and, if possible, in multiple settings. A complete academic assessment, in conjunction with intelligence testing, should be done to uncover any learning disorders or intellectual problems. It is also important to identify modifiable risk factors (e.g., bullying or poor school performance) that might contribute to oppositional behaviors. ODD has high comorbidity with ADHD and anxiety disorders (e.g., OCD and ADHD), and the clinician needs to diagnose and treat any comorbid disorders.

There are multiple assessment tools available to assist the clinician in identifying ODD, including:

The Child Behaviour Checklist

Conners Child Behaviour Checklist

The Behaviour Assessment for Children (BASC - 2)

Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)

The Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment

The Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA)

The Disruptive Behaviour Diagnostic Observation Schedule
