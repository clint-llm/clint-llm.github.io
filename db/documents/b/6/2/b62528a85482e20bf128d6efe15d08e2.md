Mesenteric venous thrombosis is caused by impairment of venous return of the bowel due to local blood coagulation. Primary mesenteric venous thrombosis is considered spontaneous and idiopathic, whereas secondary mesenteric venous thrombosis is due to an underlying condition. Mesenteric venous thrombosis can lead to venous engorgement and mesenteric ischemia and accounts for 5 to 15 percent of mesenteric ischemic events. In addition, delayed treatment of mesenteric venous thrombosis can result in life-threatening intestinal infarction. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of mesenteric venous thrombosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the risk factors for developing mesenteric venous thrombosis.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with mesenteric venous thrombosis.
- Outline the treatment options for mesenteric venous thrombosis.
- Summarize strategies for improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to enhance outcomes for patients affected by mesenteric venous thrombosis.
