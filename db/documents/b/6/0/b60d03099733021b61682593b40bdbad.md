The incidence of Muehrcke’s nails is uncertain. The literature espouses it is a rare condition. A literature review of PubMed using the terms “Muehrcke”/“Muehrcke’s” independently or with “lines”/“nails” resulted in a mere 27 publications. However, it may be underreported given its association with underlying systemic disorders for which patients may be treated by medical providers who may not be aware of this clinical finding. Although some reports involve children, the vast majority reference adult patients.
