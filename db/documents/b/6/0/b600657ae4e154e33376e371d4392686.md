**Adult Migraine**

The American Headache Society and the American Academy of Neurology: 2012 evidence-based guideline update indicated that Petasites (butterbur) demonstrates effectiveness for migraine prevention and is a valid option for patients with migraine to reduce both the severity and frequency of migraine attacks (Level A). The recommendation was questioned and then retracted in 2016.

Butterbur (leaves of Petasites hybridus) has been found to be effective in the prophylaxis of adult migraines in multiple studies.

**Pediatric Migraine**

Similar to adult migraines, there is evidence for Petasites in the prevention of pediatric migraines.

**Allergic Rhinitis and Asthma**

Butterbur has been used in countries in Asia as a herbal treatment of asthma and allergic diseases.

**Alzheimer's Disease**

Studies have found that butterbur may potentially be effective in treating Alzheimer's disease due to its neuroprotective effect. However, only studies involving in vitro and in vivo models have been performed.
