Treatment is guided by the location of the lesions, the number, and symptoms. PCFCL is effectively treated with local radiotherapy. Local radiation therapy is recommended for patients with single lesions or lesions in a single radiation field, with a complete response rate of 99% in a cumulative study review. [11] A dose of at least 30 Gray (Gy) is recommended with a margin of 1 to 1.5 cm. For small lesions, surgical excision is an acceptable alternative with a complete response rate of 99% but an increased rate of relapse (40% vs. 30% for radiotherapy). For scattered or multiple lesions that can not be contained to one radiation field, local radiotherapy or observation are recommended for initial therapy.

For very numerous or very thick lesions not amenable to radiotherapy, rituximab is suggested as a first-line systemic agent. If refractory, chemotherapy with R-CHOP and CHOP in older studies have been used. Fortunately, cutaneous relapses do not confer a worse prognosis and should be managed systematically with a similar approach to the initial diagnosis.
