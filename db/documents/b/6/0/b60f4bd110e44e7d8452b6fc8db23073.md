In adults, the esophagus is approximately 20 to 25 cm in length, extending from the hypopharynx to the stomach. The esophagus has an inner mucosa layer and a muscle layer made up of inner circular muscles and outer longitudinal muscles. The upper third is voluntary striated muscles that allow initiation of swallowing, while muscles of the lower third are involuntary smooth muscles.

The esophagus is the most common site for an acute foreign body or food impaction in the gastrointestinal tract, and 80 to 90% of swallowed objects that reach the stomach will eventually pass without intervention.

While a wide variety of objects could be ingested, common accidental esophageal foreign body ingestions include food bolus (mostly meat), fish or chicken bones, dentures, and coins. The type of objects ingested varies between different regions and cultures. For example, in southern China, fish bones were the most common esophageal foreign body impaction.
