The clinical significance of vibratory sensation lies in its carrier pathway (DCML), which also carries position sense and fine touch. Several diseases affect the DCML pathway and thus manifest as loss of position, vibration, and touch sensations.

Most common in developed countries is subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord due to vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 primarily exists in animal products, including meat, fish, poultry, and milk. Our bodies have extensive reserves of B12 and symptoms of deficiency appear after several years of a diet devoid of B12, explaining why vegetarians are mostly the victims of vitamin B12 deficiency if they don’t substitute it with other sources.

Another example is tabes dorsalis, a late manifestation of tertiary syphilis. It causes degenerative joints disease (Charcot joints), Argyll Robertson pupils (light reflex lost but accommodation reflex retained), and affects dorsal column. Tabes dorsalis incidence is reduced dramatically after the introduction of penicillin in the treatment of syphilis.

An infarction of the posterior spinal artery also affects the posterior column pathway resulting in the loss of vibration, proprioception, and light touch below the level of the lesion.

Hemisection of the spinal cord, known as Brown-Sequard syndrome, also affects the dorsal column along with other pathways. It is commonly the result of trauma, tumors, and abscesses.
