Patients with PVE present with symptoms similar to other types of infectious endocarditis (IE), including fever and chills, shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pains, anorexia, and weight loss. Patients may experience other symptoms such as malaise, headache, myalgias, arthralgias, night sweats, abdominal pain, and cough.

Cardiac murmurs are more common in PVE than other types of IE. Splenomegaly and cutaneous manifestations such as petechiae or splinter hemorrhages are other common findings on physical exam. Petechiae are observed in up to 40 percent of patients; they can present as skin findings on an extremity or mucosal surfaces of the palate and conjunctivae. Findings on nail beds can include Splinter hemorrhages, which appear as red to brown lines that are non-blanching under the nail bed.

Other less common clinical manifestations are Janeway lesions â€“ non-tender erythematous macules on the palms and soles, Osler nodes: subcutaneous violaceous nodules mostly on the pads of the fingers and toes, Roth spots: Exudative, edematous hemorrhagic lesions of the retina with pale centers.
