Wadell triad occurs due to theÂ blunt force trauma sustained secondary to direct pedestrian impact by a motor vehicle. Classically, there are 3 phases in the injuries sustained by these patients: the impact of the bumper, followed by the impact of the windshield/hood, and finally, the impact on the ground. The injuries of the pelvic limbs are due to the impact of the bumper, the thoracic or abdominal trauma results from the impact of the hood/windshield and the head or cervical spine trauma results from hitting the ground.
