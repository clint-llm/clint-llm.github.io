Lurasidone offers a safety advantage when compared with some other atypical antipsychotic agents. Treatment with lurasidone has a decreased risk ofÂ metabolic side effects such as hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and weight gain compared to risperidone, quetiapine, and olanzapine.

In patients with schizophrenia, the most common adverse effects experienced were nausea, akathisia, somnolence, sedation, and Parkinsonism. Long-term use of lurasidone is associated with modest weight gain compared with other atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine and risperidone. Several short-term clinical trials observed significant increases in prolactin levels.

Lurasidone offers a similar adverse effects profile in patients with bipolar depression. The most common side effects observed were nausea, akathisia, headache, extrapyramidal, and sedation. There have been reports that lurasidone causes a 7% increase in baseline body weight. More clinical trials need to be conducted to establish the safety and tolerability of long-term use of lurasidone in patients with bipolar depression.

Lurasidone, when used in pregnant patients, may cause extrapyramidal or withdrawal symptoms in neonates when exposed in the third trimester.
