The most common indication for pleurodesis is a malignant pleural effusion, which is typically refractory.

Indications for chemical pleurodesis are malignant pleural effusions, refractory symptomatic non-malignant pleural effusionsÂ (chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, chylothorax, nephrotic syndrome, lupus, hepatic hydrothorax, and heart failure), recurrent primary pneumothorax and recurrent secondary pneumothorax.

Indications for mechanical pleurodesis are similar to chemical pleurodesis with the added benefit of treating underlying cause if present during the same procedure. For example, the simultaneous inspection and resection of subpleural blebs and bullae, which could be the source of recurrent pneumothoraces.
