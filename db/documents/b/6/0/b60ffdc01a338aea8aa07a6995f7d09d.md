Cilostazol is a generally well-tolerated oral medication. Common side effects of cilostazol therapy reportedly include headache (34%), diarrhea (19%), and palpitations (10%).

A slight elevation in heart rate of 5 to 7 beats/min may also occur with the administration of cilostazol. These side effects are mild to moderate in intensity, transient, or alleviated with symptomatic treatment and seldom demand treatment withdrawal.

Postmarketing research has shown cilostazol to induce thrombocytopenia or leukopenia, progressing to agranulocytosis when drug administration does not immediately discontinue. Agranulocytosis is reversible with immediate discontinuation of the drug.
