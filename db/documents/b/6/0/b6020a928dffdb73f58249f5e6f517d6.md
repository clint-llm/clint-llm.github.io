There are no specificÂ symptoms that are pathognomonic of pseudocysts. However, the presence of vague, chronic abdominal pain in someone with a recent bout of pancreatitis should always raise suspicion as the diagnosis.

Some of the signs and symptoms that are suggestive of pseudocyst are:

- Persistent abdominal pain

- Anorexia

- New abdominal mass after an episode of pancreatitis

- Jaundice or shock (less commonly)

Findings that are of limited sensitivity:

- Abdominal tenderness

- Palpable abdominal mass

- Signs of peritonitis, including guarding and rigidity (in case of a ruptured cyst)

- Fever

- Scleral icterus

- Pleural effusion
