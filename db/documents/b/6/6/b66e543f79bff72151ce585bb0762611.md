**Common Indications for Pacemaker Placement**

- Sinus node dysfunction (Class I indication)

- Acquired AV block

- Post myocardial infarction

**Less Common Indications**

- Congenital complete heart block

- Long QT syndrome

- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

- Heart failure

**Conditions in Which Cardiac Pacing is Not Indicated**

- Syncope of undetermined etiology

- Sinus bradycardia without significant symptoms

- Sinoatrial block or sinus arrest without significant symptoms

- Asymptomatic prolonged PR intervals with atrial fibrillation

- Asymptomatic bradycardia during sleep

- Asymptomatic 2nd-degree Mobitz I (Wenckebach ) AV block

- Right bundle branch block with left axis deviation without syncope or other symptoms compatible with intermittent AV block

- Reversible AV block such as those with electrolyte abnormalities, Lyme disease, sleep apnea

**Pacemaker Related Complications**

**Pacemaker Syndrome:**Pacemaker syndrome is a disease that represents the clinical consequences of suboptimal atrioventricular (AV) synchrony or AV dyssynchrony, regardless of the pacing mode after pacemaker implantation.

Symptoms of Pacemaker Syndrome are:

- Cannon A-waves

- Chest pain

- Confusion

- Dizziness

- Fatigue

- Palpitations

- Shortness of breath

- Syncope

Other complications associated with Pacemakers include:

- Pneumothorax

- Cardiac perforation

- Significant pocket hematoma

- Lead dislodgement

- Venous thrombosis and obstruction

- Mechanical lead complications
