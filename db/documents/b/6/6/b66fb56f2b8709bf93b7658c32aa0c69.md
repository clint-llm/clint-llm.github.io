Hyperkeratosis of the nipple and areola is an uncommon, benign skin condition characterized by a warty thickening and pigmentation of the nipple, areola, or both. This activity describes the pathophysiology and presentation of nipple hyperkeratosis and its treatment. Hyperkeratosis of the nipple and areola does not resolve without treatment and tends to persist indefinitely. Various medical or surgical treatments may be indicated in this condition. Keratolytic topicals (salicylic acid, lactic acid) are used as a first-line treatment. Nevertheless, they are rarely sufficient. Topical corticosteroids and retinoids have almost no effect, even if they may relieve pruritus. Systemic retinoids (etretinate, acitretin) were inefficient when used. Physical destructive treatments, such as cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen, and carbon dioxide laser give more satisfactory results. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of hyperkeratosis of the nipple and areola and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of hyperkeratosis of the nipple and areola.
- Review the presentation of a patient with nipple hyperkeratosis.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for hyperkeratosis of the nipple and areola.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by hyperkeratosis of the nipple and areola.
