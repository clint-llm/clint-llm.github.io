Protriptyline hydrochloride is a tricyclic antidepressant used to improve mood in people with depression. It is also useful in treating anxiety. It is a more potent antidepressant and has fewer sedative and tranquilizing effects than other TCAs. FDA-approved uses include mental depression, narcolepsy, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and headaches. It also has other non-FDA approved indications. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of protriptyline, so providers can direct patient therapy in treating conditions for which it is indicated, as part of the interprofessional team.
