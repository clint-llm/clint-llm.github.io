The management of hypertension subdivides into pharmacological and nonpharmacological management.

Non-pharmacological and lifestyle management are recommended for all individuals with raised BPs regardless of age, gender, comorbidities or cardiovascular risk status.

Patient education is paramount to effective management and should always include detailed instructions regarding weight management, salt restriction, smoking management, adequate management of obstructive sleep apnea and exercise. Patients need to be informed and revised at every encounter that these changes are to be continued lifelong for effective disease treatment.

Weight reduction is advisable if obesity is present although optimum BMI and optimal weight range is still unknown. Weight reduction alone can result in decreases of up to 5 to 20mmHg in systolic blood pressure.

Smoking may not have a direct effect on blood pressure but will help in reducing long term sequelae if the patient quits smoking.

Lifestyle changes alone can account for up to 15% reduction in all cardiovascular-related events.

Pharmacological therapy consists of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), diuretics (usually thiazides), calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and beta-blockers (BBs), which are instituted taking into account age, race and comorbidities such as presence of renal dysfunction, LV dysfunction, heart failure and cerebrovascular disease. JNC-8, ACC, and ESC/ ESH have their separate recommendations for pharmacological management.

JNC-8 recommends the following:

- Starting pharmacological therapy for individuals with DM and CKD with BP greater than or equal to 140/90mmHg to therapeutic target BP less than 140/90mmHg

- Starting pharmacological therapy for individuals 60 years of age and over with BP greater than or equal to 150/90mmHg to therapeutic target BP less than 150/90mmHg

- Starting pharmacological therapy for individuals 18 to 59years of age with SBP greater than or equal to 140mmHg to therapeutic target SBP less than 140mmHg

- individuals with DM and non-black population, treatment should include a thiazide diuretic, CCB, and an ACEi/ARB

- individuals in the black population, including those with DM, treatment should include a thiazide diuretic and CCB

- individuals with CKD, treatment should be started with or include ACEi/ARB, and this applies to all CKD patients irrespective of race or DM status

ACC recommends the following

- Ten-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk should be estimated

- Anti-hypertensive medications are usually initiated when BP readings are persistently greater than or equal to 140/90mmHg

- High-risk population (diabetics, CKD, individuals with ASCVD) or in those individuals with 10-year ASCVD risk greater than or equal to 10%, therapy can be initiated at lower BP cutoffs

- The goal of treatment is to keep blood pressures in as close to normal range as possible, i.e., BP less than or equal to 130/80mmHg

ESC/ ESH recommends the following:

- Starting pharmacological therapy for grade 2 or 3 hypertension regardless of the level of risk

- Starting pharmacological therapy for grade 1 hypertension when there is hypertension mediated end-organ damage (HMOD)

- Grade 1 hypertension in the absence of HMOD requires either high risk for CVD or failure of lifestyle interventions, for initiating pharmacological therapy

- Starting pharmacological therapy for individuals greater than or equal to 80 years of age with BP greater than or equal to 160/90mmHg to therapeutic target less than 160/90mmHg regardless of DM, CKD, CAD or TIA/ CVA

- Starting pharmacological therapy for individuals 18 to 79 years of age with BP greater than or equal to 140/90mmHg to therapeutic target less than 140/90mmHg regardless of DM, CKD, CAD or TIA/ CVA

Researchers have also studied renal denervation is a form of interventional treatment where renal sympathetic supply is ablated, via specialized catheter equipment, as a potential treatment for resistant hypertension (where adequate blood pressure control is not achieved despite adequate compliance to two or three anti-hypertensive drugs and lifestyle measures).

Multiple randomized trials including SPYRAL, RADIANCE, and SIMPLICITY-HTN trials have shown equivocal results, so this remains an investigational therapy.
