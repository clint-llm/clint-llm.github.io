The initial studies on Fuchs uveitis syndrome hypothesized its etiology ranging from adrenergic denervation, as in Horner syndrome, to infectious causes such as HSV and Toxoplasma gondii. One of the landmark studies by Quentin and Reiber proposed the now predominating theory that FUS is caused by an inflammatory process involving rubella. The study analyzed the presence of intraocular antibody synthesis driven by rubella, herpes simplex, varicella-zoster, measles, and toxoplasmosis. The results showed the significant finding of rubella oligoclonal antibodies in every sample of aqueous humor collected from patients with FUS, leading to a diagnostic criterion of 100% sensitivity.

Subsequently, multiple studies analyzed the presence of rubella RNA or rubella antibodies in aqueous humor of patients with FUS.

The initially proposed mechanisms of FUS consisted of sympathetic nerve dysfunction, hereditary, ocular toxoplasmosis, vascular, and immunological theories, which have largely lost favor.
