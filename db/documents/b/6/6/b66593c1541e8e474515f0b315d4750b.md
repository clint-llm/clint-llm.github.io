The success of organ transplantation depends on the use of immunosuppressive drugs to control the alloimmune response. The most frequent drugs used for kidney transplantation include a cocktail of 3 medications, including a drug that inhibits T-cell activation (cyclosporin, tacrolimus, or sirolimus), an antiproliferative (6-mercaptopurine, or mycophenolic acid), and an anti-inflammatory agent (corticosteroids).

Chronic organ rejection can be associated with a high mortality rate and may result in various complications, including kidney failure, liver failure, chronic pulmonary disease, pancreatic insufficiency, arteriosclerosis, and blood dyscrasias.

Other complications include CMV infection and infectious diseases caused by bacterial, viral, fungal, protozoal, or mixed. Excessive immunosuppression can cause the emergence of BK polyomavirus resulting in BK nephropathy and may account for one to ten percent of allograft failure.

A late complication of renal transplantation is the recurrence of the original disease (diabetic nephropathy).

The development of malignancy is a late complication of chronic organ rejection. For example, the incidence of lymphoma is approximately 40 times greater in transplant recipients than in the general population. Other tumors that may be observed include skin cancer, Kaposi sarcoma, and lymphoma due to Epstein-Barr virus activation.
