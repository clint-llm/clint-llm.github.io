Management of GBS requires that the nurse participates in an interprofessional team dedicated to collaborative patient care delivery. The nurse should plan to assess and monitor the patient with GBS for potential complications. Changes in respiratory function with decreased vital capacity require the nurse to contact the MD. Complications including cardiac dysrhythmias, hypertension, hypotension, DVT, PE, urinary retention, or alterations in swallowing are findings that require the nurse to contact the MD. The nurse should contact the pharmacist for problems associated with IVIG or corticosteroids frequently used in the management of acute GBS.

Expressions of fear, anxiety, hopelessness, and helplessness by the patient or family members should prompt the nurse to contact the social worker. psychologist, or other mental health providers in the interprofessional team.
