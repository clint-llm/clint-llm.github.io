Gingivitis, if identified and treated, can easily be resolved as the condition is reversible and the altered tissues can return to normal once the dental biofilm has been removed. If gingivitis progress to periodontitis, connective tissue attachment loss, and bone destruction will occur, which may ultimately result in tooth loss.
