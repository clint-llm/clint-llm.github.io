Parents and families who have children diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder or other chronic diseases face many challenges. These challenges include social isolation, frustrations, a strained relationship, and financial difficulties. Helpful strategies include encouraging families to tell their own stories, thus assisting with emotional processing. The focus should be on strengthening protective factors such as increasing parents' communication skills, behavioral management, and providing psycho-education for extending parents' understanding of their child's condition and developmental challenges. Other helpful strategies include connecting with others with the same disease, developing an alliance, caring for one's self, and become an advocate. Recommendations for health care providers include understanding the common problems faced by parents, building parent-to-parent connections, and encouraging a good relationship with parents and their children.
