- Hypocarbia typically occurs because of hyperventilation.

- Hyperventilation typically occurs in response to an insult such as hypoxia, metabolic acidosis, pain, anxiety, or increased metabolic demand.

- Hypocarbia results in respiratory alkalosis.

- Respiratory alkalosis is not life-threatening. However, the underlying etiology may be. Always look for and treat the source of the illness.

- Interventions to reduce pH directly are typically not necessary.
