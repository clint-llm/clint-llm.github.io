The pars interarticularis injury is a common cause of low back pain, especially among young people. It is frequently misdiagnosed and can potentially affect clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction. Thus, an interprofessional team approach is essential to make a prompt and accurate diagnosis. While the orthopedic surgeon usually manages the primary injury, other clinicians and nurses should coordinate the patient's education on lifestyle changes and appropriate exercises. Patients need to stretch before physical activity, maintain healthy body weight, discontinue smoking, and not lead a sedentary life.

Patients with low back pain, especially after repetitive sports activities, require a general practitioner consultation. If the healthcare professional considers this diagnosis a cause of low back pain, referral to a spine specialist is vital. Patients may also have this condition discovered by a chiropractor, who should work collaboratively with orthopedic specialists on a way forward.

Entering a rehabilitation program may be necessary for all patients to restore muscle strength and joint flexibility. Physical therapists need to keep the healthcare team informed regarding progress. The pharmacist should work with the team by educating the patient on alternatives to opiates for pain control, verifying all dosing, and performing medication reconciliation. Nursing can monitor progress at follow-up visits, monitor treatment progress, and note any adverse medication effects. Only with such an interprofessional team approach can the morbidity of this disorder be reduced. [Level 5]

All interprofessional team members must have open communication channels to consult with other team members, especially if they note any changes in the patient's condition that may require intervention. Further, all providers must maintain meticulous records of all interactions and observations of the patient's progress so that everyone on the interprofessional team is operating from the same updated data.
