Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare subtype of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) usually identified by a translocation of the CCND1 gene. The variety of morphologic variants may make this a challenging diagnosis, although most cases are uncomplicated. It typically follows an aggressive clinical course, although an indolent leukemia variant has been described. This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment for mantle cell lymphoma and reviews the role of the interprofessional team and new management strategies in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology and staging of mantle cell lymphoma.
- Describe the typical immunohistochemistry findings associated with mantle cell lymphoma.
- Outline the different treatment strategies and investigational treatments in the pipeline in mantle cell lymphoma. Identifying complications associated with MCL treatments.
- Explore healthcare team strategies for improving care coordination, communication, and new concepts and developments to advance mantle cell lymphoma outcomes.
