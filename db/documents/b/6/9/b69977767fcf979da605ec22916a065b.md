**Percutaneous and Transcutaneous**

Current indications for bone-anchored hearing devices include conductive and mixed hearing loss and single-sided deafness.

For patients with conductive or mixed hearing loss, the devices are approved for patients five years and older with unilateral or bilateral conductive or mixed hearing loss and who are unable or receive suboptimal results from standard hearing aids. The common etiologies resulting in this situation include middle ear disease, congenital canal atresia, cholesteatoma, chronic otitis media, and post-surgical changes. In these circumstances, the bone-anchored hearing device bypasses the problematic external or middle ear.

Previously, patients with single-sided deafness (SSD) either adapted to unilateral hearing or were fitted with contralateral routing of signal (CROS) device, which is a hearing aid that routes sound from the deaf ear to the contralateral better hearing ear. However, studies have revealed that the handicap associated with SSD was previously underestimated. Bone anchored hearing devices have been shown to benefit sound localization and speech in noise in patients with SSD. As a result, indications for bone-anchored hearing devices have expanded to include single-sided deafness from etiologies such as genetic disorders, inner ear malformations, ototoxic treatment, trauma, degenerative neurologic disease, sudden sensorineural hearing loss, and vestibular schwannoma.

Contraindications for bone-anchored hearing devices include scalp dermatologic problems due to the propensity for skin infection or breakdown related to the device, patients with bony anatomy not amenable to osseointegration, and the need for ongoing MRI evaluation, especially of the unilateral temporal lobe. Although improvements have been made in device MRI compatibility, specific device manufacture guidelines should be referenced and discussed before surgery in patients in whom ongoing MRIs are planned.

**Middle Ear Implantable Hearing Prosthesis**

Multiple devices are available for middle ear implantation, and most are indicated for adults and children five years and older with conductive or mixed hearing loss. Bone conduction thresholds must be stable with mild to moderately severe loss at frequencies between 500 and 4000 Hz. These devices are also indicated for patients with mild to severe sensorineural hearing loss between 500 and 6000 Hz with stable thresholds.

Malformations of the inner ear are not contraindications as the implants may often be couples to the stapes or round window and bypass these abnormalities. Contraindications include retrocochlear/central hearing impairment, active middle ear infection, and comorbid medical conditions that preclude safe general anesthesia. Manufacturing guidelines regarding MRI compatibility should be considered pre-operatively. In many cases, a pre-operative CT scan is performed for pre-operative planning.
