Treatment of KMP is largely supportive and aimed at preventing life-threatening complications while addressing the underlying tumor. While the thrombocytopenia of KMP may be profound, life-threatening hemorrhage is, in fact, rare, and platelet transfusion is not recommended except in the cases of active bleeding. Transfused platelets may become trapped in the tumor and lead to further abnormal coagulation, worsening KMP.

Treatment of the underlying tumor is critical in KMP. Surgery is the definitive management for both KHE and TA. However, it is often not possible given ill-defined tumoral borders and the invasion of multiple tissue planes and local structures. Furthermore, once KMP develops, surgery is inadvisable given the hemodynamic risks. Embolization may be possible if a single feeding vessel is present. However, tumors usually have multiple feeding vessels. Embolization also carries the risk of necrosis of local structures. Radiation therapy can induce regression, however, carries the risk of developmental delay, growth delay, and secondary malignancy.

Multiple medical therapies have demonstrated promise in the treatment of KHE and TA. Historically steroids are typically first-line treatment. For patients who respond, clinical response is usually seen within 2 weeks, after which steroids should be tapered slowly.
