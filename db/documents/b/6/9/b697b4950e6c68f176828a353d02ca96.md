Unlike other neuropathic conditions, the diagnosis of postherpetic neuralgia is relatively straightforward and not one of exclusion.

Herpes zoster can reactivate subclinically with no rash.

Physical examination of a patient with postherpetic neuralgia may reveal the following:

- Evidence of cutaneous scarring on an area of previous herpes zoster

- Altered sensation in the affected areas, either hypersensitivity or hypoesthesia

- Pain is produced by non-noxious stimuli, such as a light touch, known as allodynia

- Autonomic dysfunction, such as excessive sweating over the involved area
