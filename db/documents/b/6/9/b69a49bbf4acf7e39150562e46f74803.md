The pathogenesis of cylindromas is not yet well understood, and multiple theories exist on their origin. As the tumor develops exclusively in hair-covered areas, a follicular epithelium lineage is often defended. The cells within the cylindroma also have exhibited expression of follicular keratin. However, many experts maintain that this neoplasm's origins are of eccrine or apocrine differentiation. Cylindromas do not arise on palmar or plantar surfaces, which would contradict an eccrine lineage as there are many eccrine glands in these areas but no hair follicles or apocrine glands. The more differentiated cells that comprise cylindromas appear morphologically similar to secretory cells, which some may use to argue for the apocrine origin of these neoplasms.
