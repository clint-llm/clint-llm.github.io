When a patient needs surgical management, laparoscopy or laparotomy can be performed, and both have significant advantages and disadvantages. Laparotomy is usually preferred when the patient is hemodynamically unstable since it allows for faster entry and direct visualization of the involved structure but results in larger incisions and increased duration of post-op pain, hospital stay, and recovery time. Laparoscopies are more lengthy procedures with smaller incisions with less risk of infection and blood loss when compared to laparotomies. However, the longer time spent in surgery leads to increased exposure to general anesthesia and increases the risk of damage to internal organs and blood vessels. When laparoscopy is performed, the hemodynamically stable patient is usually discharged home on the same day of surgery with typical post-surgical precautions and proper follow-up scheduled.
