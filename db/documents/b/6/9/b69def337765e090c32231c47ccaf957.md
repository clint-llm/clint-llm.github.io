Nitroglycerin is a vasodilatory drug used primarily to provide relief from anginal chest pain. It is currently FDA approved for the acute relief of an attack or acute prophylaxis of angina pectoris secondary to coronary artery disease. Off-label, non-FDA-approved uses include treatment for hypertensive urgency/emergency, coronary artery spasm, angina secondary to cocaine use, congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic anal fissures. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of nitroglycerin, so providers can direct patient therapy successfully in instances where nitroglycerin benefits patient care.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the approved and off-label indications for using nitroglycerin.
- Summarize the mechanism of action of nitroglycerin.
- Outline nitroglycerin's adverse event profile.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to properly use nitroglycerin to improve patient outcomes in the varied scenarios where it can be effective.
