Morton neuroma is common in the third interspace because it is narrower compared to other spaces. As the common digital nerve to the third space receives branches from both medial and lateral plantar nerves, it has increased thickness and is prone to compression and trauma. Trauma from a crush injury, penetrating injury, thickened transverse metatarsal ligament, enlarged bursa in the interspace, and repetitive trauma from running have all been linked to the development of Morton neuroma. The compression and repetitive trauma to the nerve results in vascular changes, endoneurial edema, and excessive bursal thickening leading to perineural fibrosis.
