A manual test to evaluate the femoral nerve is the sign of Nachlas. The patient is prone while the operator grabs the ankle, bending the knee with the thigh resting on the bed and bringing the heel closer to the buttock. If a radial pain in the thigh is recorded anteriorly, it may indicate the presence of compression or irritation to the femoral nerve; if other symptoms appear in the buttock or on the articular sacroiliac level, the problem must be sought elsewhere.

Another evaluation can be performed with the patient resting on the side. The operator, from behind, grasps the thigh of the side not in support, bringing the limb towards the extension, first with the knee extended and then using the same maneuver with a knee flexed. Flexion of the knee and extension of the hip causes traction of the femoral nerve; the pain radiating on the anterior portion of the thigh denotes a problem at the root of L3 in particular, while the symptomatology elicited in the medial tibial area shows issues related to L4. Possible symptomatology on the opposite side during the execution of the test would indicate a contraction was suffered or a contralateral root irritation.

**Exams**

Manual clinical evaluation is not sufficient to differentiate minor traumas or limit the size of a lesion. X-rays are useful in patients of peri-pubertal age, as it allows the practitioner to see any apophyseal detachments that are typical of the age group. Intramuscular calcifications of the quadriceps muscle also can be seen.

Because of the costs, MRI remains the secondary choice, although it may evaluate the different types of tissue.

Ultrasound of the muscle has low costs and good visibility of the soft tissues, and the absence of contraindications. It also allows the practitioner to evaluate the muscles with different positions and contractions, comparing the healthy side in cases of doubt. It is feasible to visualize the presence of hematomas, which, if large and untreated, can produce fibrous scar tissue, calcifications, and pseudocysts.

**Classifications of Muscle Injuries**

Muscle injuries can be divided into the following three causes:

- Direct trauma

- Indirect trauma (stretching and tearing)

- Lacerations

Direct traumas or contusions are divided into light, moderate, or severe, based on the limitation of the joint movement that these traumas cause. In addition to scars, a complication of direct traumas not appropriately treated is myositis ossificans. The vastus lateralis and intermedius are the vastii most affected by traumas during sports activities, being the most exposed.

Indirect traumas are divided into three classes based on the number of muscle fibers involved.

- The first degree involves a reduced number of lacerated fibers. Generally, the first-degree lesion does not increase the size of the muscle.

- The second degree of injury involves three-quarters of the muscular area. In the second degree, there may be a localized increase in muscle volume.

- The last degree exceeds the previous dimension, with the possibility of complete rupture of the muscle or the muscle-tendon junction. In the third degree, the retraction of the involved muscular district is observed.

The rectus femoris is the muscle portion most involved in indirect lesions, and in 60% of patients, the trauma involves the most proximal area. The distal area of the rectus femoris will be affected in 10% of cases, with a lesion level of the third degree.

Complete rupture of the quadriceps muscle is rare in athletes; it is easier to find this type of lesion in elderly patients or those using steroids or with systemic diseases. A complete rupture of a vastus could occur in asymptomatic mode, mimicking another problem. For example, the appearance of back pain with anterior irradiation of the leg, as reported in the literature. A total rupture of a vastus or more vastii could result from worsening hypertrophy caused by an existing disease, for example, neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis or an orthopedic disease such as ankylosing spondylitis.
