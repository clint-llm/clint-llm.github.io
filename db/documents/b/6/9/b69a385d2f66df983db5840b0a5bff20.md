The posterior pituitary releases oxytocin in response to an infant suckling at the breast. The nipple and areola have a high level of sensory nerve endings. The release of oxytocin causes the milk ejection reflex (MER), also referred to as the letdown reflex. The myoepithelial cells surrounding the alveoli will contract and propel milk forward through the lactiferous ducts and out through the nipples. The mother often feels a tingling sensation. Infant suckling also stimulates prolactin (from the Greek root word meaning "for milk"). Prolactin levels rise during pregnancy, drop shortly before birth, and then rise again after birth. Prolactin levels double with infant suckling.
