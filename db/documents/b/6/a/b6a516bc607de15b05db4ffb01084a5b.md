The use of levodopa is contraindicated with the concurrent use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) because it can lead to a hypertensive crisis. There should be a 14-day washout period when switching from levodopa to an MAOI or vice versa. Patients taking D2 antagonists may see a reduction in the effects of levodopa, and as a result, it may reduce the beneficial effects of the drug. Individuals with narrow-angle glaucoma should use levodopa with caution as it can increase ocular pressure. Extra precaution is necessary for patients with atrial nodal or ventricular arrhythmias. The recommendation is that these patients be administered levodopa in a coronary care unit. Levodopa use is also contraindicated in people with pre-existing neuropathy because symptoms have the potential to worsen. The risk of GI bleeds increases in patients who already have a history of peptic ulcer disease. Levodopa can increase the risk of psychosis in patients already diagnosed with a major psychotic disorder.

Per the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  label, Levodopa should not be used in patients with a history of malignant melanoma due to the risk of activating melanoma. However, several studies suggested drug exposure is not the reason for the increased risk of melanoma but may reflect the association of Parkinson disease with melanoma. More studies are required to verify the correlation between levodopa and dermatologic effects.
