Community-acquired pneumonia is a leading cause of hospitalization, mortality, and incurs significant health care costs. As disease presentation varies from a mild illness that can be managed as an outpatient to a severe illness requiring treatment in the intensive care unit, determining the appropriate level of care is important for improving outcomes in addition to early diagnosis and appropriate and timely treatment. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and the role of the inter-professional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the common causes of community-acquired pneumonia.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with suspected community-acquired pneumonia.
- Identify the drugs of choice in patients with community-acquired pneumonia.
