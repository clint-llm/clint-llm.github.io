Infection from the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) most commonly occurs in childhood and is spread by airborne, droplet, and contact transmission. Herpes zoster results from reactivation of the latent VZV within a sensory nerve ganglion, often presenting decades after the initial infection. The disease typically presents as a unilateral maculopapular or vesicular rash in a single dermatomal distribution. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) is defined as the viral involvement of the ophthalmic division (V1) of the trigeminal cranial nerve (V). While the diagnosis of HZO does not necessarily imply eye involvement, ocular disease occurs in about 50% of HZO cases. Ocular manifestations can include conjunctivitis, uveitis, episcleritis, keratitis, and retinitis. The condition is considered an ophthalmologic emergency due to the risk of vision loss if not quickly identified and treated early in the disease course.
