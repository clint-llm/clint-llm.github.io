The normal fully developed human ear is approximately 6 cm in height, sloped 20 degrees posteriorly from vertical, and has an auriculocephalic angle of 20 to 30 degrees with a 2 to 2.5 cm distance from the helical rim to the mastoid. Microtia is a condition in which there is an underdevelopment of the ear; in some cases, only a portion of the lobule and helix are evident. While examining patients, it is important to perform a complete head and neck examination to include evaluation of the mandible, the oral cavity and palate, the eyes, the function of the facial nerve, the color and quality of the skin, the level of the temporoparietal hairline, and the position of the auricular remnant. In some cases, microtia is associated with genetic syndromes, and therefore examination and notation of syndromic features should be documented as well as inspection for hemifacial microsomia, pre-auricular pits, accessory auricular appendages, and aural atresia. The auricular components of the ear should be examined and compared to the contralateral side.
