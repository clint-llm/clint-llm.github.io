Sebaceous carcinomas tend to be aggressive with significant potential for nodal and distant metastasis. Ocular sebaceous carcinomas have demonstrated a recurrence rate of 11Â to 30% after excision and a rate of metastasis of 25%.

Regional lymph nodes are the most common sites of spread; lungs, brain, liver, small intestine, and urinary tract metastasis have also been reported. Overall mortality rates are between 9 and 50%.
