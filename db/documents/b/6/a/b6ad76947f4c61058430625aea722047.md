This activity will highlight the various types of immunotherapy, including mechanisms of action, adverse event profiles, and other key factors, e.g., dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with conditions that can benefit from receiving immunotherapy.

**Objectives:**
- Identify different categories of immunotherapy.
- Summarize indicated conditions for each type of immunotherapy.
