**History**

- Onset: acute, subacute versus chronic - important in differentiating local eye disease vs. genetic causes. Progressive facial hemiatrophy is typical for Parry-Romberg syndrome.

- Any local eye symptoms such as pain, redness, and visual disturbances suggest local eye diseases.

- History of trauma.

- History of use of eye drops, especially used in one eye, causing discoloration of that eye such as latanoprost and other prostaglandin analog eyedrops.

- Family history of neurofibromatosis type I

**Physical**

- Most important: Review old photos, especially childhood pictures. Look for the presence of heterochromia in the past and signs of Horner syndrome such as miosis and partial ptosis.

- Look for other signs of Horner syndrome - miosis and ptosis.

- Look for signs of specific syndromes such as cutaneous neurofibromata, facial hemiatrophy, facial port-wine stains, hearing loss, and broad facial features.

- Careful exam of the eye, especially the iris, anterior chamber, pupil size and responses, corneal conditions, and intraocular pressure measurement.
