**Acute Poisoning**

Cadmium fumes pose a significant risk to the lungs.  Airway management is essential and supplemental oxygen applied.  Often, steroids area treatment of choice, though their benefit remains unproven.

Ingestion of cadmium poses slightly different concerns.  Activated charcoal and gastric lavage are options.  The patient will require monitoring for gastrointestinal injury as well as renal and hepatic dysfunction.  Chelators, though promising, have not been definitively proven to be useful in cadmium toxicity.  However, it appears that if succimer is given early in the course, it has promising results.

**Chronic Poisoning**

These patients will have a known exposure, and their dysfunction typically discovered on routine screening.  The first intervention is always to remove the patient from the exposure.  Chelation is not currently recommended for these patients even though the effects can be permanent and progressive.
