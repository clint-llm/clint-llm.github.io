Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication of relative insulin deficiency affecting primarily type-1 diabetes mellitus (DM). DKA can occur in type-2 DM when insulin levels fall far behind the bodyâ€™s needs. DKA is so named due to high levels of water-soluble ketone bodies (KBs), leading to an acidotic physiologic state. Ketone bodies, while always present in the blood, increase to pathologic levels when the body cannot utilize glucose: low blood glucose levels during fasting, starvation, vigorous exercise, or secondary to a defect in insulin production. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of diabetic ketoacidosis in the pediatric population and examines the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis, including all necessary laboratory tests.
- Summarize the management options for diabetic ketoacidosis.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for pediatric patients affected by diabetic ketoacidosis.
