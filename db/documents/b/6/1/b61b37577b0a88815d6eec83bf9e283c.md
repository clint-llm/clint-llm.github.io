The prescriber should recheck the LDL-C after starting treatment with alirocumab, evolocumab, or inclisiran.

Inclisiran is dosed at 284 mg every 6 months.

Evolocumab is dosed at 140 mg every two weeks or 420 mg once monthly

Alirocumab usually is started at a dose of 75 mg every two weeks. After 4 to 8 weeks, repeat an LDL-C level. If the LDL-C response is not adequate, increase the dose to the maximum of 150 mg every two weeks. Following the dose adjustment, remeasure the LDL-C level after 4 to 8 weeks.
