Acute anemia occurs when there is an abrupt drop in red blood cells, usually due to acute hemorrhage or hemolysis. This activity reviews the presentation, etiology, evaluation and management of this condition and highlights the role of interprofessional teams in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the signs and symptoms of acute anemia that are likely to be present when a patient has lost greater than twenty percent of their blood volume.
- Identify the most critical steps that should be taken immediately when a patient presents with acute anemia.
- Review the threshold at which a patient should receive a red blood cell transfusion. 
- Explain why an interprofessional care team is critical to improving outcomes for patients with acute blood loss anemia.
