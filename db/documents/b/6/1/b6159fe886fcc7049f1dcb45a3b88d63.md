It is important to know about the various causes of cutaneous lesions mimicking acquired digital fibrokeratoma so that treatment can commence promptly. The differential diagnosis of ADFK includes supernumerary digit, verrucae vulgaris, cutaneous horn, neurofibroma, and pyogenic granuloma.

Supernumerary digit, usually found at the base of the fifth finger is one of the most common hereditary limb malformations. Histologically, rudimentary polydactyly differs from ADFK by the presence ofÂ nerve bundles and neuroid elements.

Verrucae vulgaris, also known as common warts, is the most frequently occurring neoplasm of the hand and fingers and is caused by human papillomavirus types 1, 2, 4, and 29.

A cutaneous horn is a clinical diagnosis referring to an exophytic and hyperkeratotic growth that contains a column of keratin. Histological examination may show a premalignant or malignant underlying process. Cutaneous neurofibromas are benign tumors that may share a clinical resemblance with ADFK and presents as a soft, polypoid, dome-shaped tumor.

Pyogenic granuloma is a common vascular tumor that usually occurs in areas of minor trauma.
