To understand the pathogenesis of holoprosencephaly, one must understand the relationship between the development of the face and the brain. The successful development of the brain and face occurs due to reciprocal signaling of several 'signaling molecules' between the surface ectoderm and neural crest cells that determine the migration of primitive embryonal cells, leading to the formation of highly developed structures. Incomplete diverticulation and cleavage of the embryonic forebrain is the reason for the intracranial pathology. Blocking this signaling alters the dorso-ventral polarity, anterior-posterior axis, and inhibits bilateral symmetry of the forebrain. Shh is one such signaling molecule. Inhibiting Shh expression in the basal telencephalon subsequently impedes the dorso-ventral polarity and inhibits the induction of Shh expression in the Frontonasal Ectodermal Zone (FEZ), leading to multiple midline facial defects. Various degrees of a block in the Shh signaling determine the severity of the disease manifestation.

Incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity make it difficult to predict disease manifestation in the offspring. The parents carrying defined mutations may not have either physical or neurological symptoms. Current studies suggest a multi-hit origin of HPE, explaining the lack of clinical manifestations in patients presenting with the concerned mutations.
