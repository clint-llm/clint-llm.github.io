Complications of arterial cannulation for blood pressure monitoring include:

- Infection

- Lack of collateral circulation resulting in vascular insufficiency

- Formation of a hematoma

- Formation of an arteriovenous (AV) fistula

- Stenosis of vessel

- Blood loss

There is controversy regarding the catheterization of the brachial artery. There are several reasons for this. One reason is its proximity to the median nerve, and therefore inadvertent injury to the median nerve is a possibility. Another concern for catheterization at the brachial artery is thrombosis. The third reason for concern is limb ischemia due to a lack of collateral vessels. However, rates of these complications are low, and catheterization at this site is associated with a lower risk of infection compared with femoral artery catheterization. In cardiac surgery patients, brachial artery catheterization is more reliable compared with radial artery catheterization. This is especially true after cardiopulmonary bypass. Therefore, due to the low risks associated with brachial artery catheterization, this site is a viable option for catheterization of the upper extremity.
