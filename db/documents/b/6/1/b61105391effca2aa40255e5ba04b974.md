Congenital adrenal hypoplasia or AHC is very rare. Clinical experience has suggested it to be more uncommon than congenital adrenal hyperplasia (whichÂ has an incidence of approximately 1 per 10000 to 15000 births worldwide). Patients are more commonly male as one of the mentioned forms is X-linked. The estimated AHC frequency is 1 in 12500 live births. Triple-A syndrome or Allgrove syndrome has a prevalence of 1 per 1000000 individuals. Triple-A syndrome accounts for approximately 1% of all AHC cases and is more common in the middle east, Puerto Rico, and south Europe.
