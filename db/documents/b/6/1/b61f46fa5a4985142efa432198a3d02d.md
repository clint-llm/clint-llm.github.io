# Introduction

As the oldest cerebellar nucleus, the fastigial nucleus (FN) plays essential roles in motor control by sending signals to the brainstem and eye movement nuclei and the maintenance of many activities within the human body, such as feeding, immune, and cardiovascular and respiratory functions.

# Structure and Function

The fastigial nucleus constitutes one of the primary cerebellar nuclei and is situated closest to the midline toward the anterior segment of the superior vermis and over the roof of the fourth ventricle.

- Large glutamatergic projection neurons that transmit their axons to different parts of the brain

- Large glycinergic projection neurons that are situated in the rostral portion of the fastigial nucleus and transmit signals to ipsilateral vestibular nuclei and the caudal brainstem

- Medium-sized GABAergic projection neurons that offer feedback to the inferior olive

- Small GABA/glycine interneurons that restrict their axon terminals in the nucleus and are responsible for signaling and integration in the fastigial nucleus

- Small non-GABAergic interneurons that have faster repolarization and spontaneous firing than GABAergic neurons

As previously mentioned, the fastigial nucleus is essential in motor control by sending signals to the medial descending systems and eye movement nuclei and the maintenance of many activities within the human body, such as feeding, immune, defecation and micturition, and cardiovascular and respiratory functions.

# Embryology

Among the evolution of animals, the three cerebellar nuclei were first discovered in the elasmobranch

# Blood Supply and Lymphatics

One of the arteries that contribute blood to the cerebellum is the superior cerebellar artery (SCA). Another artery that imparts blood to the cerebellum is the anterior inferior cerebellar artery. Finally, the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) also contributes blood to the cerebellum.

# Nerves

Within the cerebellar vermis, Purkinje cells, which constitute the main afferent pathway for the fastigial nucleus, transmit inhibitory GABAergic axons that contain integrated information within the cerebellar vermis to the fastigial nucleus.

The fastigial nucleus also has many efferent pathways. First, it sends descending pathways to the vestibular nuclei along with medullary/pontine reticular formations.

The fastigial nucleus also sends signals to many nonmotor regions in the brain. Many animal studies revealed that the fastigial nucleus could reach structures within the medullary/pontine reticular formations, including the gigantocellular nucleus and nucleus ambiguus.

# Muscles

As mentioned previously, the fastigial nucleus is involved in axial along with proximal motor control. Studies involving patients with lesions in the fastigial nucleus have found that these patients lose control in the muscles of the axial and trunk regions in antigravity posture.

Afferents involving serotonin and histamine have also been shown to be involved in fastigial nucleus-related motor behavior. For instance, serotonin and histamine have excitatory outcomes on the fastigial nucleus.

# Surgical Considerations

Previous studies demonstrated that patients with cerebellar lesions in the fastigial nucleus often have saccadic hypermetria.

# Clinical Significance

As stated previously, the fastigial nucleus plays important roles in motor control by sending signals to the medial descending systems and eye movement nuclei and the maintenance of many activities within the human body, such as feeding, immune, and cardiovascular and respiratory functions. The caudal fastigial nucleus accepts inputs from the oculomotor vermis to predict the real-time motion of the eyes and transmits information to structures in the lower brainstem that are involved in saccades and smooth pursuit movements.

The fastigial nucleus is also involved in feeding control with the hypothalamus, as its stimulation can alter movements within the jejunum, ileum, and colon. Gastric control is also under the regulation of the fastigial nucleus through adrenergic, adrenal catecholamine, and vagal cholinergic release.

The fastigial nucleus has also been shown to regulate defecation and micturition functions. Stimulating the fastigial nucleus suppresses the defecation reflex and alters bladder motility in a bidirectional manner.

Fastigial nucleus lesions are related to many syndromes and disorders. For instance, previous studies have shown that patients with lesions after cerebellar tumor resections demonstrate gait and posture ataxia that often involve the fastigial nucleus. The fastigial nucleus is also related to the pathology of congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS). CCHS is a disorder that causes deficits in the ventilatory response to hypercarbia and hypoxemia. Patients with CCHS often have a defective fastigial nucleus and do not respond well to ventilatory or blood pressure changes. Moreover, stimulating the fastigial nucleus may result in a protective result toward gastric mucosal injury and acute myocardial infarction. Patients with autism and cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome have also been shown to have a dysfunctional fastigial nucleus.
