Detailed knowledge of the anatomy and aging process of the lower eyelid and the periorbital region is crucial when assessing lower eyelid laxity. A thorough preoperative evaluation should include an assessment of the patient's general condition and a local assessment of the anterior, middle, and posterior lamellae. This systematic approach helps the surgeon to formulate a safe preoperative plan when rejuvenating the lower eyelid.
