- Neurofibroma

- Schwannoma

- Lymphomas

- Multiple myeloma

- Osteomyelitis

- Tuberculosis

- Plasmacytoma

- Tuberous sclerosis

- Lymphangioleiomyomatosis

- Pulmonary histiocytic sarcoma

- Emphysema

- Sarcoidosis

Biopsy and histopathological analysis, staining for CD1a, and electron microscopic finding help in differentiatingÂ EG with these conditions.
