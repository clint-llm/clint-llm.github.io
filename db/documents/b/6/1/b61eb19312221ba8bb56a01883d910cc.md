Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare subtype of locally advanced breast cancer according to the TNM breast cancer staging system. It accounts for about 2% to 4% of breast cancer cases in the United States. Despite its low incidence, IBC contributes to 7% of breast cancer caused mortality. It is clinically characterized by diffuse induration of the skin with an erysipeloid appearance, and there is usually no underlying mass.

The current American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) guidelines define IBC as a separate clinicopathologic entity with erythema and edema occupying at least one-third of the breast, that can extend to the whole breast and across to the contralateral breast involving the mediastinum, upper extremities, and neck area.

Diagnostic criteria: IBC is designated as T4d in the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging system. All of the following criteria must be met for a diagnosis of IBC.

- Rapid onset of breast erythema, edema and/or peau d’orange, and/or warm breast, with or without an underlying palpable mass.

- Duration of history no more than six months.

- Erythema occupying at least one-third of the breast.

- Pathologic confirmation of invasive carcinoma.

Differentiation between primary and secondary inflammatory breast cancer should be made.  Primary inflammatory breast cancer is defined as the development of cancer in a previously normal breast. Secondary inflammatory breast cancer is defined as the development of inflammatory skin changes in a breast with invasive cancer or after surgery for non-inflammatory breast cancer.
