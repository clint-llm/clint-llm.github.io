Local trauma, including damage to nearby structures, pain, infection, and reaccumulation of effusion.

If the needle placement is poor or the synovium is thickened, it may result in a dry tap.

Hemarthrosis can occur if a large needle damages a blood vessel when performing multiple attempts. In most cases, the hemarthrosis presents within a few hours after the procedure. It is often associated with pain, stiffness, and swelling of the joint. The majority of hemarthrosis is self-limited and resolves within a few weeks. If the patient has a coagulopathy, it may need to be corrected, and consultation with a hematologist may help.

If arthrocentesis is performed through an infected area of skin to look for a septic joint, the patient must receive antibiotics promptly. If the fluid is frankly purulent, admission is recommended.
