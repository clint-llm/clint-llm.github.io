Autoimmune hepatitis refers to chronic and progressive inflammation of the liver from an unknown cause. The proposed mechanism for the development of autoimmune hepatitisÂ is thought to be the interplay of genetic predisposition, an environmental trigger, and failure of the native immune system resulting in chronic inflammation of hepatocytes and subsequent fibrosis of the liver.
