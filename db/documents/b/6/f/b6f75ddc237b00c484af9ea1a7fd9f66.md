Patients with blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome willÂ require a multispecialty approach to management. They may need evaluation by an orthopedic surgeon if they develop complications from deforming venous malformations in the bone. They will also need monitoring by a gastroenterologist, hematologist, ophthalmologist, and possibly, cardiovascular or neurosurgeon if central nervous system involvement occurs.
