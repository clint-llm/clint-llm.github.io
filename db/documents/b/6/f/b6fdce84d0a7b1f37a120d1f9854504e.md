The initial clinical trials for ranitidine reported the following adverse effects following oral or parenteral administration (frequency not defined):

- Central nervous system (CNS): Malaise, dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, vertigo, mental confusion, agitation, and hallucinations.

- Cardiovascular: Tachycardia, bradycardia, asystole, atrioventricular block, and premature ventricular beats. Bradycardia may be more frequent with rapid intravenous administration and in patients with cardiac rhythm disturbances.

- Gastrointestinal (GI): Constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, pancreatitis.

- Hepatic: Hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed hepatitis; hepatic failure

- Musculoskeletal: Myalgia, arthralgia

- Hematologic: Leukopenia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, agranulocytosis

- Endocrine: Decreased libido, impotence, galactorrhea, gynecomastia

- Integumentary: Rash, alopecia, vasculitis

- Respiratory: Pneumonia

- Renal: Increased serum creatinine, acute interstitial nephritis

- Other: Hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylaxis

Transient pain at the site of intramuscular (IM) injection has been reported. Transient local burning or itching has been reported with intravenous (IV) administration of ranitidine.

The 2015 Beers Criteria list identifies ranitidine as a therapy that may potentially trigger or exacerbate delirium in adults older than 65 years of age. Caution should be used when treating the elderly with ranitidine.

Long-term use of ranitidine for greater than 2 years may also be associated with vitamin B12 deficiency.

**Pregnancy**

Ranitidine is known to cross the placenta; however, it is still commonly used when pregnant patients require acid-suppressing therapy. Of note, increasing studies are revealing a correlation between acid-suppressing therapy use during pregnancy and the development of childhood asthma.
