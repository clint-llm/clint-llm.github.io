The layman's definition of addiction is a "fact or condition of being addicted to a particular substance, thing, or activity." Medically it is a "chronic, relapsing disorder characterized by compulsive drug seeking, continued use despite harmful consequence, and long-lasting changes in the brain." This current Oxford English dictionary definition can be traced back to Roman law in which addiction was a "formal giving over by sentence of the court."
