Isolated radial head dislocation is rare with an unclear pathomechanism, and clinicians often miss this injury. The most common radial head dislocation is anterior and associated with multiple other injuriesÂ such as an ulnar fracture, such as a Monteggia fracture. This combination accounts for less than 2% of all forearm fractures. This fracture is rare in adults, and in children, the peak incidence is between 4 to 10 years of age. Elbow dislocations account for 10 to 25% of elbow injuries, most common between the ages of 10 to 20 years of age.

Congenital radial head dislocation is also very rare. It is almost always a posterior radial head dislocation and is associated with concurrent congenital anomalies. Radial head dislocation in such patients can be bilateral and not associated with trauma. They are most often asymptomatic.
