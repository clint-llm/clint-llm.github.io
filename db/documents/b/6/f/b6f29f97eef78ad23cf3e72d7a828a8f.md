Headache is a common medical complaint. Therefore a headache secondary to ICH can often be confused with more commonly presenting diagnoses such as migraine, tension headache, or meningitis. Other conditions such as subarachnoid hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, over drainage of CSF secondary to a ventricular shunt, arteriovenous malformation, or brain malignancy can present with headache without significant neurological deficits on a physical exam which can make it difficult to distinguish the cause of the headache and make the diagnosis of ICH.
