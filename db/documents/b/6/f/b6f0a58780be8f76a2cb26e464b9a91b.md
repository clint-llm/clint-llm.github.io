**Dorsal Scapular Nerve**

The innervation of the levator scapulae is typically from the dorsal scapular nerve, or DSN, originating from the C4 and C5 nerve roots. This nerve also provides motor innervation to the rhomboids. The DSN arises from the anterior rami of the C5 root, from the upper brachial plexus, and is typically the first nerve branch off the C5 root. Innervation can also be from cervical nerves (C3, C4) via the cervical plexus.
