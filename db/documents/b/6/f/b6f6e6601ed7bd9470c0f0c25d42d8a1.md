Lasegue sign or straight leg raising test (SLRT) is a neurodynamic exam to assess nerve root irritation in the lumbosacral area.

**Historical Evolution**

Traditionally, Ernest-Charles Lasegue (1816-1883) is considered the first physician who verbally described this sign and emphasized its importance in patients with sciatica.Contribuition a l’etude Clinique de la Sciatique in 1881. Both Lasegue and Forst proposed that the sharp pain elicited by the test was due to compression of the sciatic nerve by muscular contraction.

**Anatomy Related to SLRT**

In the lumbar region, the nerve roots cross the intervertebral disc above the neural foraminae through which they exit.

**Causes of Pain While Performing SLRT**

- Stretching of the sciatic nerve

- Displacement of the medulla and conus medullaris

- Nerve compression leads to sensitization at the dorsal root ganglion and posterior horn, which in turn leads to the lowering of the pain threshold.

**Causes of Positive SLRT**

- Nerve root irritation - Intervertebral disc prolapse being the most common cause

- Intraspinal tumor

- Inflammatory radiculopathy

**Examination Techniques**

The original method of examination described by JJ Forst

Patient positioning is supine for this test. The involved lower limb is raised with the knee extended. This should evoke pain. The examiner then repeats the maneuver with the leg flexed at the knee and the thigh flexed on the pelvis. This should not evoke pain.

Currently, the following technique is popular in practice

The patient should be informed about the steps of the test, what to expect during the exam and to describe the pain distribution. The patient should be examined in a neutral supine position with the head slightly extended. During the exam, the hips and legs should stay neutral. No hips abduction or adduction is allowed as well as no leg internal or external rotation is permitted. The affected leg is then passively and slowly raised by the ankle with the knee fully extended. Upon eliciting pain, the examiner stops further leg elevation and records the range of motion along with the area of pain distribution.

It is noteworthy that ankle dorsiflexion during SLRT may exaggerate the pain; notwithstanding, it is not part of the Lasegue sign.

**Criteria for a true positive SLRT**

- Radicular leg pain should occur (radiating below the knee).

- Pain occurs when the leg is between 30 and 60 or 70 degrees from horizontal.

**What findings should not qualify as a positive SLRT?**

- Pain occurring in the low back alone.

- Pain occurring in the posterior thigh alone.

- Pain occurring at an angle less than 30 degrees - May indicate non-organicity or hip joint pathology.

- Pain occurring at an angle more than 70 degrees from the horizontal - More likely cause is tight hamstring or gluteal muscles.

- Pain occurs in a normal person at an angle of 80 to 90 degrees.
