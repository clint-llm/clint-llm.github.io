Motion sickness is inducible in almost all people with a functioning vestibular apparatus and a sufficient provocative stimulus.

Individual susceptibility varies.  Certain characteristics associated with motion sickness include

- Sex – women are more susceptible than men

- Age – motion sickness begins around age 6 and peaks at age 9 - there is a subsequent decline during teen years due to habituation

- Elderly people are the least susceptible to motion sickness

- Fitness level – cross-sectional studies show increased susceptibility in persons with high levels of aerobic fitness; there have been suggestions that this is due to a more reactive autonomic system

- Medical conditions – patients with vertigo, vestibular pathology, Meniere’s disease, and migraines are at elevated risk

- Hormones – fluctuations during pregnancy and the menstrual cycle increase susceptibility
