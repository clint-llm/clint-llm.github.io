The brain needs a constant supply of glucose (through adequate cerebral blood flow) to function and any interruption to this even for few seconds can lead to loss of consciousness or syncope. Cerebral blood flow is maintained by a complex mechanism involving cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, mean arterial pressure, and intravascular volume. Any defect in one or more of these systems leads to decreased cerebral blood flow. Approximately three-fourths of blood is in the venous bed and any interference in venous return can lead to decreased cardiac output.

Any episode lasting more than a few minutes is not syncope and is more likely to be related to a seizure or other acute neurologic process. Seizures are the most common disease misdiagnosed as syncope. When symptoms overlap too closely, the only way to differentiate seizure from syncope may be with an EEG.

Terms near syncope or presyncope are confusing in that they may convey a different meaning to different practitioners. However, when a practitioner defines near syncope as “a feeling that you were going to pass out but did not” then, near syncope and syncope are both thought to be related to cerebral hypoperfusion, and therefore, any disease process which decreases blood flow can cause syncope and near syncope.
