Contraindication of wound debridement, in general, may be applied to dry and intact eschars with no clinical evidence of underlying infection, such as with an unstageable pressure ulcer with an intact eschar at the sacrum or buttock, or heel.

Other contraindications pertain to each particular method of debridement.
