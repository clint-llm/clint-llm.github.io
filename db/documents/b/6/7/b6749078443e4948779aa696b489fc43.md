Standard of care for HIV treatment requires the combination of NRTI, NNRTI, protease inhibitors, and integrase strand transfer inhibitors. Currently, the recommended regimen consists of a "2+1" method where the patient should start on 2 NRTIs followed by either an NNRTI, a protease inhibitor (with ritonavir boosting), or an integrase inhibitor. As for selecting the NRTI, a variety of factors like HIV strain sensitivity, contraindications, adverse reactions, and current medications should be taken into account. The International Antiretroviral Society recommends that treatment starts on the day of diagnosis to have maximum efficacy and slow the progression of the disease as quickly as possible. According to the IAS, for new HIV infections, the recommended initial treatments are integrase inhibitor-based:

- Dolutegravir + tenofovir alafenamide + emtricitabine

- Bictegravir + tenofovir alafenamide + emtricitabine

For cases of preexposure prophylaxis, the recommended treatment regimen:

- Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + emtricitabine.

Postexposure prophylaxis is attainable through either one of the following regimens for four weeks:

- Dolutegravir + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + emtricitabine (preferred)

- Raltegravir + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + emtricitabine

The following list contains some of the approved drugs that fall in the NRTI and NNRTI categories of reverse transcriptase inhibitors and the dose ranges for each drug. All RTIs come in an oral tablet or solution form, with certain drugs coming in other formulations.
