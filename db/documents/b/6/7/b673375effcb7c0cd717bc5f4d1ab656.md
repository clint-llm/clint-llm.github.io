Essential thrombocytosis usually presents as an incidental finding. Once diagnosed, the most important step is to risk-stratify patients. Patients could be categorized under low, intermediate or high risk. This stratification guides healthcare professionals to decide what treatment strategy to perform. Educating patients on their risk of thrombosis and hemorrhage is imperative as this could encourage patient compliance. Some low-risk patients are only required to take aspirin daily. It is essential that a patient who is younger than 12-years-old should not be treated with aspirin to avoid Reye syndrome.

Although the cytoreductive medications currently available help to reduce thrombotic, hemorrhagic events and conversion to myelofibrosis or acute leukemia, more research needs to be done by pharmaceutical companies and physicians to find a cure. The current goal of managing essential thrombocytosis is to prevent vascular events. It is imperative to find a cure as complications due to stroke, and myocardial infarction could be deadly and cause untimely deaths in high-risk patients.

Treatment and management of essential thrombocytopenia require an interprofessional team approach, involving physicians, nursing staff, and pharmacy, working together to achieve optimal patient outcomes. [Level V]
