Becker muscular dystrophy is caused by a mutation in a protein called dystrophin. The defective gene is located in theÂ Xp21.2 chromosome, and the defect is inherited as an X-linked recessive trait. Patients without a clear X-linked pattern of inheritance may have defects in other genes, affecting the dystrophin-associated glycoproteins.
