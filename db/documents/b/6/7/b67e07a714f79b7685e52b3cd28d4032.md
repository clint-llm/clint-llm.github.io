Gammopathy is caused by the aggregation of immunoglobulin (Ig) in various tissues. Ig can accumulate in most ocular tissues, including the cornea or retina, resulting in various pathologies due to the interference of normal tissue functioning by protein invasion. In paraproteinemic keratopathy, immunoglobulins form paracrystalline inclusions that impair corneal transparency, resulting in reduced visual acuity.

Multiple studies have additionally shown that patients with monoclonal gammopathy have significant decreases in corneal transparency as measured by corneal densitometry. It is unclear if these corneal changes lead to paraproteinemic keratopathy; however, these findings suggest that corneal deposition may be present subclinically in all patients with monoclonal gammopathy. It is not understood why some patients develop PPK, defined by paracrystalline deposit formation and visual impairment, while most do not.
