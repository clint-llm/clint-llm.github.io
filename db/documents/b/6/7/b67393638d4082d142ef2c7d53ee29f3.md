As mentioned, Ludwig angina is a rapidly progressive cellulitis that can cause airway obstruction requiring immediate intervention. The presence of airway symptoms or the inability to manage oral secretions are clear indications for elective intubation in order to prevent potential mortality in cases of Ludwig angina.

Furthermore, close monitoring is essential to prevent the spread of cellulitis to adjacent areas, which can lead to complications such as mediastinitis or neck cellulitis. Additionally, Ludwig angina can progress to aspiration pneumonia. Descending necrotizing mediastinitis, occurring predominantly through the retropharyngeal space (71%) or the carotid sheath (21%), is a severe complication that requires attention.
