Initial evaluation of the comatose patient should always include assessment with intervention as necessary of the airway, breathing, and circulatory conditions (A,B,C's). The differential diagnosis of coma is extensive. Unless a recognizable infectious or metabolic cause of coma is promptly established, additional testing will be necessary. Laboratory and toxicologic tests should be obtained as indicated. Initial stat labs would include electrolytes, CBC, arterial or venous blood gas analysis, and possibly toxicologic testing. As the case progresses, neuroimaging may be indicated. CT and MRI brain scanning may detect hemorrhage, mass effect, or other structural abnormalities. Vascular imaging may reveal large vessel occlusion. Initial efforts will be to determine a likely structural or non-structural cause of coma leading to appropriate interventions and consultations. EEG should be considered in a patient following generalized convulsive status epilepticus with continued altered mental status since status epilepticus may continue with little or no associated motor movements. A checklist approach is suggested to indicate whether advanced imaging is needed or advanced laboratory testing.
