For melanoma or other cutaneous lesions, radiotracer should be injected intradermally around the lesion with a fine gauge needle, tangential with the skin. Two to four injections around the site with 0.1 to 0.2 mL of technetium 99 deposited each time. The total activity of around 200-1,000 microCuries will be injected.

For breast malignancy, there are several techniques that could be performed with the most common technique being perilesional injection (whether superficial or deep) with 3-4 mL injected with a total activity of 200 to 3,000 microCuries. Another method includes intradermal or subcutaneous injection superficial to the lesion with 0.2 to 1 mL of technetium 99 injected with a total activity of 150-2,000 microCuries. Other methods include periareolar region injection and intralesional injection.

For lymphatic flow pathology, the interdigital space of the affected extremity should be injected with 0.05 mL of technetium 99 with a total activity of 500 microCuries.

The planar scintillation camera is then set appropriately for technetium 99 with a large field-of-view detector and parallel-hole collimator. Image acquisition should occur immediately after injection until 45 minutes to an hour after the injection, and a cobalt-57 flood source can be utilized to outline the body for better localization. If anatomy is more complex, SPECT-CT can be used for cross-sectional analysis. Status (planar) imaging should be obtained at 15 to 30 minutes, 1 hour, and 2 to 4 hours after injection and as needed, according to the radiologist, up to 24 hours after injection. The three planes that should be obtained include anterior, anterior oblique, and lateral. Image acquisition time takes up to 5 minutes to obtain sufficient counts. The number of counts within a sentinel lymph node has not been shown to correspond to the severity of the disease; therefore identification of the sentinel lymph node is the most important factor and purpose. Dynamic imaging can be obtained if desired according to the interpreter’s request.

If the patient is undergoing the examination for identification of the sentinel lymph node during surgery, a gamma probe will be utilized to identify the area of highest activity.

The technical success rate of lymphoscintigraphy is close to 100%.
