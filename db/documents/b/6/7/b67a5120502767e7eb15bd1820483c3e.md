The diagnosis and management of hepatic cysts often require integrating multiple aspects of care, involving various sub-specialties: primary care physicians, interventional radiology, oncologist, hepatology, nephrology, infectious diseases, surgery, a specially trained nurse, and pharmacists. It is important for the involved physicians to coordinate patient care to provide the best healthcare possible, improve their outcomes, andÂ achieve optimal patient results.

HCs encounters for a wide range of disorder. Physicians must have a high index of suspicion for rare diseases to provide as accurate a diagnosis as possible.

Enhancing patient outcomes starts with the clinician's awareness of BCA and the associated risk of developing BCAC. A thorough history and imaging are essential to differentiate this entity from other benign hepatic cysts due to different management options. The clinicians need to follow the patient with sequential imaging to ensure that malignant transformation does not occur. Following surgery, there is a risk of recurrence of BCAC; thus, patients require monitoring for any symptom development and imaging findings.

There is a paucity of randomized controlled trials and research other than anecdotal reports comparing treatment methods for simple hepatic cysts.
