HPV is a non-enveloped DNA virus with a circular double-stranded DNA. After infection of a basal cell, HPV transcribes one of its two DNA strands, thus leading to viral protein formation. Two proteins, E6 and E7, are responsible for the oncogenic effects of the virus. They interrupt normal cell death pathways and promote cellular proliferation by interfering with the tumor suppressor genes RB and p53. If the virus incorporates its DNA into the genome (integrated viral DNA), it replicates in the maturing squamous cells. The koilocytic morphology results from E4 protein, which acts to disrupt the cytoskeleton of the squamous cell.
