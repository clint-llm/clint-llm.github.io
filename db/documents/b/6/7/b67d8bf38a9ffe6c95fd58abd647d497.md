The typical patient is an overweight black African, African-American, or Afro-Caribbean child. Disease onset is before three years of age. The prevalence of early-onset Blount disease in the Caribbean has been estimated at 1/1200 live births. Early ambulation, before ten months of age, is common. The physiologic bowing of the legs becomes more marked and often asymmetrical. The abnormality is bilateral initially in 50% of cases.

The growth disorder occurs at the posteromedial proximal tibia and results in a three-dimensional deformity combining varus, procurvatum, and internal tibial rotation, as well as in limb length discrepancy. Lateral thrust during weight-bearing is a critical clinical finding. Irreversible asymmetric medial proximal tibial epiphysiodesis usually develops towards 6 to 8 years of age, making conservative treatments ineffective. The knee deformities and associated abnormalities worsen gradually.
