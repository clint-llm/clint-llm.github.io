The prognosis of patients with a prostate abscess mainly depends on a timely diagnosis and proper treatment as well as their prior general health and comorbidities. Early recognition of this disorder with timely and appropriate treatment modalities dramatically improves the prognosis. Conservatively treated patients may avoid a surgical procedure but will typically need a longer duration of antibiotic therapy. Regardless of interventions, the treatment period with antibiotics is longer in prostatic abscess cases than in similar acute bacterial prostatitis patients without such abscesses.

Poor prognostic factors include age above 65 years, presenting temperatures higher than 100.4 F (38 C), history of urinary retention or symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia, chronic Foley catheterization, uncontrolled or poorly controlled diabetes, HIV/AIDS, debilitated general health status, and renal failure. It is a potentially lethal condition if not promptly diagnosed and properly treated in a timely fashion.
