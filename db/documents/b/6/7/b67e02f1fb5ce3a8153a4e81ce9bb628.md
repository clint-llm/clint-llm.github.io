Nitroglycerin has many adverse effects of significance, most resulting from the vasodilatory effects of the medication.

- Dizziness

- Weakness

- Palpitations

- Vertigo

- Headaches

- Nausea

- Vomiting

- Diaphoresis

- Syncope

Many of these adverse effects are secondary to the hypotensive effects of nitroglycerin. Patients may report symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, which manifest as dizziness, weakness, palpitations, and vertigo. Profound hypotension may occur in patients with preload-dependent conditions. Some patients can be more sensitive to the hypotension caused by nitrates, potentially resulting in nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, pallor, and collapse even at therapeutic doses. There have also been reports of flushing, exfoliative dermatitis, and drug rash in some patients taking nitroglycerin. Headaches can be severe, throbbing, and persistent and may occur immediately after use.

Syncope is the most dangerous adverse effect and can result in falls and their resultant injuries. The risk of syncope significantly increases with the concurrent use of a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor. A further discussion is included below under contraindications.
