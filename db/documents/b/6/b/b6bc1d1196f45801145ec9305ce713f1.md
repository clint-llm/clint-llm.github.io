Cervical cancer is commonly diagnosed in women aged 35 to 45 years. A thorough history reveals the presence of essential risk factors that are associated with cervical cancer, such as an immunocompromised state, high-risk sexual behavior, multiple sexual partners, history of sexually transmitted diseases, and tobacco smoking. Many women are asymptomatic. However, she can present with any of the following symptoms:

- Postcoital bleeding/intermenstrual bleeding

- Increased vaginal discharge

- Pelvic or low back pain

On inspection, the cervix often appears normal, or there may be cervicitis or erosion that bleeds with touch. Inguinal lymphadenopathy may be present.

Late complications that result due to the spread of cervical cancer include:

- Hydronephrosis may develop due to compression of the ureters by tumor

- Lower extremity edema that may occur due to compression of veins and lymphatics in the pelvic region by tumor

- Lymphadenopathy, abdominal, chest, or bone abnormalities (e.g., pain) due to metastases to these regions

- Advanced-stage cancer may present with acute heavy vaginal bleeding
