The development of the embryo undergoes the formation of three distinct layers (the trilaminar disc). These layers are known as the outer ectoderm, middle mesoderm, and inner endoderm. Along the midline, differentiation of neural cells forms the neural tube, which continues development within the mesoderm. Folding in such a way that endoderm becomes internalized produces a three-layered tubular structure from which all the structures of the thorax originate.

**Thoracic Wall**

During development, paraxial mesoderm somites form on opposite sides of the neural tube.

**Thoracic Cavity**

The cardiovascular system originates from the mesoderm layer as a coalescence of cardiac myoblasts what is known as the cardiogenic field.

The respiratory system originates from the ventral wall of the primitive foregut endoderm as a diverticulum at 3 to 6 weeks.

The thymus develops in the thoracic cavity with origins from the ventral thirdÂ pharyngeal pouch.
