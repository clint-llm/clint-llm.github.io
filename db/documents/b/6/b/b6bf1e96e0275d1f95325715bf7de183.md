Mollart and Goulon first coined the term 'coma depasse,' meaning a state beyond coma, for brain death.

**Persistent vegetative state**- loss of only cortical functions with intact brain stem functions

**Brain-stem death**- absent brain stem reflexes but the presence of few cortical as well as hypothalamic integrity such as osmoregulation

**Whole Brain death**- biological death with absent cortical and brainstem functions

**Death**- Whole-brain death along with the cardiopulmonary arrest
