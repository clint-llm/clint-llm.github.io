**Origin, insertion, and structure**

The detailed anatomic structure of the ITB, TFL, and its origins, insertions, and variations have been debated for decades in the literature.  Huang et al. delineated the proximal anatomy in a recent study from 2013.

**Proximal anatomy**

- The proximal IT tract begins as three distinct layers coursing distally to fuse/coalesce at the level of the greater trochanter (GT)

- Superficial IT layer: 

- Origin: Ilium (superficial to the TFL origin)


- Intermediate IT layer:

- Origin: Ilium (distal to the TFL origin)

- The intermediate layer's location is consistently deep to the TFL muscle layer




- Deep IT layer
- Recognized as a constant structure 
- Portions of the deep IT layer are also confluent with the hip joint capsule itself
- Origin: arises from the supra-acetabular fossa between the hip joint capsule and the reflected head of the rectus femoris

- TFL 

- Separate origin of TFL fibers originates off the ilium and in between the superficial and intermediate IT layer origins 
- Distally, the TFL becomes a tendinous structure as it merges with the superficial and intermediate IT layers
- Farther distal, the TFL tendinous fibers, including the superficial and intermediate IT layers, fuse as a single confluent structure near the level of the GT

- Gluteal contributions

- Gluteal aponeurotic fascia:

- Originates from the posterior iliac crest
- Courses distally to invest the anterior two-thirds of the gluteus medius 
- A portion of its fibers merge with the posterior ITB to continue distally while the remaining aponeurotic fibers insert at the gluteal tuberosity on the femur


- In addition, the posterior ITB also receives distinct fascial/tendinous contributions from:

- Superior gluteus maximus
- Superficial fibers of the inferior gluteus maximus


- Deep fibers from the inferior gluteus maximus course toward the femur to insert onto the gluteal tuberosity of the linea aspera

**Distal anatomy:**

Proximal to the knee joint, the ITB attaches to the intermuscular septum and supracondylar tubercle of the femur.  Proximal to the lateral epicondyle, there is an interposed fat layer between the ITB and the vastus lateralis.

**Function**

Proximal ITB function includes

- Hip extension

- Hip abduction

- Lateral hip rotation

Distally, ITB function depends on the position of the knee joint

- 0 degrees/full extension to 20 to 30 degrees of flexion 

- Active knee extensor

- The ITB lies anterior to the lateral femoral epicondyle

- 20 to 30 degrees of flexion to full flexion ROM

- Active knee flexor

- ITB lies posterior relative to the lateral femoral epicondyle
