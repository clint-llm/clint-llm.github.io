Fully trained, certified, and licensed nuclear medicine technologists under the supervision of a qualified, licensed, and board-certified nuclear medicine physician must oversee the care of nuclear medicine patients. Close attention should be paid to the training of proper radiolabeling of white blood cells. In addition, nuclear medicine technologists should be well trained in aseptic techniques to prepare radiopharmaceuticals in general and specifically when handling a patient's white blood cells.

While all radiopharmaceutical misadministrations are considered serious, the inadvertent administration of one patient's leukocytes to another patient may have serious consequences, including anaphylaxis or transmission of hepatitis, HIV, or another inoculant.  Similarly, leukocytes obtained from patients potentially infected with transmittable pathogens must be handled, labeled, and reinfused with the utmost caution to avoid inadvertent contamination. Labeling steps should not be performed in a rush. There should be no shortcuts to the multiple levels of confirmation needed to ensure the correct identity of a given patient's leukocytes.

Completion of the study should require a nuclear medicine physician, technologist, and potentially a radio pharmacist when available.  A nuclear medicine physician should initiate the study by written prescription after receiving a written order from the patient's referring physician.  A technologist will collect the required blood sample and either radiolabel the sample or have a nuclear pharmacist perform the labeling.  Subsequently, the radiolabeled autologous leukocytes will be readministered to the patient, followed by imaging. All personnel involved will be appropriately trained to provide these patient care services.

If any discrepancy is observed regarding the patient-sample identification process, the technologist should immediately return the dosage syringe, injection tray, and the completed radiolabeled blood product administration record to the nuclear pharmacy for disposition.
