Appropriate patient position can facilitate proper physiologic function during pathophysiologic processes and also facilitate access to certain anatomical locations during surgical procedures. Multiple factors should be considered when choosing the patient's position. These factors include patient age, weight, and size as well as past medical history, including respiratory or circulatory disorders.
