Failure or late treatment of a hypertensive emergency can result in renal failure, retinopathy, myocardial infarction, and stroke. In particular, without prompt treatment of high blood pressure in patients with encephalopathy, brain edema can progress and lead to status epilepticus, coma, or death. Aggressive treatment of hypertension is not advised and can lead to ischemic conditions in target organs, especially in patients with an adapted autoregulatory mechanism due to chronic hypertension.
