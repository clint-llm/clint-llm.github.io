Sympathetic ganglia and nerves except the preganglionic neurons form from the neural crest cells. During neurulation, the neural crest cells migrate to cranial, vagal, trunk and lumbosacral areas. Trunk neural crest population gives rise to sympathetic ganglia. Neural crest cells migrate ventrally to the area of future paravertebral and prevertebral plexuses forming the sympathetic chain and major ganglia around the ventral branches of the abdominal aorta.
