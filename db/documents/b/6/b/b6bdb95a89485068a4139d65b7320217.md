The treatment outcome, in general, can be enhanced if the dentists have thorough knowledge about the treatment of oral conditions related to HIV infection, such as hairy leukoplakia. Based on the patientâ€™s history, physical and laboratory findings, the dentist and his interprofessional health care team should formulate a plan of adequate follow-up care. The role of health care professionals goes beyond basic education and training. It extends to providing proper knowledge and information to the patients regarding oral lesions along with the development of reinforcing educational programs as early diagnosis and management of these lesions play a vital role in reducing the impact of the disease on the patient. Specialty trained nurses in AIDS and otolaryngology educate patients, arrange for follow-up, and facilitate communication among the team. Pharmacists consult with clinicians to determine the appropriate agent(s) and dosing, review prescriptions, check for interactions and inform patients. These interprofessional interventions will improve patient outcomes.[Level 5]
