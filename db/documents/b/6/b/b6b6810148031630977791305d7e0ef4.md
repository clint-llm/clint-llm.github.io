Patients that may benefit from the procedure are first assessed and identified by endocrinologists. Patients that meet the criteria are then evaluated by a psychologist to determine their motivation and ability to commit to therapy. Transplant surgeons harvest the islet cells from deceased donors.

After harvesting islet cells, they must be separated from the exocrine pancreas in an enzymatic and density centrifugation process. Grafts then undergo assessment and rate as adequate when they contain 5,000 high-quality islets per Kg (recipient). Typically recipients are infused with islet cells from multiple donors. Infusing a larger number of islets increases the chances that an adequate number will survive.
