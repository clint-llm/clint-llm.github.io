The pathogenesis of apocrine hidrocystoma is not entirely known. The tumor derives from the secretory part of apocrine sweat glands. Apocrine hidrocystoma is currently considered to be a cystic proliferation of apocrine glands, rather than a simple retention cyst. Multiple apocrine hidrocystomas have been described in two rare ectodermal dysplasias: a particular form of Goltz-Gorlin syndrome and Schopf-Schultz-Passarge syndrome. Goltz-Gorlin syndrome (Focal dermal hypoplasia) is an X-linked dominant disease characterized by linear skin atrophy, microcephaly, microphthalmia, midfacial hypoplasia, malformation of the ears, mental retardation, and skeletal abnormalities. Some additional clinical findings were described in a particular form combining multiple apocrine hidrocystomas, bilateral keratoconus, esophageal papillomatosis and hiatus hernia. Schopf-Schultz-Passarge syndrome is an autosomal recessive condition characterized by the association of multiple eyelid apocrine hidrocystomas with hypotrichosis, hypodontia, palmar and plantar hyperkeratosis, as well as nail fragility
