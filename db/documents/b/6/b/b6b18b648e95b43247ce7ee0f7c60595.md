Robotic TKR was developed to improve bone preparation accuracy and decrease the possibility of outliers to guarantee a longer prosthesis lifespan. Adequate restoration of the mechanical axis in TKA is associated with a decrease in polyethylene wear and a lower revision arthroplasty rate.

Some literature demonstrated accepted flexion and extension gaps in 94% of the robotic TKR patients however in the conventional TKR patients this figure was 80%. The system allows the surgeon to adjust soft tissue balance using gap measurements provided by the robotic software. This can be done before any bone cuts or after cuts are made.
