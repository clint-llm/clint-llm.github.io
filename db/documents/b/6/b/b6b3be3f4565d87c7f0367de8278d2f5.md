The peroneal magnus artery is a congenital vascular variant of the lower leg.  In patients with a peroneal magnus artery, the anterior and posterior tibial arteries are smaller than normal, and the peroneal magnus artery is larger than normal peroneal arteries.  The peroneal magnus artery provides the majority of blood supply to the lower leg and foot.  A peroneal magnus artery is seen in up to 5% of the population.

Patients with a peroneal magnus artery that undergo vascular surgery involving grafting in the lower leg have an increased likelihood of experiencing surgical complications such as foot and limb ischemia.
