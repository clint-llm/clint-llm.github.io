Per the manufacturer's labeling, trihexyphenidyl is contraindicated in those with hypersensitivity to the drug (trihexyphenidyl HCl) or any drug formulation ingredients. It is also contraindicated in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma because it possesses anticholinergic activity that could cause mydriasis, further narrowing the angle of the lens, increasing the IOP, and worsening the condition.
