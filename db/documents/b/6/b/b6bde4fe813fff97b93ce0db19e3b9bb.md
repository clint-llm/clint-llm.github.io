All parts of the hypothalamus receive vascular supply from arteries derived from the circle of Willis. Specifically, the anterior hypothalamus, including the supraoptic nuclei, is supplied by branches of the anterior cerebral and anterior communicating arteries. This system provides a dense assortment of collateral blood supplies, which contributes to the stroke-resistant nature of the hypothalamus.
