**Potential Routes of Transmission of Infectious Agents in Dental Practice**

The spread of pathogens may occur through direct contact (person to person) via blood, saliva, secretions, or indirect contact through contaminated instruments, equipment, or surfaces. Inhalation of pathogens suspended in the air (airborne transmission) is also a possible route of infection in the dental setting.

An important transmission route in the dental office is direct exposure to blood and body fluids.

In principle, any disease could be transmitted in the dental office, but some conditions are more relevant to dental professionals than others. Bloodborne pathogens of concern include hepatitis B and C viruses and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The most common mode of transmission of HBV in dentistry is by percutaneous injury,

The highest risk of HIV transmission is with percutaneous injuries; however, after a needlestick exposure to HIV-contaminate blood, the approximate risk of transmission is 0.3% per exposure.

Other more common viruses can also be acquired in the dental office, including rubella, mumps, and measles; herpes viruses, human papillomaviruses; adenovirus; coxsackie viruses; and upper respiratory tract viruses like influenza A and B viruses and coronavirus (COVID-19).

For any of these pathogens to cause disease, the following factors must be present independently from the route.

- A sufficient number of disease-producing microorganisms.

- A reservoir, most likely a body fluid (blood, saliva, oral and respiratory secretions).

- A route of transmission from the source to the host.

- An entrance to the host.

- A nonimmune host (susceptible host).

Infection control prevents infection transmission by acting on one or more of these factors through implementing standard and transmission-based precautions. Standard precautions - the basic strategies to prevent and minimize the risk of infection transmission - are taken with all patients. Extra protection, "transmission-based precautions," are used when patients are suspected or known to be infected with pathogens that can be transmitted by contact, droplets, or air.

**Standard Precautions**

- Regular hand washing.

- Personal protective equipment, including mask, eye protection, gloves, and gown.

- Appropriate protective equipment for the specific task, for example, using heavy-duty gloves for cleaning and processing instruments.

- Adequate management of sharps.

- Appropriate cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization of patient care equipment.

- Cleaning and disinfection of environmental surfaces.

- Preventing injuries through safe work practices.

Standard precautions should be applied with all patients whenever there is contact with mucous membranes or non-intact skin, but also when:

- Cleaning the dental surgery.

- Handling objects that have been in contact with saliva, like an x-ray film.

- Cleaning and processing instruments.

- Handling body fluids, like blood, saliva, and other secretions.

**Transmission-based Precautions**

Transmission-based precautions are applied when standard precautions alone are insufficient to prevent the spread of certain infectious microbes. The measures used depend on the mode of transmission of the specific agent. Transmission-based precautions are mainly used in the dental setting to prevent airborne infections.

To prevent the spread of airborne infectious agents, evidence recommends using negatively pressurized rooms and a P2 (N95) surgical respirator, which achieves a better seal with the face. Non-emergency dental treatment must be postponed in patients with viral influenza, active tuberculosis, chickenpox, or measles. If patients with viral influenza require emergency care, transmission-based precautions must be applied:

- The patient must be scheduled for the last appointment of the day, minimizing contact with other patients, or at least 30 minutes must be left before the next appointment.

- A mouth rinse must be offered before initiating treatment.

- Dental dam isolation must be used for restorative treatments.

- The use of aerosol-generating procedures must be avoided or minimized.

- Environmental surfaces must be cleaned twice.

- Providers delivering treatment must be immunized against the current influenza strain.

After the appearance of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), extra infection control measures have been implemented in the dental office.

Most dental clinics are not designed to execute all transmission-based precautions, e.g., negatively pressurized rooms; effective systems must be in place to identify and manage potentially infected patients.

**Respiratory Hygiene**

Respiratory hygiene is designed to prevent the transmission of pathogens spread by air or droplets. Recommendations include the following:

- Implement measures to contain respiratory secretions, like having signs at entrances with recommendations to cover their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing.

- Provide masks to patients with respiratory symptoms entering the dental setting.

- Ask patients and companions not to come to the dental office if they have respiratory infection symptoms unless it is an emergency.

- Wash hands after being in contact with respiratory secretions.

**Management of Patients with Bloodborne Infections**

Patients with confirmed bloodborne infections are treated using standard precautions. No extra cleaning and sterilization measures are taken. Dental health care personnel must be confident that the infection control and prevention protocols work well with every patient regardless of their infectious status.
