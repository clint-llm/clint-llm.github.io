Rhino-orbital cerebral mucormycosis has significant morbidity and mortality despite available medical and surgical management. Education of patients and relatives is of paramount importance to reduce certain preventable factors, and for ensuring early presentation to the clinician, thereby preventing a delay in diagnosis and treatment.

Rhino-orbital cerebral mucormycosis is most commonly seen in patients with diabetes mellitus, especially when their glucose is uncontrolled. These patients must constantly monitor and control their blood sugar, which could help reduce the incidence in the general population. All immunocompromised patients and their relatives need to be adequately advised regarding seeking urgent medical attention in case of any ear, nose, eye issues even when they are subtle. Neutropenic patients fail to show any sign of inflammation, and hence a very high index of suspicion on the part of patients and relatives is again advisable. Once rhino-orbital cerebral mucormycosis is diagnosed, the patients and family need to be adequately counseled regarding poor prognosis, and the pros and cons of extensive surgical debridement, including the potential for severe disfigurement after the procedure. Varying residual neurologic sequelae are seen in up to two-thirds of the patients.
