The pathophysiology leading to the development of colovesicular fistulas can differ depending on the specific etiology.

**Diverticular Disease**

The pathophysiology behind colovesicular fistula formation begins with the formation of diverticula in the sigmoid colon. These are false diverticula characterized by the protrusion of the mucosa and submucosa through the muscularis propria at the point of entry of the vasa recta (blood supply to the mucosa/submucosa and a point of relative weakness in the colonic wall on the mesenteric side). These outpouchings occur mainly secondary to high intraluminal pressure which is exacerbated by muscularis hypertrophy, altered colonic motility, and narrowing of the lumen. The theory that fecaliths obstruct the lumen of the diverticula leading to distention and perforation is now out of date. The more reasonable theory is that increased intraluminal pressure with abnormal peristalsis directs force radially into the diverticula and cause micro or macro perforations which are characterized as diverticulitis. This may result in a diverticular abscess or phlegmon that ruptures into an adjacent organ (i.e., the bladder) and creates a fistula.

**Malignancy**

The most common malignant etiology of colovesicular fistulas is colonic adenocarcinoma directly invading the urinary bladder and forming an abnormal connection.

**Crohn’s Disease**

Long-standing transmural inflammation results in the formation of fistulae between the colon and other organs (bladder, bowel, uterus, vagina). Up to 35% of patient with Crohn’s disease develop fistulas.  Most commonly these involve the small intestine leading to entero-entero, entero-colonic, ileo-sigmoid, and entero-cutaneous fistulae, among others. Rarely, long-standing Crohn’s colitis of the sigmoid colon can lead to colovesicular or colovaginal fistulas.
