Chondromalacia patellae may be reversible, or it could progress to the development of patellofemoral osteoarthritis. Patients with knee pain resulting from chondromalacia patella often achieve full recovery. Depending on the case, recovery can occur in as little as a month or take years. Teenagers often achieve long-term recovery because their bones are still growing, and their symptoms generally ameliorate after reaching adulthood.
