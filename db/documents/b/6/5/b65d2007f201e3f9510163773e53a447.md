Venous access can be obtained through the cannulation of peripheral veins, such as the antecubital or saphenous vein, or central veins, such as the internal jugular or femoral vein. The insertion of a central venous line is potentially life-saving in that it allows for the rapid administration of high volumes of isotonic fluids and medications that would otherwise be caustic to peripheral veins. In most instances, central venous access with ultrasound guidance is considered the standard of care. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and techniques involved in performing femoral vein cannulation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for femoral vein cannulation.
- Describe the technique involved in performing femoral vein cannulation.
- Outline the complications of femoral vein cannulation.
- Explain the importance of improving coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care for patients undergoing femoral vein cannulation.
