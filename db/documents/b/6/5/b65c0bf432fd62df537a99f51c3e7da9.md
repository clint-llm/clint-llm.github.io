Intestinal trauma can result from blunt or penetrating abdominal injuries and can cause a wide range of injuries from intestinal bruising to intestinal necrosis. The management options are also vast; therefore, providers must understand the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of intestinal injury. Failure to recognize and properly treat intestinal trauma can result in significant morbidity and mortality to the patient.
