Abnormal fetal venous circulation is observable in patients with the absence of the ductus venosus with the main abnormalities being

- Umbilical vein bypasses the hepatic system and draining into the right atrium

- Umbilical vein connects directly to the inferior vena cava via iliac veins

- Umbilical vein drains into the portal circulation

Researchers have noted that decreased or abnormal blood flow through the ductus venosus during the first trimester has links with aneuploidies such as trisomy 13, 18, 21, and Turner syndrome.
