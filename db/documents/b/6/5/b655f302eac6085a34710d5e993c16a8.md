Diagnosing and treating peripheral arterial disease requires cooperation and communication between healthcare providers. There is often a multidisciplinary team providing medical and invasive interventional management for the patient. Peripheral arterial disease involves interventional radiologists, interventional cardiologists, vascular and plastic surgeons, endocrinologists, and primary care physicians. There are multiple forms of lifestyle, medical and surgical management available (as well as various guidelines for management). Therefore, the entire healthcare team and the patient must make an informed decision to maximize patient-centered outcomes.
