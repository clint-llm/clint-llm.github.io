Acupuncture is a system of medical treatment and ideology that is based on the principle of applying small needles or pressure to specific points in the body. The origins of this treatment system are grounded in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), with underlying philosophical principles associated with Confucianism and Taoism. Under this ideology, health stems from the alignment of qi which means "vital energy" and encompasses the yin/yang dichotomy that flows through all of the physical worlds. This activity describes the physiology and mode of action underlying acupuncture and highlights the role of interprofessional healthcare providers in educating patients on pain management.
