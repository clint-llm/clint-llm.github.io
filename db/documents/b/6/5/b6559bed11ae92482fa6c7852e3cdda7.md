Pingueculae are usually well-defined nodular lesions. Histologically, the epithelium is normal, thinned, hyperkeratotic, or hyperplastic. In patients with brown or black skin, epithelial racial melanosis will be evident. The substantia propria exhibits basophilic staining on hematoxylin and eosin staining, termed elastotic degeneration. This elastotic degeneration consists of material that stains elastin but is not degraded by elastase. Sometimes it is associated with fat or calcified globules. In a pinguecula, the elastotic degeneration is nodular. Histologically pinguecula is analogous to pterygium, except for the lack of vascularisation and corneal involvement.

A study localized advanced glycation end (AGE) products in the subepithelial amorphous deposit in pinguecula, which may denote the severity of exposure to ultraviolet light or the reduced levels of anti-oxidants.
