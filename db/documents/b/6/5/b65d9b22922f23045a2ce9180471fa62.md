Patients with a LGIB usually present to the emergency department. Because there are many causes of a LGIB the disorder is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a surgeon, gastroenterologist, radiologist, intensivist and the emergency department physician. Depending on the severity of the bleed, these patients may require admission to the ICU and monitoring by the nurses. Some of these patients may require resuscitation including blood transfusions. Imaging studies are useful to find the location of the bleeding but some patients may need emergency surgery to stop the bleeding. The outcomes of patients with LGIB depends on the age of the patient, other comorbidity, hemodynamic stability and the need for emergent surgery.
