Chlorine gas can be used as a disinfecting agent at swimming pools, or it could form by mixing household agents. The combination of bleach (sodium hypochlorite) with acid produces chlorine gas, a heavy green-yellow gas with a strong odor. Chlorine gas has also been used as an industrial solvent and has other industrial uses such as the production of bulk materials, bleached paper products, plastics such as PVC, and solvents. Chlorine gas is also used to make dyes, textiles, paint, and even medications.

Chlorine gas is pressurized and cooled for easy storage in liquid form.  When released, the liquid form of chlorine quickly turns into yellow-green colored gas with an irritating odor. Since chlorine is heavier than air, it accumulates in low-lying areas.

Chlorine gas has been used as an agent of war as recently as 2007 in Iraq.
