The prognosis of DCO is generally excellent. In one radiology-based study, 93% of patients were successfully treated with conservative therapy.

No current identified studies specify a regimen or algorithm for treatment, but most include NSAIDs, post-activity icing, and activity modification.

Surgical interventions are effective, and with newer arthroscopic approaches, return to sports/activity is faster and more successful.
