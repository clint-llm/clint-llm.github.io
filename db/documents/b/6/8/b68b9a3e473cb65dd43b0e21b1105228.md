- Ask the patient to sit upright. Place your cerumenolytic of choice in the external auditory canal and leave it in the ear for fifteen to thirty minutes before initiating irrigation.

- Draw up the warm water into the syringe and attach the IV catheter to the end of the syringe. Place the IV catheter into the external ear canal, no further than the cartilage/bone junction. The cartilaginous portion usually makes up the lateral one-third of the external auditory canal.

- Hold the emesis or ear irrigation basin tightly to the skin below the ear, in an attempt to catch the water during irrigation. This will help keep the patient from getting wet.

- Direct the IV catheter superiorly and posteriorly in the ear canal so that the water will separate the cerumen from the tympanic membrane. Do not direct the water stream directly at the tympanic membrane, because this can cause perforation. Do not inject too rapidly as this may result in trauma, bleeding, and pain.

- Following irrigation, you can remove any loose pieces of wax with a cerumen scoop or alligator forceps, being careful not to damage the external auditory canal and the tympanic membrane.

- To dry the remaining moisture in the external auditory canal, apply several drops of isopropanol. This step is especially contraindicated if the tympanic membrane is ruptured.

**Following prolonged irrigation:**

- Topical steroid containing suspension drops, such as ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone drops, may be soothing to the external auditory canal. Some providers will prescribe these for a few days following the ear irrigation procedure.

- Many providers prescribe antibiotic drops (example: fluoroquinolones) to patients at high risk for severe infections, such as diabetic patients. These drops are usually prescribed for several days following the ear irrigation procedure to prevent the complication of otitis externa

If multiple attempts to remove impacted cerumen—including a combination of treatments—are ineffective, clinicians should refer the patient to an otolaryngologist.
