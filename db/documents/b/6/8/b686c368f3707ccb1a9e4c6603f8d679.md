Patients should be made aware of the potential risk factors for developing TVIE. When hospitalized, efforts should be made to educate these patients about the hazards of IV drug abuse. Furthermore, all available resources should be used to prevent these individuals from relapsing into IVDU again. These include information and access to local rehab centers, education, and pharmacologic options.
