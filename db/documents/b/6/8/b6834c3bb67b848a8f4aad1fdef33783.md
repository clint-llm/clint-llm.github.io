SFTPsÂ arise from mesenchymal cells in the pleura. They usually originate from the visceral pleura, with one-third originating from the parietal pleura. The mid to lower zones of the chest are the most common predilection sites. The tumor usually has well-defined borders and may be pedunculated. The tumor may grow several centimeters in diameter, and its physical presence can result in clinical symptoms. SFTPs may produce insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2), resulting in refractory hypoglycemia (Doege-potter syndrome).

Due to the rarity of solitary fibrous tumors of the pleura, it is difficult to delineate between benign and malignant forms of the tumor. Characteristics typically felt to favor a diagnosis of malignancy include the following: high Ki67 proliferation index, p53 positivity, paraneoplastic syndrome, tumor diameter greater than 10 cm, pleural effusion, calcifications, tumor necrosis, and cellular dysmorphisms.

Metastases are usually bloodborne, with common sites of metastases including the lungs, chest wall, and intrabdominal organs like the liver.
