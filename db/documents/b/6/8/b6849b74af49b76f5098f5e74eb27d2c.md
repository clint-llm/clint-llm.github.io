Lemierre syndrome originates as a complication of bacterial throat infections. The most commonly responsible bacteria are Fusobacterium necrophorum, an obligate anaerobic, gram-negative bacilli and Fusobacterium nucleatum. These bacteria can cause invasive disease secondary to multiple virulence factors including endotoxins and exotoxins. Other organisms such as Streptococcus species., Bacteroides species., Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and others have also been reported in other case studies.

F. necrophorum is part of the normal bacterial flora in the pharynx, gastrointestinal tract, and female genital tract. In addition to primary infection, it is postulated that other etiologies of oropharyngeal infections can lead to conditions that are conducive to fusobacterial growth. These can be viral infections e.g. acute Epstein Barr or bacterial infections e.g. streptococcal infection. Conditions conducive to anaerobic growth such as a peritonsillar abscess, allow growth and penetration of the surrounding tissues by F. necrophorum. Extension of the infection from the oropharynx into the lateral pharyngeal space results in the seeding of the internal jugular vein, septic thrombophlebitis, and subsequent access to the venous system resulting in septicemia and septic emboli.
