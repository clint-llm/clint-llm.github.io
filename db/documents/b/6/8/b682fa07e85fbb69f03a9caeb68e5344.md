Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis describes a chronic infective process of the biliary tree, presenting primarily with recurrent attacks of acute bacterial cholangitis. This is a disease traditionally prevalent in South East Asia; however, due in part to global population migration, it can also be seen in North America and Europe. Due to its significant clinical overlap with other, more common types of cholangitis, it must be considered as a differential diagnosis where relevant. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of recurrent pyogenic cholangitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiology of recurrent pyogenic cholangitis.
- Describe typical presentation of a patient with recurrent pyogenic cholangitis.
- Summarize management considerations for a patient with recurrent pyogenic cholangitis.
- Review common complications of recurrent pyogenic cholangitis.
