Although there have been many broadly inclusive mnemonic devices for high anion gap metabolic acidosis, the use of "GOLD MARK" has gained popularity for its focus on causes common to the 21st century.

- Glycols (ethylene glycol, propylene glycol)

- Oxoproline (pyroglutamic acid, the toxic metabolite of excessive acetaminophen or paracetamol)

- L-Lactate (standard lactic acid seen in lactic acidosis)

- D-Lactate (exogenous lactic acid produced by gut bacteria)

- Methanol (this is inclusive of alcohols in general)

- Aspirin (salicylic acid)

- Renal Failure (uremic acidosis)

- Ketones (diabetic, alcoholic and starvation ketosis)

Of note, metformin has been omitted from this list due to a lack of evidence for metformin-induced lactic acidosis. In fact, a Cochrane review found substantial evidence that metformin was not a cause of lactic acidosis. The same could not be said of the older biguanide, phenformin, which does increase the incidence of lactic acidosis by approximately tenfold.

Furthermore, the addition of massive rhabdomyolysis would be appropriate given the potentially large amounts of hydrogen ions released by muscle breakdown.
