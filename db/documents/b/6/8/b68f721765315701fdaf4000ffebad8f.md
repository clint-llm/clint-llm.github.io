In prenatal development, neural ectoderm forms the optic vesicle, which later forms the optic cup. The anterior rim of the optic cup forms the ciliary body epithelium, which secretes aqueous humor. The drainage of aqueous humor is a poorly understood mechanism; the structures currently implicated in this process include the trabecular meshwork, Schlemm’s canal, and the ciliary muscle. These three structures derive from the periocular mesenchyme, a subpopulation of the cranial neural crest.
