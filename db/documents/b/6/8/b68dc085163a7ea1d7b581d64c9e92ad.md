Toxicity associated with antihistamine use is due to overdose following oral ingestion, either unintentional or intentional suicide attempt—most commonly in young and elderly populations. Toxicity from intravenous, intramuscular, or topical routes of administration rarely occurs in the household setting. Toxicity presents as antimuscarinic and hallucinogenic effects. The mnemonic 'dry as a bone, hot as a hare, red as a beet, blind as a bat, full as a flask, and mad as a hatter' has been used to remember the presentation of acute anticholinergic toxicity. This mnemonic represents the findings of anhidrosis, hyperthermia, reddening of the skin, mydriasis, hallucinations, urinary retention, and delirium, respectively.

Major complications of doxylamine toxicity include arrhythmias, respiratory failure, seizures, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, and coma. If the patient experiences toxicity, the healthcare team should continually monitor cardiac activity, and IV access is necessary. Patients who only recently ingested the toxic dose can receive activated charcoal.
