Close liaison between emergency medicine doctors, orthopedic teams, radiology, and physiotherapy is vital to managing patellar dislocations safely. This is especially true in the early stages when additional CT/MRI scans may be required to rule out more serious injuries. Once the patient is on the non-operative management path, physiotherapists are crucial in ensuring patients strengthen muscles correctly as this may be all that is needed to manage an acute dislocation. Working within an interprofessional team will enhance patient care and outcomes.
