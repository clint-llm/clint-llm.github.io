Toxoplasmosis is caused by the obligatory intracellular protozoan parasite T. gondii. Human infection is either by ingestion of oocysts shed in the feces of cats or by consumption of tissue cysts present in raw or undercooked meatT. gondii forms a parasitophorous vacuole that sequesters the parasite from phagolysosomes and the host immune responseT. gondii have been identified with strain I the most virulent and strains II and III less virulent
