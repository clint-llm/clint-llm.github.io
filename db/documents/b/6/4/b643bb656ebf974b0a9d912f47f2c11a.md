Renal extracorporeal lithotripsy is a procedure that utilizes shockwaves to fragment kidney stones that can then pass through the urinary tract and be removed. It is the only outpatient procedure for the treatment of nephrolithiasis that is truly non-invasive. This activity outlines extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating patients who undergo this procedure.
