**Investigations**

The physical examination may be initially limited by severe pain and gross swelling of facial structures. Non-contrast, fine-cut computed tomography (CT) scanning of the head provides definitive details of soft tissue and bony injuries. Using both 3-dimensional and 2-dimensional images in coronal and axial views facilitates the diagnosis and staging of NOE complex fractures and assists the operating team in planning reduction and fixation.

**Classification**

The Markowitz and Manson system is the most widely used classification system for NOE fractures and is based on the integrity of the MCT because its status determines the complexity of the reconstruction required.

- Type 1: The MCT is attached to a large bone fragment.

- Type 2: The MCT is attached to a comminuted bone fragment.

- Type 3: The MCT is avulsed from the bone.
