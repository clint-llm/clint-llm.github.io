Most morbidity and mortality in hospitals across the US relate to errors in communication.

Often parents arrive with the babies and may have specific questions. Before transport back to the NICU, there should be communication, including information on extubation plans (or ventilator needs), blood loss, endotracheal tube, and vent settings, fluids are given, intravenous access, and meds administered (in particular, paralytics, reversal, antibiotics, and opioids). A structured handoff on arrival in the NICU is also required.

Across the US, interprofessional teams take care of neonatal patients every day. Pediatric anesthesiologists can work cases by themselves or work in an anesthesia care team model, overseeing nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants, pediatric anesthesia fellow physicians, or anesthesia resident physicians. All these various disciplines (physicians, specialists, nursing, pharmacy, therapists) need to communicate and function as an interprofessional team to obtain the best outcomes in care. [Level 5]

Taking care of neonates in the operating room can be both challenging and very rewarding. Knowing how a neonate is physiologically and anatomically different from other patients is essential to providing proper care while under anesthesia.
