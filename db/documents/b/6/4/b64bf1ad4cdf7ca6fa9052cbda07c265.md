**Other Issues**

**Conflict**

Conflict is a natural and expected aspect of group therapy sessions. Many conflicts may not be obvious to the group members, and it is the responsibility of the provider to bring these covert conflicts to the members’ attention. The provider is not required to solve the conflict; however, he or she must make an informed decision on how to deal with the conflict based on the interest of the group. It may be worthwhile to address the conflict, as there is an opportunity for the group to learn.

Members’ responses to conflict can be complex and unpredictable. When conflict arises, providers should use the last five to ten minutes of the session to speak with patients individually and allow them to voice their concerns.

**Patients Who Ramble**

Occasionally, a patient may continue to talk for an unnecessary length of time. It is essential to address this patient and see what he or she hopes to gain when doing so. If the patient is unsure as to why they are dominating the conversation, the provider should use this opportunity to teach the patient how to express his or her thoughts and feelings better.

**Lack of Engagement**

It is the provider’s responsibility to ensure members are alert and attentive during group sessions. When members seem disengaged, the provider should interject and see why members are losing interest. The inclusion of interactive activities can help members to be more engaged in the group discussion.

**Patients’ Limits**

Providers are encouraged to push their patients to engage with the sessions; however, it is crucial to be aware of a patient’s individual limits. If the provider’s initial request for the patient to continue engaging meets with resistance, then the provider should respect this wish. Providers should remain patient, understanding, and empathetic with their patients and continually encourage without forcing patients to act against their will.
