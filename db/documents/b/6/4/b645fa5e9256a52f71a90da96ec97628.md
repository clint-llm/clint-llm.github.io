Oxytocin is primarily used by the obstetrician and labor and delivery nurses. Its use and monitoring require the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team that includes clinicians, specialists, obstetric nurses, and pharmacists. Clinicians who do prescribe this hormone should be familiar with its side effects. An inappropriate dosage of oxytocin can lead to dangerous tachycardia, arrhythmias, and myocardial ischemia. High dosages of oxytocin can cause uterine rupture, hypertonicity, and spasms. When oxytocin is given to women in the first or second stages of labor or to women to cause induction of labor, uterine rupture, maternal subarachnoid hemorrhages, maternal death, and even fetal death can result. If oxytocin is given in dosages too large or even slowly during 24 hours, the medication can exhibit an antidiuretic effect resulting in extreme water intoxication. This excessive dosing can result in coma, seizures, and even death in the mother.; hence, the pharmacist needs to check the dosage ordered carefully. Note that patients who receive fluids orally are at higher risk for water intoxication and antidiuretic effects when given exogenous oxytocin. When used at therapeutic doses, the drug is safe and effective.
