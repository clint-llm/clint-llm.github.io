Management of hyperbilirubinemia requires a multidisciplinary approach. Following specialties are needed for a better outcome:

- Gastroenterology

- Hepatology

- Hepatobiliary surgery

- Liver transplant

- Nutrition specialists

- Social services

Referrals are indicated in cases of unexplained and persistent elevation of bilirubin alone or combination with AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase; typically, total bilirubin greater than 3 mg/dL, aminotransferases two times and alkaline phosphatase 1.5 times the upper limit of normal are considered significant. Additionally, if multiple etiologies are suspected, specialist referral is advantageous.
