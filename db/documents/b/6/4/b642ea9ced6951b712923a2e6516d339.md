Typically includes:

- Laboratory testing such as CBC. Elevated WBC is typically found, but CBC is normal in approximately one-third of patients with appendicitis.

- Typically a CT abdomen and pelvis is done while the patient is in the emergency room setting, but ultrasound and MRI are also used, particularly in pregnant women, and ultrasound is sometimes used in children to reduce radiation.

- Appendicitis is often a clinical diagnosis by the provider based on a thorough history and physical exam.
