The clinical significance of wound debridement and ulcers with necrotic tissue, regardless of the infection status, cannot be overstated and should not be underestimated. Debridement for most wounds is considered a standard in wound management. It provides the benefits of removal of necrotic tissue and bacteria and senescent cells, as well as the stimulating activity of growth factors. Sharp surgical debridement has been shown to reset the proper timing of the phases of wound re-epithelializationÂ by providing the initial trauma seen in the hemostasis phase of wound healing. Angiogenesis has also been shown to be stimulated by sharp surgical debridement.

Of course, not all forms of debridement will have the same impact on the wound or the ulcer as the mode of action differs; however, either sharp surgical debridement or nonsurgical debridement is fundamental to wound re-epithelialization.

A critical concept of debridement is the dry eschar, such as in unstageable pressure ulcers with no overt signs of infection, where debridement is not always indicated because the dry eschar will act as a biological covering.

The mode of debridement should be tailored to the particular wound presentation, considering factors such as comorbidities, other lower-risk options, and the patient's comfort and desires.
