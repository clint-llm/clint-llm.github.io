The rate of progression of the disease may be predicted based on the following:

- Males who have postural instability of difficulty with gait.

- Patients with older age at onset, dementia, and failure to respond to traditional dopaminergic medications tend to have early admission to nursing homes and diminished survival.

- Individuals with just tremors at the initial presentation tend to have a protracted benign course.

- Individuals diagnosed with the disease at older age combined with hypokinesia/rigidity tend to have a much more rapid progression of the disease.

The disorder leads to disability of most patients within ten years. The mortality rates of patients with PD is three times the normal population. While treatment can improve symptoms, the quality of life is often poor.
