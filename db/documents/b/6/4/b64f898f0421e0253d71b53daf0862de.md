The superior colliculus receives its blood supply from both the collicular artery and the posteromedial choroidal artery. These are both proximal branches from the posterior cerebral artery. It is noteworthy that the superior cerebellar artery, which branches from the basilar artery, is sometimes attributed to supply the superior colliculus. Lymphatics of the brain were recently discovered, with one study detecting the presence of brain lymphatic endothelial cells over the optic tectum of zebrafish, which selectively uptake specific macromolecules.
