Because PPA may have an early onset (nvfPPA variant), with a progressive clinical course, patients and families risk developing depression symptoms. Patients with PPA are aware of their deficits, which can further frustrate their psyches. Psychological evaluation, education, and support conferences are often helpful for patients and family members to set expectations, develop coping mechanisms, and provide emotional support. With no cure available, patients may depend on social support for assistance with daily living activities.
