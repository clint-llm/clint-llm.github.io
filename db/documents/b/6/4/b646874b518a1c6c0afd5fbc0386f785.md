Hepatorenal syndrome has two types and is a diagnosis of exclusion. Type 1 is characterized by rapid and progressive decline in renal function defined by doubling of the serum creatinine to at least greater than 2.5 or a decrease in the creatinine clearance by half or more over a two week period. This is usually associated with a urine output of less than 500mL/day, a normal urine sediment and a low urinary sodium excretion. Type 2 typically involves less severe kidney injury, and patients ordinarily present with diuretic-resistant ascites. Other apparent causes of acute kidney injury need to be excluded, including pre-renal, nephrotoxic drugs, obstructive nephropathy, and renal parenchymal disease.
