Before starting this procedure in a hospital, it is mandatory to have a chemotherapy approval infrastructure equipped with a surgical infrastructure linked to the medical-surgical resuscitation unit for patient monitoring.

HIPEC can be performed on the open and closed abdomen. In both perfusion models, the abdominal cavity is continuously perfused with cytostatic solution heated to 41 to 43 degrees C through a drainage system consisting of inlet and outlet catheters.

This procedure, therefore, requires the following equipment:

- A heat exchanger connected to a thermostat to maintain a stable temperature at 42 degrees in the extracorporeal circulation

- Outflow and inflow catheter to ensure the infusion and absorption of the cytotoxic drug in the abdominal cavity

- Temperature probes which measure the temperature in the circuit and the peritoneum

- Roller pump to maintain the extracorporeal circulation of the cytotoxic drug

- The reservoir of the cytotoxic agent

- A computer system that controls the heat exchanger and the drainage pumps according to the thermal probes

- A timer that measures the infusion time

- Cytotoxic drugs used for intra-abdominal chemotherapy are mitomycin C, Platine, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and irinotecan.

- The chemotherapeutic agent is applied with a carrier solution (mainly 0.9% NaCl or 5% glucose). The volume of the carrier solution is calculated based on the body surface area. Usually, infusion volumes between 1.5 and 2 liters/ m^2 of body surface areas are used.
