Pantoprazole isÂ often prescribed by the primary care provider (including mid-level practitioners), internist, and gastroenterologist. While the drug is effective for peptic ulcer disease, there have been many reports regarding overdose. The pharmacist should also perform a complete medication reconciliation when starting pantoprazole. Healthcare workers should avoid writing prescriptions for many months and educate patients on drug safety, including storing the medication in a locked cabinet away from the reach of children.

All members of the interprofessional healthcare team need to work collaboratively when patients are taking pantoprazole. This includes open information sharing and coordinating therapeutic interventions, so the patient receives optimal care with the fewest possible adverse events. [Level 5]
