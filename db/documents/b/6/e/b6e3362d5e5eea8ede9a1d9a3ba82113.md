Nonoperative management of nondisplaced talar head fractures and appropriate surgical management of displaced talar head fractures correlate with excellent outcomes. The relatively good prognosis of the talar head as compared to the neck and body is at least partially attributable to its good vascular supply. Regarding talar neck fractures, there is a strong positive correlation between the modified Hawkins-Canale fracture type and the risk of avascular necrosis.
