Current research suggests prophylactic NIPPV may mitigate lung injury before clinical signs of pulmonary toxicity and may reduce mortality based on animal studies.

Other anti-inflammatory medical therapies showing theoretical promise include nitrous oxide (NO) inhibitors, melatonin, and angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) inhibitors. Antioxidative strategies are also being investigated. Nebulized N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is being investigated for its potential as a glutathione (GSH) regenerator. However, studies are conflicting, and further research is needed to elucidate the proper timing of therapy. One study suggests pulmonary edema may render nebulized NAC inaccessible.

Intravenous NAC appears to improve systemic oxygenation; however, it does not prevent progression to respiratory failure. Ibuprofen (IBU) is readily available and has shown positive outcomes when administered pre- and post-exposure, but the utility of pre-exposure use is not practical as most phosgene exposures are not anticipated. Supportive measures such as lung protective ventilation characterized by low tidal volume, high positive end-expiratory pressure, and high FiO2 are recommended for phosgene ALI.
