Effective aerobic exercise has been shown to elicit adaptations at both the molecular and macroscopic levels. These adaptations profoundly impact the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems (the two most affected organ systems), enabling more efficient oxygen delivery, endurance capacity, and improved performance. When implemented consistently for prolonged periods of time, aerobic exercise may lead to chronic adaptations with beneficial clinical outcomes.

This review will define an acute adaptation as any change that occurs within 30 days, or 1 month, following at least one episode of aerobic exercise. A chronic adaptation will be defined as any change occurring after 30 days of onset of regular training. Using these definitions, we will examine the cardiovascular system and musculoskeletal system changes and the relevant clinical changes that occur within these domains.
