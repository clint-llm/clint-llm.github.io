HIPEC is an intraperitoneal chemotherapy technique that should only be performed by qualified physicians who have received sufficient training in surgical oncology. Nursing staff in the operating room must be qualified, trained in medical oncology, and manage the extracorporeal circulation of cytotoxic drugs during this procedure to perform the procedure safely.

Hospital pharmacists must prepare cytotoxic drugs at the pharmacy in a specific room under constant laminar flow to strictly reduce any bacterial contamination of the preparation.
