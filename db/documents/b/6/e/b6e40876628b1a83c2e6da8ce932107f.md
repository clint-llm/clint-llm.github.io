**Common causes of thrombocytopenia**

- Primary immune thrombocytopenia (primary ITP). An autoimmune condition where antibodies are produced against platelets resulting in platelet destruction.

- Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia:

- 
              
- Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) - in this condition, anti-platelet antibodies activate platelets resulting in thrombosis (both arterial and venous)
              
              
- Quinine
              
              
- Sulfonamides, ampicillin, vancomycin, piperacillin
              
              
- Acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen
              
              
- Cimetidine
              
              
- Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors
              
              
- Other over the counter remedies, supplements, foods like African bean, sesame seeds, walnuts) and beverages (herbal teas and cranberry juice)

- Drug-induced non-immune thrombocytopenia. Drugs like valproic acid, daptomycin, linezolid cause thrombocytopenia by dose-dependent suppression of platelet production.

- Infections:

- 
              
- Viral: HIV, hepatitis C, Ebstein-Barr virus, parvovirus, mumps, varicella, rubella, Zika viral infections can cause thrombocytopenia.
              
              
- Sepsis causes bone marrow suppression.
              
              
- Helicobacter pylori
              
              
- Leptospirosis, brucellosis, anaplasmosis, and other tick-borne infections are associated with thrombocytopenia.
              
              
- Malaria, babesiosis intracellular parasite infections are associated with thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia

- Hypersplenism due to chronic liver disease

- Chronic alcohol abuse

- Nutrient deficiencies (folate, vitamin B12, copper)

- Autoimmune disorders like systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis associated with secondary ITP

- Pregnancy. Mild thrombocytopenia presents in gestational thrombocytopenia; moderate-severe thrombocytopenia can occur in preeclampsia and HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count) syndrome

**Other causes**

- Myelodysplasia

- Malignancy: cancer with chronic DIC, cancer with marrow suppression (leukemia, lymphoma, solid tumors)

- Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)

- Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)

- 
              
- Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a condition manifested by fever, renal failure, thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with or without neurologic manifestations
              
              
- A hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) caused by Shiga toxin-producing organism (E. coli and Shigella), seen in children.
              
              
- Drug-induced TMA: quinine, specific chemotherapy agents
              
              
- Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome

- Aplastic anemia

- Inherited thrombocytopenia. Often seen in children, rare in adults

- Von Willebrand disease type 2
- Alport syndrome
- Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome
- Fanconi syndrome.
- Thrombocytopenia-absent radius syndrome
- Bernardâ€“Soulier syndrome
- May-Hegglin anomaly
