Any patient presenting to the outpatient department with pain, photophobia, redness, and early morning blurred vision after cataract surgery should be examined carefully by an ophthalmologist to rule out pseudophakic bullous keratopathy. This patient must be referred to a cornea and ocular surface expert for a higher opinion. The cornea specialist is an expert in picking up shallow Descemet membrane detachment (DMD) that may lead to corneal decompensation in the future. They are highly skilled in deciding whether the patient needs DM to reposition with an air bubble or whether the patient needs corneal transplantation in the form of PKP or DSEK.
