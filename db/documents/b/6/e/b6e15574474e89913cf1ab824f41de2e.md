Based on the radiographic findings, the differential diagnoses include:

- Lytic metastatic lesion (particularly a vascular metastasis from thyroid or renal cell carcinoma)

- Primary bone tumor

- Brown tumor of hyperparathyroidism

- Non-ossifying fibroma

- Aneurysmal bone cyst

- Fibrous metaphyseal defects

- Osteoblastoma

- Chondroblastoma

- Malignant fibrous histiocytoma

- Telangiectatic osteosarcoma.

As noted earlier, mutations within the H3F3A gene can distinguish GCT from other entities, as they are identified in up to 96% of cases.
