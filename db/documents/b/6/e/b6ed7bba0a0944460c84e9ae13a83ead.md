Certain receptors recognize specific sequences in newly-produced proteins to bring the proteins to the necessary area. After the protein has been delivered, the receptors will be recycled for further use. Proteins made in the RER are sent to the Golgi through gaps in the RER membrane known as endoplasmic reticulum exit sites (ERES). After quality control at Golgi, misfolded proteins are sent back to the RER to go through a degradation pathway ending at the 26S proteasome. The adequately configured cargo is encircled at the ERES by COPII-coated vesicles.****The Sec16 gene maintains the ERES and the COPII vesicular transport. These vesicles are then taken to the RER-Golgi-intermediate compartment (ERGIC) to begin protein targeting.

The Golgi apparatus is a transit for approximately one-third of newly-formed proteins before reaching their final destination.cis (the side facing the RER), medial, and trans (the side facing the plasma membrane and opposite the cis side) compartments. The cis cisternae mature into the trans cisternae. The trans cisterna is continuous with the trans-Golgi network (TGN).

Described as a separate organelle, the TGN is responsible for routing proteins to their appropriate destinations.****Also known as the trans-Golgi reticulum, the TGN contains enzymes and compounds such as sialyltransferases, P-galactosyltransferase, and sialylated glycoconjugates.

Proteins enter the cis-Golgi, pass sequentially through all the cisternae, and leave through the TGN, which is the organelle's sorting component.****The TGN sends proteins to the plasma membrane, endosomes, or lysosomes. Pakdel and Blume concluded that sorting at the TGN occurs through a CaATPase SPCA1 channel which brings calcium into the lumen to be recognized by Cab45, a calcium-binding protein. Upon calcium binding, oligomerization and binding to specific proteins occur, differentiating cargo that remains in the Golgi from cargo that goes to other cellular locations.trans end of the Golgi carry the proteins to the endosomal system, which eventually end up in lysosomes.

Endosomes sequentially mature into lysosomes by first becoming early endosomes (sorting endosomes) and then late endosomes. The late endosomes become lysosomes by fusing with existing lysosomes.

Cargo delivery to the plasma membrane is dependent on GTP requiring ARF (ADP-ribosylation factor), GTPases (guanine triphosphatases), or Rab (Ras-associated binding) GTPases. The activity of either microtubules or actin directs the vesicles to the plasma membrane. Kinesins play a role in this route. The vesicles and granules fuse with the plasma membrane via the octameric exocyst complex composed of Sec3, Sec5, Sec6, Sec8, Sec10, Sec15, Exo70, and Exo84.****
