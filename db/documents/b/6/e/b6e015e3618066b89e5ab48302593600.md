There are no absolute contraindications to TT placement. In patients with chronic OME or RAOM not meeting indications as above, watchful waiting or treatment with antibiotics as medically indicated should be performed. Placement of TT outside of the above indications may be performed based on the surgeonâ€™s judgment and after a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits with the parent or patient. Several anatomic variations can be considered relative contraindications to TT placement; these include dehiscence of the facial nerve within the middle ear space, as well as dehiscence or aberrant course of the internal carotid artery within the middle ear cleft.
