An acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction occurs due to occlusion of one or more coronary arteries, causing transmural myocardial ischemia which in turn results in myocardial injury or necrosis. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of patients with with ST-elevation myocardial infarctions and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with a suspected myocardial infarction.
- Describe EKG findings in a patient with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction.
- List the treatment and management options available for an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction. 
- Employ interprofessional team strategies to improve outcomes for patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarctions.
