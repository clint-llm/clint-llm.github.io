Currently, due to the diverse and vast amount of pseudogenes sharing similar coding sequences to their functional gene counterparts, there is no standard method for identifying them without identifying the entire genome. However, many independent groups are currently working to resolve this dilemma and create a standardized and efficient means of pseudogene identification.

Not many full genome sequencing projects have counted the number of pseudogenes present. One study of human chromosomes 21 and 22 revealed 393 pseudogenes amongst these two chromosomes alone. The study further extrapolated the data and estimated a total of 20000 pseudogenes within the human genome. Other studies estimate as many as 23000 to 33000 pseudogenes.  All studies have estimated that pseudogenes represent up to one-third of the human genome.

The term "nonfunctional pseudogenes" is also a concern when defining the relationship between pseudogenes and their parental copies. One study found that nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in the snail family, Lymnaea
stagnalis, and its pseudogene have an inhibitory relationship with each other. The NOS pseudogene transcript was revealed to act as an antisense RNA through hybridization and decrease the expression of the functional mRNA. However, the NOS pseudogene itself has numerous defects and is unable to code for an actual protein like its functional copy.
