In an asymptomatic, gravid female, third-trimester ultrasound is indicated for the evaluation and determination of:

- Fetal anatomy

- Fetal anomalies

- Gestational age

- Fetal growth

- Fetal presentation

- Suspected multiple gestations

- Placental location

- Cervical insufficiency

Third-trimester ultrasound examination on the symptomatic pregnant patient has multiple indications, including, but not limited to, the following conditions:

- The discrepancy between the uterine size and calculated gestational date

- Pelvic mass

- Ectopic pregnancy

- Fetal death

- Fetal anomaly

- Vaginal bleeding

- Abdominal or pelvic pain

- Hydatidiform mole

- Uterine abnormalities

- Fetal abnormalities

- Amniotic fluid abnormalities

- Placental abruption

- Premature rupture of membranes

- Premature labor

- Placenta previa

Additionally, other applications of ultrasonography include acting as an adjunct to procedures, e.g., amniocentesis, cervical cerclage placement, external cephalic version.

A particular patient population that is especially benefited from using ultrasound in the third trimester is the late presenter without prior prenatal care. Unfortunately, these patients are prone to all aforementioned disorders, and an ultrasonographic evaluation is of paramount importance to avoid, or at least plan for, significant morbidity and mortality causes.

A more detailed and specialized examination of fetal anatomy and characteristics of the placenta may be required under certain clinical circumstances.
