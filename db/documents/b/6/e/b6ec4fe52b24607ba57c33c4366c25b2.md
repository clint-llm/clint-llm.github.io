# Continuing Education Activity

America is becoming increasingly diverse. Discrimination against minority groups persists and contributes to negative disparate outcomes for patients and healthcare professionals. Healthcare professionals have a responsibility to address inequity in the medical system. This activity defines the terms "diversity" and "discrimination" and highlights the interprofessional team's role in improving care for patients from diverse backgrounds.

**Objectives:**
- Define the terms "diversity" and "discrimination" and discuss their implications in healthcare.
- Explain the different levels on which bias and discrimination occur.
- Summarize relationships between bias and negative patient outcomes.
- Outline actions that healthcare systems can take to increase diversity and reduce disparities.

# Introduction

Diversity is broadly defined as the inclusion of varied attributes or characteristics.  In the medical community, diversity often refers to the inclusion of healthcare professionals, trainees, educators, researchers, and patients of varied race, ethnicity, gender, disability, social class, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, gender identity, primary spoken language, and geographic region.

Discrimination in the healthcare setting can be defined as negative actions or lack of consideration given to an individual or group that occurs because of a preconceived and unjustified opinion. It is worth noting that individuals do not need to be members of an unfairly treated group to experience discrimination against that group. Discrimination can occur based upon perceived membership.  Furthermore, harm does not need to occur for discrimination to exist. A group may be discriminated against if they receive something of less value than another group solely because of their race, ethnicity, gender, disability, social class, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, gender identity, primary spoken language, or location of residence.

While people can be discriminated against for various reasons, this article focuses mainly on gender, ethnicity, and race-based discrimination in the healthcare setting, not because these are the most important, but because these areas are best represented in the literature. We hope that the next version of this article will include more information on discrimination involving other underrepresented and marginalized groups.

# Issues of Concern

The two main types of discriminatory acts or comments are macroaggressions and microaggressions. Macroaggressions are more overt and radical forms of racism rooted in a society or within a system. Examples of macroaggressions are the forced relocation of Japanese-Americans into internment camps during World War II, laws preventing equal suffrage rights for women, and the Tuskegee study in which Black men were intentionally misled and denied standard of care treatment for syphilis.

Laws such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act prohibiting unequal treatment based on race, sex, and disability have decreased overt racism in the healthcare setting. In areas where overt racism has declined, awareness of microaggressions has increased. Microaggression can be defined as short, everyday insults or snubs that can be barely perceptible or difficult to define but convey a negative message to a person because of their affiliation with a marginalized group.

Despite the insidious nature of microaggressions, they have clearly perceptible negative impacts upon the oppressed's quality of life.

The killing of George Floyd in conjunction with the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 in communities of color has elevated the national consciousness regarding diversity and discrimination. Americans are becoming more aware that structural racism is causing healthcare disparities.

**An Increasingly Multicultural Society Requires a More Diverse Workforce**

As our country's racial and ethnic diversity continues to increase, there is a greater need to diversify our healthcare workforce. Unfortunately, the physician workforce's diversification is occurring at a slower rate than that of the general population.

**The Progression from Individual Racism to Structural Racism**

Racism is a social construct that emphasizes phenotype. According to the National Museum of African American History & Culture, there is individual racism, interpersonal racism, institutional racism, and structural racism. Individual racism is most directly related to the biases which we hold, and interpersonal racism is an expression of these biases between individuals. Institutional racism is reflected in the policies and procedures of an organization. Structural racism is the cumulative effect of these forces across systems and between institutions or organizations. The promotion of health equity and a decrease in health disparities requires addressing individual and interpersonal racism and dismantling institutional and structural racism.

**Bias, Stereotype Threat and Negative Outcomes**

There is increasing awareness in the United States that implicit bias leads to poorer healthcare outcomes for patients of color.

# Clinical Significance

Individual racism is a personal belief in the superiority of one’s race over another. It may result in discriminatory behavior, which is a reflection of both implicit and explicit bias. Historically, racist beliefs regarding biological differences between Blacks and Whites were used to justify slavery and medical experimentation on men and women of color. Unfortunately, the legacy of this false belief in fundamental and innate biological differences between Blacks and Whites is still present in medical practice, leading to health disparities such as the undertreatment of pain in Black patients. A research study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America demonstrates the connection between false beliefs about biological differences between Blacks and Whites and racial bias in pain assessment and treatment recommendations.

Structural racism is rooted in societal, historical, and cultural norms that support racial group inequality.  As an institution, medicine has adopted and implemented practices and policies that promote structural racism. Race-adjusted algorithms are based on the historic racist belief that Blacks are physiologically different.  For instance, “race corrected” estimated glomerular filtration rate measurements are based on the unscientifically supported belief that Blacks are more muscular and have higher creatinine levels. Consequently, this may result in a higher reported estimated glomerular filtration rate, which is interpreted as the better renal function for anyone identified as Black.

At a systems level, the failure to identify the health implications of racism and access to care may result in developing a structurally racist system that promotes health disparities. For example, an algorithmic bias was identified in a medical artificial intelligence program that took into account past healthcare costs when predicting clinical risk.

# Other Issues

**Diversity Education**

This section is intended primarily for health professions educators.  However, all HCPs can use it for peer and self-education.

**Diversity Education Preface**

The Liaison Committee on Medical Education and the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation require medical schools to promote diversity and prohibit discrimination.

However, researchers have yet to confirm whether such actions affect health outcomes. A search in PubMed for studies of health professions diversity education did not yield studies large enough to have generalizable results about the effectiveness of one educational strategy over another on health outcomes.   An intermediate step before modifying healthcare outcomes is raising HCP’s awareness of bias to modify their perceptions and behaviors; research in this area is abundant and is described below.

Valuing cultures other than one’s own involves a willingness to learn and self-reflect in an ongoing manner.  For this reason, when discussing the ability of diversity education to change persons’ perceptions and behaviors, the terms “cultural humility,” “cultural awareness,” and “cultural sensitivity” are more appropriate than “cultural competency,” as “competency” implies having attained a finite body of knowledge.

**Diversity Education Technique**

Culturally sensitive diversity education emphasizes that HCPs should consider patients in their unique individual contexts and remember that a situation may be experienced differently by different patients.  “It is (an individual’s) health views, needs, and experiences that matter when making an informed decision, not a patient's ethnicity, race, or social status.”

Recent review articles contain general guidance and practical examples for educators:

- In 2007, Smith et al. developed recommendations for curricula on health disparities and suggested that the broad goal of such curricula should be to eliminate health disparities.

- In 2016, Dogra et al. published a curriculum guide and reviewed examples of diversity education. They recommended integrating diversity education throughout the curriculum and highlighted the importance of self-reflection in learning and teaching diversity-related concepts.

- In 2020, Brottman et al. reviewed models of diversity education for trainees and/or practitioners in medicine, nursing, pharmacy, dentistry, physical and occupational therapy, public health, audiology, and social work. The interventions studied ranged from 20 minutes to hundreds of hours and included immersion experiences, simulation, discussion, lecture, reflection, educational technology, case-based learning, essays, presentations, readings, and videos.  This extensive review determined insufficient evidence to recommend any particular format as a best practice for diversity education.

Despite the lack of large-scale evidence for best practices, many smaller studies focused on particular target populations or particular interventions.  There is some evidence for gains in learners’ knowledge, skills, and attitudes with multimodal, active learning formats, for example, a combination of faculty role modeling, interprofessional rounds, and Objective Structured Clinical Examinations.

When diversity education is integrated longitudinally throughout a curriculum, appointing someone to oversee all curricular modules can maximize cohesion and minimize redundancy.

Diversity education is a unique curricular topic. All healthcare team members (e.g., nurse, physician, pharmacist, social worker) at all expertise levels (from trainee to experienced practitioner) require the same skill set.  This may lend itself well to its use in interprofessional settings in which learners of different disciplines learn with and/or from each other.

**Diversity Education Pitfalls**

HCPs have made many false assumptions about the relationship between cultural variables and medical outcomes, unnecessarily reinforcing negative stereotypes.  Teaching “typical” characteristics of minority groups frequently promote stigmatization without promoting healthcare outcome improvements.  This approach makes culture a “proxy” that prevents HCPs “from noting the person behind the patient.”

Faculty preparation is essential for diversity education; well-intentioned but unprepared educators can inadvertently promote students' and patients' stereotyping.

Finally, educators should realize that they are continually teaching a curriculum, either implicitly or explicitly.   Whereas the “planned curriculum” describes what educators perceive, the “experienced curriculum” describes what students perceive.

**Diversity Education Summary**

Diversity education is not a time-bound goal; it is an ongoing journey. It should provide learners with “the opportunity to become actively engaged in fostering a level of critical awareness of the health care provider's position of power and privilege in society.”

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

The fact that this article's title is Diversity and Discrimination suggests there is a link between these two.  It is hypothesized that an inverse relationship exists between discrimination and diversity.  It has been a prevailing thought within the medical community that discrimination would decrease and equity would increase if the percentage of underrepresented minorities reached a critical mass. Evidence suggests that although diversity is a goal unto itself, diversity alone does not create equity.  More than half the pediatricians and gynecologists in the United States are now female, yet department leaders remain predominantly male.

These results are similarly found in the nursing profession. The male advantage in nursing has been described as a “glass escalator,” in which men are put on a fast track and almost pushed to achieve positions that include greater responsibility, higher salary, and more organizational benefits.

While an increase in diversity may not eliminate all problems related to healthcare disparities and discrimination, we strongly encourage healthcare systems to take steps to promote diversity amongst providers.  A larger talent pool that includes providers with heterogeneous customs, experiences, and problem-solving tactics, can create more innovative approaches to systems-based problems.

Numerous studies have shown that increased provider diversity is associated with improved healthcare quality. Concordant care, defined as a patient and provider sharing a common attribute such as race, ethnicity, or gender, has been associated with improved quality of care.

Poor access to quality care continues to impact minority and low-income individuals in the United States disproportionately.  Recruitment and retention of providers who are underrepresented in medicine is one potential solution.  Underrepresented minority physicians are more likely to serve in areas with a physician-shortage and serve underserved groups, including minorities, low-income individuals, and the uninsured.

We urge healthcare groups and systems to consider the following actions to improve the recruitment and retention of employees from underrepresented groups:

- Eliminate financial barriers to higher education for socioeconomically disadvantaged groups via the development of scholarships, grants, and tuition assistance.

- Create mentorship and pipeline programs to increase the number of underrepresented minorities in healthcare careers. When possible, these mentorship pairings should be race and gender concordant.

- Offer opportunities for coaching and leadership training for HCPs from underrepresented groups.

- Use transparent processes to select committee members and leaders with diverse backgrounds and viewpoints.

- Provide pay transparency and freely accessible objective steps for promotion and salary increase.

We urge healthcare groups and systems to consider the following actions to quell discrimination and accelerate the remedy of healthcare disparities:

- Acknowledge that past discrimination and current implicit biases lead to inequities related to race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and disability that still exist in the healthcare setting. Denying that discrimination and bias exist limits progress.

- Educate HCPs on the impact of health disparities and structural racism on patient outcomes. Equip healthcare trainees and practitioners with tools and resources to confront macroaggressions and microaggressions.

- Create a zero-tolerance policy for harassment and discrimination that includes a safe reporting mechanism for both the victim and the reporter.

- Increase support for healthcare disparities research.
