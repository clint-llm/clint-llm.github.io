- Terminal myelocystocele: A rare skin-covered lesion defined as one of the types of neural tube defects. It is caused by a dilation of the central spinal canal at the caudal end of the vertebra.

- Sacrococcygeal teratoma: A germ cell tumor mostly derived from multipotent stem cells of the primitive streak and usually grows at the base of the coccygeal bone.

- Caudal neural tube defect: It encompasses other forms of spina bifida such as meningocele and myelocele.

- Tail remnants: Benign fibrofatty lesions that usually occur at the perianal area and do not adhere to the coccygeal bone.

- Rhabdomyosarcoma: One of the malignant soft tissue tumors derived from the primitive muscle cells.

- Curarinos syndrome: Characterized by a triad of anorectal malformation, presacral mass, and sacral bone defect and usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.

- Neuroenteric cyst: One of the rare duplicated congenital lesions derived from the endoderm during embryonic development when there is an impaired remodeling of the neurenteric canal.

- Caudal regression syndrome including sacral agenesis or hypoplasia: occurs when there is an incomplete development of the coccygeal bone during embryogenesis.
