Ocular injuries are a major cause of blindness.

They can lodge in any part of the eye, either in the anterior or posterior segment. Since they are sharp and are generated at high speed, they mostly get lodged in the posterior segment. According to a study, about 2/3rd of IOFBs were found in the posterior segment.
