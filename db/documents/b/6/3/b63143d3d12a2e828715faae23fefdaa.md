Physical signs and symptoms of pulmonary barotrauma related to SCUBA diving can be subtle with pneumomediastinum or subcutaneous emphysema.

Subcutaneous emphysema in the cervical region can lead to voice changes, difficulty swallowing, choking, or foreign body sensation. Crepitus or a crackling sensation can be felt under the skin as air travels through the subcutaneous tissues. Air can track down the esophagus and cause pneumoperitoneum.

Air emboli are formed when air is forced into the capillaries, pulmonary veins, and central circulation. These bubbles collect in the heart or brain and obstruct blood flow. The damaged epithelial and endothelial cells release inflammatory mediators. This damage to the cells leads to leaky vessels causing swelling and edema. In the brain, this manifests as cerebral edema. The initial presentation of arterial gas embolism is the loss of consciousness, seizure, and cardiac arrest due to lack of blood flow in the large vessels or air gas emboli in the brainstem.

An inquiry should be made regarding previous decompression injuries, pulmonary blobs, Marfan syndrome, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pregnancy,Â and any prior pulmonary injuries or surgeries.
