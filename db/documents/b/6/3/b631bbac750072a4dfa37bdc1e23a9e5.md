Plasma, also known as blood plasma, appears light-yellowish or straw-colored. It serves as the liquid base for whole blood. Whole blood minus erythrocytes (RBCs), leukocytes (WBCs), and thrombocytes (platelets) make up the plasma. Serum, sometimes mistakenly considered synonymous with plasma, consists of plasma without fibrinogen. Plasma contains 91% to 92% of water and 8% to 9% of solids. It mainly comprises of:

- Coagulants, mainly fibrinogen, aid in blood clotting

- Plasma proteins, such as albumin and globulin, that help maintain the colloidal osmotic pressure at about 25 mmHg

- Electrolytes like sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, chloride, and calciumÂ help maintain blood pH

- Immunoglobulins help fight infection and various other small amounts of enzymes, hormones, and vitamins
