Urinary retention is a relatively common urological problem encountered in both inpatient and outpatient situations. It should be suspected in any patient with lower abdominal discomfort and any degree of urinary difficulty. Retention can be confirmed with a post-void residual determination either with a bladder ultrasound or a catheterization.

Post-obstructive diuresis is an abnormal condition of prolonged polyuria, involving both excessive salt and water loss, after the acute drainage and decompression of a distended bladder, typically from urinary retention.

Normal maximum bladder capacity is about 450 cc to 500 cc. Post obstructive diuresis is not typically an issue unless the residual urine is 1,500 cc or more. If the post-obstructive diuresis condition becomes pathologic, it can cause serious consequences such as dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, hypotension, hypovolemic shock, and even result in death.
