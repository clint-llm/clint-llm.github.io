The significant differential includes the inborn error of metabolism, such as sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter defect. Sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter defect can cause a metabolic disorder similar to biotinidase deficiency. There is a deficiency of biotin, pantothenic acid, and lipoate.

Biotin deficiency can present with symptoms similar to zinc deficiency. Biotin is necessary for zinc homeostasis in the skin; the precise nature of this association between zinc and biotin is unknown.
