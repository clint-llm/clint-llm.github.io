Epinastine acts through various pathways to decrease inflammation. It acts as:

- a) Mast cell stabilizer:-Mast cells, when activated, promote IgE mediated allergic reactions. Epinastine causes the cessation of degranulation of mast cells by stabilizing them to reduce inflammation.

- b) Anti-histamine:-Inflammatory conditions have been very well known to be associated with the activation of histamine receptors. Histamine is known to increase the permeability of the vessels, as a result of which fluid exudates into the interstitial space. The vascular phase is followed by the cellular phase and sets of an inflammatory cascade. Drugs that block the effects of histamine by competitively inhibiting histamine at its receptors or behaving as inverse agonists are known as anti-histamines. It prevents the binding of histamine to H1 and H2 receptors.

c) It ceases the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, and hence inflammatory response does not progress.
