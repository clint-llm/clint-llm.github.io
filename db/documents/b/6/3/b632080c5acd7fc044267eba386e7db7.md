Benefits and risks always merit consideration when contemplating neurosurgery. The locus coeruleus may be damaged in the process of neurosurgery. The tectum is a region of the brainstem (midbrain) that consists of the inferior and superior colliculi. The superior colliculus functions to process visual information and control eye movement. The inferior colliculus functions to process auditory information. Benign tumors may form in the tectal region of the brain. Neurosurgery for the removal of tumors found in the tectal region is challenging and may contribute to iatrogenic lesions of the locus coeruleus. Damage to the locus coeruleus may result in depression, REM sleep disorder, cognitive difficulties, and more.
