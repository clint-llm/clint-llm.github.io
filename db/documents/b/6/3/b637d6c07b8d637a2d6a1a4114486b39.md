Psoas syndrome is a disorder of the iliopsoas muscle leading to back pain, groin pain, snapping hip, buttock up, or difficulty standing. Psoas dysfunctions are common in athletes but can also impact the general population due to their frequent activation as a hip flexor during walking and everyday activities. This activity reviews the muscle energy treatment of the iliopsoas muscle and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the classic presentation and physical exam findings of psoas syndrome.
- Describe the anatomy of the iliopsoas muscle related to psoas syndrome and mechanisms underlying muscle energy and counterstrain treatments.
- Describe the muscle energy treatments of the iliopsoas muscle from both the supine and prone positions.
- Review the contraindications to muscle energy and counterstrain treatment of the iliopsoas muscle.
