HHV-6 commonly presents with a rash in children presenting to the emergency room and pediatricians alike. While defining rashes can be challenging, isolating specific cofounding symptoms is imperative to differentiate between more toxic versus benign illnesses. The majority of HHV-6 infections are asymptomatic, transient, and do not require antiviral treatment. [Level II] Pediatric consultation is the recommendation for infants with roseola infantum who have febrile seizures. There are known complications from HHV-6, and those individuals with more ominous signs and symptoms including changes in mental status and organ failure would benefit from an interprofessional approach. In such cases insight from neurology and infectious disease physicians are imperative. When HHV-6 associated heart failure is suspected, early cardiology consultation is critical in managing infectious myocarditis in immunocompetent adult patients.

Coordinated care from skilled nurses is prudent to monitor for deterioration and changes in vital signs. Similarly, laboratory assistance in expediting the preferred methods of viral detection in blood or CSF by PCR, or viral antigen in tissue by immunohistochemistry should not be discounted. (Level II) Lastly, the pharmacist is integral in providing ganciclovir and foscarnet anti-viral treatment in HHV-6 associated encephalitis.
