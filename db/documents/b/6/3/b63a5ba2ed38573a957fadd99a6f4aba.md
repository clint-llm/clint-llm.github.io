Biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma (BSNS) is an emerging subtype of sinonasal malignancy. It has not been previously well-studied but has characteristic gene fusion products and associated phenotypic features unique to it. Although rare, it has the potential to become large and infiltrate into bone over a prolonged period, with nonspecific preceding symptoms. It was first described in 2012, and more studies are needed before definitive decisions can be made regarding adjuvant treatments in addition to surgery. This activity reviews the evaluation, management, and overarching principles of BSNS and highlights the role of the healthcare team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the typical presentation of biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma and its distinctions from other sinonasal malignancies.
- Outline the typical immunohistochemical findings for biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma.
- Summarize new developments in the identification of biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma via molecular testing methods.
- Explain the importance of distinguishing biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma from other malignancies in the differential diagnosis.
