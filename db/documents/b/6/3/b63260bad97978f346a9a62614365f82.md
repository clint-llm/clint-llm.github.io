In the setting of a peri-arresting or arrested pregnant patient, the highest likelihood for survival for the mother and the infant is when an interprofessional approach is employed early in the course of the arrest. As is in the setting for a trauma activation, a team of emergency medicine physicians, trauma surgeons, obstetrics and gynecology physicians, anesthesiologists, pediatric neonatologist, and ER- or ICU-trained nursing staff should be present for these scenarios. Hospital policies should be set in place for a peri-arrest or arresting pregnant patient. This allows for easy and early activation of the groups mentioned above. As mentioned earlier, the procedure should be performed by the physician with the most surgical experience in the room, to reduce complications. Areas, where this situation can occur (i.e., ED, ICU, labor and delivery), should also have easy access to all equipment required to perform the procedure. Per AHA 2010 guidelines, "Team planning should be done in collaboration with the obstetric, neonatal, emergency, anesthesiology, intensive care, and cardiac arrest services (Class I, LOE C)."
