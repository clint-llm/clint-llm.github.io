Abnormal uterine bleeding with ovulatory dysfunction (AUB-O) is a frequently encountered complaint in both primary care and OBGYN clinics. Because there are many causes, it is crucial to have an interprofessional team dedicated to this health problem. Most patients initially present to the primary care clinician or nurse. A referral to a gynecologist should take placeÂ as soon as possible to prevent delays in diagnosis and treatment. While the patient is being worked up by the specialist, the primary clinicians should encourage the patient to maintain a healthy body weight, discontinue smoking, eat a healthy diet, and exercise regularly.

Given the myriad of pharmaceutical options available for treatment, it is prudent to include a pharmacist at every step of the way for agent selection, dosing, drug-drug interaction checking, and patient counseling. Nursing staff can also cover drug administration, answer patient questions, and help assess therapeutic effectiveness. Both pharmacy and nursing need open communication with the treating clinician so that all members of the interprofessional team are operating from the same information and can provide input to patient care to achieve optimal results.

The ability to diagnose the condition quickly allows for more rapid initiation of treatment and specialty referral if necessary. Appropriate interprofessional team treatment of AUB-O has been shown to improve patient quality of life. [Level 5]
