**Propofol Infusion Syndrome (PRIS):**This is a rare but serious side effect of prolonged infusion of propofol (usually > 4mg/kg/hour for more than 24 hours). The syndrome presents as metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, hyperlipidemia, and rhabdomyolysis and may proceed to renal and cardiac failure and ultimately death.

It is thought to occur due to alterations in mitochondrial metabolism and electron transport chain function, but the exact mechanism of PRIS is still unknown. The onset of PRIS usually occurs within four days of the initial propofol treatment. This syndrome has been noted to occur during prolonged infusions at high doses in pediatric/young adult patients or those with the need for prolonged sedation, such as mechanically ventilated patients with head trauma.

PRIS is a diagnosis of exclusion. Management of PRIS is the discontinuation of propofol infusion and supportive treatment. Mortality associated with PRIS has been estimated to be around 33% and becomes even higher if the diagnosis is delayed.
