The appendix is less likely to be fixed to mesenteryÂ and has greater mobility. If the omentum is underdeveloped, note a higher rate of diffuse peritonitis if perforation occurs (as the omentum cannot contain purulent material). In children, presentations are often vague or nonspecific, and pain localization is challenging. Children with abdominal pain have especially atypical manifestations and are at higher risk for perforation.
