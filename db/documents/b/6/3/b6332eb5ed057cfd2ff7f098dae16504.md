It is recommended that the healthcare provider monitor the direct low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol for patients taking the DHA-containing products omega-3-acid ethyl esters, omega-3-acid ethyl esters A, and omega-3-carboxylic acids due to DHA’s association with an increase in LDL cholesterol.

In patients with dyslipidemia, icosapent ethyl is an option since it has no association with increased LDL cholesterol.
