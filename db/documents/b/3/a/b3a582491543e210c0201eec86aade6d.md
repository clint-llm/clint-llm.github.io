Orbital atherectomy (OA) has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective device in both clinical studies and all-comer real-world registries.

The most commonly reported complications associated with orbital atherectomy include dissections, slow or no-reflow, and perforations. In the ORBIT I trial involving 50 patients, there were six coronary dissections without clinical sequelae and only one perforation. There was no noted incidence of slow flow or distal emboli.

A transient heart block is uncommon with orbital atherectomy, but bradycardia has been observed. In a 2017 study by Lee et al. involving 50 patients, 4% experienced bradycardia, none of which required pacemaker implantation.

Rare complications have been reported and include pseudoaneurysm and dislodged microtip.
