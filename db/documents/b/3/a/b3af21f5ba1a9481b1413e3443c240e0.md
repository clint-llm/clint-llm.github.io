Everyone has some propensity to have seizures. The concept of a seizure threshold means that each individual exists on a seizure susceptibility continuum with many factors influencing that susceptibility. Medications, genetic factors, electrolyte abnormalities, sleep state, infections, brain inflammation, or injury from many causes may lead to an individual crossing that threshold with a resulting seizure.

On a cellular level, seizures start with the excitation of susceptible cerebral neurons, which leads to synchronous discharges of progressively larger groups of connected neurons. Neurotransmitters are undoubtedly involved. Glutamate is the most common excitatory neurotransmitter, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an important inhibitory neurotransmitter. An imbalance of excess excitation and decreased inhibition initiates the abnormal electrical activity. These electrical paroxysmal depolarization shifts (PDS) seem to trigger epileptiform activity. Increased activation or decreased inhibition of such discharges could result in seizures. The part of the brain affected often reflects in the clinical signs or symptoms of the seizure.

Generalized convulsive status epilepticus is accompanied by systemic changes of lactic acidosis, increased catecholamine levels, hyperthermia, respiratory compromise, and other systemic alterations.
