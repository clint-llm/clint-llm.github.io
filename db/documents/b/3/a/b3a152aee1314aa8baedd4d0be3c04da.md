Arguably the greatest issue surrounding patients sustaining burn injuries is fluid loss. Therefore, volume replacement is crucial. Burns management can be divided intoÂ three phases: early resuscitative, wound management, and rehabilitative/reconstructive. This article will primarily discuss the early resuscitative phase after initial stabilization has been performed. Although guidelines have been present since the early 1960s, fluid management protocols remain controversial for patients in the first 24 hours.

In the early resuscitative phase, the major concern is hypovolemia due to capillary permeability. Thermal injury prompts the release of inflammatory markers not only at the site of injury but also systemically. These inflammatory markers increase the capillary permeability throughout the body and cause a massive fluid shift out of the intravascular compartment. The inflammatory response from thermal burns far surpasses that of trauma and sepsis patients.

Among these inflammatory markers, histamine is likely responsible for the early phase of burn injury, creating capillary permeability.

Initial burn shock during the first 24 to 48 hours following major burns might be identified with myocardial depression, increased capillary permeability, large fluid shifts, and depleted intravascular volume.
