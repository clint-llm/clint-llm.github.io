Education to both the patients and the parents of pediatric patients about the proper use of medication is important. Parents should be educated not to use diphenhydramine in children younger than 12 years of age without the direction of a physician. Patients should also be educated about over-the-counter products containing diphenhydramine and other anticholinergic medications.
