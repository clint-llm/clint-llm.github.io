The burden of HIV prevention lies not only among direct care medical staff but also in the community. One review of PREP uptake among MSM showed that socioeconomic factors and government policies affect the use of PREP to prevent HIV in this population.

HIV prevention relies heavily on patient education in addition to new pharmaceutical therapies. To that end, it requires an interprofessional team approach to patient care that includes clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), nurses, pharmacists, and mental health professionals. All interprofessional team members need to be well-versed in HIV prevention if they are to engage with these patients, and all share in the responsibility for patient education to make prevention strategies effective. Any team member who notes a change in status for the patient must document their observations in the patient's record and reach out to the appropriate team member(s) for additional interventions if necessary. EducationÂ can include patients, their partners, and sometimes family members. This interprofessional paradigm will optimize the effectiveness of HIV prevention strategies. [Level 5]

These findings remind us that engagement beyond the medical setting is essential for HIV prevention. Partnering with community organizations will also improve linkage to care for HIV treatment once diagnosed. Decreasing the time to viral suppression will further reduce the risk of HIV transmission.
