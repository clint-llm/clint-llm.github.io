More than 500,000 people in the United States live with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its progression to this terminal disease remains a significant source of reduced quality of life and premature mortality. The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) define CKD using markers of kidney damage, specifically the ones that determine proteinuria and glomerular filtration rate. Many chronic diseases can cause end-stage renal disease. In many developed and developing countries, diabetes mellitus is the leading cause. This activity explains when this condition should be considered in the differential diagnosis and how to evaluate this condition properly. Furthermore, it highlights the interprofessional team's role in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the causes of end-stage renal disease.
- Outline the presentation of a patient with end-stage renal disease.
- Summarize the treatment options for end-stage renal disease.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to ensure improvement and best outcomes in end-stage renal disease.
