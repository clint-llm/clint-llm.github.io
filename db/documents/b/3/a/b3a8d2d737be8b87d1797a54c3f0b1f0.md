Vincristine acts by binding to tubulin and inhibiting the formation of microtubules. This inhibition causes mitosis to arrest at metaphase, through the disruption of mitotic spindle formation, especially during the M and S phases. Another mechanism of action of vincristine includes interfering with nucleic acid and protein synthesis by blocking glutamic acid utilization.
