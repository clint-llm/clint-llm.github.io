Elevated liver function tests are found in approximately 8% of the general population. These elevations may be transient in patients without symptoms, with up to 30% of elevations resolving after three weeks. Thus, care should be taken when interpreting these results to avoid unnecessary testing.

**Differential Diagnosis Based on Elevated LFTs**

**Hepatocellular pattern:**Elevated aminotransferases out of proportion to alkaline phosphatase

- ALT-predominant:  Acute or chronic viral hepatitis, steatohepatitis, acute Budd-Chiari syndrome, ischemic hepatitis, autoimmune, hemochromatosis, medications/toxins, autoimmune, alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, Wilson disease, Celiac disease

- AST-predominant: Alcohol-related, steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, non-hepatic (hemolysis, myopathy, thyroid disease, exercise)

**Cholestatic pattern:**Elevated alkaline phosphatase +gamma glutamyl transferase + bilirubin out of proportion to AST and ALT

- Hepatobiliary causes: Bile duct obstruction, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, medication-induced, infiltrating diseases of the liver (sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, lymphoma, among others), cystic fibrosis, hepatic metastasis, cholestasis

- Non-Hepatic causes: Bone disease, pregnancy, chronic renal failure, lymphoma or other malignancies, congestive heart failure, childhood growth, infection, or inflammation
