In 2010, over 16 million people in the US required treatment for dysphagia, either in the community or an inpatient setting. It is estimated that nearly 50% of hospitalized patients have a swallowing disorder, exposing them to the risk of aspiration pneumonia (with concomitant increased length of hospital stay), increased re-hospitalization, and increased mortality. By identifying at-risk patients early on, appropriate management can commence, helping reduce the risk of aspiration. The videofluoroscopic swallow study is an important initial diagnostic study for dysphagia as it demonstrates the dynamic motion of the upper aerodigestive pathway in real-time with the motion of food bolus passing through it. This activity outlines and reviews the role of the healthcare team in managing patients who undergo a swallow study.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for a swallowing study.
- Review the complications associated with a swallowing study.
- Describe the typical imaging findings associated with an abnormal swallowing study.
