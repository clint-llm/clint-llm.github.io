Blepharoconjunctivitis is an ophthalmic disease that combines the features of blepharitis and conjunctivitis. It is characterized by inflammation of the eyelid margin (blepharitis) and the surrounding conjunctiva (conjunctivitis). It is closely related to blepharitis and can be considered to be a mature form of blepharitis. If blepharitis is left unmanaged in the initial stages, the inflammation progresses to affect the nearby conjunctiva resulting in blepharoconjunctivitis. Several classification systems have been proposed to describe the condition based on etiology, clinical features, anatomy, and standardized photo grading scales.

The majority of cases in the United States are classified using the American Academy of Ophthalmology preferred practice patterns, which separate cases into anterior or posterior based on the anatomy affected.
