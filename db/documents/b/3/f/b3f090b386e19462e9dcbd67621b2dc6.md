The patients present with stiffness, mild pain, and instability of the shoulder girdle. A history of previous dislocation, mechanism of injury (direction of shoulder movements during the traumatic event), and family history of shoulder instability are also important.

For stroke patients with hemiplegia, although there is no clear association between shoulder subluxation and pain, both medical conditions can exist simultaneously. Furthermore, some patients have a limited range of motions on the hemiplegic shoulder after shoulder subluxation.

During physical examinations, subluxation is detected by palpation of the glenohumeral joint. The extent of shoulder subluxation can be quantified by the distance from the acromion to the humeral head, using fingerbreadth, caliper, or tape.

The tests to examine shoulder laxity include the load and shift, drawer, sulcus, hyperabduction, and push-and-pull tests.

For patients with a history of stroke, if they present with concomitant subluxation and shoulder pain, the physical examination for the rotator cuff tendinopathy, acromioclavicular arthropathy, and subacromial impingement helps identify the cause of shoulder pain.
