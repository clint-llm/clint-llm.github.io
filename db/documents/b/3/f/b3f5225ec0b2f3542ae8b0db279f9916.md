Patients with ataxia may have a functional disability, so it is essential to inform them about the symptoms that should receive medical attention and provide them with assistance.

Referrals should manage swallowing, speech, visual, and hearing difficulties to the respected departments, and patients should receive education on the prevention of common emergencies such as aspiration and falls.

ForÂ acquired etiologies that can be modified, such as alcohol or drug-induced ataxia, the underlying cause will require treatment.
