The most common presenting complaint leading to mid-face lifting is the descent of the malar fat pads with deepening of the NLFs, which is frequently accompanied by atrophy of the facial fat pads. The presence of festoons - hypertrophic and ptotic "bags" of orbicularis oculi muscle - may also necessitate a midface lift in conjunction with excision to help prevent the development of postoperative ectropion. Mid-face lifting may also accompany a more general face or neck lift when jowling or excess skin laxity, especially from significant weight loss, occur.
