The major differential diagnoses are represented by synovial sarcoma, congenital cystic adenomatoid malformations, and fetal lung interstitial tumor.

- Synovial sarcoma is characterized by the presence of spindle cells that can be associated with ovoid cells that are reactive for epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin, and CD99. This reactivity is not noticed in pleuropulmonary blastoma. Molecular analyses are helpful when assessing DI-CER1 mutation and X;18 translocations

- Fetal lung interstitial tumor is characterized by features resembling the lung at 20 to 24 weeks gestation.
