Before the development of multi-detector computed tomography and isotropic acquisition, patient positioning during CT studies was incredibly valuable. Current technology allows for acquisition in nearly any position, and post-processing adjustments will occur after image acquisition. Standard views of the pituitary gland can be obtained by image reconstruction and formatting to standard coronal, sagittal, and axial anatomic landmarks. Since MRI can acquire imaging data in multiple planes, patient positioning is also less critical.
