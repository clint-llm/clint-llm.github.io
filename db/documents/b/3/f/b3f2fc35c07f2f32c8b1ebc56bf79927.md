As with many aspects of medicine, the treatment of mitral valve disease requires multi-disciplinary communication. One of the key differences between the minimally invasive surgical approach and percutaneous edge-to-edge mitral valve repair is the team performs the procedure. Cardiothoracic surgeons conduct minimally invasive surgery and robotic surgery. Interventional cardiologists typically do the transcatheter repair. Cardiothoracic surgery works with interventional cardiology if complications arise, and the percutaneous edge-to-edge mitral valve repair must be converted to a mediastinotomy.
