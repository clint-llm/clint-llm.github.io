Analysis by Stokes et al of confirmed cases reported to the CDC found that older individuals (≥65 years) with underlying comorbidities have a much higher risk of hospitalizations than those without (45.4% vs 7.6%). In the same patient population, mortality was significantly increased compared to younger healthy individuals (19.5% vs 1.6%).

Individuals were identified as high risk if they had advanced age and/or underlying medical conditions that increased the risk of severe disease. According to the CDC, conditions with conclusive evidence demonstrating a higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness when acutely infected are included in their update titled "Underlying Medical Conditions Associated with Higher Risk for Severe COVID-19: Information for Healthcare Professionals" on the CDC website. These include the following:

- Asthma

- Cancer

- Cerebrovascular disease

- Chronic kidney disease

- Bronchiectasis

- COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)

- Interstitial lung disease

- Pulmonary embolism

- Pulmonary hypertension

- Cirrhosis

- Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

- Alcoholic liver disease

- Autoimmune hepatitis

- Cystic fibrosis

- Diabetes, type 1 and 2

- Heart conditions (such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathies)

- HIV (Human immunodeficiency virus)

- Mental health conditions such as mood disorders and Schizophrenia spectrum disorders

- Obesity (defined as body mass index (BMI) of greater than 30 kg/m2 or greater than 95th percentile in children)

- Pregnancy and recent pregnancy

- Smoking, current and former

- Solid organ or blood stem cell transplantation

- Tuberculosis

- Use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications

**Indications**

Monoclonal antibody therapy is currently not indicated for treating acute COVID-19, even if they meet the criteria on their EUAs. As of January 2023, the dominant circulating variants and subvariants are not effectively neutralized by any previously authorized mAbs. The FDA and the NIH advise against their use until further notice. As stated above, the only authorized mAb currently is tixagevimab co-packaged with cilgavimab, which is indicated for pre-exposure prophylaxis only.
