Lunotriquetral joint instability is often misdiagnosed and if left untreated can result in lunotriquetral dissociation. Although patients may lack symptoms in low grade lunotriquetral injury, when symptomatic there is a typical pattern of pain and simple tests can be performed and obtained to more specifically identify injury. This activity outlines the identification and management of lunotriquetral joint instability for the clinician as well as the interprofessional team dealing with this pathology.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the classical presentation of lunotriquetral joint instability.
- Review the imaging modalities and imaging findings of lunotriquetral joint instability.
- Outline the treatment and management options for lunotriquetral joint instability.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients with lunotriquetral joint instability type injuries.
