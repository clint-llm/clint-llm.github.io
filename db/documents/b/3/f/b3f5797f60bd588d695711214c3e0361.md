The four muscles that constitute the rotator cuff are the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, and teres minor.Â  The primary biomechanical role of the rotator cuff is stabilizing the glenohumeral joint by compressing the humeral head against the glenoid. The rotator cuff muscles thus act as dynamic stabilizers of the glenohumeral joint.

The supraspinatus primarily abducts the shoulder and is responsible for the initial 15 degrees of abduction. The infraspinatus and teres minor aid in external rotation of the shoulder. The subscapularis muscle aids in internal rotation of the shoulder. The supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles are innervated by the suprascapular nerve. The teres minor is innervated by the axillary nerve and subscapularis by the subscapular nerve.
