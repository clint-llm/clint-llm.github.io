Thalassemia minor patients must be educated about the hereditary nature of their disease and they must be informed that their parents, siblings, and children may be affected. If both parents have beta-thalassemia minor, there is a one-fourth chance that a child has thalassemia major. Careful genetic counseling is needed when one parent has thalassemia minor and the other parent has other beta globin-related diseases, such as sickle cell carriage. Patients with beta-thalassemia minor should be told that iron supplementation would not improve their anemia as they don't have iron deficiency anemia.
