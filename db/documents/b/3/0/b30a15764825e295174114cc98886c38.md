An interprofessional team is of utmost importance in providing the best possible outcome both physically and psychologically, for patients with akinesia and their family. While the diagnosis of adult-onset akinesia is dependent on the neurologist, fetal akinesia can be appreciated by an obstetrician and fetal medicine specialist. The rehabilitation of akinesia in adults is heavily dependent on self-motivation and requires regular counseling and psychological evaluation. On the other hand, the parents of a live-born with akinesis, with potentially lethal etiologies, must be counseled and supported when opting for comfort care. Surgeons of numerous disciplines and neonatologists play a role in providing structural and functional corrections in these patients.

The nurse and the pharmacist are responsible for dispensing the right medication and dosage. Finally, physiotherapists' role cannot be undermined in both fetal and adult akinesia as they contribute to significantly improving the quality of life in these patients.

Collaboration shared decision making, and communication is crucial for a good outcome. The interprofessional care must use an integrated care pathway using an evidence-based. The earlier signs and symptoms of a complication are identified, the better is the prognosis and outcome.
