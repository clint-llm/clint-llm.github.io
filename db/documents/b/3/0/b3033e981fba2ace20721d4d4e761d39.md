In the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, the pulmonary veins undergo a negative remodeling with increased fibrotic tissue in the intimal layer. The mechanism of vasorelaxation decreases in patients with COPD, with reduced levels of nitric oxide (NO) and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF), both molecules that influence the tone of the vessel.

On an animal model with congestive heart failure (CHF), there would appear to be a sympathetic hyperinnervation of the vessels, with an increase in beta1-adrenergic receptors.
