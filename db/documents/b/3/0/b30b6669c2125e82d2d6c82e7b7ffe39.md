**Procedural Sedation and Analgesia**

The use of continuous end-tidal CO2 monitoring during the performance of procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA), sometimes referred to as “conscious sedation,” is often recommended as a measure to detect respiratory depression. The medications associated with PSA such as proposal, benzodiazepines, and narcotics can often lead to respiratory depression. It is important to recognize that the levels of sedation represent a continuum of drug effect. The lightest forms of sedation include mild anxiolysis where a patient can normally respond after receiving these medications. At the other extreme is deep sedation or general anesthesia where the patient requires active respiratory support and may require hemodynamic support during the procedure. PSA is intended to preserve a patient’s basic cardiopulmonary functioning; however, the medications used in PSA can have side effects including hypotension, loss of protective airway reflexes and hypoventilation. Respiratory depression is considered to be one of the most significant risks during the administration of PSA. To address the risk of hypoventilation, many experts who study and provide PSA have explored the question if CO2 monitoring can help identify hypoventilation and improve patient safety. Oxygen saturation has classically been used as the marker for hypoventilation. However, this may be a late marker of hypoventilation, particularly when supplemental oxygen is administered prophylactically during the administration of PSA.

Some specialty societies whose members perform PSA have recommendations about the use of CO2 monitoring

**Endotracheal Tube Confirmation and Monitoring**

CO2 detection has grown to be used as an important indicator to confirm the correct placement of an endotracheal tube (ETT) after intubation. Airway experts widely recommend this as a required step in ETT confirmation

A false negative CO2 reading may occur in cases of cardiac arrest when there is no cardiopulmonary circulation to carry CO2 to the alveoli and ultimately to the detector. In this case, it is possible that an endotracheal tube could be properly positioned in the trachea yet not provide a CO2 waveform. However, the detector does not produce a waveform with ventilation and could lead to the wrong conclusion. Early initiation of CPR during cardiac arrest leads to circulatory flow which can then generate a CO2 waveform, helping confirm proper tube position. In the later phases of resuscitation as cell death occurs, even with CPR being performed, the CO2 levels will fall.

Continuous CO2 monitoring of an intubated patient can also help identify accidental endotracheal tube displaced during transport or movement of a patient. Continuous monitoring can also help detect other post-intubation complications such as airway obstruction from a kinked ETT or mucous plugging. Anytime a waveform is suddenly lost, it should alert the clinician to evaluate the equipment and connections and determine if there is a more concerning cause for the loss.

**Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)**

**Effectiveness of CPR**

Immediately after a cardiac arrest and during CPR, chest compressions generate cardiac output that results in circulatory flow and the generation of a CO2 waveform. In cardiac arrest in the absence of compressions, there may be no detectable CO2 level. End-tidal CO2 levels correlate with the effectiveness of the compressions and can be used to help guide a resuscitation

**Return of Spontaneous Circulation**

During cardiac arrest when there is a successful return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), there is an associated rise in end-tidal CO2 levels, in fact, this is often the first sign of ROSC

**Termination of Resuscitation**

End-tidal CO2 is also useful during resuscitation to help predict death after a prolonged cardiac arrest. After 20 minutes of CPR, an end-tidal CO2 level of 19 mm Hg or less is predictive of death as an outcome of the cardiac arrest

**Future and Growing Applications**

ETCO2 approximates the arterial concentration of CO2 (PaCO2).  It is typically 2 to 5 mm Hg lower and can be used to estimate the effectiveness of ventilation. This gap can be affected by multiple disease states such as asthma, COPD, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism among others that cause a change in V/Q mismatching, alteration of physiological dead space or shunt physiology. CO2 detection provides a window into ventilation, pulmonary perfusion, and cardiac output.  Multiple disease states are being studied in attempts to find clinical correlations to CO2 levels. Recent work has explored a broad range of possible uses including determination of metabolic rate, diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and assessment for diabetic ketoacidosis
