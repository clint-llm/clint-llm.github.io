Optic canal variants include duplicated optical canal and the key-hole anomaly. Duplicated optic canal is a rare finding present in 0.64% of the population. In the key-hole anomaly, the optic canal has a grooved floor with a keyhole appearance in plain film radiographs. This variant was present in 2.65% of studied orbits.

In some cases of the duplicated optic canal, the origin of the ophthalmic artery is the intracavernous part of the internal carotid artery. In this variant, the ophthalmic artery could pass through the superior orbital fissure.
