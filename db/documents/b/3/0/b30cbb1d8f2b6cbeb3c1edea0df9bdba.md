- Uhthoff’s phenomenon (also known as Uhthoff sign or Uhthoff syndrome) is described a transient worsening of neurological symptoms related to a demyelinating disorder such as multiple sclerosis when the body becomes overheated in hot weather, exercise, fever, saunas, or hot tubs.

- The pathophysiology and etiology are complex and related to the effects of demyelination on sodium and potassium channels, heat shock proteins, circulatory changes, effects of serum calcium, and unidentified humoral substance surrounding myelinated axons, causing increased threshold for depolarization and decreased conduction velocity after increased in temperature.

- Historical factors such as exertional activity, hot climates, hot showers, menses, psychological stress, viral or bacterial illness with fever can trigger this phenomenon in the setting of chronic, subacute, or acute lesions related to multiple sclerosis

- Pseudoexacerbation often resolves after the underlying infectious trigger is resolved, while a true exacerbation will present with new focal neurological deficits including diplopia or amblyopia, dysarthria, nystagmus, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, focal hemiplegia, dysesthesias, dysmetria, ataxia, allodynia, neuropathic pain, spasms, abnormal reflexes, among other central demyelinating symptoms.

- Evaluation of Uhthoff’s phenomenon includes using history and physical examination to determine whether it is a true exacerbation or pseudo exacerbation

- Pseudoexaacerbation evaluation includes a serum laboratory complete metabolic and blood count with differential, urinalysis, chest X-ray among others to rule out infectious, toxic, and metabolic triggers.

- A true exacerbation should be worked up with advanced imaging including an MRI brain, MRI C-spine, MRI T-spine with and without contrast to assess for any new contrast-enhancing lesions that could reveal a new clinical attack for the demyelinating condition the patient suffers. For new diagnosis, a lumbar puncture may be indicated to pinpoint the demyelinating or inflammatory condition including basic CSF studies, meningoencephalitis panel, oligoclonal bands, IgG Index, NMO Aquaporin-4 or MOG antibodies, flow cytometry, cytology, among others.

- Symptomatic treatment of Uhthoff syndrome includes avoidance of heat triggers, active cooling measures, and in severe or recurrent cases, oral 4-aminopyridine or dalfampridine

- A true exacerbation should be treated acutely with IV high dose corticosteroids, IVIG, plasmapheresis, chronic disease-modifying immunomodulatory therapy, physical rehabilitation, and treatment of complications related to the chronic neurological sequela of the underlying disorder.
