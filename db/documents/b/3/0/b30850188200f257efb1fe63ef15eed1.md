Renal transplant is effective in the 10 to 20% of patients who doÂ develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The disease may recur in up to 50% of the patients. Within few days, sub-epithelial deposits can appear in the allograft. For primary MN patients, delaying transplantation until antibodies are no longer detected is preferred. Treatment for recurrent MN in transplant patients is usually considered only when protein excretion exceeds 1 g per day.
