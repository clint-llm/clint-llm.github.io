The user’s strength and coordination should undergo evaluation before issuing them a set of crutches.  The use of the wrong crutches can lead to injury.  Most injuries are a direct result of falling.

Crutch palsy is observable in axilla crutch users who rest their weight on the shoulder rest.  The pressure on the brachial plexus can result in palsy to the radial and ulnar nerves.  Extra padding on the shoulder rest can aid in preventing crutch palsy. Education should be provided to patients to discourage supporting body weight on the shoulder rest. With treatment, this can be a repairable injury.
