Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is a clinical syndrome in which there is an acute, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema associated with hypoxia that occurs during or after a transfusion. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of transfusion-related acute lung injury and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify diagnostic criteria for transfusion-related acute lung injury.
- Describe the pathophysiology of transfusion-related acute lung injury.
- Contrast transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) and transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO).
- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients with transfusion-related acute lung injury.
