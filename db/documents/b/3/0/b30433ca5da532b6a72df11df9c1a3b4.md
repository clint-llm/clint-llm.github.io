The clinical staging of both HL and NHL derive from the Ann Arbor (AA) staging system, which was subsequently modified at the Cotswolds meeting in 1989. The modification kept the previous four-stage system, with the addition of the modifier ‘‘X’’ for bulk, defined as greater than 10 cm in long-axis or for a mediastinal mass as measuring greater than one-third of the internal transverse thoracic diameter of a standard PA chest X-ray at the level of the fifth or sixth thoracic vertebral body. It is based on the extent of involvement of lymph node groups. The ‘‘E’’ modifier presents a direct extension of the tumor to an extranodal site, or for stage IE disease, isolated involvement of a single extranodal site without evidence of lymph node disease (e.g., primary lymphoma of bone or thyroid). The ‘‘B’’ modifier refers to the presence of one or more of a set of symptoms that are associated with more aggressive disease and worse prognosis, and these include unexplained recurring or persistent fever, drenching night sweats, or unexplained weight loss of 10% of body weight (B symptoms).

Cotswolds modification of the Ann Arbor staging system:

**Stage I**

Involvement of a single lymph node region or lymphoid structure (e.g., spleen, thymus, Waldeyer’s ring) or involvement of a single extra lymphatic site (IE)

**Stage II**

Involvement of two or more lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm (II) or localized contiguous involvement of only one extranodal organ or side and its regional lymph-nodes with or without other lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm (IIE)Note: The number of anatomic regions involved may be indicated by a subscript (e.g., II3)

**Stage III**

Involvement of lymph node regions on both sides of the diaphragm (III), which may also be accompanied by involvement of the spleen (IIIS) or by localized contiguous involvement of only one extranodal organ side (IIIE) or both (IIISE)

**Stage IV**

Disseminated (multifocal) involvement of one or more extranodal organs or tissues, with or without associated lymph-node involvement or isolated extra lymphatic organ involvement with distant (non-regional) nodal involvement

**Designations Applicable to Any Disease Stage**

A: No symptomsB: Fever (temperature > 38 C), drenching night sweats, unexplained loss of more than 10% of body weight during the previous six months.X: Bulky diseaseE: Involvement of an extranodal site that is contiguous or proximal to the known nodal site
