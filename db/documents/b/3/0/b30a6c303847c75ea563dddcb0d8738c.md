Due to the stringent requirements set by the FDA, some studies have revealed the issue of “drug lag” in the US markets. Particularly in the 1970s, new drugs were often approved and marketed far earlier in European markets than in US markets.

The increasing cost of performing clinical trials creates another significant barrier to the approval of new drugs. The average cost of performing a clinical trial is nearly $48 million per drug.
