A) In cases of nerve trauma, partial or complete transection can occur; in the cases of a total transection of the nerve, Wallerian degeneration may follow.

B) In cases of nerve entrapment:

- At the site of the entrapment, there is compression and flattening of the nerve.

- Proximal to the site of the entrapment, there is swelling of the nerve.

The net result is progressive ischemia of the nerve, potentially leading to the following

- Pain

- Loss of function

- Impaired sensory input

- Hair loss and trophic changes in the anterior surface of the scrotum and root of the penis in males or labia majora and mons pubis in females

- A small area of the upper anteromedial thigh and weakness of the muscles supplied by the ilioinguinal nerve
