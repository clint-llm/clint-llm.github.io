The most important differential diagnosis of coronary artery calcifications is coronary artery disease. On chest imaging, including CT scans, it may be difficult to distinguish calcifications of the coronary artery, valves, annulus, pericardium, great vessel, cardiac lumen, and myocardium. However, advanced imaging, like echocardiography and cardiac MRI, as well as cardiac CTA, can help predict the precise locations of these calcifications.

The morphology of calcifications on chest imaging can provide clues to its source in difficult cases. Coronary artery calcifications follow an expected anatomic course and usually are linear. Pericardial calcifications are usually dense but oriented in a linear configuration and usually spare the apex. Calcifications of the mitral annulus are arranged in dense ring-like clumps, whereas valvular and great vessel calcifications are thin and curvilinear and located in an expected anatomic location. Myocardial calcifications are diffuse and frequently involve the septum.
