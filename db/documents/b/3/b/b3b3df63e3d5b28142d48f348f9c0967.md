Fenofibrate is contraindicated for patients with a history of hypersensitivity to fenofibrate, liver disease, severe renal dysfunction, preexisting gallbladder disease, or breastfeeding. Fenofibrate may also interact with other drugs and may require a change in dose, frequency, or switching to a new therapy. When prescribing fenofibrate in conjunction with statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) or colchicine, rhabdomyolysis and myopathy may occur. There is also an increased incidence of myopathy related to fenofibrate therapy in patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, thyroid disorder, or a renal disorder.

Fibrates, especially gemfibrozil, are associated with an increased risk of cholecystitis and cholelithiasis due to their ability to increase the cholesterol saturation in bile. Patients with severe renal dysfunction, including those on dialysis, should avoid fenofibrate due to reduced drug clearance and increased risk of myositis. Caution is necessary if patients are on anticoagulation therapy as fenofibrate may potentiate the effects of coumarin-type medications.
