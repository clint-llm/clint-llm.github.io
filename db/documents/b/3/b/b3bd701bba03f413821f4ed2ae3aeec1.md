The latissimus dorsi flap, either free or pedicled, transferred with or without the overlying skin and subcutaneous tissue, can be a technically simple flap to transfer and provide large swaths of pliable tissue for reconstruction of the head, neck, and torso. Further, the latissimus flap often provides an excellent skin match for areas of the head, neck, and torso, and so is aesthetically advantageous. Many wounds that are too large for reconstruction with other flaps are amenable to latissimus transfer, making it a useful flap to keep in the reconstructive surgeon's armamentarium.
