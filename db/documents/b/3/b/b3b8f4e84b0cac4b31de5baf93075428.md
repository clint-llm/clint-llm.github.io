Initial evaluation of a patient suspected of having a subarachnoid hemorrhage should include a head computed tomogram (CT).

The sensitivity of CT scans and red blood cell (RBC) counts are time-dependent and very sensitive early in the diagnosis. This loss of sensitivity over time can be due to the brisk physiologic flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Over time, the RBCs present in the CSF undergo lysis resulting in breakdown products such as bilirubin and oxyhemoglobin. RBC lysis explains that xanthochromia becomes increasingly sensitive after a few hours.
