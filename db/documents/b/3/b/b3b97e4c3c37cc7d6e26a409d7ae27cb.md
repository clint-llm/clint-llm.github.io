In week 3 of embryonic development, the primitive heart tube differentiates into two separate structures. The primordial atrium persists to form the left and right atria, while the sinus venosus develops right and left horns. The primordial IVC and SVC drain into the right horn, which eventually is absorbed by the enlarging right atrium. The left horn persists to form the coronary sinus and its contiguous tributaries.
