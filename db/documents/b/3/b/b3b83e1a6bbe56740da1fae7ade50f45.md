Pudendal neuralgia can arise from mechanical or non-mechanical injuries. The mechanical injury can be due to compression, transaction, or stretching. Amongst the mechanical causes, compression caused by pudendal nerve entrapment is the most common etiology. Non-mechanical causes of pudendal neuralgia include viral infections (herpes zoster, HIV), multiple sclerosis, radiation therapy, and diabetes mellitus, among others.

The first reported case of pudendal neuralgia was due to cycling, which resulted from continuous pressure on Alcock's canal.

**Causes of Pudendal Neuralgia**

- Pelvic surgery - The surgery for repair of prolapse of pelvic organs is reportedly the most common cause of pudendal neuralgia. The incidence increases if a mesh is used. Chronic persistent pain may require mesh removal in some cases.

- Direct trauma to the buttocks or back can result in pudendal neuralgia.

- Childbirth - Vaginal delivery causes a significant stretching of pelvic floor muscles by the fetal head, which sometimes results in pudendal nerve damage.

- Chronic constipation

- Excessive cycling -Â The condition is presumably because of chronic perineal microtrauma, which causes fibrosis in the pudendal canal as well as the sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments.

- Prolonged sitting can also contribute to this condition.
