Cerebral aneurysms are defined as dilations that occur at weak points along the arterial circulation within the brain. They can vary in size (small less than 0.5 mm, medium 6 to 25 mm, and large greater than 25 mm). Most are saccular (berry), which is associated with a thin or absent tunica media, and an absent or severely fragmented internal elastic lamina. However, fusiform (circumferential) and mycotic (infectious) aneurysms are present in a small percentage of cases. The majority of cerebral aneurysms are silent and may be found incidentally on neuroimaging or upon autopsy. Approximately 85% of aneurysms are located in the anterior circulation, predominately at junctions or bifurcations along the circle of Willis. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) usually occurs with rupture and is associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality.
