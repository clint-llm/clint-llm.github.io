Liddle syndrome is one of the rare causes of resistant hypertension that usually presents since early childhood, but some are not detected until well into adulthood. First explained by Grant Liddle et al. in 1963, it is characterized by a primary increase in collecting tubule sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion. For this reason, is also known as pseudohyperaldosteronism. It is a rare cause of secondary hypertension due to a genetic mutation, affecting the function of the collecting tubule sodium channel.
