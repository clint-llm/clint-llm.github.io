Over 85% of patients with acute herniated disc symptoms experience relief of symptoms within 6 to 12 weeks without any treatments, and those without radiculopathy symptoms notice an improvement in even less time.

The patient should be encouraged to obtain a rest period free of daily activities. For persistent pain, physical therapy should be consulted.

Patients who develop signs of cauda equina should seek emergent evaluation as prognosis and outcome will depend on the time to treatment from the initial symptoms.

Studies have shown that conservatory management and surgical treatment have similar outcomes after two years, although pain relief is faster with surgical treatment.
