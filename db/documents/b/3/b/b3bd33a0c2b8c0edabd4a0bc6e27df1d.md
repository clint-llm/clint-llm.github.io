After head trauma, a patient may develop an epidural (extradural) or subdural hematoma. The hematoma can lead to a rapid rise in intracranial pressure, and death can result if not treated.

**Epidural Hematoma**

In an epidural hematoma, the arterial blood collects between the endosteal layer of the dura and the skull. The vessel frequently involved is the middle meningeal artery (MMA), which may be ruptured or torn as a result of blunt or penetrating brain trauma.

**Subdural Hematoma**

In a subdural hematoma, there is a collection of venous blood between the dura and the arachnoid mater. The hematoma frequently is due to injury or rupture of the subdural veins as they empty into the dural venous sinuses. Subdural hematoma arises from the rupture of bridging veins, usually from head trauma. Because the venous pressure in the veins is low, the hematoma is not typically large, and progression is not rapid. An increase in intracranial pressure can increase the rate of bleeding from the ruptured bridging veins.

Subdural bleeding (SDB) in infants is considered an essential symptom of nonaccidental head injury.

**The Sensitivity of the Dural Mater**

The dura mater is very sensitive to stretch. Any irritation of the dura often causes a sensation of a headache, e.g., meningitis, hematoma.
