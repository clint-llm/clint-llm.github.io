In patients presenting with an acutely swollen knee, weight-bearing radiographs in 3 planes should be ordered to look for a fracture in the case of trauma. This includes AP, lateral, and axial views.

An ultrasound of the effusion can help assess a complicated effusion from a simple effusion and can also be used to perform arthrocentesis. A saline load test may be utilized to determine if a wound near a joint communicates with the joint. In the knee, 155 mL of saline is needed to reach 95% sensitivity.

Arthrocentesis and subsequent synovial fluid analysis should be done in all cases of unexplained knee effusion. The aspirated fluid should be analyzed for cell counts, Gram stain, bacterial cultures, and crystal analysis. Hemarthrosis is commonly caused by joint trauma. Fat droplets (detected by polarized microscopy) also indicate an articular fracture. Other clotting disorders like hemophilia can cause hemarthrosis in the absence of trauma.

**Synovial Fluid Aspirate Analysis**

- Complete cell count with differential (white blood cell [WBC], polymorphonuclear leukocytes)

- Crystal examination of synovial fluid

- Bacterial Culture and Gram staining of synovial fluid

- Viscosity (RA: expect decreased viscosity and poor mucin clot formation)

- Glucose

- A low level of synovial-fluid glucose is suggestive of an infected joint, but low glucose levels are present in only about 50% of patients with septic joints and can also occur in rheumatoid arthritis.
- Fasting glucose levels are usually reduced to less than half of the simultaneously obtained blood levels.

- The presence of crystals cannot exclude septic arthritis with certainty.[8] Septic arthritis occurs concurrently with gout or pseudogout in less than 5% of cases.

**Septic Arthritis**

- Joint fluid appears cloudy or purulent.

- A cell count with WBC greater than 50,000 is considered diagnostic for septic arthritis. However, lower counts may still indicate infection (not sensitive).

- A prosthetic joint with WBC greater than 1100 is considered septic.

- Gram stains only identify infective organisms one-third of the time.

- Glucose will be less than 50% of the serum level.

**Non-Inflammatory Synovial Fluid**

- It contains less than 60 to 180 cells per mL, most of which should be mononuclear.

- Synovial fluid is considered non-inflammatory if it contains less than 2000 cells/mL, but most samples of synovial fluids from pts with osteoarthritis contain less than 500 cells per ml.

- The most common cause of non-inflammatory effusions of the knee (synovial fluid white blood cell count less than 2000 cells/mcL) is osteoarthritis; other causes include osteonecrosis, Charcot arthropathy, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, hypothyroidism, and acromegaly. Inflammatory arthritis (synovial fluid white blood cells greater than 2000 cells/mL) can be caused by infection, autoimmune disease, and crystal-induced arthritis. Aspiration of dark brown serosanguinous fluid should raise the possibility of pigmented villonodular synovitis.

**Inflammatory Synovial Fluid**

- Greater than 2000 leukocytes/mL

- Traumatic: Less than 5000  (w/RBCs)
- Toxic Synovitis: 5000 to 15,000 and less than 25% polymorphs
- Acute Rheumatic Fever: 10,000 to 15,000 and 50% polymorphs
- JRA 15,000 to  80,000 and 75% polymorphs

- Greater 50,000 leukocytes/mL;

- Although other diseases, including trauma, may produce WBC cells in joint fluid, levels greater than 50,000/mm3 are usually due to infectious arthritis.
- Usually causes most intense synovial fluid leukocytosis, w/ 50,000 to 200,000 cells/mL and usually over 90% PMNs.
- Lower leukocyte counts are more common early in bacterial arthritis and in patients with disseminated gonococcal infection.
- Non-infectious conditions such as gout, pseudogout, acute rheumatic fever, reactive arthritis, and RA can cause a markedly inflammatory synovial effusion. A finding of greater than 90% PMNs despite a relatively low total leukocyte count should prompt concern about infection or crystal-induced disease. However, the presence of crystals cannot exclude septic arthritis with certainty

- Septic arthritis 80,000 to 200,000 and greater than 75% polymorphs

- In synovial fluid, WBC count and percentage of polymorphonuclear cells from arthrocentesis are the most powerful predictors for septic arthritis. The LR is increased as the synovial fluid WBC count increases.
- For counts greater than 50,000/microL (LR, 7.7; 95% CI, 5.7-11.0) and for counts greater than 100,000/microL (LR, 28.0; 95% CI, 12.0-66.0). On the same synovial fluid sample, a polymorphonuclear cell count of at least 90% suggests septic arthritis with an LR of 3.4 (95% CI, 2.8-4.2), while a PMN cell count of less than 90% lowers the likelihood (LR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.25-0.47)

**Other Labs**

**Blood Work**

- Infectious processes: 

- Lyme disease (especially in the pediatric population with atraumatic unilateral knee effusion) 
- Antistreptolysin-O for post-streptococcal infection 
- Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) for syphilis
- Elevated WBC in a complete blood count (CBC) for osteomyelitis, inflammation, malignancy

- Inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein and sedimentation rate

- ANA for possible autoimmune disorders

Urine studies check for urinary tract infections and sexually transmitted diseases, including gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomonas, which can cause reactive arthritis.

Polymerase chain reaction tests of affected mucosal sites for gonorrhea and chlamydia should also be considered.

Stool cultures can detect salmonella, yersinia, campylobacter, and shigella, which can all cause reactive arthritis.
