The vast majority of patients in whom an atypical infection is suspected can be managed successfully as an outpatient. There is usually a complete resolution of symptoms and a low morbidity and mortality. Treatment is often uneventful in the absence of significant comorbid conditions, vital sign abnormalities, and a toxic appearance.  As with all clinical disease, not every case follows the expected course. Close follow-up and compliance are necessary to monitor for disease progression.
