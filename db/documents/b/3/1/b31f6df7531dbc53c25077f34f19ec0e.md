Clinical evaluation should always include an endoscopic examination of the larynx using fiberoptic endoscopy, or direct laryngoscopy under general anesthesia in addition to imaging modalities such as a CT scan and ultrasound.

In literature, the recommendation is to perform CT within 24 hours of trauma is suggested as laryngeal fractures are frequently underdiagnosed. Schaefer has suggested a CT scan for all patients with a potential laryngeal fracture, while others have recommended selective use of CT scans.
