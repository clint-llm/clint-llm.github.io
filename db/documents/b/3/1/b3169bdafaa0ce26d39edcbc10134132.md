Mycobacterium kansasii is a non-tuberculosis mycobacterium (NTM) that is readily recognized based on its characteristic photochromogenicity; it produces a yellow pigment when exposed to light.

Buhler and Pollack first described this slow-growing mycobacterium in 1953.M. kansasii appears as thick rectangular, beaded, gram-positive rods which are longer than those of M. tuberculosis.M. kansasii causes a chronic, upper-lobe cavitary disease, resembling that from M. tuberculosis. The prevalence of NTM infections has steadily increased when compared to tuberculosis whose prevalence has decreased in the last few decades.M. kansasii, although some studies have in fact shown decreasing prevalence.
