Non-odontogenic cysts are usually discovered during a routine examination. These lesions arise from the non-odontogenic (non-tooth forming) tissue. By definition, the cysts are lined by epithelium. Cysts within the oral cavity vary in their clinical appearance, incidence, histology, behavior, and management. The clinical features, etiology, and treatment modalities for the following lesions will be discussed in this activity: nasopalatine duct cyst, nasolabial cyst, palatal cyst of the neonate, oral lymphoepithelial cyst, and epidermoid cyst.
