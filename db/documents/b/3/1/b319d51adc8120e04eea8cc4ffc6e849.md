The elderly population must be explained about the risk factors associated with colonic volvulus. These include chronic constipation, high-fiber diet, chronic dependence on enemas or laxatives, association with neuropsychiatric disorders and myopathies, the use of neuroleptic drugs, etc. Similarly, Chagas disease or megacolon can also predispose to sigmoid volvulus. Rarely, appendicitis or surgery may lead to excessive adhesions leading to volvulus. Patients must also be informed about the available treatment options including conservative strategies and their complications. A need for enterostomy (colostomy and /or ileostomy) must always be explained to the patients before the surgery for volvulus.
