Dandy-Walker malformation (DWM) or syndrome is a posterior fossa anomaly characterized by agenesis or hypoplasia of the vermis and cystic enlargement of the fourth ventricle causing upward displacement of tentorium and torcula. Most patients have hydrocephalus at the time of diagnosis. DMW is the most common posterior fossa malformation, and it typically occurs sporadically. This activity reviews the presentation of Dandy-Walker malformation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of Dandy-Walker malformation. 
- Describe the presentation of Dandy-Walker malformation. 
- Summarize the treatment of Dandy-Walker malformation. 
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by Dandy-Walker malformation.
