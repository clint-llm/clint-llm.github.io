The etiology of vasovagal syncope is unclear. Some believe that the vasovagal reaction is an exaggeration of an adaptive response meant to assist in hemostasis in times of trauma. In other words, in the setting of physical trauma, the body reflexively lowers blood pressure and heart rate to reduce the amount of bleeding. Others have sought a genetic link for the syndrome.
