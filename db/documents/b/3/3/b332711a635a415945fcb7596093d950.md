The list of early pregnancy complications is vast, including ectopic pregnancy, heterotopic pregnancy, molar pregnancy, and miscarriage. The provider needs to visualize an intrauterine pregnancy for reasons discussed in prior sections.

Complications resulting from ultrasonography in early pregnancy are minor. Transvaginal ultrasound may cause vaginal and or cervical discomfort during the exam, especially in the setting of a gynecologic infection. Given theoretical risks of harm to the fetus, the principle of ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) should be practiced by limiting scan time, avoiding the use of doppler, etc. However, overall the consensus is that ultrasonography is a safe diagnostic tool for both the patient and fetus.
