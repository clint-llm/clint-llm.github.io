Hydralazine is a direct arteriole vasodilator. Although the mechanism is not completely understood, it is theorized to be associated with intracellular calcium homeostasis. Specifically, it acts to inhibit inositol trisphosphate (IP3)-induced release of calcium from the smooth muscle cells' sarcoplasmic reticulum and inhibits myosin phosphorylation within the arterial smooth muscle.

Hydralazine is metabolized by the liver. It undergoes polymorphic acetylation. Slow acetylators require lower doses of the drug. Both the acetylated drug and unchanged drug are excreted in the urine and feces.

For intravenous dosing, the blood-pressure-lowering effects occur within 5 to 30 minutes with a total duration of 2 to 6 hours. For oral dosing, the blood-pressure-lowering effects occur within 20 to 30 minutes with a total duration of 2 to 4 hours.
