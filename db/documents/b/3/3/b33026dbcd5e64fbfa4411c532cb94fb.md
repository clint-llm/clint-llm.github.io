Transfusion transmitted diseases (TTD) comprise several pathologies that are transmitted by blood transfusions. The various etiologic agents are mainly viruses and parasites. For example, hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can be transmitted via blood taken from an infected individual and transfused into a recipient, causing the recipient to develop chronic hepatitis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, respectively. This activity will review the most common causes of transfusion-transmitted disease and outline the treatment approach according to current evidence. This activity will highlight the role of the interprofessional team in recognizing and treating patients with transfusion transmitted diseases.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of transfusion transmitted diseases.
- Recall the types of infections that can be acquired during transfusions.
- Summarize the treatment options for transfusion transmitted diseases.
- Outline the importance of enhancing care coordination among the interprofessional team to ensure proper evaluation and management of transfusion transmitted diseases.
