Physical exam, as described above, is the best way to analyze patients for retrognathia. A common adjunctive radiological review is the lateral cephalometric x-ray. This is typically traced and measured with a full cranio-cephalometric analysis that is beyond the scope of this article. There are a series of measurements that look at the position of the mandible to the skull base to diagnose mandibular hypoplasia (for example, the Sella-Nasion-B point angle (SNB) is generally 80 degrees inÂ the White population, so an SNB angle of 72 degrees is indicative of retrognathia).
