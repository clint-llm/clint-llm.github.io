Hydranencephaly has some unique findings on imaging and ancillary tests that help to differentiate it from other conditions such as severe-extreme hydrocephalus, holoprosencephaly (especially the alobar holoprosencephaly type), severe open schizencephaly, and anencephaly.

- Hydrocephalus (severe-extreme): This can occur due to multiple etiologies. The cortical mantle is preserved. There is the presence of the third ventricle, abnormal head circumference at birth, full and bulging fontanelles, and a normal vascular study. There is significant clinical and radiographic improvement after shunt placement, which can improve prognosis.

- Holoprosencephaly (alobar): It is the most severe form of holoprosencephaly. This is a condition that occurs due to a congenital cerebral anomaly that results due to absent or incomplete division of the forebrain. In this form of holoprosencephaly, there is a partial fusion of the thalami, and the falx is missing. These patients present with facial anomalies and small head circumference.

- Schizencephaly (severe open): This occurs due to an abnormality in the migration of neurons, leaving clefts lined with abnormal gray matter, described as polymicrogyria. There is a thinning but preservation of the cortical mantle, which is absent in hydranencephaly.

- Anencephaly: This isÂ caused by a neural tube obstruction disorder and the classical finding will be a defect in the skull as well as in the brain parenchyma.
