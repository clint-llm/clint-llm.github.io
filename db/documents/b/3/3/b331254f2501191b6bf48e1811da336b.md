Diagnosis is usually based on history and clinical examination. Palpation in the affected space may reproduce the symptoms. Compression of the forefoot in the mediolateral direction while palpating the affected space often results in a significant crunching or clicking feeling, commonly known as the "Mulder's click." Some surgeons inject the affected webbed space with a diagnostic injection of lidocaine. A maximum of 1 ml to 2 ml of the anesthetic agent should be injected. Plain, weight-bearing radiographs should be taken to rule out any bony masses, deformities, subluxation, dislocation, or arthritis.Â Additionally, gapping of the distal intermetatarsal space and/or divergence of adjacent digits may be noted, and this is known as Sullivan's sign.

A radio-opaque foreign body can also be visualized. An ultrasound scan performed by an experienced radiologist can be a useful diagnostic aid. A steroid injection under ultrasound guidance can be given at the same time. MRI can be obtained based on the clinical scenario, especially to rule out other pathologies.
