The standard dose of nintedanib therapy is 150 mg every 12 hours. There are no recommended guidelines for managing overdose. Any patient with a suspected overdose should undergo close monitoring in a healthcare facility. Nintedanib has a high protein binding ability (approximately 98%), predominantly to albumin, with a bioavailability of around 5%.

Nintedanib therapy is frequently associated with elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin, but this is usually reversible with dose reduction or treatment interruption. For patients with ALT/AST elevation less than 3 to 5 times the upper limit without signs of hepatotoxicity, it is recommended to hold the therapy and resume at a lower dose of 100 mg twice daily once the liver enzymes normalized. Treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity with AST/ALT elevation more than 3 to 5 times the normal upper limit.

Female patients with low BMI, low body surface area (BSA), and Asian ethnicity are at higher risk of hepatotoxicity when treated with doses of 150 mg twice daily. This is reversible with treatment interruption or dose reduction.
