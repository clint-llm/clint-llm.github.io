When evaluating any patient with an orbital mass, keeping a broad differential diagnosis is vital. A thorough history and clinical examÂ are paramount for determining risk factors for various disease processes and guiding diagnostic workup and treatment acuity. Malignant lesions often carry a poor prognosis, and thus expedient workup and treatment are essential.

Inflammatory signs are not often seen with tumors and may indicate infectious or inflammatory dacryoadenitis. Pain or hypoesthesia is often an indicator of malignancy as most benign lesions are painless. Imaging is equally important in diagnosis and the decision-making process for treatment; it can also aid with surgical planning. The treatment of malignant tumors requires a multi-specialty approach with physicians experienced in managing these orbital tumors and their complications.
