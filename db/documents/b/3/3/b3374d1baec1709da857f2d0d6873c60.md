No specific patient preparation is required for a general TCD examination. For specific applications, there may be some additional preparation required. For example,Â the evaluation of right-to-left shunt utilizes a contrast examination. This requires the patient to have an IV line started (typically in an antecubital vein) attached to tubing with a three-way stopcock. Additionally, for this exam preparation, agitated saline will be needed.
