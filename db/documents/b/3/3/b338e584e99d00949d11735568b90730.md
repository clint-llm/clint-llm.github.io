An oral examination is crucial to evaluate for possible complications of thumb sucking. The first oral evaluation for all children is recommended when the first tooth erupts, no later than 12 months. Examining the oral soft tissues, palate, alveolar ridges, and any erupted/ erupting teeth is essential. Once dental care is established, monitoring the developing primary dentition and occlusion should be done at regular clinic visits.
