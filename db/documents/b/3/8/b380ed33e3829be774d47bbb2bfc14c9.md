The performance of a closed-suction system can be optimized by increasing intracavitary tube length, decreasing extra cavitary tube length, increasing tube diameter, increasing the pressure differential, use a perforated catheter, squeezing a low-pressure bulb side-to-side, and milking drain tubing frequently.
