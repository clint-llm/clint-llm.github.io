Treatment of cerebral palsy takes an interprofessional team approach. The team includes physicians (primary care, neurologists, physiatrists, orthopedists, and other specialists needed based on co-existing conditions), therapists (physical, occupational, and speech), behavioral health specialists, social workers/case managers, and educational specialists. Interventions should focus on maximizing the quality of life and decreasing the disability burden. The patient, family, and team should set functional goals that are realistic and periodically reevaluated.

Oral and injectable (e.g., botulinum toxin) medications can help to treat tone abnormalities, pain, and comorbid conditions such as epilepsy, sialorrhea, gastrointestinal disturbances, and behavior disorders. Medications used for spasticity include benzodiazepines, baclofen, dantrolene, tizanidine, cyclobenzaprine, botulinum toxin, and phenol.

Surgical management options include placement of a baclofen pump, selective dorsal rhizotomy,Â tendon releases, hip derotation/rotation surgery, spinal fusion, strabismus repair, and deep brain stimulation.
