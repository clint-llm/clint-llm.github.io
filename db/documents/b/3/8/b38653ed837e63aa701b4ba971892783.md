OAVS has a prevalence of 1 per 3500 to 1 per 45,000 live births. Facial abnormalities are usually unilateral, leading to facial asymmetry with the right side more frequently involved. However, asymmetrical bilateral involvement (10 to 33%) can also be seen. Male infants are more commonly affected with OAVS than female infants (3 to 2). Usually, the affected children have a normal life span and normal intelligence. OAVS is most commonly sporadic, with a few familial cases (2 to 12%) reported in the literature.
