Sonographic anatomy, similar to gross anatomy, recognizes landmarks and scanning conventions that were originally defined by specialties like obstetrics and radiology. For example, the gallbladder is located under the liver and has great variability with its location. The sonographic cystic pedicle (SCP) is a landmark utilized to ensure correct identification of the gallbladder.
