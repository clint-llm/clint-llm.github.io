Severe cases of musculoskeletal symptoms warrant discontinuation of simvastatin. In milder cases, the currently accepted practice is temporary discontinuation followed by a re-challenge at a lower dose. If re-challenging simvastatin at a lower dose leads to similar adverse effects, discontinuation followed by an alternative statin is the recommended next step.
