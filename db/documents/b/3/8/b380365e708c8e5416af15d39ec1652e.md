The current belief is that hypercapnia changes neurotransmitter levels involved with consciousness. There is a hypothesis that there are increased levels of glutamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA) and decreased glutamate levels.

Cerebral autoregulation is a process in which the brain works to maintain a constant and steady supply of nutrients and oxygen despite changes in cerebral perfusion pressure. CO2 plays a fundamental role in the regulation of cerebral blood flow. The belief is that changes in PaCO2 drive changes in the pH of the cerebral spinal fluid, causing relaxation or contraction of the smooth muscle. As PaCO2 levels rise, cerebral blood vessels dilate, and as PaCO2 levels drop, cerebral blood vessels constrict.

Hypercapnia commonly causes respiratory acidosis. CO2 combines with H20 to form H2CO3, which dissociates into H+ and HCO3-. This buffer equation is in constant flux. Giving patients with hypercapnia supplemental bicarbonate will worsen their condition if not adequately ventilating. The supplemental bicarbonate will push the acid/base buffer equation towards increased CO2 production; however, if the patientâ€™s ventilation is inadequate, the equation will move back towards more H+ production, worsening the acidosis. With respiratory acidosis, the kidneys try to compensate by increasing H+ secretion, raising the HCO3- concentration, assuming the patient has adequate kidney function. In acute respiratory acidosis, the serum HCO3- increases 1 mEq/L for every 10 mmHg elevation in PaCO2. If PaCO2 remains elevated for three to five days despite compensatory mechanisms, it is considered chronic respiratory acidosis. In this state, the serum HCO3- increases from 3.5 to 5 mEq/L for every 10 mmHg elevation in PaCO2.

There is a hypothesis that in certain circumstances, high levels of PaCO2 can be protective; this refers to a mechanical ventilation strategy called permissive hypercapnia, in which hypercapnia is tolerated to achieve other goals while on the mechanical ventilator. This strategy is useful in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), COPD, and asthma. The ventilator strategy in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) involves the use of low tidal volumes. It is believed low tidal volumes lessen the risk of alveolar overdistention, decreasing the risk of further lung injury.

Oxygen induced hypercapnia can develop in some patients with COPD. Formerly, the belief was that these patients depended on a hypoxemic respiratory drive due to a blunted sensitivity to CO2. According to this previous theory, when giving supplemental oxygen to COPD patients, they would develop hypercapnia due to a loss of their hypoxemic respiratory drive with a resultant decrease in alveolar ventilation. However, recent studies support that oxygen-induced hypercapnia in select COPD patients is due to mechanisms such as increased dead space, Haldane effect, and decreased minute ventilation.
