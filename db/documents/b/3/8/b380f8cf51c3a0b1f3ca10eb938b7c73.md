Blood is a necessary component of the human body, and the loss of this fluid may be life-threatening. Blood is generated via hematopoiesis and ultimately becomes the delivery method for oxygen to the tissues and cells. The human body protects against loss of blood through the clotting mechanism. Vascular mechanisms, platelets, coagulation factors, prostaglandins, enzymes, and proteins are the contributors to the clotting mechanism which act together to form clots and stop a loss of blood. Through vasoconstriction, adhesion, activation, and aggregation, the contributors form a transient plug to act as the cork to the leaking blood flow. Soon after, fibrin, the functioning form of fibrinogen, stabilizes this weak platelet plug. The scope of this article will highlight the physiological aspects of the clotting mechanism.
