The lateral circumflex femoral artery primarily supplies the vastus lateralis. The lateral circumflex femoral artery has three main branches: ascending, transverse, and descending. The muscle also receives someÂ blood supply from perforating arteries of the deep artery of the thigh, also known as the profunda femoris. The perforating arteries pierce the lateral intermuscular septum to gain access to the anterior compartment of the thigh. The parent artery arises from the lateral or posterior side of the femoral artery in the femoral triangle.

Venous drainage of the VL is achieved through the perforating veins of the deep femoral vein, the lateral femoral circumflex vein, and other unnamed veins from the superficial venous circulation. Larger named veins in the area that assist with drainage are named akin to the corresponding artery.
