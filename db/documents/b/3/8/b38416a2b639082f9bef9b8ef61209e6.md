Acute nickel toxicity should be considered when a patient presents with any neurologic, pulmonary, or cardiac symptoms combined with known exposure. As most toxicity is due to industrial exposure, an occupational history is exceptionally important to obtain. Symptoms can include headache, vertigo, dyspnea, and chest pain. Initial symptoms can appear mild. However, delayed symptoms can get progressively more severe, causing altered mental status and a need for ventilation support. A nickel carbonyl exposure air concentration of 50 mg/m3 will produce the abovementioned symptoms.

If ingestion is the route, symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Ingestion of 0.5 to 2.5 g could produce such symptomatology.

Chronic exposure can lead to rhinitis, bronchitis, and asthma. Increased incidents of nasal and pulmonary cancer have been reported.

Persistent exposure is also seen with contact dermatitis. The rash is typically localized to the point of nickel contact and is often described as erythematous papules with a pruritic association. Recent piercing and jewelry changes would be essential to note.
