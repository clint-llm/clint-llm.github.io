The focus of education is routinely the education of family members or surrogate decision-makers. Early summarization of events leading to the current presentation and the likelihood of survival with good neurologic outcome and prognosis is essential. Because of involuntary reflexes that may appear as crying, facial grimacing, or other expressions of suffering, an explanation of the lack of consciousness and suffering in a coma can provide relief. Discussion of prognosis early, with reinforcement and updates regarding clinical findings, can significantly aid surrogate decision-makers in considering goals of care and re-evaluating whether the current care regimen is consistent with the patientâ€™s values and goals.
