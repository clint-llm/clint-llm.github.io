In Hirschsprung disease, there is a disruption of the migration process and differentiation of neural crest cells at the level of the enteric nervous system, which is under the control of the RET gene and its ligands. This disturbance causes a total absence of GC in the nerve plexuses. It leads to the overactivity of the intestine with the persistent release of acetylcholine. Subsequently, there is a continuous contraction of the narrowed (affected) colonic segment and progressive secondary dilatation of the healthy proximal colon.

HD transmission is complex, involving multigenic inheritance. Its penetrance is weak, variable, and sex-dependent. The main gene involved is the proto-oncogene RET found in about 35% of sporadic cases and 49% of familial cases.
