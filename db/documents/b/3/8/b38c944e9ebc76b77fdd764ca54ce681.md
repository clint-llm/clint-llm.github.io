Diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis is clinical, based on obtaining a good history and physical examination. A positive nickel contact history with physical exam findings consistent with a nickel allergy dermatitis should allow for the formulation of the diagnosis. Laboratory and radiographic testing are not typically required and generally offer little to the workup. The need for additional workup should be determined on a case-by-case basis and is likely to occur in conjunction with an immunologist or dermatologist. Patch testing can help confirm suspected cases and identify additional allergens.
