There are 31 spinal nerve pairs (mixed) that arise from the intervertebral foramen on both sides of the vertebral column.

- 8 Cervical nerves - C1 - C7 nerves arising from above corresponding cervical vertebra except for C8, which exits from between C7 and T1 Vertebrae

- 12 Thoracic nerves

- 5 Lumbar nerves

- 5 Sacral nerves

- 1 Coccygeal segment

Nerves from the lower spinal segment exit terminal to the conus medullaris and form the cauda equina.

Ventral spinal nerve roots - make up the motor component of the spinal innervation with rootlets arising from the anterior horn of the spinal segment, sending motor impulses to muscles and joints, etc.

Dorsal spinal nerve roots - make up the sensory component, with the dorsal ganglia sending sensory impulses via nerve rootlets to the posterior horn of spinal segments.
