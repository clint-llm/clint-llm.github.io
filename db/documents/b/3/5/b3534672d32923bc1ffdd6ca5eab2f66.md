Vestibular nuclei interconnect via commissural projections with their homologous and non-homologous vestibular nuclei; this allows for the comparison of activity on both sides.

- **LVN**- The LVN receives input from the vestibulocerebellum and all parts of the vestibular apparatus. Fibers from the vestibulocerebellum, also known as the flocculonodular lobe, convey information about head tilt and gravity.

- **MVN**- The MVN primarily receives afferent fibers from the lateral semicircular canals. Ascending fibers leave the MVN and cross the midline via the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF). They then innervate the contralateral paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) and contralateral motor nuclei of the extraocular muscles (CN III, IV, and VI). This pathway mediates the VOR, which is important for clear vision during vertical and rotational movements.

- **SVN**- The SVN receives afferent information from the superior and posterior semicircular canals. Efferent fibers from the SVN combine with fibers from the DVN to travel to the fastigial nuclei within the flocculonodular lobe of the cerebellum. The flocculonodular lobe is involved in balance maintenance and is necessary for adaptation to reflexive eye movements. The SVN also sends fibers to the nuclei of the thalamus.

- **DVN**- The DVN receives afferent fibers from otolith organs (the utricle and saccule) of the inner ear. The DVN has projections to the other three vestibular nuclei and the cerebellum.
