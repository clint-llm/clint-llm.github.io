The toxicity of estrogenÂ is dose-dependent. If a patient takes too much estrogen, the potential toxicity lies in the organs it affects. In high doses, estrogen therapy can potentially cause severe effects, including excessive vaginal bleeding, fluid retention, and mental status changes. In a study analyzing the effects of estrogen therapy in surgically-induced postmenopausal mice, the results suggested that estrogen taken in high doses is associated with harmful effects on the heart but negatively impacted renal function.
