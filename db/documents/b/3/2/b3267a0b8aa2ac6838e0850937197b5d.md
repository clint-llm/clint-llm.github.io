Laryngeal cartilages begin to develop in the fourth week of embryogenesis. A 2018 study on fourteen human embryos has provided a new description of the embryology of the hyoid-larynx complex, which is distinct from traditional and textbook descriptions based on comparative embryology. The thyroid and cricoid cartilages arise from mesenchymal condensations in the neck regions, and not from fourth or sixth pharyngeal arch cartilages as previously described.
