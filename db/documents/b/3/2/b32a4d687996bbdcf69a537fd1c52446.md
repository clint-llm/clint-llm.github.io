CFRD shares several similarities with diabetes mellitus type 1 and type 2, however, it has fundamentally different pathophysiology, and it is crucial to recognize the differences for proper diagnosis and management. CFRD differentiates itself from type 1 diabetes by its gradual onset over the years, rather than weeks to months. Individuals with CFRD will maintain some degree of insulin function compared to individuals with type 1 diabetes. Ketoacidosis, a common finding in type I diabetes, is uncommon in CFRD due to the residual insulin production present. The destruction of beta cells seen in CFRD is not related to autoimmune disease, and individuals with CFRD generally test negative for diabetes autoantibodies. Insulin resistance seen in CFRD is generally transient due to acute illness or steroid therapies compared to the insulin resistance seen in type 2 diabetes, which is longstanding and is present even in the baseline state of health.
