A urethral stricture is a narrowing of the urethra, causing obstructive symptoms. They usually result from injury to the urethral mucosa and tissues around it. It can develop anywhere along the length of the male urethra and can be due to many etiologies.

The male urethra extends from the external urethral meatus at the tip of the glans penis to the bladder neck proximally. It is contained within the corpus spongiosum, which lies in a groove below the two corpora cavernosa. The inside of the urethra is lined with stratified squamous epithelium. The urethra isÂ divided into anterior (from the external urethral meatus to the distal membranous urethra) and posterior (from the distal membranous urethra to bladder neck) parts. However, the World Health Organization conference in 2002 recommended that this nomenclature should be discarded. According to the new nomenclature, the urethra is broken up into seven segments; the urethral meatus, followed by fossa navicularis, penile, bulbar, membranous, and prostatic urethra, and finally, the bladder neck.
