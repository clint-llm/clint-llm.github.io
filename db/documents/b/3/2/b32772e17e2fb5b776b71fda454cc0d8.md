In SHPT, the disorder of phosphocalcic metabolism will affect the different systems of the body and manifests by specific clinical signs. Primarily bone, and then soft tissues are affected. Skin can also be affected.

In SHPT, bone remodeling and mineralization are affected.

Extraosseous manifestations are also seen. Calcifications affect the arterial walls, viscera, periarticular tissue, cutaneous tissue, and the eye (cornea and conjunctiva). They are thus responsible for muscle weakness, red-eye syndrome, and intense pruritus.

Calciphylaxis can be seen as ulceration of the skin, resulting from arterial obstruction, with cutaneous necrosis of the extremities.

Other manifestations in SHPT include psychological and neurological problems, as well as malnutrition.
