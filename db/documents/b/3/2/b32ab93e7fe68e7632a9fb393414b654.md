The median survival of patients with VIPoma is 96 months

As per recent National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, the post-resection follow-up includes history and physical examination, multiphasic CT or MRI and serum VIP level in the initial 3 to 12 month period. After one year, it is recommended to follow the same measures every 6 to 12 months.
