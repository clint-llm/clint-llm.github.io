Athletes with piriformis syndrome may return to activities when they can demonstrate the pain-free range of motion, increased strength of the affected side, and performance without any discomfort. Patients must stretch and warm-up before the activity. The time to return to exercise or sporting events depends on the severity of symptoms and the type of treatment undertaken. In general, the longer one does not seek medical care or physical therapy, the longer is the course of rehabilitation.

Patients with piriformis syndrome should adhere to the following:

- Avoid prolonged sitting

- Stretch exercises 2 to 3 times a day and before participating in sports

- The patient should be educated on a continual basis. Patients should be told about the importance of maintaining compliance if they want a positive outcome.

- In most cases, recurrent pain can be prevented by performing stretching exercises for at least 5 to 10 minutes prior to full participation and avoiding risk factors like prolonged seating.
