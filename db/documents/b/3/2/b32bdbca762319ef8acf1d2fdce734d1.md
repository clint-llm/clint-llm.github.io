The teres minor, a muscle of the upper limb, arises from the myotome of the paraxial mesoderm (somites). The upper limb bud appears at about four weeks and lies opposite somites C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, T1, and T2. During week 5, the myotomes migrate into the limb bud and form two condensations: one posterior and one anterior. The posterior condensation gives rise to all intrinsic shoulder muscles, including the teres minor. The muscle groups are well-established by eight weeks.
