Patients with Goodpasture syndrome will initially present similarly to other forms of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with acute renal failure. There are no symptoms specific to the anti-glomerular basement membrane that distinguish it from other diseases causing similar organ dysfunction. Careful and expedient workup must be undertaken for an accurate diagnosis. The pulmonary symptoms are typically present at the time of the initial encounter or shortly after that. Hemoptysis of varying degrees is typical for pulmonary involvement, ranging from serious and life-threatening bleeding to more subtle diffuse hemorrhage that is only apparent on more careful evaluation. It is more typical for younger patients affected by the anti-glomerular basement membrane disease to present with simultaneous renal and pulmonary symptoms (Goodpasture syndrome) and to be critically ill on presentation. Patients over 50 years old tend to present with glomerulonephritis alone and follow a less severe course.

Careful physical examination of patients presenting with findings suspicious for the anti-glomerular basement membrane disease should be done, particularly for other signs such as a purpuric rash. This finding may suggest so-called “double-positive” patients with concurrent ANCA-associated vasculitis (granulomatosis with polyangiitis). Other physical exam findings to look for in Goodpasture syndrome are:

- Increased respiratory rate

- Basilar inspiratory crackles

- Cyanosis

- Hepatosplenomegaly

- Hypertension (in 20% of cases)

- Edema
