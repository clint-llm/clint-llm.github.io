Pectoral implants are performed for several reasons, including to treat a congenital or acquired chest wall asymmetry or to enhance the appearance of the chest. The Trans-axillary approach is the most common method utilized for the insertion of pectoral implants. The main indications include a small pectoralis major muscle due to lack of exercise, congenital absence of all or part of the pectoralis muscle, or deformity due to an existing injury. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of an underdeveloped male chest and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.
