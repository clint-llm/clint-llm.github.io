The diagnosis of CPA tumors is made based on history, physical examination, audiometric and radiological evaluation. Magnetic resonance image (MRI) is the gold standard for the diagnosis of CPA tumors. High-resolution computed tomography (CT) is useful for the assessment of bony involvement. Vestibular schwannoma appears isodense on CT, hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2 MRI.

When trying to differentiate meningioma from vestibular schwannomas, more advanced MRI data information such as MR spectroscopy metabolite peaks and perfusion ratios are necessary. Also, better information on more specific features such as ice-cream-cone shape, adjacent hyperostosis, presence of calcification, a dural tail that might be extended into any skull base foramina should help final diagnosis.
