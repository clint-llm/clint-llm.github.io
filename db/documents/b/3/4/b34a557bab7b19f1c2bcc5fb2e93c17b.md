The refraction process aims to correct any ametropia present in the eye. The amount of ametropia in the eye is significantly determined by the dioptric power of the cornea and the crystalline. While the power of the cornea is fixed, the power of the crystalline lens varies with accommodation, resulting in fluctuating amounts of ametropia. This can prolong the refraction process and lead to asthenopic symptoms if the ametropia is not adequately corrected.

It is also important to note that at several points during the refraction process, the eye is exposed to different stimuli for accommodation, including the retinoscope light, the occluder, and the testing prisms. This necessitates the fogging, carried out at the latter stages of the refraction process during binocular balancing.

Headaches can be caused by uncorrected hypermetropic patients, especially if not diagnosed, and the patient without corrective lenses does not complain of decreased vision.
