Working through the differential of schizoaffective disorder is often a daunting task, and many clinicians continue to have trouble making the diagnosis.

- Observe the criteria for each diagnosis carefully.

- Do not "fill in blanks" with preconceived notions about the patient's history. Take what the patient tells you and what family/collateral information tells you when working through a differential.

- Time frames often give clues towards one specific diagnosis. Symptom course also plays a role; did mood symptoms or psychotic symptoms come first? For how long did the symptoms last? History-taking is an essential skill necessary for all clinicians; it is even more imperative in psychiatry.

- Criterion B of schizoaffective disorder is key for the following reasons. One must tease out a 2 week or longer period of just psychotic symptoms in the patient's history. If one finds that the patient has always had mood symptoms during their entire illness, the diagnosis by definition is not a schizoaffective disorder.
