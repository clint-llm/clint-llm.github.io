Lasers for hair reduction include the following:

- **Ruby Laser**(694 nm) - Red light is delivered through synthetic ruby crystals, more effective for lighter skin types with dark hair (skin types I-III*)

- **Alexandrite Laser**(755 nm) - Greater penetrance, good for lighter hair (skin types I-III)

- **Diode Laser**(810 nm) - Penetrates deeper, delivers better fluence, less epidermal damage, safer in darker skin (skin types I-V)

- **Neodymium-doped Yttrium-Aluminium-Garnet (Nd: YAG) Laser**(1064 nm) - Better penetration, less epidermal damage, relatively less melanin absorption (skin types I-VI)

- **Intense Pulse Light (IPL) or Broadband Light (BBL)**(500-1200 nm) - High-intensity pulses of polychromatic, non-coherent light are delivered by a flash-lamp; various filters allow the narrowing of the emitted wavelength band, can be used on darker skin, larger areas can be covered due to its larger spot size, less expensive than a true laser but not as effective

*** Fitzpatrick Skin Types**

- I- Pale white skin, blue/green eyes, blond/red hair; always burns, does not tan

- II- Fair skin, blue eyes; burns easily, tans poorly

- III- Darker white skin; tans after the initial burn

- IV- Light brown skin; burns minimally, tans easily

- V- Brown skin; rarely burns, tans darkly easily

- VI- Dark brown or black skin; never burns, always tans darkly
