Any vascular lesion or disease involving the central somatosensory system carrying pain (either slow or fast fibers) can cause these symptoms. Although an ischemic event precedes most central post-stroke pain, the pain can also happen after a hemorrhagic stroke, which can be either intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Intracerebral hemorrhage can precede central post-stroke pain in the legs because of the pattern of arrangement of fibers to face, arm, trunk, and leg is mediolateral, in the ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus. The central post-stroke pain occurs more frequently in those with acute stroke and larger lesions, but no characteristic finding on computed tomography (CT) brain scan of the patients with central post-stroke pain is identified. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of patients with this syndrome has shown infarctions, while single-photon emission computed tomography shows decreased blood flow, especially to the left thalamus.
