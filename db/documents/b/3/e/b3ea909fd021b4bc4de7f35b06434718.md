The mainstay of treatment focuses on immunosuppression and cytotoxic therapy. Both of these are obviously contraindicated in patients with severe infection and underline the importance of arriving at a clear diagnosis prior to initiation. The landmark HLH-94 protocol was first developed and tested in an international collaborative study that enrolled and gathered data from 113 children.

The HLH-2004 protocol enrolled patients with both primary and secondary HLH and changed the previous protocol slightly by adding cyclosporine to the initial therapy cocktail as well as adding intrathecal steroids to IT-MTX for those with underlying neurologic dysfunction. Study analysis demonstrated no improvement in outcomes with the addition of upfront cyclosporine or intrathecal steroid therapy.

In both regimens, conditioning prior to BMT is achieved with reduced-intensity conditioning, such as fludarabine/busulfan.
