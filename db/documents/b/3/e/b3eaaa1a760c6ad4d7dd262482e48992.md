Pediatric elbow dislocations have many similarities to adult elbow dislocations. However, in children, medial epicondyle fractures may occur. Up to 60% of medial epicondyle fractures are associated with elbow dislocations in children. Importantly, the medial epicondyle is the last ossification center in the distal humerus to fuse, anywhere from 15Â to 20 years old. The medial epicondyle serves as the common flexor origin and the origin of the inferior aspect of the medial collateral ligament, leaving it vulnerable to avulsion injuries. It also lays anterior to the ulnar nerve.
