Paraneoplastic syndromes are rare disorders with complex systemic clinical manifestations from an occult malignancy causing an altered immune system. In other words, malignant cells do not directly manifest symptoms of metastasis. Instead, they generate autoantibodies, cytokines, hormones, or peptides that affect multiple organ systems such as neurological, dermatological, gastrointestinal, endocrine, hematologic, and cardiovascular systems.
