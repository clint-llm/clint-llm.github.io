Alkaptonuria is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with a prevalence of 1 in 100,000 to 250,000 in the general population. However, higher prevalence rates can be found in certain populations and demographics due to founder effects. In Slovakia, where prevalence reaches 1 in 19,000, most alkaptonuria pedigrees can be traced back to a specific Kysuce region in the Carpathian mountains where isolated immigrant communities settled.

Similarly, populations identified in the Dominican Republic, where the prevalence of the disease is also unusually high, have been attributed to a single founder mutation C120W. This particular mutation is closely tied to the Dominican population and has only been identified outside of the country in a Dominican individual living in the United States.

Consanguinity, which can be considered a version of the founder effect that is even more genetically isolated, has been observed to be associated with a higher prevalence of alkaptonuria ever since the earliest discussions of the disease. Although specific statistics of alkaptonuria prevalence in consanguineous populations have not been well studied, consanguineous mating has been expected to contribute to the presence of alkaptonuria in Arab populations.
