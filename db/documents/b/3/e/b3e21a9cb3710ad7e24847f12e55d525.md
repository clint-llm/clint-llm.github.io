There is no evidence to suggest that immunotherapy will be effective if a specific IgE antibody is negative.

The use of concomitant B-blockers is contraindicated with immunotherapy in the rare chance that the patient needs epinephrine to treat anaphylaxis.

If a patient is having an asthma exacerbation, they should not receive an immunotherapy injection
