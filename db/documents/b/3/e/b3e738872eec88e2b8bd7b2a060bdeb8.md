For diuretics in general,Â toxic doses are not well established. Chronic use is the most common cause of toxicity, such as hypotension and increased hematocrit due to plasma volume depletion and syncope. Hypokalemia, hyponatremia and reduced renal function, and increased mortality have been reported with the use of metolazone.

There is no antidote to metolazone. Supportive measures should be instituted as soon as possible to maintain hydration, electrolyte balance, respiration, and cardiovascular and renal function. Due to its high plasma protein binding, it is not removed by dialysis.
