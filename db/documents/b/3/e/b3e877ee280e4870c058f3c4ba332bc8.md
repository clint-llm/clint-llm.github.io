Since quinapril has been available on the market, it has been an effective medication for treating hypertension and chronic heart failure. Key points to remember are that 1) average systolic blood pressure change is approximately 13 mm Hg while average diastolic blood pressure change is approximately 10 mm Hg with maximum effect at 5 hours, and 2) patients require close monitoring for adverse effects like hyperkalemia, renal dysfunction, and angioedema.

Clinicians should determine the dose of quinapril based on the patient's clinical diagnosis and other medical conditions. Nurses need to monitor vitals and verify the dose before administering it to the patients. Pharmacists need to perform medication reconciliation and counsel patients for the safe use of medicine. The prescribing, administering, and monitoring of quinapril requires the coordinated effort of an interprofessional healthcare team comprised of clinicians, specialists, mid-level providers, nurses, and pharmacists, all communicating openly and coordinating activity to drive optimal patient outcomes.
