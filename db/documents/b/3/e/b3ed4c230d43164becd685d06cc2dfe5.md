Lifelong premature ejaculation has no definitive cure. However, management of the condition can be successful via a multimodal combination treatment approach in the majority of cases.

Acquired premature ejaculation can often be corrected by treating the underlying cause. For example, if a man has erectile dysfunction and ejaculates prematurely to compensate for his inability to maintain an erection, treating the erectile dysfunction may also eliminate his premature ejaculation. At the very least, it will reduce performance anxiety and lead to a more successful outcome.

In many cases, pharmacological therapy must be continued indefinitely, as discontinuation may lead to the recurrence of premature ejaculation.

Success rates after treatment vary from 30% to 70%, but relapses are common, and some men need lifelong therapy.

Premature ejaculation takes an enormous toll on male self-esteem, often leading to serious marital difficulties, divorce, and depression.
