Management requires determining what provokes the eruption and then attempting to minimize this, while at the same time gradually increasing exposure to induce hardening.

Explain that UV-A is a large component of sunlight and can cause the light eruption without sunburn (as sunburn is mainly due to UV-B). UV-A, unlike UV-B, can penetrate window glass and is less well blocked by sunscreens. When in situations that are likely to provoke the rash, cover up as much as possible with densely woven clothing. Select broad-spectrum, water-resistant semi-opaque sun protection factor (SPF) 50+ sunscreens and apply before exposure and every two hours on skin that is not covered.

Low-dose narrowband UV-B and other forms of phototherapy undertaken in late winter or early skin can reduce the incidence and severity of polymorphous light eruption. The course is 2 to 3 treatments per week for 4 to 6 weeks each year.

There is some evidence to support prophylactic short courses of oral steroids (for example, to prevent the eruption during a holiday break), hydroxychloroquine, and antioxidants such as Polypodium leucotomes extract, lycopene, beta-carotene, nicotinamide and astaxanthin.

The eruption is treated with topical corticosteroids with some benefit in reducing symptoms and duration.
