Estimates are that more than a million people in the United States have HIV infection. Once diagnosed with HIV infection, immediate initiation of antiretroviral treatment is the recommended course to delay the disease progression from HIV infection to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the infected patient. This approach requires an interprofessional team effort.

Adherence to the treatment plan is equally crucial to prevent HIV transmission to others by reducing viral load.

Recently, research has shown that a single-tablet regimen improved pharmaceutical adherence over multi-tablet regimens.

In summary, interprofessional healthcare teams can enhance HIV treatment outcomes in various ways, especially by improving drug adherence through education, careful monitoring, and consideration of the patient's needs and lifestyle. [Level 5]
