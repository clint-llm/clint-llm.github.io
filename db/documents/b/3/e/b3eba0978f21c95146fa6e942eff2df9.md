Glycogenic hepatopathy (GH) is a rare or possibly under-diagnosed complication seen in children and young adults with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus and few patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is characterized by a reversible accumulation of excess glycogen in hepatocytes, causing hepatomegaly and transient elevation of liver enzymes, especially transaminases. This activity describes the evaluation and management of glycogenic hepatopathy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of glycogenic hepatopathy.
- Review the differential diagnosis of glycogenic hepatopathy.
- Summarize the investigations to diagnose glycogenic hepatopathy.
- Identify interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with glycogenic hepatopathy.
