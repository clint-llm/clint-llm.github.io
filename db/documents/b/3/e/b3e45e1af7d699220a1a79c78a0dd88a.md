The etiology of reentry is diverse and includes:

- Electrolyte abnormalities and channelopathies form a substrate for reentry arrhythmias.

- A mechanical force such as the chest thump maneuver induces but also terminates reentry.

- Chronic cardiac stretch leads to remodeling and fibrosis that changes electrical properties of the myocardiocytes.

- Scar tissue following infarction is the basis of anatomical reentry.

- Congenital heart disease and surgery performed to treat it can cause reentry.

- Genetic culprits are related reentry tachycardias. Roberts et al. identified genetic culprits SCN5A and LMNA as a cause of idiopathic bundle branch reentry ventricular tachycardia.

The connection between congenital heart disease and reentry is of particular research interest and requires further attention. Congenital heart disease itself or scars following surgical repair poses a substrate for reentry circuits.

Muscular bridges crossing the fibrous atrioventricular skeleton can cause the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome in Ebstein patients.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia has characteristic fibrofatty atrophy of the right ventricular myocardium and accompanying ventricular arrhythmias. Ellison et al. described clustering of reentry circuits sites in areas like the right ventricular outflow tract and the tricuspid annulus that are affected by fibrotic changes.
