1. Due to excessively high plasma levels of phytanic acid and with added high levels of VLCFA, di- & tri-hydroxycholestanoic acid, and pipecolic acid in IRD, if left untreated or if the patient is poorly complaint, phytanic acid accumulates in myelin sheaths, adipose tissue liver, and kidneys where damage may result in following complications:

- Cardiomyopathy

- Arrhythmia

- The progressive loss of vision

- Cataracts

- Lower limb neuropathy

- Ataxia

- Acidouria

- Diabetic Mellitus

- Hypertension

- Muscular atrophy

- Renal atrophy

- Progressive hearing loss

- Atheroma

2. The exact mechanism has not been clarified yet. However, it is thought that under a molecular distortion hypothesis, that phytanic acid and other metabolites penetrate and disrupt the structural integrity of the retinal cell membrane, cardiac Purkinje cells, ciliary ganglion cells, oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells, osteoblasts and insulin receptors leading to various symptoms and long term manifestations of Refsum disease.

3. Structural similarities between phytanic acid and vitamin A and E have also been implicated for the ocular complications.

4. A calcium driven apoptotic damage is implicated for cardiac and neuropathic disorders such as arrhythmias, peripheral neuropathies, hearing and vision loss, and ataxia.
