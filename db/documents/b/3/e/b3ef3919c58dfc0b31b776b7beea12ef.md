Research shows that even when manufacturers set dose estimation guidelines, it seems to have little impact on what dose clinicians prescribe. Another overlooked aspect of the ED50, of which clinicians and pharmacists may be unaware, is the patient by patient variation in the ED50 depending on their weight, height, fat content, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics.

ED50 for medications and the recommended dosages based on clinical studies derive from surrogate endpoints (e.g., blood pressure after taking medication) rather than the long-term effects the drug has on the body.

Clinical studies have shown that regarding the ED50, many deem mortality to be too small of an endpoint and uncommon to be of particular interest for a medication. However, on a grand scheme in a large patient population, medications that may have substantial clinical benefits may also lead to severe consequences and death. An example of this is digoxin, which has had efficacy in heart failure and atrial fibrillation, but at commonly used dosages caused a net increase in mortality.
