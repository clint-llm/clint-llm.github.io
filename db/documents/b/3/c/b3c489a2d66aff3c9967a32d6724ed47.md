Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease is believed to be caused by an imbalance between the production of pyrophosphate and the levels of pyrophosphatases in diseased cartilage. As pyrophosphate deposits in the synovium and adjacent tissues, it combines with calcium to form CPP.

Several comorbidities have correlations with CPPD. In a number of studies, hyperparathyroidism presented the highest positive association with CPPD, followed by gout, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and hemochromatosis. Other comorbidities associated with it include osteoporosis, hypomagnesemia, chronic kidney disease, and calcium supplementation.

Deposition of calcium pyrophosphate is believed to cause activation of the immune system producing inflammation and further soft tissue injury.
