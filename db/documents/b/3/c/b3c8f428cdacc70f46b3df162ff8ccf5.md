Patients with diabetes receive more frequent ophthalmic evaluations than the average person; usually, patients with diabetes should get eye exams every year. In certain instances, this may be more or less frequent). Diabetic macular edema is diagnosed stereoscopically, and the macula appears thicker with diabetic macular edema when compared to eyes not impacted by DME. The Early Treatment Retinopathy Study (ERDRS) has defined DME as a thickening of the retina or the presence of hard exudates within 1 disc diameter from the center of the macula, and this is the most commonly used definition. There are various patterns of thickening, including focal, multifocal, and diffuse areas. DME is deemed medically significant if it is associated with any of the following: thickening within 500 mm of the center of the macula,  the presence of hard exudates within 500 mm of the center of the macular if associated with thickening of the adjacent retinal tissue, or zones of retinal thickening 1 disk area of which part of which is within 1 disk diameter of the macular center. It is important to note that only of these features must be present in order for diabetic macular edema to be deemed as clinically significant, although it is not uncommon for several of these features to be present.
