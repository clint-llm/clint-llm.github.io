The RCRI, currently used today, utilizes six independent variables with known associations with increased perioperative risk. Even if it exhaustively evaluates a wide range of factors, other factors are not included. For instance, it is known that several other conditions, such as atrial fibrillation or morbid obesity, may increase a patient's risk of perioperative risk of cardiac complications.

The Gupta MICA calculator has several limitations. While the RCRI has been validated through multiple studies over the past 15 years, including an extensive systematic review that found moderate discrimination in predicting major perioperative cardiac complications,

Other RCRI-derived indices have undergone development to overcome most of these limits. Among the procedure-specific risk evaluation tools there is the Thoracic Revised Cardiac Index (ThRCRI). This index has potential use in thoracic surgery to guide the indication of the interventions. In particular, it allows differentiating subjects who may proceed to surgery (classes A or B) from those who should undergo a further cardiac evaluation (classes C or D).

A step forward in assessing cardiovascular risk is certainly the possibility of linking preoperative factors with intraoperative conditions. This strategy is only apparently more complex. Among the proposed attempts, there is the ANESCARDIOCAT score.
