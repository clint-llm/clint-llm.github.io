Disorders of the lower leg are not uncommon in children. Pigeon intoeing is commonly seen in clinical practice and is best managed by an interprofessional team that include orthopedic nurses. Pigeon intoeing may appear unsightly but clinicians should be aware that most cases resolve as the child gets older. A majority of cases are managed primarily by observation with emphasis placed on parental reassurance. Metatarsus adductus is expected to resolve by 2 years of age, and any persistence is not associated to have any symptomatology. Rigid and severe metatarsus adductus with no flexibility should be referred for possible serial casting. Premature surgery can cause more harm than good.
