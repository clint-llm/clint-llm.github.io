Based on severity, initial evaluation for burns follows advanced trauma life support (ATLS) protocol. One should perform primary and secondary surveys.

- In the primary survey, assess the ABCs: (airway, breathing circulation, disability, and exposure);

- Maintain the airway with cervical spine protection: ensure a patent airway;

- Breathing and ventilation: Is the patient breathing? Evaluate for injuries that can severely impair ventilation such as tension pneumothorax;

- Circulation and hemorrhage control: Is there a palpable pulse? Assess the level of consciousness, skin color, and other signs of perfusion. Identify the source of bleeding, if present, and control the bleeding;

- Disability (neurologic evaluation): Are there associated disabilities? This assessment should also include a quick neurologic evaluation to establish a level of consciousness, pupillary size and reaction, lateralizing signs, and level of spinal cord injury (if present);

- Exposure with environmental control: Is the patient completely examined for a thorough assessment? Cover the patient to avoid hypothermia;

- Secondary evaluation of burns should assess for extent, depth, and circumferential wounds;

- In first degree burns, patients present without associated airway symptoms, and a thorough history and detailed examination should be performed; and

- Estimate and record the size and depth of the burn.
