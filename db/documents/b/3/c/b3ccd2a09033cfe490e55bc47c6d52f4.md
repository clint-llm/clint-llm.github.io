The pathoanatomy underlying TS is relatively nonspecific.  The proposed pathologic cascade entails nonspecific inflammation targeting the synovial joint lining causing hypertrophic changes.  Typically one or multiple aforementioned risk factors can be elicited from the clinical history upon presentation.  The acute inflammatory phase clinically manifests as a pain that is self-limiting and resolves within 24 to 48 hours.  The natural history favors a complete resolution of symptoms within 1 to 2 weeks, although recurrence rates can be as high as 20%
