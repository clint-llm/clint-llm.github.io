Patients present with moderate to severe daytime sleepiness. The typical patient with narcolepsy will begin experiencing symptoms in either their mid-teens or mid-thirties with a progressive increase of symptoms. The average time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis is about 15 years.

Cataplexy is a sudden, often bilateral muscle weakness lasting a few seconds to a couple of minutes in response to increased emotion (typically laughter) during which patients remain conscious. Cataplexy can also be brought on by excitement, anger, grief, or any intense emotion. It is pathognomonic for the disorder if it is present but is not required for the diagnosis of narcolepsy type 2. Sleep paralysis occurs when waking from sleep when patients can hear what is happening around them but are unable to open their eyes or move. They often describe a sensation of suffocating due to the paralysis of the intercostal muscles despite the diaphragm continuing to function normally. It can be associated with narcolepsy but also occurs at least once in up to 50% of the normal population.

Hypnagogic hallucinations are visual, auditory, or tactile dream-like experiences that occur as patients are falling asleep or just waking up. They can typically see human faces or experience a feeling like someone else is in the room. Additionally, these patients have significantly fragmented nighttime sleep. Unlike some other disorders with excessive daytime sleepiness, patients with narcolepsy typically find naps to be refreshing. It is also essential to do a complete physical exam to rule out other possible causes of hypersomnia.

A common feature of narcolepsy is obesity, which also increases the risk of sleep apnea.

In children, the clinical features of narcolepsy may also include motor overactivity and restlessness. Inattentiveness is often a major complaint by the parent/teacher. Others may present with drop attacks, aggression, irritability, and falls. These children are often falsely labeled as having seizures.

**DSM V criteria**

In order to make a diagnosis of narcolepsy, the individual must have symptoms occurring at least three times a week over the past 3 months. In addition, one of the following must be present:

- Hypocretin deficiency

- Episodes of cataplexy occurring at least several times a month

- REM sleep latency of fewer than 15 minutes or two or more sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMPs) and a mean sleep latency of fewer than 8 minutes.
