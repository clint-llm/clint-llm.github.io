If the patient is asymptomatic and the finding of concretions is incidental, it is best not to perform any procedures. Most concretions remain asymptomatic and do not need a specific treatment.

If the patient is symptomatic, the specific concretions may be removed.

Method of removal: Proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5% drops are instilled, and the lid is everted to expose the palpebral conjunctival surface. Applying the anesthetic via a Q-tip soaked with the anesthetic on the concretion is useful in achieving better local anesthesia. The concretions mayÂ either be removed using a 26G or 30G needle with bevel away from tarsus and just nudging the concretion at one end and lifting it from the conjunctiva. Fine-tipped forceps may also be used. Mild oozing is common and is easily controllable with simple local pressure. A topical antibiotic drop or ointment is administered. If there has been a breakdown of the corneal surface, a few days of antibiotic drops or ointment are prescribed.
