Megaloblastic anemia is not rare, but data are insufficient regarding its prevalence. Moreover, there is a variation amongst different populations, which may be dependent on universal supplementation of folate in dietary products, frequency of chronic illnesses, such as pernicious anemia and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, and cultural/personal dietary practices.Â In a 2016 study from the Netherlands, evaluating more than 3000 patients with anemia, only 7.5% of the cases displayed macrocytic anemia. Approximately 1.4% of all the cases were due to vitamin B12 deficiency and 0.5% were due to folate deficiency. When compared to the macrocytic anemia subgroup, this translated to 18% and 6% prevalence for B12 deficiency and folate deficiency, respectively.

The incidence of folate deficiency is low, especially in countries with universal supplementation of folate in dietary products. A 2015 report from Canada, reported a prevalence of 0.16% for folate deficiency in hospitalized patients, with alcohol use disorder, malabsorption syndromes, and decreased oral intake due to mental health diagnoses as the identified causes.
