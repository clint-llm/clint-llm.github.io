- Left-sided heart failure: Left ventricular systolic and diastolic heart failure are well-known causes of peripheral edema, right upper quadrant pain from hepatic congestion, and syncope due to arrhythmias or insufficient cardiac output. Exertional chest pain may also occur. Left-sided heart failure and PH can be distinguished via echocardiography and/or right and left heart catheterization.

- Coronary artery disease: Myocardial ischemia is the most common cause of exertional chest pain, and it also can cause ischemia-induced arrhythmias with exertional syncope. Coronary artery disease is identified by stress testing and/or left heart catheterization.

- Budd-Chiari syndrome: Budd-Chiari syndrome refers to thrombosis of the hepatic veins and/or the intrahepatic or suprahepatic inferior vena cava. It causes peripheral edema due to venous outflow obstruction and right upper quadrant pain due to hepatic congestion. The syndrome can be identified by Doppler ultrasonography, CT, MRI, or venography.

- Liver disease: Acute and chronic liver diseases cause peripheral edema, and the former can also cause right upper quadrant pain. Liver disease can be detected by liver function testing and right upper quadrant ultrasound. Liver biopsy is the gold standard, but it is seldom necessary.
