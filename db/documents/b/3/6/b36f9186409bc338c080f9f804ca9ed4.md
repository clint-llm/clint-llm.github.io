Complications of MOE can occur due to the invasion of the surrounding structures and cranial nerve involvement. Most commonly, the facial nerve is affected; however, glossopharyngeal, vagus, accessory, or hypoglossal nerve can also be involved.

Skull base osteomyelitis arises when the disease spreads to reach the sphenoid, occiput, and clivus, rather than being confined to the temporal bone.

Intracranial involvement might also happen to range from confusional state to severe complications such as meningitis, thrombosis, or death.
