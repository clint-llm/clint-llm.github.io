Complications of shigella infection include intestinal and systemic complications listed below.

Intestinal Complications:

- Colon perforation- Very rare and primarily occurs in infants and malnourished patients.  It is associated with S. flexneri and S. dysenteriae 1.

- Intestinal obstruction-usually seen in severe disease and S. dysenteriae 1.

- Toxic megacolon-Usually occurs in S. dysenteriae 1 infection.

- Proctitis or rectal prolapse-Invasion of shigella organisms into colonic mucosa can lead to rectal prolapse and proctitis in infants and young children.

Systemic Complications:

- Bacteremia-Common in young children under the age of 5.

- Hemolytic-uremic syndrome-Although uncommon, HUS is the most frequent acute kidney injury in young children and infants.

- Moderate to severe hypovolemia

- Hyponatremia-Usually associated with S. dysenteriae 1 infection.

- Leukemoid reaction-Common in children between ages 2-10 years old.

- Neurologic symptoms-Generalized seizures are the most common neurologic complication. This is usually associated with a higher mortality rate.

- Reactive arthritis or Reiter syndrome-Uncommon sterile inflammatory arthritis. It is usually caused by S. flexneri infection. Arthritis can occur alone or in conjunction with conjunctivitis and urethritis.

- Vulvovaginitis with or without diarrhea-Seen in young girls associated with painless vaginal discharge.

- Keratitis-Rare but should be considered in a young child with keratitis and a history of recent diarrheal illness.

- Acute myocarditis-Seen in children with S. Sonnei infection.
