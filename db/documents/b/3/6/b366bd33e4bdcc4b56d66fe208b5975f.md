The AV node and the bundle of His comprise the AV junction. The AV node plays a gatekeeper role delaying the signal between the atria and the ventricles; this prevents premature contractions of the ventricle that has not filled. It also can function in a protective role in becoming the dominant pacemaker of the heart in times of SA node failure. The bundle of His conducts the signal from the AV node to the left and right bundles to the Purkinje cells of the ventricles.
