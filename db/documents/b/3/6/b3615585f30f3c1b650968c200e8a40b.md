Since the advent of ART, HIV has altered from a progressive and fatal disease to a chronic condition. Consequently, the prevalence of HIV-associated complications is also increasing. Even though the literature lacks precise data, in around 10 to 15% of HIV-infected patients, neurological symptoms are clinically prevalent; however, pathological evidence of neuropathy can be seen in almost all patients with advanced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

HIV-associated neuropathies are seen frequently in the adult population, and not many cases have been noted in children—also, the odds of recovery decrease as age increases. Advancing age, obesity (high BMI), diabetes, and major depressive disorders are proposed to be other risk factors for the development of neuropathies in HIV patients.
