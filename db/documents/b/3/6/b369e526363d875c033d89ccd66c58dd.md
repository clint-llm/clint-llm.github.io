Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is a value that can be set up in patients receiving invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, complications, and other key elements of the use of PEEP in the clinical setting as relates to the essential points needed by members of an interprofessional team managing the care of patients requiring assisted ventilation.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the different uses of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).
- Summarize the possible complications of the use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).
- Explain how to manage positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) related complications in mechanically ventilated patients.
- Outline the importance of interprofessional management and reporting of complications related to the use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).
