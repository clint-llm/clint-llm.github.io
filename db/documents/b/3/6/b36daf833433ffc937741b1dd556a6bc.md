During postoperative care, the examiner should watch out for postoperative complications such as infection, visual, or central nervous system (CNS) symptoms. The patient's head should be elevated to reduce the edema, and cool compresses can be placed over the closed eyelid to reduce pain and swelling. The patient's visual acuity ad pupillary function should be periodically assessed; if any changes are noticed, the surgeon should be immediately notified.
