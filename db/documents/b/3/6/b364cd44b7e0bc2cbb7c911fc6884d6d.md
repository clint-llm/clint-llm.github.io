Management of choledocholithiasis requires a multidisciplinary approach and, therefore, requires the expertise of many medical specialists. The gastroenterologist and endoscopist, along with a general and/or laparoscopic surgeon, play the key role. Interventional radiology services are required both for diagnosis and treatment. Infectious disease specialists are consulted for the choice of the right antibiotics in patients with cholangitis. Pharmacy services play a key role in determining the appropriate doses of medications, including antibiotics, especially in patients with significant other comorbidities.
