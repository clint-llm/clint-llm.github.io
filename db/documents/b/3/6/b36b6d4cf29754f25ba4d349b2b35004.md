Biliary stenting refers to the insertion of stents which are tubes made of plastic or metal to relieve obstruction in the biliary tree or to treat biliary leaks. It can be used to relieve obstruction for both benign and malignant conditions of the biliary tract, while also being used for palliative treatment of advanced malignancies of the biliary tract. This activity describes the types, indications, contraindications, and treatment protocols of biliary stenting and highlights the importance of the interprofessional team in decreasing morbidity and mortality of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
