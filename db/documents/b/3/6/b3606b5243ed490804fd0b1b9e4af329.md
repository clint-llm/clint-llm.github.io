Nalbuphine is available in 10 mg/ml and 20 mg/ml injectable solutions. Nalbuphine is not available in oral form secondary to poor oral bioavailability.

**Adult Dosing**

A typical recommended dose is 10 mg for a 70 kg individual. The administration is subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intravenous; this dose may be repeated every 3 to 6 hours as necessary. The recommended single maximum dose is 20mg in an opioid, nontolerant individual with a maximum daily dose of 160mg. In opioid-dependent patients, the dose should be reduced by 25%, and the patient should be observed for signs of opioid withdrawal. In patients who are not opioid-tolerant, withdrawal symptoms have not been seen from other opioid medications that have been given in the same acute setting as nalbuphine. The potency of nalbuphine is comparable to morphine on a mg-to-mg basis.

**Pediatric Dosing**

Less than one year: safety and efficacy not established.

Greater than one year: 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously every 3 to 4 hours as needed. The maximum single dose is 20 mg. Maximum daily dose 160 mg.

Renal impairment: use caution, may require a reduced dose.

Hepatic impairment: use caution, may require a reduced dose.
