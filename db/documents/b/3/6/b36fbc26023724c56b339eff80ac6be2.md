Knowledge of laboratoryÂ methods involved with urine drug testing help to facilitate test result interpretation. Drug testing is often a two-step process: screening and confirmation. Screening tests via biological samples are usually first administered for speculative testing. In some settings, a confirmative test is unnecessary if the patient confirms test findings. However, a definitive or confirmatory test is required if the patient contradicts speculative test results.

Clear guidelines should be developed regarding confirming positive test results using a more sensitive and specific laboratory method, particularly for situations where definitive punitive action will be taken based on the result. In clinical settings where treatment may be based upon unconfirmed results, staff using the data should be educated concerning the limitations of the testing. For example, in emergency clinical toxicology, for overdose cases, decisions will often be based on preliminary testing that has a turnaround time of one hour or less. Sometimes treatments are administered for diagnostic purposes without preliminary testing, e.g., in suspected opioid overdoses, naloxone will be given for diagnostic purposes, without waiting for the result of testing.
