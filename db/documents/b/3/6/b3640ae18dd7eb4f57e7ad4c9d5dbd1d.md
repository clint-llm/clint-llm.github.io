Data on the long-term outcome of Rolando fractures in the scientific literature are limited. In the series by Langhoff et al., out of 17 Rolando fractures, 82% required surgery. Among fractures treated surgically, 11 were treated by open reduction while three by percutaneous K-wire fixation. The quality of the radiologically evaluated reduction was excellent in 45.4% of patients treated with open surgery, and in none of the cases treated percutaneously. However, in a follow-up study on 16 of these patients at a median distance of 5.8 years, the quality of the obtained reduction was not related to the presence of symptoms or the onset of osteoarthritis, both accounting for 37%.
