Hematopoietic pluripotent stem cells have self-renewal capability and give rise to either myeloid or the lymphoid lineage which further differentiates into various mature blood cells such as red blood cells (RBC), lymphocytes, granulocytes, megakaryocytes, and macrophages. The hematopoietic process is determined by the bone marrow environment, growth factors, and transcription factors. The abnormal proliferation of one or more terminal myeloid cell lines in the peripheral blood gives rise to a heterogeneous group of disorders called myeloproliferative neoplasms. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are four classic types of myeloproliferative neoplasms. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of myeloproliferative neoplasms and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with these conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of myeloproliferative neoplasms.
- Describe how to evaluate for myeloproliferative neoplasms.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for myeloproliferative neoplasms.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance care and improve outcomes for patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms.
