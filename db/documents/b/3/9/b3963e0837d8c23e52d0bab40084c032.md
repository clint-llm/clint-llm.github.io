It is important to reiterate that many forms of PPK, including certain types of PPKP, are harbingers or cutaneous markers of serious underlying morbidity. However, AKE is a benign form of PPKP, with no associated medical condition. Discounting the fact of poor response to treatments and indefinite persistence of lesions, the overall prognosis of the condition is excellent.
