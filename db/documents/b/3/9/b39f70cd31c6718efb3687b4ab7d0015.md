Tracheal cancer may arise from the epithelial cells, mesenchymal structure, or salivary glands. It is malignant in 90% of cases in adults, while only 10 to 30% of cases are malignant in children.

Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of primary tracheal carcinoma, followed by adenoid cystic carcinoma. Other types include mucoepidermoid, small cell carcinoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, sarcomas, fibroma, pleiomorphic adenoma, and other much rarer forms. Squamous cell carcinoma presents with lung and mediastinal metastases in one-third of cases at the time of diagnosis; these lesions may be exophytic or ulcerative. These tumors are characterized by a well-differentiated appearance and keratinization. Several variants were described in 2005 in the WHO classification, including acantholytic carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, basaloid variant, papillary carcinoma, spindle-cell carcinoma, and verrucous variant.

In contrast, adenoid cystic carcinomas usually grow slowly over several years.
