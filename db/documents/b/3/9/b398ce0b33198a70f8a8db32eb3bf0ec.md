During many shoulder surgeries, nerve blocks are used to decrease pain during the first 24 hours of surgery, which improves patient satisfaction, and decreases the need for opioid pain relief. These nerve blocks are often conducted under ultrasound guidance and are delivered onto the brachial plexus immediately as they exit the anterior and middle scalene muscles in the neck. There are many more cervical blocks utilized in surgery, discussed elsewhere in specific articles in StatPearls.

Most spinal accessory nerve damage occurs via iatrogenic causes including neck dissection surgery or excisional biopsies of cervical lymph nodes, due to its close location to the cervical lymphatics; this will result in loss of function to the trapezius muscle and the sternocleidomastoid muscle.

It is also important to consider the location of the superior laryngeal nerve and the recurrent laryngeal nerve during surgery on the neck, especially of the thyroid, where both nerves must be identified and preserved. Injuring the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve would cause paralysis of the cricothyroid muscle, resulting in an alteration in sound pitch, or dysphonia. If the recurrent laryngeal nerve suffers damage, the result would be paralysis of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles, except for the cricothyroid muscle, causing vocal cord paralysis.
