Patients who complain of double vision need a detailed squint evaluation. Clear history regarding onset, duration, progression, diurnal variation, and prior episode of trauma/ fever/ association with underlying systemic disease needs to be explored. An interprofessional collaborative approach involving orthoptists, optometrists, ophthalmologists, and physicians is required. A strabismologist or neuro-ophthalmologist opinion should be sought whenever needed.

Some of these patients might have underlying uncontrolled diabetes or hypertension, which needs urgent intervention and be life-threatening to the patient. Interprofessional coordination between physicians, orthoptists, nurses, and ophthalmologists, including squint or neuro-ophthalmologists, ensures better management and helps the patient make better decisions. Once underlying causes have been ruled out, dispensing Fresnel prismsÂ requires coordination between strabismologist and orthoptists.
