The prognosis of patients with seizures depends mostly on any underlying cause. Patients with seizures from remedial medical or toxicologic causes should do well with the management of those issues.

In other patients with acute symptomatic seizures, the prognosis is related to the disease process.  Obviously, as a group, patients with neoplastic causes of seizures or hypoxic brain injury will not fare well compared to many patients with metabolic causes of seizures.

The prognosis of a patient with a single unprovoked seizure has been well delineated. Unprovoked seizures, by definition, have no established cause after clinical evaluation. If basic investigations, including appropriate laboratory work, imaging, and perhaps EEG, are unremarkable, estimates of the recurrence rate of another unprovoked seizure within five years are between one-third and one-half. However, if there is a second or third unprovoked seizure, the risk of further seizures increases to about three-quarters.
