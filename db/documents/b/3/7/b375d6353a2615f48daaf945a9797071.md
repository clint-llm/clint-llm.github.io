Contraindications to chemexfoliation include

- History of an allergic reaction to a peeling agent

- Ongoing infection, open lacerations or wounds in the area of the peel

- Recent isotretinoin use in the last 6 months (particularly relevant to medium and deep peels)

- Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding

- Patients with psoriasis, connective tissue diseases, atopic dermatitis, exposure to radiation therapy, or who had recent facial surgery are generally not candidates for chemical peeling.

- Special considerations are also necessary for patients with a known propensity for keloid formation or poor wound healing with uncontrolled diabetes or immunosuppression, as well as patients classified as Fitzpatrick III-VI as they may be prone to aberrant pigmentation or dyschromasia (see Preparation section below)
