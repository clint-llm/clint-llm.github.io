At-risk patients may need to understand the possible presentation of subarachnoid hemorrhage; patients who have had subarachnoid hemorrhage often report they experienced the "worst headache I ever had." Other symptoms that require immediate attention include:

- Sudden facial, arm, or leg weakness or numbness, particularly unilaterally

- Sudden onset confusion or difficulties with speaking or understanding others

- Sudden loss of coordination or ability to walk or stand; difficulty maintaining balance

- Sudden excruciating headache with no apparent cause

The postoperative ICU period following subarachnoid hemorrhage is associated with significant morbidity and mortality risk. Patient expectations must be based on identified prognostic indicators for poor outcomes and educating the patient regarding optimal hemodynamic monitoring.
