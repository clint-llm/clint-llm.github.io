The etiology for this condition varies and can be categorized into congenital or acquired. Acquired vesicovaginal fistula can be further divided into obstetric surgical, malignant, radiation, and miscellaneous categories. Congenital vesicovaginal fistula is very rare and typically associated with other urogenital malformations. Vesicovaginal fistula occurs most commonly after obstetrical and gynecological injury. In the developed world, the most common cause of vesicovaginal fistula is gynecological surgery. In North America, bladder injury during a hysterectomy is the most common cause. In developing countries, obstructed labor and the resulting pressure necrosis is the most common cause of vesicovaginal fistulas. Poor socioeconomic status, malnourishment, low literacy rate, early marriage and childbearing, and inadequate obstetrical care are important risk factors for developing a vesicovaginal fistula in the developing world.

Miscellaneous acquired causes of this condition include retroperitoneal, vascular or pelvic surgery, urologic or gynecologic instrumentation, infectious and inflammatory diseases, sexual trauma, vaginal laser procedures, external violence, and vaginal foreign bodies.
