Plastic surgeons primarily insert breast implants, but the follow up may be by the nurse practitioner or primary physician. When patients seek a breast implant, the primary care providers should have some knowledge about the implants.

Implants come in varying profiles of the same volume, which changes the shape and base width with each profile. Implants are selected based on anatomic measurements taken during consultation while accounting for the volume you desire. Patients should be informed of the benefits and risks of the different cohesivities, fillers, styles, shapes, and surfaces of the implants and make a choice that is best for them. As for what brand surgeons use, it truly is personal preference, often guided by the service provided by the manufacturer or the surgeon's experiences. The outcomes for most patients who undergo implants are good to excellent.

Plastic surgery nurses are involved in patient education and follow up, informing the interprofessional team of important changes in patient status. [Level 5]
