Hypercalcemia, when it occurs following a benign disorder, has a good prognosis but when the cause is secondary to a malignancy the prognosis is poor. Patients with hypercalcemia associated with malignancy are often symptomatic and need frequent hospitalizations. When hypercalcemia is due to ectopic production of PTH related protein, most patients are dead within a few months. The osteolytic metastatic lesions cause fractures, nerve compression, and paralysis.
