Treatment of spider nevi is dependant on the cause of intra-arteriolar vasodilation. Patients with an underlying systemic disease like cirrhosis should be managed as the standard of care. However, when spider nevi are present, these patients may already have advanced liver disease.

Rarely, fine-needle electrocautery, 585 nm pulsed, dye laser, 532 nm KTP (potassium-titanyl-phosphate) laser, or electro desiccation have been used to clear spider angioma for cosmetic concerns. The results of the procedure are generally good except for the small risk of the scar. Spider angiomas can recur after treatment. Spider nevi in healthy individuals usually disappear in a few years, in pregnancy following childbirth and those related to oral contraceptive pills after discontinuation of medication. Cirrhotic patients note the disappearance of nevi following liver transplantation.
