Most cases of Addison disease are iatrogenic and caused by long-term administration of glucocorticoids, which suppress the feedback mechanisms. This suppression can be so severe that during a stress period, the brain and adrenal gland may not be able to respond adequately. Alternatively, if the exogenous glucocorticoids are discontinued without a taper, the patient may have an adrenal crisis.

The most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency relates to autoimmune damage to the adrenal cortex. Other insults to the adrenal gland that lead to primary insufficiency include adrenal hemorrhage, cancer, infections (HIV, syphilis, TB, bacterial), and certain drugs such as etomidate, ketoconazole, fluconazole, metyrapone. Phenytoin and rifampin increase the metabolism of cortisol and can, therefore, precipitate adrenal insufficiency in those predisposed.

Adrenal hemorrhage can occur in patients on anticoagulation medications or a bleeding diathesis, or in the postoperative setting.

Primary adrenal insufficiency can also be congenital. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia has been extensively studied and described in the literature. Panhypopituitarism and many genetic conditions can cause adrenal insufficiency. Pituitary hemorrhage or infarction (Sheehan syndrome) can cause secondary adrenal insufficiency.
