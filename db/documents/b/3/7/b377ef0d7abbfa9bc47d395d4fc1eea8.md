**Intravenous Vancomycin Injection**

Common adverse effects of intravenous vancomycin injection include nephrotoxicity, hypotension, and hypersensitivity reactions.

Vancomycin flushing syndrome (VFS), previously known as redman syndrome, is an infusion-related reaction associated with rapid intravenous infusion of vancomycin. Symptoms include flushing, pruritus, and an erythematous rash on the face, neck, and upper torso. Signs of VFS often appear 4 to 10 minutes after starting or shortly after completing an infusion. The incidence of VFS varies between 3.7 and 47% in patients. However, there is a direct correlation between the increased incidence of VFS with faster rates of vancomycin administration. Rapid infusion of vancomycin can lead to angioedema and hypotension, which accompany VFS. Reports show that the most severe forms of this reaction frequently occur in children and patients younger than age 40. Initially, the infusion can be held. Therefore, prolonging the infusion time is the primary management strategy used to mitigate VFS. Nevertheless, premedication with antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine or hydroxyzine, can be useful in preventing the occurrence of VFS.

Less common adverse effects include local phlebitis, chills, drug fever, skin rash, eosinophilia, and reversible neutropenia. In rare situations, patients have reported DRESS syndrome (drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms), ototoxicity, thrombocytopenia, vasculitis, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

**Oral Vancomycin**

Gastrointestinal adverse effects, such as abdominal pain and nausea, are commonly seen with oral vancomycin. In addition, dysgeusia or distorted sense of taste is a common adverse effect unique to vancomycin oral solution. Patients should seek medical attention if these adverse effects are severe and bothersome. Note that many of these adverse effects are temporary.

Less common adverse effects of oral vancomycin include peripheral edema, fatigue, headache, diarrhea, flatulence, vomiting, back pain, urinary tract infection, and fever. Reports exist of rare cases of increased serum creatinine, VFS, interstitial nephritis, nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, thrombocytopenia, and vasculitis using oral vancomycin.
