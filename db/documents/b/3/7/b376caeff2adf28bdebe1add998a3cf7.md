Antenatally, maternal ultrasound is the mainstay of evaluation. Findings such as a distended bladder are indicative but not diagnostic of posterior urethral valves. A diagnosis of posterior urethral valves has been correlated with antenatal dilated bladder with increased wall thickness, but not in cases diagnosed postnatally. A keyhole sign suggests obstructive uropathy, of which the most common cause is posterior urethral valves. However, they found this to be more commonly associated with urethral atresia than posterior urethral valves and was not shown to be significantly predictive of posterior urethral valves.

A neurogenic bladder has a keyhole appearance on ultrasound due to the hypotonic neck.****Serial scans are essential not only for antenatal diagnosis but for evidence of poor prognostic markers such as low levels of amniotic fluid and evidence of renal dysplasia. Fetal urinary electrolytes and β-2 microglobulin are the most accurate measure of fetal renal function. Physiologically fetal urine should be hypotonic with osmolality less than 210 mEq/L. Raised osmolality and a β-2 microglobulin greater than 4 mg/L are indicative of irreversible renal dysfunction.

Postnatally, investigations can be divided into blood tests, imaging modalities, and urodynamic studies. In the 48h following birth, the neonate's serum biochemistry is primarily determined by the mother's levels, so blood must be taken after this period. Testing serum creatinine, urea, and nitrogen is critical to ascertain the neonate's degree of renal dysfunction. Blood gas testing is of value if the child is unwell to determine if the patient has a metabolic acidosis.

**Imaging modalities**

**Renal and Bladder Ultrasonography**

- The signs postnatally are similar to those described for antenatal diagnosis. Repeat ultrasound after the first week may be needed as oliguria can be physiological in this period. Ultrasound, through the perineal approach, may show a dilated posterior urethra and valve leaflet.

**Voiding Cystourethrography (VCUG)**

- The gold standard imaging modality for the diagnosis of posterior urethral valves.

- The patient is catheterized, and a contrast agent (sodium and meglumine diatrizoate) is injected into the bladder, fluoroscopy is then used to observe voiding and to identify reflux.

- Features suggestive of posterior urethral valves include a thickened trabeculated bladder, elongated and dilated posterior urethra, circumferential filling defect at the level of the pelvic floor; and a prominent bladder neck and vesicoureteric reflux in many infants.

**Renal Scintigraphy**

- Functional imaging of the kidneys is often not performed until the end of the neonatal period to allow the development of the kidneys.

- This can be subdivided into static and dynamic imaging.

- Dynamic studies such as DTPA or MAG 3 renogram use a tracer that is taken up by the kidney and excreted in the urine. As the excretion of MAG 3 is approximately twice that of DTPA, it is the method of choice in most cases.

- This allows for the estimation of differential renal function, the function of one kidney relative to the contralateral kidney. Static imaging such as DMSA can demonstrate differential renal function as well as focal parenchymal defects as it is extracted in the proximal tubules and remains in these cells.

**Urodynamic Studies**

- It is used to describe bladder storage and emptying, which can be disordered in patients with posterior urethral valves.

- Urodynamics are particularly valuable following valve ablation.

- In Cystometry, the bladder is filled, and the rate recorded, the pressure within the bladder is then measured. This data is plotted on a cystometrogram. The pattern of this can reveal abnormalities, including hyper-reflex contraction or hypocontractile bladder and muscular disorders of the bladder, such as detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia.

- Bladder compliance and post-void residual volume can also be investigated. Poor compliance is associated with persistent hydronephrosis.
