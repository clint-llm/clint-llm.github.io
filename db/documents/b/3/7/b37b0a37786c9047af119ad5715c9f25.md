NETs are relatively rare tumors. But the incidence of intestinal NETS is on the rise due to increased detection of these tumors on routine imaging for other purposes. Small intestinal carcinoids are mostly located in the ileal region which is 60 cm from the ileocecal valve. Colonic NETs are usually detected in elderly patients and are commonly located on the right side, particularly the cecum. Commonly, rectal carcinoids are incidentally discovered on imaging.

Colorectal NETs are more frequent in the Asia/Pacific region than in Europe
