Occupations requiring repetitive actions, heavy lifting, or prolonged awkward positioning increase the risk of developing WMSDs. Some of the most at-risk occupations include drivers, maintenance and construction, agriculture, and healthcare workers.

**Surgeons**

Surgeons are often subjected to long hours standing, awkward positioning, and repetitive use of UE instruments, increasing their risk of postural fatigue and repetitive use injuries. Below are ergonomic accommodations that can be completed by surgical staff to reduce the risk of developing WMSDs:

- Maintain a neutral spine position with the muscles relaxed while taking brief moments every 10 or 15 minutes to be aware of body alignment while making the appropriate adjustments to reduce discomfort. To minimize the stress on joints, grip surgical instruments with a light hold, alternate hands when completing easier, repetitive tasks or evenly apply pressure when squeezing bottles using all the fingers instead of just the thumb/index finger.

- Head and neck position (as close to neutral with no more than 15 degrees flexion recommended, with monitoring the use of loupes and headlights as the extra weight tends to exacerbate cervical flexion).

- Position monitors 1 meter in front of surgeon and declination of 0 to 15 degrees.

- Adjust table position to allow elbows at 90 to 120 degrees to ensure proper alignment of the back. Additionally, adjust and readjust the patient pre and intraoperatively to maximize ergonomic positioning and alignment.

- Incorporating stretching routines, including full routines pre/post-op or intraoperative "micro-breaks," have been shown to reduce pain while not increasing operative time.

- Ensure the chair has adequate spinal support for those utilizing chair and foot pedals. Position foot pedals approximately hip-distance apart, at the same height with even distribution of pressure in both feet. Place chair at a comfortable height with knees bent close to or slightly less than a 90-degree angle.

- If utilizing a microscope, use ocular extenders to prevent leaning forward. Take periodic breaks (every 10 to 15 minutes) from using the microscope and from focusing on a target at a distance when looking away from the microscope. To reduce stress on joints, utilize both hands when adjusting the microscope.

Laparoscopic approaches have been employed as a minimally invasive method to complete common procedures. Benefits of laparoscopic surgery include reduced postoperative recovery times and postoperative infection rates.

**Nurses**

Nurses have a high prevalence of WMSDs, with operating room nurses having a higher prevalence. Nurses in the operating room are subjected to the same ergonomic risk factors as surgeons, with additional issues arising with those nurses caring for patients requiring increased patient handling (often at an unmatched weight proportionate to the nurse completing the transfers). Studies have also noted nurses have an added layer of psychosocial risk factors regarding WMSDs due to lack of control and autonomy in their tasks, which has been cited as a risk factor for WMSDs.

In addition to the surgical ergonomic suggestions for those applicable, nurses can reduce their risk of injury by implementing the following ergonomic tactics:

- Utilizing proper supportive footwear and antifatigue mats and use of stockings to reduce edema and promote blood flow.

- Utilizing proper transfer ergonomics, including use of lifting equipment when appropriate, gait belt use, multi-team transfers, and use of drawsheets, sliding boards, or air-assisted transfer mattresses.

**Therapists**

In addition to nurses, therapists are also often in the role of patient handling, positioning, and transferring, with the same ergonomic principles previously listed for nurses applicable to their field as well. In addition to this, physical therapists are noted to have increased risk for WMSDs due to providing manual therapy to patients, placing increased workload on the providers' upper extremities (particularly wrists/hands).

- Providing proper staffing allows for distributing workload and utilizing support staff as needed.

- Modification of treatment plan to include alternative treatments and utilizing equipment to reduce manual contact required to achieve therapeutic benefit.

- Ensuring practitioners have access to means to promote physical fitness within themselves as a preventative measure.

**Dentists**

- Ensuring proper placement of adjustable light and instrument table.

- Opting for the most ergonomic tools (those that are adequate in diameter curved, and with knurling or grooves allow for the best friction with the least amount of force).

- Opting for automatic instruments compared to manual to decrease the force applied to hands and wrists.

- Avoid using retractable and coiled hoses as the tension when the hose is stretched is transported to the wrist and arm.

- Considering positioning the patient horizontally.

- Emphasis on correct seated posture (especially utilizing hip tilt when completing seated forward bending as often required to maintain lordotic curvature).

Though everyone will have different ergonomic requirements based on their stature, job requirements, and equipment use, basic principles of ergonomics common across many fields are essential for clinicians to know to better educate their patients as a treatment and preventative measure for WMSDs. The basic principles that follow can help to reduce the rate of WMSDs across all occupations:

- Decreasing weight handled when lifting through team lifts, use of equipment, or portioning the load into smaller/lighter containers.

- When lifting, ensure the object being lifted is as close as possible to the body (ideally between the knees), maintain an erect back posture, and squat.

- Maximizing time allowed for lifting heavy objects and rotating heavy tasks.

- Allowing for frequent rest breaks.

- Seated positions that provide adequate support for the spine, upper, and lower extremities, including proper lumbar support, maintaining wrist angle of less than 10 degrees extension, and angling screens between 10 degrees and 30 degrees).

- Using properly fitting instruments (dependent on hand size and preferred hand use), utilizing power tools as opposed to manual where appropriate, and ensuring proper size and texture of handle to maximize grip strength (50-75mm diameter often recommended made from a smooth and compressible gripping surface).

- Use of antifatigue mats, properly fitting and supportive shoes, and compression stockings to promote proper blood flow.

- Ensuring properly fitting gloves to avoid increasing risk for carpal tunnel syndrome.
