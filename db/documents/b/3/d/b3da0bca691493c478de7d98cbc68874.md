The blood supply to the medulla can divide into two groups, which are the paramedian bulbar and lateral bulbar arteries. The paramedian bulbar arteries arise from the vertebral arteries and supply the medial aspect of the medulla. At the most caudal part of the medulla, the paramedian bulbar arteries can also arise from the anterior spinal artery. The lateral bulbar branches arise from the vertebral artery or the posterior inferior cerebellar artery and supply the lateral part of the medulla.
