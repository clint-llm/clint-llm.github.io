**Relative Contraindications**

Relative contraindications for placement of tunneled CVCs on the chest wall include neoplasm, burn and/or trauma, and patients with cystic fibrosis requiring chest physical therapy. In these patients, a subcutaneous port may be placed on the upper arm (although this is associated with a greater risk of thrombosis),

Thrombosis can be considered a relative contraindication. If aÂ CVC exists within a thrombosed vein, infused thrombolytics and/or interventional radiological procedures can be performed to break up and remove the clot.

**Absolute Contraindications**

Severe, uncorrectable coagulopathies, uncontrolled sepsis, and/or bacteremia are absolute contraindications to the placement of all tunneled CVCs. In these patients, a temporary, non-tunneled catheter should be placed until the coagulopathy can be corrected or the infection clears. If a patient has a tunneled catheter and later develops sepsis secondary to bacteremia, the recommendation is to remove the CVC.
