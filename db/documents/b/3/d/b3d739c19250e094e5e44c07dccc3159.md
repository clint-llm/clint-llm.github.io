There are generally only minimal direct male complications related to Sertoli cell-only syndrome or maturational arrest other than infertility and the possibility of passing on heritable male factor infertility genes to any potential male offspring. Obtaining a testis biopsy has a small risk of infection, bleeding, or a testis rupture, but these are relatively rare and easily managed. The biggest complication may be emotional and psychological to the individuals and couples affected by a devastating infertility diagnosis with a relatively low success rate even with optimal assisted reproductive technology.
