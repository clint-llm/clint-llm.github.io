Symptomatic patients who are very ill and unable to undergo an open surgical procedure may be candidates for carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS).Â  The stent, a small, flexible, mesh-like tube is inserted into the artery under local anesthesia. The tube is then expanded over a balloon to expand the lumen of the artery and improve blood flow. A multi-institutional study, the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trials (CREST), demonstrated CEA and CAS yield similar outcomes in terms of postoperative complications such as restenosis, myocardial infarction, long-term stroke, and/or death. However, the risk of peri-procedural stroke was significantly higher in patients undergoing CAS, while the overall risk of myocardial infarction was significantly higher in CEA

While not an absolute contraindication, patients with a history of radiation therapy to the neck are at higher risk of developing temporary cranial nerve injury during CEA, and also at increased risk of late cerebrovascular events and restenosis following CAS. CEA is more technically challenging in the radiated neck because these patients tend to have more diffuse plaques, as well as adhesions, scar tissue, and wound complications as a result of radiation.

Symptomatic women may be at increased risk of postoperative complications after CEA when compared to men, while outcomes and complications remain similar among the sexes for asymptomatic patients.
