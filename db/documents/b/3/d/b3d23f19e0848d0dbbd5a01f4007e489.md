The accommodation reflex is the visual response for focusing on near objects. It also has the name of the accommodation-convergence reflex or the near reflex.**convergence**of both eyes, contraction of the ciliary muscle resulting in a change of lens shape (**accommodation**), and**pupillary constriction**. Coordination of these three events changes the power of the eye, allowing the point of focus of the eye change from a distant object to a nearby object or vice versa.
