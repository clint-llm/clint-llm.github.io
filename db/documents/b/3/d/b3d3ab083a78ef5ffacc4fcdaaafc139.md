Galloway-Mowat syndrome (GMS)

Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS) is characterized by male pseudo-hermaphroditism, Wilms tumor, and early-onset nephrotic syndrome that progress rapidly to end-stage renal disease.

Frasier syndrome (FS) is characterized by progressive glomerulopathy, male pseudo-hermaphroditism, and gonadoblastomas. Proteinuria is usually detected between 2 and 6 years of age. The disease has a slower progression to end-stage renal disease than DDS. Renal biopsy shows FSGS.

Pierson's syndrome is characterized by congenital nephrotic syndrome/diffuse mesangial sclerosis, microcoria (small pupils), impairments of vision, and muscular hypotonia. Children with Pierson syndrome usually die from renal failure within days or weeks after birth.

Nail-patella syndrome is characterized by dysplastic or absent finger- and toenails, small or absent patellar, and kidney involvement ranging from mild proteinuria to end-stage renal failure.

Galloway Mowat syndrome (GMS) is characterized by microcephaly with various central nervous system anomalies and early-onset nephrotic syndrome.

Infectious causes of congenital nephrotic syndrome are congenital syphilis, toxoplasmosis, or viral infections as cytomegalovirus. The prognosis is good.

Congenital syphilis causes congenital nephrotic syndrome commonly in developing countries. Congenital syphilis presents with fever, anemia, persistent rhinitis, hepatitis, hepatosplenomegaly, neurosyphilis, desquamations, and erythematous patches with superficial bullae. Renal involvement varies from microscopic hematuria to nephrotic syndrome. The nephrotic syndrome usually appears between 2 and 3 months. Membranous nephropathy is a common finding in renal biopsy. The immune system is involved in the pathogenesis, as evidenced by immune deposits in the region of the glomerular basement membrane. Prognosis is good as antimicrobial therapy. Usually, penicillin is curative.

Congenital toxoplasmosis is a rare cause of nephrotic syndrome. It is usually caused by intrauterine toxoplasmosis infection in the mother. Congenital toxoplasmosis is associated with massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, anasarca, and positive IgM serum antibody for toxoplasmosis.  In congenital nephrotic syndrome caused by toxoplasmosis, diffuse mild increase in mesangial cells and extensive glomerulosclerosis is a common finding in renal biopsy.

In western countries, cytomegalovirus infection is one of the common causes of congenital infections. Incidence varies between 0.15% and 2%. Cytomegalovirus infection presents with anemia, thrombocytopenia, pulmonary infection, and congenital nephrotic syndrome. Diagnosis is confirmed by the detection of viral DNA by quantitative PCR assay. Diffuse mesangial sclerosis (DMS) is often seen on histological examination on renal biopsy. Tubular cells and glomeruli may show cytomegalic inclusion bodies.

Non-genetic causes of congenital nephrotic syndrome are neonatal alloimmunization, renal vein thrombosis, maternal systemic lupus erythematosus, and mercury poisoning.

Neonatal alloimmunization Mother has mutations in the metallomembrane endopeptidase gene, which encodes the podocyte protein neutral endopeptidase (NEP). Pathogenesis involves the absence of the neutral endopeptidase (NEP) in the mother that induces an alloimmunization process against the NEP of fetal cells. Pregnant mothers with a deficiency of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) produce anti–neutral endopeptidase (NEP) antibodies resulting in fetal podocyte insult and nephron loss.
