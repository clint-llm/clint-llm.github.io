Initially, kidney biopsy specimens examined through light microscopy may be normal. As the disease progresses, non-specific findings may appear. These include focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and the presence of lymphocytes and plasma cells. Immunofluorescence studies yield negative results. Electron microscopy of the kidney reveals longitudinal splitting and multi-lamellation of the GBM lamina densa.

As the alpha-5 chain of type 4 collagen is also expressed in the epidermis, a skin biopsy can be used to establish a diagnosis. Immunofluorescence studies on skin biopsy specimens are often diagnostic. Patients with XLAS may also display abnormalities of alpha-2 collagen expression in the skin.
