In the United States, death due to cervical cancer has declined by more than 60% since the 1950s. Once one of the most frequent cancers affecting women of childbearing age, it now ranks 14th. In 2010, approximately 12,000 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer, with about 4000 resulting in death. From 2002 through 2012, the rate of cervical cancer decreased by 1.3%, and deaths from cervical cancer decreased by 0.9%. In 2014, Hispanic women were reported to have the highest rate of getting cervical cancer, while African-American women had the highest death rate from the disease.

Cervical cancer is much more common in countries without widespread screening programs. More than 80% of cervical cancer cases are found in developing countries. Cervical cancer is still the third most common cause of cancer in women worldwide. Annually, there are approximately 528,000 new cases of cervical cancer, with 266,000 deaths. These statistics make it the second most common cause of cancer-related death in women.
