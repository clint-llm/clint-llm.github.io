Malaria is a significant global health problem with a substantial disease burden worldwide. In 2019 there were approximately 229 million cases of malaria responsible for about 409000 deaths, the majority on the African continent (WHO World Malaria Report 2020). Malaria results from infection with single-celled parasites belonging to the Plasmodium genus. Five species of Plasmodium are known to cause disease in humans: P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, and P. knowlesi. Globally, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax account for the majority of cases of malaria. Tis activity reviews the presentation and pathophysiology of malaria and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of malaria.
- Review the pathophysiology of malaria.
- Summarize the treatment options for malaria.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by malaria.
