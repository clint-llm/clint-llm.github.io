Laser therapy can be a minimally invasive method to treat pigmented lesions of the skin and mucosa. In the case of vascular anomalies, lasers have been shown to control the growth of lesions that would otherwise cause disfigurement or functional impairment. Lasers have also been effectively used to treat other pigmented lesions, that while they may not be growing or progressing, can still cause patients aesthetic concern. For any provider who follows patients with pigmented lesions, lasers are a tool essential to the treatment armamentarium.
