Chronic infections can cause goblet cell depletion and thus cause immunologic implications; goblet cell secretion of mucus encourages pathogen elimination and safeguards the protective mucus layers. Besides chronic infections, parasitic intestinal infections can significantly affect these cells. Some studies have also implicated goblet cells to play a role in cystic fibrosis.

Two major inflammatory bowel diseases that may involve goblet cells are Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. In ulcerative colitis, goblet cell number and size drastically decrease. Mucin, the main product of goblet cells, plays an essential role in maintaining protective mucus barriers, and the breakdown of these barriers is thought to eventually result in colitis.

Pools of superfluous amounts of extracellular mucin characterize mucinous carcinoma. Mucinous carcinoma is a tumor where 50% of the tumor mass comes from mucin. This carcinoma leads to high levels of MUC2 goblet cell mucin. MUC2 becomes upregulated and, thus, increases the binding of the goblet cell lineage transcription factor to the MUC2 promoter.
