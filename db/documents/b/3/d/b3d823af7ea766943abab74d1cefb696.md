Clinically the etiology may be categorized into fetal, placental, or maternal causes. However, there is a significant overlapping of pathogenesis.****

Fetal causes: Fetal genetic anomalies are detected in 5% to 20% of FGR cases. These may be due to aneuploidy, uniparental disomy, single-gene mutations, partial deletions or duplications, ring chromosome, and aberrant genomic imprinting. The finding of symmetric FGR prior to 20 weeks of gestation suggests aneuploidy. Fetal infection is responsible for 5% to 10% of FGR cases, the most common being cytomegalovirus and toxoplasmosis. Other infectious agents implicated are varicella-zoster virus, malaria, syphilis, and herpes simplex. Fetuses with non-chromosomal congenital anomalies or specific syndromes may also be growth restricted.

Maternal causes: Maternal morbidities can adversely interfere with uteroplacental-fetal blood flow and cause FGR. These conditions include chronic hypertension, gestational or pregestational diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, severe cardiopulmonary or renal diseases, severe anemia and malnourishment, sickle cell disease, substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, nicotine, heroin, marijuana, and others), anti-neoplastic drugs or radiation exposure, chronic antepartum hemorrhage, low pre-pregnancy weight or poor gestational weight gain, extremes of maternal age, short interpregnancy interval, high altitude residency, multiple gestations, uterine malformations, and assisted conception. Maternal nutritional status can be responsible for almost a 10% variance in fetal weight. Mothers who were growth restricted carry twice the risk for delivering FGR neonates.

Placental/umbilical cord causes: Chromosomal placental mosaicism (CPM), presenting with placental trisomy (most commonly trisomy 21) and a chromosomally normal fetus, is identified in 10% of idiopathic cases of FGR and 33% of FGR with placental infarction and decidual vasculopathy. Placental anomalies (bilobate or circumvallate placenta, small placenta, placental mesenchymal dysplasia), umbilical cord anomalies (single artery, velamentous or marginal cord insertion) are other causes of FGR. Maternal morbidities impact fetal growth via their adverse effects on the placental functions.
