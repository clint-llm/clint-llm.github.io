Upper extremity DVT primarily involves brachial, axillary, and subclavian veins. The internal jugular veins and the more distal radial and ulnar veins are involved less frequently. There are 2 forms of upper extremity DVT: primary and secondary. The primary form is known as Paget-Schroetter syndrome (PSS) and typically occurs in the dominant arm of younger athletic patients involved in activities requiring excessive and repeated motion of the upper extremities such as wrestling, swimming, gymnastics, and sports involving repetitive ball throwing (i.e., football, baseball, and basketball). The secondary form occurs most commonly in patients with central venous catheterization or patients with malignancy.
