The keystone of Tietze syndrome treatment is conservative therapy and reassurance that this disease process will often resolve on its own with no permanent sequelae, many times within a few weeks. There is, however, the potential for it to last months, or even up to a year. First-line medical management is oral or topical anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents.

If those do not provide significant relief, patients may benefit from a focused injection of local anesthetic, steroid, or both at the site of maximum swelling, which should be visualized via sonogram. Some patients have reported benefits with warming pads applied to the affected area. There are reports in which cartilage has been resected as a treatment option in persistent, severe cases. However, this is not generally recommended and should only be considered on a case by case basis.
