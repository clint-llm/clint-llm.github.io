Treatment with outpatient antibiotics is indicated in symptomatic or complicated UTIs and pyelonephritis. It is important to take into consideration specific local resistance patterns when choosing appropriate antibiotic coverage.

The antibiotic of choice in uncomplicated S. saprophyticus UTIs is nitrofurantoin 100 mg orally twice daily for five days, or for seven days in complicated cases. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) 160 mg/800 mg by mouth twice daily for three days may be given alternatively in uncomplicated cases.

Symptomatic treatment for pain and nausea should also be addressed.Â  Acute uncomplicated UTIs are unlikely to cause renal injury. Thus NSAIDs are a preferred analgesic. Pyridium may also be given to alleviate associated dysuria. Ondansetron or promethazine are commonly prescribed antiemetics. Most patients will notice symptomatic relief within 36 hours from antibiotic treatment alone.

Patients who are hemodynamically unstable, have associated kidney injury, abscess formation, or emphysematous pyelonephritis, have failed outpatient treatment, have intractable nausea, vomiting, or pain, are unable to tolerate oral intake, or are unable to comply with medical treatment may require admission.
