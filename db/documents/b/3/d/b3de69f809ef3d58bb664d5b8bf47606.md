Monitoring parameters for salmeterol include heart rate, blood pressure, pulmonary function, forced expiratory volume, peak expiratory flow, frequency of nocturnal awakenings, central nervous system stimulation, and occurrence and severity of asthma symptoms.

If there is a concern for any of the conditions noted above in the contraindication section, it may be helpful to periodically monitor blood glucose, potassium, thyroid function, hepatic function, and/or the QT interval if the patient is concomitantly taking other CYP3A4 inhibitors.

Patients with hepatic impairment require close monitoring as decreased liver function may lead to salmeterol accumulation in the plasma.
