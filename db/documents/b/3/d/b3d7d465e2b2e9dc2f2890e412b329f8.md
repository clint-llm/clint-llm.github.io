Computed tomography with thin cuts of the temporal bone without contrast is the most commonly utilized diagnostic imaging modality among otolaryngologists. Imaging assists with surgical planning and provides a significant amount of useful information to the otolaryngologist. MRI can also be used to help with the diagnosis of acquired middle ear cholesteatomas. They often appear isointense on T1, hyperintense on T2 and do not enhance with gadolinium contrast. MRI may be more useful as a method of cholesteatoma surveillance after surgery.

Subtle defects seen on imaging include:

- Labyrinthine fistula

- Scutal erosion

- Ossicular involvement, erosion

- Defects in the tegmen

Audiometry should always be done prior to surgery to establish a baseline. The speech reception threshold, air, and bone conduction and speech discrimination scores should be noted.
