The varying prevalence of Rhesus negative type individuals around the globe has caused a significant impact on the incidence of disease worldwide. 15% of Whites (North Americans and Europeans) are found to be Rh-negative, while only 4%-8% of Africans and 0.1 to 0.3% of Asians have the Rhesus negative blood group. Despite a remarkable decline in reported cases of Rh-hemolytic disease due to proper prenatal screening and prophylaxis, 276 neonates per 100,000 live births per year are still being affected globally, especially in developing countries.

The southwest United States has a 1.5 times greater incidence rate than the national average, probably due to immigration factors. The risk of death and stillbirths are 24% and 11% respectively among these affected newborns, while 13% of affected neonates develop kernicterus with the highest reported mortality rates in the Eastern Europe/Central Asian region with 38 deaths per 100,000 live births.
