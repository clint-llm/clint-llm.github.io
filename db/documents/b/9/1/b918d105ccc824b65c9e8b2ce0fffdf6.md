Typical childhood absence epilepsy occurs in childhood and resolves by adolescence. Seizure freedom is reported in 57% to 74% of the patients. Patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures usually do not respond to initial ethosuximide monotherapy and do not achieve long-term remission.

Compared with controls, the risk for accidental injuries during absence seizures is well reported.
