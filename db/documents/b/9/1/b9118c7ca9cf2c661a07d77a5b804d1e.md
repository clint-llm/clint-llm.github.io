Dr. Harold Brown first described eight cases of a new ocular motility condition, which presented with restricted elevation in adduction, among other features in 1949.

The terminology regarding Brown syndrome has varied and was often confusing. For this review, true Brown syndrome is due to congenital cause, with a constant limitation of elevation and a positive traction test secondary to a tight, superior oblique tendon. Pseudo-Brown syndrome encompasses acquired and intermittent cases, as well as cases not due to superior oblique muscle-tendon pathology.
