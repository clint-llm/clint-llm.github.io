Fulvestrant is a novel drug that has shown to be of some use in the management of advanced breast cancer. It acts by binding, blocking, and degradation of estrogen receptors, which in turn leads to the complete cessation of estrogen signaling through the estrogen receptors in the body.

The novel drug has a high binding affinity for the estrogen receptor, almost 89% of estradiol.
