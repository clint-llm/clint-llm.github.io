HSV is enveloped and has a linear double-stranded DNA genome. It has two subtypes: HSV-1 and HSV-2, each affecting different regions of the body. The following etiological factors are responsible for the spread of the disease:

**Primary infection:**

- **HSV-1**: HSV-1 causes infection in the face, lips, and eyes. The involvement of the cornea is due to direct infection.

- **HSV-2**: HSV-2 infects the genitalia; however, it may get transmitted to the eye through infected secretions, either venereally or at birth (neonatal conjunctivitis).

- **Environmental****conditions**: HSV transmission facilitation occurs in conditions of crowding and poor hygiene.

**Reactivation:**

Primary infection may become latent, which may be reactivated later in life due to a variety of stressors such as fever, trauma, immunosuppression, hormonal change and radiation exposure, etc.
