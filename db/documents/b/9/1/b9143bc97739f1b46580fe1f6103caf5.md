Understanding the potential risks and complications associated with a lumbar puncture is of great importance and should be discussed with the patient before performing the procedure. Serious complications are rare, and risk can be minimized if proper technique and precautions are followed. The complications of a lumbar puncture include post-lumbar puncture headache, bleeding, infection, spinalÂ hematoma, and cerebral herniation.

Spinal hematoma is of particular concern in patients with coagulopathies or currently receiving certain anticoagulant medications.
