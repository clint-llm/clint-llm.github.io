Major procedure-related complications and drug-related systemic effects of ESI requiring hospitalization including spine infection, hematoma, and sepsis are very rare. This was estimated to be 0.46% in a large single-center European study.

Particulate steroids have been implicated in multiple case reports of permanent neurological damage after cervical transforaminal ESI.

Different approaches have been described to safely deliver medication to the target area with avoidance of the neurovascular structures. There is controversy on the safest approach to minimize the chance of neurological injury. In a review of 18 cases of paralysis following lumbar transforaminal ESI where needle position could be determined, the needle was in the superior portion of the neural foramen in 77.7% of cases, in the mid-zone in 22.2%, and in no case was the needle in the inferior portion of the neural foramen. The needle was more commonly anterior (71.4%) and less commonly posterior (28.5%).
