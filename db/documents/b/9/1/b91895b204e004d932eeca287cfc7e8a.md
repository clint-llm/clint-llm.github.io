Preprocedural planning. A trial is necessary before permanent ONS implantation. In the trial period, leads are placed under the skin and connected to an external battery. The leads get inserted into the trailing cable. Stimulation is provided temporarily using a radiofrequency transmitter to different electrode combinations; this helps the patient to report the location, intensity, and sensation of stimulation. The trial period lasts for 4 to 7 days. During this period, the patient must maintain a headache diary. ONS is considered successful if there is more than fifty percent improvement in pain, or there is a decrease in the number of headache days or the patient reports improvement in the quality of life. The patients with successful block qualify for permanent implantation.

Local anesthesia vs. general anesthesia. Weiner and Reed performed the placement of electrodes under local anesthesia. The advantage with local anesthesia is that it allows the patient to assess the site of paresthesia and thus verify electrode placement. This procedure can also take place under sedation with propofol (i.e., procedural sedation), and the staff can wake the patient to check areas of paresthesia intra-operatively. Recently, physicians have also been performing the procedure under general anesthesia in the prone position, which decreases the risk of lead migration.

Positioning. The procedure is possible in a lateral or prone position, depending on the entry point of incision.
