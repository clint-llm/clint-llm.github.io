Diaphragm pacing requires an interprofessional team approach before and after the surgery. Alongside the surgeon who performs the procedure, neurology consultation should be sought for careful performance and interpretation of the phrenic nerve conduction velocities prior to surgery. These patients are usually severely deconditioned at the time of surgery and need a skilled rehabilitation team consisting of a physical medicine and rehabilitation clinician, physical therapist, occupational therapist, and speech therapist.
