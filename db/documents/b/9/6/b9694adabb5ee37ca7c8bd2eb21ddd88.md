During the first eight weeks of gestation, the mesenchyme condenses and forms five prominences, two mandibular, two maxillary and a frontonasal prominence. The frontonasal prominence forms the precartilagenous nasal capsule which develops as two masses around the forming nasal cavities. The maxillary prominences grow and fuse at the midline forming the lateral nasal prominences. Â As the frontonasal prominence regresses and the maxillary prominence grows medially, they form the midline of the nose and philtrum of the upper lip.
