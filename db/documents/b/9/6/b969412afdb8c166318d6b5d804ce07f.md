VFS should be differentiated from an anaphylactic reaction. Both VFS and anaphylactic reactions will have similar findings of pruritus, erythematous rash, and tachycardia. Anaphylactic reactions involve stridor, angioedema, hives, and wheezing from bronchospasm. Anaphylactic reactions are IgE mediated and require prior exposure. VFS is a rate-related anaphylactoid adverse reaction that most often occurs during the first exposure to intravenous vancomycin.
