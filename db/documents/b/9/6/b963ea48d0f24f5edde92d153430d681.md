For wrist arthroscopy, smaller arthroscopic equipment is needed. A 30° arthroscope measuring 2.7 mm or less should be used for visualization. A 70° arthroscope may also be used. Wrist joint distraction is performed using a commercial traction device which is commonly available. It is recommended to use small joint graspers and shavers measuring 3.5 mm or less.
