**Microscopic Evaluation of the Placenta**

Take 1 x 1 cm blocks from 4 locations of the placenta. Retrieve the specimens with the maternal side of the placenta up and send samples unfixed.

**Autopsy**

The remains must be handled with respect, and an autopsy should be performed in a timely fashion to help the family establish closure. The approach to the autopsy of a stillborn has not been standardized. However, keep in mind that the documentation of negative findings is just as important as that of positive findings.

Some patients and some caregivers may find it difficult to address the topic of a stillborn autopsy. The performance of an autopsy requires written consent. Fetal tissue is not considered part of the product of conception after 20 weeks of gestational age, and therefore insurance may not cover its examination.

An autopsy may identify the cause for stillbirth in 46% of cases and may provide new findings in 51% of cases.

A pathologist who is experienced in the evaluation of stillbirth is an integral part of the team. If someone with this expertise is not locally available, the fetus and or placenta may need to be transferred, per regulations, to another center for evaluation.

Cardiac malformations are not readily detected on postmortem imaging, and hence an autopsy is invaluable to evaluate for them. These anomalies may be missed on routine obstetrical ultrasound and often require a fetal echocardiogram to be diagnosed prenatally.

A complete autopsy includes an examination of the brain and the internal organs. It may include retrieving and preserving organs for later study; however, upon request, all organs may be returned to the body following the autopsy.

A partial autopsy can also be done. In this case, the family specifies what body cavities may be entered. Examination of the head may be declined, and the family may only give consent for an external exam. Some families are much more accepting of an autopsy knowing this information.

An autopsy may be performed in concert with radiological studies. MRI, CT, or high-quality ultrasound may uncover concerning intracavitary lesions. If detected, these lesions may be evaluated using a guided needle biopsy to screen for infection, tumor, or malignancy. In some cases, these radiological studies may help to obviate the need for a complete autopsy.

An autopsy may help to provide valuable information when multiple anomalies are found that do not conform to a syndrome. It may also be used to evaluate for renal anomalies and causes of nonimmune hydrops in the absence of a cystic hygroma.

Photographs should be taken of any detected abnormalities as they can be reviewed at different times and by multiple care team members and help identify the cause of stillbirth and direct future pregnancy management.

**Imaging**

Various imaging modalities can be employed to help in the evaluation of the cause of stillbirth. A Babygram is a lateral and anterior-posterior X-ray of the whole fetus. It may uncover skeletal dysplasia, costovertebral malformations, ectopic calcifications, and gas collections suggestive of infection. This study may confirm or suggest a cause of stillbirth in 16% of cases and serves as the only method of diagnosis in 1.5% of cases.

**Chromosomal Study**

In 5% of normal-appearing stillborns, a chromosomal abnormality will be detectable.

Chromosome testing for aneuploidy should be offered for all stillbirths to confirm or to seek a cause of the stillbirth. After 20 weeks of gestation, "fetal tissue" is not considered a product of conception, and thus the evaluation of this tissue may not be covered by the mother's insurance. Genetic amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling before delivery offers the highest yield (80% to 100%) for successful cytogenetic analysis.

Because amniocentesis results are still pending at the time of the delivery, additional tissue samples should still be obtained immediately following the delivery as a back-up to increase the odds of obtaining a result.

If amniocentesis results in failure to culture tissue, fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FiSH) may still be performed to rule out aneuploidy, the benefit of amniocentesis/fluorescence in situ hybridization is that it is cheaper than microarray.

Cord blood collected for the blood bank is not anticoagulated and is not useful for cytogenetic testing. Cord blood needs to be collected in a green or a purple top tube for cytogenetic testing, which contains an anticoagulant (EDTA, heparin).

Avoid using a skin biopsy for cytogenetic testing if there is any maceration as this tissue will not yield a result. Placental tissue is viable much longer than fetal skin and should be collected as the product of conception of choice if there is fetal maceration. Viable, nonfixed tissue is preferred.  The tissue should be placed in lactated Ringer's solution and not in formaldehyde. If fixed in formaldehyde or alcohol, some labs may still offer genetic testing, but this is not preferred.

Chromosomal microarray testing (CMT) is now the preferred test performed on tissue collected from the fetus or the placenta after delivery. Intact skin, the patella, or costochondral tissue may be collected and submitted unfixed using lactated ringers solution at room temperature.

Gene sequencing with whole-exome sequence panels may be performed in cases with suspected skeletal dysplasia or sudden death. Testing for Mendelian conditions is emerging. Mutations in genes controlling for sudden cardiac death have been discovered and may be found in 10% of stillbirths, which remain unexplained despite undergoing a thorough investigation.

**Lab Testing**

All patients should be offered amniocentesis if delivery is not imminent, even if a prior cell-free DNA screening was unremarkable.

All patients require CBC, glucose, as well as type and screen for HIV and syphilis. These help screen for maternal hemoglobinopathy, infection, poor glycemic control, or undiagnosed diabetes and red cell alloimmunization.

Urine drug screen should be considered, especially for cocaine, which has links to maternal hypertension and placental abruption.

Most maternal and fetal thrombophilias are not associated with stillbirth, and routine testing for thrombophilias is not recommended.

Immediately after a stillbirth, evaluate all women for fetomaternal hemorrhage using the Kleihauer Betke test. This is an acid elution test looking for fetal RBC in the maternal circulation and may help to identify the cause of stillbirth.  It is not an exact test as it uses an estimation of maternal blood volume to calculate the estimated quantity of fetal blood transferred to the maternal circulation. If the mother is Rh-negative and the fetus is Rh-positive, this test is used to calculate the dose of Rhogam necessary to prevent Rh isoimmunization.

Consider screening for TSH, liver chemistry, and bile salts if there is clinical suspicion for an underlying problem. Screen for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin IgM, and IgG if there is a family history of blood clots or if there is evidence of placental infarction or arteriopathy.

**Screening for Infection**

Screening for infection is complicated because many women have positive serology from previous infections. The most common bacterial pathogens associated with stillbirth are E. coli, group B Streptococcus, and Enterococcus species. Most infection-related stillbirths occurred before 24 weeks of gestation.

CMV is the most prevalent infection transmitted in utero. Usually, there are no abnormal ultrasound findings, although cerebral hemorrhage, cardiomegaly, hepatomegaly, mild ascites, and echogenic bowel may be reported. Thrombotic vasculopathy is noted on autopsy. The kidney is the most frequently involved organ, and CMV inclusions may be found in epithelial cells on histology. Cytomegalovirus DNA may be found in the kidney, liver, brain, thyroid, lung, heart, pancreas, and placenta.

Intrauterine herpes infection is very rare. 95% of neonatal infections are acquired peripartum. Although intrauterine herpes may be acquired during a primary or secondary outbreak, the risk is highest during a disseminated herpes infection. Intrauterine transmission is most common during the first 20 weeks of gestation and may lead to stillbirth or congenital abnormalities. Clinical findings may include skin vesicles or scarring, eye lesions (chorioretinitis, microphthalmia, cataracts), neurologic damage (microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, seizures, encephalomalacia). An autopsy may reveal ulcerated skin and necrosis of the liver, adrenal glands, brain, and placental membranes. Fluorescent in situ hybridization may confirm the herpes infection.

Coxsackievirus infection may be asymptomatic or may result in fetal myocarditis, meningoencephalitis, or generalized sepsis. Autopsy findings may include mild arthrogryposis, necrotic meningoencephalitis with vascular calcifications, mild myocardial hypertrophy, and chronic monocytic placental villitis. Molecular techniques may confirm infection.

Aerobic, anaerobic, and listeria placental cultures may be obtained if clinically indicated. To prevent contamination, the swab should be taken from the potential space which is exposed by separating the chorionic from the amniotic membrane. Cultures from the stillborn infant are best obtained from internal organs.

Syphilis RPR may be positive for months after the patient is treated. Syphilis spirochetes infect the placenta causing villous enlargement, acute villitis, necrotizing funisitis, and amniotic infection. Placentomegaly results in stillbirth in 50% of infected fetuses due to placental dysfunction. The infected fetus may demonstrate involution of the thymus, hepatosplenomegaly, and hydrops. Mucocutaneous lesions are rare. Where the incidence of syphilis is high, this is the leading infectious cause of stillbirth and has the greatest potential for improved outcomes if screened and treated.

Malaria, in endemic regions, is responsible for a large number of stillbirths due to its damaging effect on the placenta. Prophylaxis and the use of bednets could reduce stillbirths attributed to this infection.

**Screening for Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)**

Disseminated intravascular coagulation is very rare in the context of stillbirth today due to early diagnosis and management. In cases of fetal demise undiagnosed for more than three weeks or in stillbirth cases complicated by placental abruption or sepsis, DIC may need to be ruled out. The is no single laboratory or clinical test to diagnose DIC. If encountered in the context of a stillbirth, the treatment of DIC includes delivery of the stillborn and management of hemorrhage and or sepsis; supportive care with the administration of blood products as indicated; close clinical surveillance and repeat labs; and rapid response/specialist consultation.

To aid in diagnosing DIC in non-emergent cases where only a clinical diagnosis can be achieved, the EREZ (modified ISTH score) is recommended.

A) Platelet count, (10^9/L)   <50 = **1**: 50-185 =**2**: > 185 =**0**

B) Prothrombin time, (seconds)  <0.5  = **0**: 0.5-1 =**5**: 1.0-1.5 =**25**

C) Fibrinogen, (grams/liter)  3.0 = **25**: 3.0-4.0 =**6**: 4.0 - 4.5 =**1**: >4.5 =**0**

A calculated EREZ score, obtained by adding the score of (A) + (B) + (C), which is greater than 26, predicts a high probability for DIC even in the absence of obvious clinical symptoms.

The platelet count is the most useful test for DIC. Thrombocytopenia, or a down-trending platelet count, is the most important lab value to note, even if it remains above 100 x 10^9/L.

The PT and PTT may become prolonged, but they may also remain normal even in the event of acute hemorrhage and more so in the case of an acute abruption. This is attributed to the change in clotting factors during pregnancy, which favors thrombosis. Treatment for DIC may, therefore, be initiated even when the PT and PTT are minimally prolonged.

A low fibrinogen level is diagnostic of DIC, and in pregnancy, low levels are uncommon except for the setting of a massive postpartum hemorrhage. A fibrinogen level <2 g/L has a positive predictive value of 100% for progression to severe DIC. Consider replacing fibrinogen with cryoprecipitate when the fibrinogen level is <1.5 g/L and replacing platelets when they are less than 50 x 10^9/L, and replacing fresh frozen plasma (30 mL/kg) when the PT and PTT are prolonged.
