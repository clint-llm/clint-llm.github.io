The superior portion of the external jugular vein runs parallel with the great auricular nerve.  The great auricular nerve is a branch of the cervical plexus and provides sensory innervation to the auricle as well as the skin over the parotid gland and mastoid process.  Clinically, a nerve block can be performed to the greater auricular nerve to provide anesthesia to a portion of the ear.  Care must be taken to avoid injecting anesthetic into the external jugular vein during this procedure.
