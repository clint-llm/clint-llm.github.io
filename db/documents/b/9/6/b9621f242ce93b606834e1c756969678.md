Many stones may be watched conservatively as an outpatient, with intervention planned as an outpatient. Smaller stones (less than 5 mm) have a greater chance (90%) of passing on their own with medical expulsion therapy (usually tamsulosin, nifedipine, or alfuzosin). Any hint of a urinary tract infection should be treated aggressively with antibiotics.

Acute management requires IV hydration, analgesia, and antiemetic medications. Studies show that desmopressin can lower the pain of renal calculi. Anecdotal reports indicate that using calcium channel blockers or alpha-blockers can provide pain relief due to the relaxation of the ureter and helps the passage of the stone distally. The urine should be strained for stones.

There are several cases where urgent intervention is required.

- An obstructing stone in a patient with a urinary tract infection, fever, or sepsis. (This is called pyonephrosis or obstructive pyelonephritis and requires urgent surgical decompression by urology or interventional radiology)

- Nausea or pain uncontrolled with outpatient management

- An obstructing stone in a solitary kidney

- Any degree of simultaneous bilateral obstruction can easily lead to renal failure.

- Any degree of obstruction with a rising creatinine

In the case of urinary tract infection or urosepsis with an obstructing stone, the obstruction should first be relieved with either a ureteral double J stent or nephrostomy tube placement. The decision of which treatment modality is most appropriate should be made by urology.  In general, the more severely ill the patient, the greater the benefit from a nephrostomy tube. Definitive stone management can then occur once the infection is no longer active.  Morbidly obese patients and those who cannot be safely taken off of their blood thinners may require a double J stent, regardless.

Electively, stones can be surgically managed in several ways.

- Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) can be used to break up stones anywhere in the urinary tract but is primarily used in the kidney and upper ureter.

- Ureteroscopy with laser lithotripsy can be used to manage stones endoscopically and is preferred for ureteral stones, especially in the lower ureter.

- For large (greater than 2 cm) stones in the renal pelvis, percutaneous nephrolithotomy can be performed.

- Robotic-assisted laparoscopic pyelolithotomy with intracorporeal pyeloscopy can be used in complicated stone cases in horseshoe kidneys.

Once the patient has had their acute stone episode treated, it is recommended to evaluate the patient for the underlying cause for their stone episode, particularly if he or she has had stones in the past. This would involve obtaining a basic metabolic panel and a 24-hour urine collection for stone prevention analysis. Patients must understand that this represents their commitment to follow a long-term course of therapy for stone prevention and that no treatment plan is foolproof. An occasional stone may still be produced but is much less likely on prophylaxis.

Physicians evaluating 24-hour kidney stone results should not only look at the normal ranges but also at what may be optimal. For example, optimal 24-hour urinary calcium should be no more than 250 mg, oxalate less than 25 mg, citrate more than 600 mg, urinary volume more than 2,000 ccs, and urinary uric acid at 600 mg or less. While these levels may not be realistically obtainable in every patient, they are used as goals for treatment where the intention is to get as many chemistry levels optimal as possible, even if they are all technically normal.

Analysis of 24-hour urine tests is often considered complicated but is actually quite simple for the vast majority of patients.

- Hypercalcemic patients should have a parathyroid hormone level check for possible hyperparathyroidism.

- Hydration should be optimized with a goal of at least 2 liters of urine production a day.

- Thiazides are used for hypercalciuria.

- Potassium citrate is used for hypocitraturia and aciduria.

- Allopurinol will help lower high urinary uric acid levels.

Appropriate thiazide use has been shown to lower hypercalciuric calcium stone disease from 2.94 to 0.05 stones per year (P<0.001) while long-term use of potassium citrate can diminish calcium stone production by 80%.

Essentially, just three drugs. A companion StatPearls reference article, "24 Hour Urine Testing for Nephrolithiasis: Guide to Interpretation," by Leslie S and Bashir K, is recommended for more details on 24-hour urine interpretation and preventive therapy.

**Admission**is recommended in the following situations:

- Inadequate pain relief with oral analgesics

- Patient with a transplanted kidney and renal calculi

- Presence of renal calculi and pyelonephritis

- Obstructed pyelonephritis (pyonephrosis)

**Dissolution therap**y does not work for calcium stones but may be used to manage uric acid and cystine stones. Uric acid calculi can be dissolved by making the urine consistently alkaline with potassium citrate and/or sodium bicarbonate.
