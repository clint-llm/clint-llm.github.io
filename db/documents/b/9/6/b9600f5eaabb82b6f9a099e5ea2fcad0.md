Testing of the entire pituitary axis is appropriate and highly recommended in patients with empty sella syndrome after diagnosis; however, there is currently a lack of society-based guidelines.

Growth hormone deficiency presents in 4 to 60% of cases, but its clinical significance in adults is unclear.

The following labs are necessary for the evaluation of pituitary function in any patient found to have empty sella

- Adrenal axis: Early morning fasting cortisol levels are a screening option for adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) deficiency, and overtly low cortisol levels less than 3.0 mcg/dL are consistent with adrenal insufficiency.

- Thyroid axis: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level with free thyroxine (T4) level at the same time should be checked.

- Reproductive axis: In premenopausal women with regular menses, gonadotropin and estradiol levels are not necessary. If menses are irregular or absent, then follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) with estradiol levels should be checked. Postmenopausal women most likely do not need FSH, LH, or estradiol levels checked. A testosterone level with simultaneous LH and FSH levels should be obtained in men.

- Prolactin (PRL): PRL levels should be obtained. Hyperprolactinemia is much more common than PRL deficiency. PRL elevations can be seen in many conditions unrelated to ESS (e.g., drugs, pregnancy, etc.), and thus abnormalities must be correlated with the clinical presentation.

- Growth Hormone (GH), excess or deficiency: GH has a short half-life and is pulsatile throughout the day, so measuring serum levels is not a common practice. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) can be used instead as a screening measure. However, normal levels of IGF-1 do not rule out GH deficiency. Stimulation testing is recommended by some experts to rule out the possibility of GH deficiency.

- Antidiuretic hormone (ADH): ADH levels are not typically measured, but the clinician should inquire about the frequency of urination, including nocturia, to rule out the possibility of diabetes insipidus. If suspicious of diabetes insipidus, serum sodium, serum osmolality, and urine osmolality should be obtained. In rare case reports, hyponatremia was the presenting sign of empty sella.

- Oxytocin levels are not a routine lab for screening in ESS.
