Risk factors for AAA include atherosclerosis (most common), smoking, advanced age, male gender, White race, family history of AAA, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and prior history of aortic dissection. Other causes include cystic medial necrosis, syphilis, HIV, and connective tissue diseases (Ehlers-Danlos, Marfan, Loeys-Dietz syndromes). Non-White race and diabetes are associated with a reduced risk for AAA.

Aneurysm enlargement can be step-wise with the stability of the size for some time and then a more rapid enlargement. The rate of enlargement for small AAA (3 to 5 cm) is 0.2 to 0.3 cm/year and 0.3 to 0.5 cm/year for those with a greater than 5 cm diameter.
