Patients with non-incarcerated hernias may be offered elective surgical repair based on their symptomatology. For patients with moderate to severe symptoms who are healthy enough to undergo surgery, surgical repair is indicated.

Surgical repair of the strangulated hernia will depend on the operative skill and choice of the surgeon. Studies have shown success with a laparoscopic or robotic technique to evaluate strangulated bowel. Depending on the surgeon's skill and experience, bowel resection may also be performed using a minimally invasive technique. For surgeons not experienced in laparoscopic approaches, open approaches are equally successful.
