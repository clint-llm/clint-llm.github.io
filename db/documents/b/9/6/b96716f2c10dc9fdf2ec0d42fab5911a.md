Tricuspid stenosis (TS) is a relatively rare valvular heart disease, accounting for less than 1% of cases. It is the narrowing of the tricuspid valve due to any etiology. The clinical sequel of The cause of tricuspid stenosis can be broadly classified into three categories: acquired, congenital, and iatrogenic. is predominantly systemic congestion. It most often co-exists with mitral valve pathology, especially in patients with rheumatic heart disease. There are various causes of the disease, including systemic illnesses and drugs; the cause of tricuspid stenosis can be broadly classified into three categories: acquired, congenital, and iatrogenic. This activity describes the evaluation and management of tricuspid stenosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe various etiologies of tricuspid stenosis.
- Review the hemodynamic consequences of tricuspid stenosis.
- Outline diagnostic evaluation of tricuspid stenosis.
- Describe the stages of tricuspid stenosis and the relevant management strategy.
