To monitor changes in [H+] and influence the respiratory response, the body possesses two groups of chemoreceptors: 1) central, H+ receptors in the ventrolateral medulla, and 2) peripheral, PaO2, and H+ receptors located in the carotid and aortic bodies.

In the event of hypoxia, the carotid body response dominates, serving as the primary oxygen sensor.

In scenarios in which the receptors disagree, such as hypoxic hypocapnia, the peripheral chemoreceptor hypoxic response dominates, stimulating theÂ respiratory drive to improve oxygenation despite further decreases in CO2.

The kidneys and lungs function in tandem, with their abilities to correct derangements strongest when compensating against the other system. For example, with metabolic acidemia, the kidneys are unable to properly restore acid/base status, and thus rely on the lungs for compensatory respiratory alkalosis through stimulation of the peripheral and central chemoreceptors in response to hydrogen ion increases.
