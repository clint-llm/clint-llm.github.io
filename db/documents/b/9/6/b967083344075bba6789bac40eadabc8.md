Upon diagnosis, patients should be reassured by their physician that uterine prolapse is a common and well-known condition. Additionally, educating patients regarding potential sequelae and available treatments will allow them to know what to expect and make them active participants in their own care.Â Patients may feel negative about their condition because they believe it is not "normal", but reassurance in this fashion can help them to see that their problem is not strange or unheard of and can lead to the destigmatization of uterine prolapse.
