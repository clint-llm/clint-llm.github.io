The care of a pregnant patient requires coordination between an interprofessional team comprised of physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals. Not every complaint in pregnancy is an obstetric emergency; however, it is important to recognize and promptly diagnose the conditions that have been discussed above (ectopic pregnancy, placental abruption, etc.). The use of rapid bedside ultrasound by emergency department providers improves patient outcomes and allows for rapid assessment of both mother and baby, which in turn aids in the ability to communicate more rapidly with the obstetrical specialists in the setting of surgical obstetric emergencies.  Ultrasound reduces maternal and neonatal mortality in primary care facilities and should be included in the assessment by all providers routinely caring for pregnant patients.
