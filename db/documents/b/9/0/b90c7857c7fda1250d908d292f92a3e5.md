Cockayne syndrome causes obstacles to the motor, sensory, and intellectual plans. Children with the most common form of Cockayne syndrome (type 1) have very good communication skills for a very long time despite the illness and very often seek contact. Their socialization and schooling should be encouraged as much as possible. On the other hand, children with the severe form (type 2) have little possibility of interaction with their surroundings because of the severity of sensory and intellectual impairment. The lives of patients with a lighter form (type 3) are close to normal early on, and children attend formal schooling.

In adolescence, the appearance of visual and auditory problems and general weakness require adaptation of the pace of life.
