A common issue seen with flexor hallucis longus dysfunction is stenosing tenosynovitis, which commonly occurs in ballet dancers who undergo extreme plantarflexion while performing various ballet movements. First-line treatment is rest and physical therapy, but a surgical approach is used if the injury is debilitating enough, followed by a well-crafted rehabilitation program. Anti-inflammatory medications can also be prescribed to alleviate symptoms.

Hallux saltans is another condition that arises from flexor hallucis longus muscle overuse. A nodule develops along the tendon that can cause a “popping effect” during contraction due to friction with surrounding tissues. If the nodule continues to grow, this can cause stenosis of the flexor hallucis longus tendon leading to the stifling of the range of motion in the big toe, leading to relative immobility.

Many clinical issues with the flexor hallucis longus muscle and tendon get overlooked because of the muscle being small in size. Diagnosis is via MRI to evaluate the pathology and condition of the flexor hallucis longus tendon. Diagnostic ultrasound is used to assess muscle movement and identify potential impingement sites.

The flexor hallucis longus tendon also has utility for tendon transfer in chronic calcaneal (Achilles) tendon rupture. Single-incision flexor hallucis longus transfers for calcaneal tendon ruptures are considered a simple method with miniscule morbidity and complications.
