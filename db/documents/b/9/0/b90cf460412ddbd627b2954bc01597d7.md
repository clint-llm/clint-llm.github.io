Otalgia has many different causes. It divides into primary (arising from the ear) and secondary or referred (stemming from an organ outside the ear) causes. Primary otalgia tends to be more frequent and is usually due to an ear infection, acute otitis media, especially in children. Secondary otalgia can arise from locations close to the ear, such as the nose, sinuses, and neck. It can rarely occur from areas in the body that are more distant from the ear, such as in heart disease or gastroesophageal reflux. Evaluation and treatment largely depend on the diagnosis. It is essential to seek medical attention for ear pain, especially if associated with other symptoms.
