Adenoma refers broadly to any benign tumor of glandular tissue. Adenomatous polyps are the most common type of polyp in the colon whose prevalence increases with age. Conventional type adenomatous polyps can be classified as tubular, villous, or tubulovillous. Villous features refer to finger-like or leaf-like epithelial projections, and villous adenomas are characterized by more than 75 percent villous features, Villous adenomas are associated with an increased risk of the development of neoplasia or dysplasia compared to other types of adenomas. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of villous adenomas and underscores the role of the interprofessional team in treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of villous adenomas.
- Describe the pathophysiology of villous adenomas.
- Review the treatment options available for villous adenomas.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to advance the delivery of care to patients with villous adenomas.
