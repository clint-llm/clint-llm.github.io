**Cholestyramine**

- Four grams of cholestyramine every 6 hours for 14 days is the recommended intervention for wash-out therapy due to the long half-life of leflunomide.

Leflunomide toxicity can affect the liver by causing acute drug-induced hepatic injury and affect the pulmonary system through pneumonitis and interstitial lung disease. During these complications, discontinuation of leflunomide and empirical cholestyramine wash-out therapy is recommended for toxicity.
