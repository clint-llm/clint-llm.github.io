Tetanus is an infection characterized by muscle spasms and lockjaw, also called trismus. Toxins produced by Clostridium tetani are responsible for the characteristic presentation. The disease most commonly occurs in unvaccinated individuals or elderly patients with waning immunity. Vaccination campaigns have decreased the incidence of tetanus worldwide. This activity reviews the most common modalities of tetanus transmission, clinical presentation and illustrates the treatment approach according to current evidence. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with tetanus.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the common ways in which tetanus is transmitted.
- Identify the common presenting features of tetanus.
- Review tetanus treatment strategies.
- Identify interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with tetanus.
