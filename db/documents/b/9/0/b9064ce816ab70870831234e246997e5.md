**Cuff Application Sites**

Arm: Mid-arm

Ankle: Above level of malleoli

For the manual method, apply a stethoscope or doppler to sites of brachial, dorsalis pedis, and posterior arteries as described in the anatomy section.

Inflate cuff 20 to 30mm Hg above the last heard sound, then slowly release pressure. The first heart sound is the pressure that should be recorded as the systolic pressure at that site.

Order: The AHA suggests performing the order of measurements as follows: First arm, same side ankle (both PT and DP), opposite leg, and opposite arm.

If there is a 10m Hg difference in the arm, it is recommended to recheck the initial arm to address the “white coat effect” of blood pressure measurement.

Calculation: The calculation is the ratio of the systolic pressure at the ankle over the systolic pressure at the arm. The appropriate value to use for the systolic ankle pressure has been a subject of debate. The most commonly used is the highest value of the ankle values.
