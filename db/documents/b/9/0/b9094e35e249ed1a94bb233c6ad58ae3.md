Since the major victims of the invasive mucormycosis are immunocompromised individuals, they should be under consideration for early intervention. Knowledge of rhinocerebral mucormycosis among these individuals allows an early visit to the hospital or clinic. It assists in early diagnosis and increases survival. Information about the disease comforts the patients, and the level of information provided should be parallel to the understanding level of patients. More educated patients must be provided with more extensive details. Details of signs and symptoms help the patients before self-assessing the warning of disease. Patients have the right to choose the mode of investigation and treatment, accept or reject the intervention upon them. But first, they should be counseled and instructed about the merits, necessity, demerits, and complications in the absence of the interventions.
