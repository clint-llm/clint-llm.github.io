Numerous causes of portal hypertension exist. The etiology can classify as prehepatic, intrahepatic, or posthepatic reasons.

The common causes of pre-hepatic etiology are either due to increased blood flow or obstruction within the portal vein or splenic vein. Instances of increased blood flow include idiopathic tropical splenomegaly, arterio-venous malformations, or fistula. A blockage within the portal or splenic vein may be due to thrombosis or to invasion or compression of these veins by the tumor.

Intrahepatic causes subclassify into pre-sinusoidal, sinusoidal, or post-sinusoidal. Pre-sinusoidal intrahepatic causes can be produced by schistosomiasis, congenital hepatic fibrosis, early primary biliary cholangitis, sarcoidosis, chronic active hepatitis, and toxins such as vinyl chloride, arsenic, and copper. Sinusoidal causes arise from cirrhosis, alcoholic hepatitis, vitamin A intoxication, or cytotoxic drugs. Post-sinusoidal causes result from sinusoidal obstruction syndrome or veno-occlusive disease.

Finally, posthepatic causes can be at the level of the heart, hepatic vein, as in Budd-Chiari syndrome, or inferior vena cava. Posthepatic causes at the level of the heart are due to a rise in atrial pressure, as in constrictive pericarditis. If these causes occur at the level of the inferior vena cava, it is due to stenosis, thrombosis, webs, or tumor invasion.
