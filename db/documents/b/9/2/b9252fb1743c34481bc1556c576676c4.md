**Biceps Femoris Long Head**

- Origin: Common (conjoint) tendon from the superior medial quadrant of the posterior ischial tuberosity (with semitendinosus)

- Insertion: Majority onto the fibular head; also the lateral collateral ligament of the knee and lateral tibial condyle

- Action: Flexion of the knee and lateral rotation of the tibia; extension of the hip joint

- Innervation: Tibial nerve (a portion of the sciatic nerve)

- Arterial Supply: Perforating (muscular) branches of profunda femoris artery, inferior gluteal artery, and the superior muscular branches of the popliteal artery

**Biceps Femoris Short Head**

- Origin: Lateral lip of linea aspera, the lateral intermuscular septum of the thigh, and lateral supracondylar ridge of femur

- Insertion: Mostly on the fibular head; lateral collateral ligament of the knee, and the lateral tibial condyle

- Action: Flexion of the knee and lateral rotation of the tibia

- Innervation: Common peroneal nerve (a portion of the sciatic nerve)

- Arterial Supply: Perforating (muscular) branches of profunda femoris artery, inferior gluteal artery, and the superior muscular branches of the popliteal artery

**Semimembranosus**

- Origin: Superior lateral aspect of the ischial tuberosity

- Insertion: The posterior surface of the medial tibial condyle

- Action: Extension of the hip, flexion of the knee, and medial rotation of the tibia (specifically with knee flexion)

- Innervation: Tibial nerve (a portion of the sciatic nerve)

- Arterial Supply: Perforating (muscular) branches of profunda femoris artery, inferior gluteal artery, and the superior muscular branches of the popliteal artery

**Semitendinosus**

- Origin: The common (conjoint) tendon from the superior medial quadrant of the posterior ischial tuberosity (with biceps femoris long head)

- Insertion: Superior aspect of the medial tibial shaft (into the distal portion of the pes anserinus along with the gracilus and sartorius muscles)

- Action: Extension of the hip and flexion of the knee, medial rotation of the tibia (specifically with knee flexion)

- Innervation: Tibial nerve (a portion of the sciatic nerve)

- Arterial Supply: Perforating (muscular) branches of profunda femoris artery, inferior gluteal artery, and the superior muscular branches of the popliteal artery
