Elder abuse is a complex phenomenon with many risk factors and societal factors to consider. These include victim and perpetrator characteristics, societyâ€™s perceptions, and environmental factors.

Victim characteristics strongly associated with elder abuse include increased reliance on a caregiver due to physical, emotional, psychological, or financial dependence.

Perpetrator characteristics associated with elder abuse include substance abuse, normalization of violence through previous life experiences, financial dependence on the victim, mental illness, personality disorders, and a history of a strained premorbid relationship with the older adult.

Societal and environmental factors include high crime rates, which may normalize violence, lack of community resources causing increased strain on caregivers and victims, and the belief that the elderly are unlikely to be victims of abuse.
