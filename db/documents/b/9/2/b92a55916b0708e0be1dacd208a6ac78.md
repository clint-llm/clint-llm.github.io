Hydroxocobalamin is a form of manufactured, injectable vitamin B12. Clinicians use it in the prevention and treatment of macrocytic anemia associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. It may also be part of therapy to treat Leber optic atrophy (an inherited optic neuropathy associated with a deficiency in vitamin B12).

The FDA-approved form of intravenous (IV) hydroxocobalamin is used for the treatment of cyanide poisoning.
