Cholecystectomy for biliary colic is an elective procedure and thus has a very favorable postoperative course. Since biliary colic by definition precedes the more serious inflammation that accompanies cholecystitis the dissection and removal of the gallbladderÂ is typically much easier. Patients can often be discharged the same day or after a single day in the hospital provided they can tolerate appropriate oral intake of hydration and nutrition and their pain is well controlled.
