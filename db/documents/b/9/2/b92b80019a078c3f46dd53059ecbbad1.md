Management of acute or chronic skin injuries due to ionizing radiation is a complex challenge with injuries ranging from acute redness to chronic wounds that cannot be visualized. Chronic manifestations of radiation injuries may include radiation-induced fibrosis of the skin, nonhealing ulcers, osteoradionecrosis, compromised muscle flaps, and dehiscence of surgical closures. This activity describes the incidence, pathophysiology and clinical presentation of radiation-induced skin injury including cancer and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of radiation induced skin injury.
- Recall the presentation of a patient with radiation-induced skin injury.
- List the treatment and management options available for skin injury.
- Employ interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of patients with radiation induced skin injury and improve outcomes.
