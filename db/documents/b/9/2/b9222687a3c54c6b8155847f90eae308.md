An acute bacterial infection of the eyelid margin, 90% to 95% of cases of hordeolum are due to Staphylococcus aureus with Staphylococcus epidermidis being the second most common cause. An external hordeolum represents a localized abscess formation of the follicle of an eyelash whereas an internal hordeolum is an acute bacterial infection of the meibomian glands of the eyelid.

A chalazion is an acute or chronic inflammation of the eyelid secondary to obstruction of oil glands (meibomian or Zeis) in the tarsal plate and a foreign body reaction to sebum. Processes that block the normal drainage of sebaceous glands, such as hordeolum, acne rosacea, and blepharitis, can contribute to the development of chalazia.
