The initiation of mechanical circulatory support therapy (whether temporarily or destination therapy left ventricular assist device) requires an interprofessional team of different health care professionals, including and not limited to: cardiologists, cardiothoracic surgeons, nurse coordinators, social worker, and palliative care, all sharing their findings, monitoring as appropriate, and making adjustments to the treatment plan as conditions indicate. This interprofessional collaboration will lead to better patient outcomes when using these implantable devices. [Level 5]

Early identification of the need for mechanical circulatory support may improve outcomes. Implementing a cardiogenic shock team (interprofessional team) is recommended for early diagnosis, structured protocols, risk stratification, and early application of the appropriate mechanical circulatory support device is recommended.
