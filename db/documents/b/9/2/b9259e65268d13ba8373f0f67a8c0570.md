Intestinal trauma occurs from a variety of mechanisms. Due to this, the prevention of intestinal trauma requires deterrence against all the common causes of trauma. Most intestinal trauma results from motor vehicle collisions, gunshot wounds, and stabbings. It is recommended that community-based education to address distracted driving may help to decrease the risk of motor vehicle collisions. Additionally, education regarding weapon safety, use, and storage may help to decrease the risk of accidental penetrating injuries. Further collaboration with community organizations may be needed to address the risk of community violence resulting in the remaining penetrating injuries.
