Gait analysis is known as 'the systematic study of human locomotion.' Forensic gait analysis or forensic gait comparison is defined as 'the assessment and evaluation of the gait patterns and features of the person/suspect and comparing these features with the scene of crime evidence for criminal/personal identification.' In other words, forensic gait analysis may be defined as a contributor to the identification process rather than one of the methods of identification as individualization of the gait of a person has not yet been fully scientifically proved.'

Meanwhile, an investigating officer is always on the look-out for evidence that will link the suspect to the scene of the crime. In recent times, gait analysis has emerged as an important parameter that can help in personal identification during forensic examinations. The advent of CCTV cameras and other surveillance means has generated interest in the practice and research related to forensic gait analysis and its possible use in human individualization. In 1839, in London, gait analysis entered into the court in the case of Thomas Jackson; he was identified by the witness due to his bowed left leg and walking with a limp.
