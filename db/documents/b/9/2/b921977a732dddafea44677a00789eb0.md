Desvenlafaxine is rarely lethal when used as a standalone agent. There is a risk of serotonin syndrome when combined with other serotonin augmenting medications, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, over-the-counter agents, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. The treatment for overdose is symptomatic and supportive. There is no specific treatment for desvenlafaxine toxicity.
