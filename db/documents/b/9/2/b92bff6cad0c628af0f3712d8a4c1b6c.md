Functional deficits in the hand arise most commonly as sequelae of radial, median, or ulnar nerve injury, but can also be secondary to brachial plexus injury, spinal cord injury, specific muscle or tendon injury, or as a result of polio. Additionally, non-displaced distal radius fractures treated non-operatively can lead to attritional rupture of the extensor pollicis longus. Tendon transfers are used to address functional deficits created by these conditions. This activity describes the indications, contraindications, complications, and technique of hand tendon transfers.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the types of nerve injuries that can occur in the hand and wrist that may require tendon transfers.
- Describe the indications for hand tendon transfers.
- Recall the contraindications of hand tendon transfers.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients undergoing hand tendon transfers.
