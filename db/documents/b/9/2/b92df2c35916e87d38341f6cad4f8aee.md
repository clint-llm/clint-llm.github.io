The Valsalva maneuver is forced expiration against a closed glottis. It mimics many normal and, in some cases, routine activities, such as straining during defecation, blowing up a balloon, or playing the saxophone. Performing the Valsalva maneuver causes an increase in intrathoracic pressure, leading to a reduction in preload to the heart. Cardiovascular changes occur during and after this maneuver due to baroreflex and other compensatory reflex mechanisms that are initiated by decreased preload. This activity outlines the indications and contraindications for performing the Valsalva maneuver and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in using this test to evaluate for autonomic dysfunction.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the Valsalva maneuver.
- Review how to perform the Valsalva maneuver.
- Explain the clinical significance of the Valsalva maneuver.
- Summarize the clinical impact that autonomic dysfunction can have on patients and how the interprofessional team can best evaluate and treat patients with autonomic dysfunctions to improve patient outcomes.
