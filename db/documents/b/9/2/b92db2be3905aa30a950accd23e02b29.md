The rubella vaccine contains live attenuated rubella virus. Live vaccines are whole-cell vaccines, meaning the entire virion is used to create the vaccine. An attenuated vaccine is a vaccine that reduces the virulence of the pathogen while still keeping it viable. This vaccine induces both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. It produces an IgG humoral immune response in individuals, as well as a cell-mediated immune response by rubella-specific activation of CD4+ T-helper and CD 8+ T-lymphocyte cells. Thus, the immune response to a live attenuated rubella vaccine is almost identical to one seen during a natural infection.
