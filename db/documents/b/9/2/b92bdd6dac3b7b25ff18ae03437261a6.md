**Paranasal Sinuses**

The advent of endoscopic sinus surgery has increased the interest in the taxonomy of the internal nose and paranasal sinuses. Therefore, the names used by anatomists and surgeons differ at times. Anatomists use the Terminologia Anatomica. Lund et al. defined terms commonly used in surgical practice.

The location of the sphenoidal sinuses provides a convenient pathway to access the pituitary gland in its hypophyseal fossa surgically. The thin bones that line the sphenoidal sinus allow the surgeon to penetrate the roof of the nasal cavity, go through the sphenoidal sinus and enter the hypophyseal fossa.

**Dural Venous Sinuses**

Dural venous injury occurs approximately 1% to 4% in the general population. Mortality due to this injury is significant (41% overall and 20% during surgery).
