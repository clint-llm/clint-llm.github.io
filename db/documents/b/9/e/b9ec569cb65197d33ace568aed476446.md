Intestinal or bowel ultrasound is a non-invasive examination method of the gastrointestinal tract. It is a complementary examination of the more common abdominal ultrasound for providers who use ultrasound as part of their practice. Ultrasound does not involve radiation and is, therefore, safe for pregnant women and children and for patients that require repeated radiological examination. Operator technique and time allocation serve as potential limitations to this exam. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in incorporating intestinal ultrasound in clinical practice and reviews its technique, equipment used, and limitations.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the importance of intestinal ultrasound in clinical practice and the techniques used in screening by ultrasound.
- Summarize the anatomical landmarks of intestinal ultrasound.
- Review the different indications for intestinal ultrasound and the pathologies potentially seen on imaging.
- Describe the potential role of ultrasound in evaluating infectious and inflammatory bowel disease.
