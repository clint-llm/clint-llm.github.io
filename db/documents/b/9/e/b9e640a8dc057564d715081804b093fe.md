The perimortem cesarean section, as described in its name, is the surgical delivery of the fetus, performed during or near the time of death of the mother. The perimortem cesarean section is one of the most anxiety-provoking surgical procedures. At this time, there are no clear, standardized guidelines regarding when this procedure should be performed. The lack of consensus data makes this procedure even more stressful. It is imperative for providers to know the indications, as well as be able to perform the procedure efficiently, thus giving both the mother and neonate an increased chance of survival. This activity describes the evaluation and management of perimortem cesarean sections and stresses the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of perimortem cesarean sections.
- Describe exam findings suggesting the need for a perimortem cesarean section.
- Explain when a perimortem cesarean section is done. 
- Explain the importance of optimizing coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care to patients undergoing perimortem cesarean section.
