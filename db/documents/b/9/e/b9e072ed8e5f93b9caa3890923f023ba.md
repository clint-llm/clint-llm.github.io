Gastrin levels are routinely measured to diagnose Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, which is characterized by gastrin-producing tumors in the duodenum or pancreas that result in recurrent, refractory peptic ulcers and diarrhea. A gastrin level 10 times the upper limit of normal (approximately 1000 pg/mL) plus a gastric pH below 2.0 is diagnostic of Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) syndrome.

Pentagastrin injection is used to diagnose carcinoid syndrome because administration will induce symptoms in patients who present with minimal or inconsistent symptoms. Additionally, the pentagastrin-stimulated calcitonin test for patients with normal calcitonin levels who have symptoms suspicious for medullary thyroid carcinoma.

Cholecystokinin is used for diagnostic radiography examinations of the gallbladder, called biliary scintigraphy, for patients with suspected gallbladder disease, and also has utility in manometry for patients with sphincter of Oddi dysfunction.

Secretin is used as an adjunct with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for diagnostic testing of pancreatic secretion and potential ductal obstruction.
