Acid-base disorders, including metabolic acidosis, are disturbances in the homeostasis of plasma acidity. Any process that increases the serum hydrogen ion concentration is a distinct acidosis. The term acidemia is used to define the total acid-base status of the serum pH. For example, a patient can have multiple acidoses contributing to a net acidemia.Â Its origin classifies acidosis as either a respiratory acidosis which involves changes in carbon dioxide, or metabolic acidosis which is influenced by bicarbonate (HCO3).

Metabolic acidosis is characterized by an increase in the hydrogen ion concentration in the systemic circulation resulting in a serum HCO3 less than 24 mEq/L. Metabolic acidosis is not a benign condition and signifies an underlying disorder that needs to be corrected to minimize morbidity and mortality. The many etiologies of metabolic acidosis are classified into 4 main mechanisms: increased production of acid, decreased excretion of acid, acid ingestion, and renal or gastrointestinal (GI) bicarbonate losses.
