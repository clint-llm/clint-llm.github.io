There are three Gowers signs described in the medical literature

- Sciatic pain on passive ankle dorsiflexion

- The irregularly contracting pupils in syphilis

- The characteristic maneuver ofÂ climbing up the thighs while standing up is seen particularly in Duchenne dystrophy.

In 1879, neurologist Sir William Richard Gowers described the most significant Gowers sign as the characteristic patterns observed in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy wherein they 'climb up' their thighs with the aid of their hands to overcome the weakness of their pelvic and proximal lower limb muscles.
