The use of forceps in infant delivery has fallen out of favor among obstetricians in the past three decades. Forceps deliveries now make up about only 1.1% of vaginal deliveries (according to a retrospective cohort involving more than 22 million vaginal deliveries from 2005-2013). The use of vacuum extraction has also declined but is more frequently used compared to forceps delivery; this may be because vacuum extraction is easier to use in comparison to forceps. However, vacuum use is less likely to result in a successful vaginal delivery when compared to the use of forceps. This activity describes the indications, contraindications and complications of forceps delivery and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients in labor and improve outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for forceps delivery.
- Review the complications of forceps delivery.
- Summarize the contraindications for forceps delivery.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team to recognize the indications for forceps delivery, ensuring patient safety and improving outcomes.
