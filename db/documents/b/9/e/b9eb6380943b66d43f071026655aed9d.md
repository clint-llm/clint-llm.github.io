The first sign of polymorphous light eruption typically appears after first exposure to intense sunlight during the spring or early summer in temperate climates. Several hours to days later, an irritable rash appears on areas newly exposed to the light such as the décolletage, forearms, backs of hands, lower legs and feet. It rarely affects the face. It also occurs in some patients treated for inflammatory skin diseases with phototherapy, when it may appear on the trunk and proximal limbs.

The most common morphology is smooth-topped erythematous papules, which can coalesce into plaques. Morphology varies between individuals and can include macules, vesicles, lichenoid plaques, prurigo papules and targetoid lesions resembling erythema multiforme.

Rarely, systemic features such as fever, malaise, and headaches, have been associated with the eruption.

The rash persists for several days then clears up without scarring if further exposure to UV is avoided. It may persist for weeks or months if repeatedly exposed, although in most individuals gradual exposure leads to hardening so that the eruption does not occur in late summer.

Polymorphic light eruption tends to recur annually and is some patients persists throughout the year, depending on latitude. It often reduces in severity over time and eventually resolves with a lower prevalence in older people.
