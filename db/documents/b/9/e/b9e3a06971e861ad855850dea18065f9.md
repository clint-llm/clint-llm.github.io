Though OIS is associated with many unique symptoms, the most common symptom of the disease is gradual vision loss over weeks or months in 80% of the cases. Less frequently, there can be an abrupt decrease in vision that can be associated with neovascular glaucoma and a cherry-red spot in the retina (12%).

The other characteristic of the disease is dull aching ocular or periorbital pain referred to as “ocular angina”(40%), which is due to ocular ischemia or raised intraocular pressure or due to ischemia of ipsilateral meninges. Features of amaurosis fugax are present in 12% of the cases. Prolonged visual recovery on exposure to bright light is another complaint due to macular ischemia and delayed recovery of photoreceptors consequent to the compromised blood supply.

**Clinical Features**

The anterior segment features are rubeosis iridis(67%) leading to neovascular glaucoma, low-grade inflammation in the anterior chamber ( Flare: 50%, Cells 1+:18%), anterior and posterior synechiae, atrophy of sphincter pupillae (semi-dilated pupil) with sluggish reaction to light, spontaneous hyphema, asymmetric cataract, conjunctival and episcleral injection, and corneal edema with Descemet`s folds (sometimes with bullous keratopathy), rarely scleral melting has been reported.

Posterior segment manifestations are narrowed retinal arteries (90%), dilated and not tortuous retinal veins (90%), retinal hemorrhages (80%), microaneurysms (80%), retinal telangiectasia, cherry-red spot (12%), cholesterol emboli, glaucoma (neovascular glaucoma, normal-tension glaucoma), neovascularization (optic disc 35%, retina 8%), cotton-wool spots (6%), vitreous hemorrhage (4%), spontaneous retinal arteries pulsations (4%), anterior and posterior ischemic optic neuropathy (2%), choroidal neovascular membrane, areas of chorioretinal atrophy.
