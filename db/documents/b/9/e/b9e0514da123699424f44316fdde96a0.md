There are few relative contraindications to standard central venous catheter insertion.

Bleeding postinsertion is uncommon; moderate-to-severe coagulopathy before initial catheter placement is a relative contraindication to the procedure. If possible, correction of the underlying coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia should occur before insertion; this sometimes is not a viable option in an unstable patient.

Other relative contraindications to central venous catheterization include site-specific considerations. Avoidance of insertion sites with known indwelling intravascular hardware, such as permanent hemodialysis catheters or pacemaker leads, is recommended.

After catheter insertion, there is no contraindication to routine catheter maintenance and care. In the event of insertion site infection, decreased functionality, or new bacteremia, the catheter ideally should be removed. However, if there is a need to maintain critical venous access to maintain hemodynamic or clinical stability, the line should be utilized until another working site is available.
