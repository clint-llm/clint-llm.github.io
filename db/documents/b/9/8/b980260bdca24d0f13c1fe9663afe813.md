The semitendinosus, just medial to the biceps femoris, arises from three locations. The medial border of the ischial tuberosity, the medial border of the proximal tendon of the long head of the biceps femoris, and the proximal aponeurosis.

The semitendinosus muscle, collectively with the other two muscles of the posterior compartment of the thigh, works to extend at the hip and flex at the knee. The semitendinosus muscle, in particular, has the added functionality of assisting the popliteus muscle in rotating the leg internally.
