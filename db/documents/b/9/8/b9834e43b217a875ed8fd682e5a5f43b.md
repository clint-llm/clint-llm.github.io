The biggest complication risk with a redo CABG is typically associated with the repeat sternotomy. Because of the scaring and adhesions that form after an initial sternotomy, a surgeon loses the definitive planes and anatomical clarity they may have experienced during the primary surgery. Complications of repeat sternotomy and dissection can include damage to the heart itself, the coronary vasculature (to include the still patent bypass grafts), the great vessels, the lungs, and any surrounding nerves (i.e., phrenic).

In addition, repeat CABG is often associated with higher bypass times, likely because of more extensive dissections and ischemicÂ myocardium. Therefore, increased bypass time leads to increased inflammatory response, increased risk of infection, and increased coagulopathy. Finally, because of the higher chances of needed blood products during surgery, they are at an increased risk of transfusion reactions.

Another risk associated with redo sternotomies where previous grafts present is intraoperative myocardial infarction due to thrombus dislodgment during manipulation of venous grafts, which carry a higher risk of thrombosis compared to arterial grafts.
