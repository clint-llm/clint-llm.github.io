Methylxanthines are drugs primarily employed in the treatment of non-obstructive lung pathology. This activity will highlight the indications, mechanism of action, and adverse effects of methylxanthines. It will also investigate early signs of toxicity and how its narrow therapeutic range alters the monitoring of patients receiving these drugs.

**Objectives:**

- Describe the adverse effects of methylxanthines.
- Review the appropriate monitoring of methylxanthines.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance methylxanthines and improve outcomes.
