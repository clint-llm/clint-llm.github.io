In the case of donepezil overdose, general supportive measures are necessary, and the clinician should contact poison control for a consult. An overdose of donepezil can cause a cholinergic crisis. Symptoms of overdose include severe nausea, vomiting, sweating, and salivation. It can also cause bradycardia, hypotension, respiratory depression, collapse, and seizures. Donepezil overdose may increase muscle weakness and cause death if respiratory muscles are involved. There have been reports of hepatotoxicity in a few cases with overdose. Like other anticholinesterase inhibitor toxicity, tertiary anticholinergics like atropine may be used as an antidote for donepezil overdose. The dose of IV atropine should be titrated based on clinical response. It is unknown if donepezil or its metabolites are removable by hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or hemofiltration.
