The cornerstone of long-term dermatitis herpetiformis management is strict adherence to a gluten-free diet. Not only does this improve skin changes over time, but it is also essential in the management of associated GSE. Patients are best managed in consultation with an experienced dietitian who will be able to provide appropriate support, as maintenance of a strict gluten-free diet can be challenging.

Because of the slow response to a gluten-free diet, most patients with dermatitis herpetiformis require pharmacological intervention to control their disease in the short to medium term. Dapsone and related sulphonamide drugs have proven highly effective, often suppressing pruritis within days of initiation of treatment.

The mechanism of action of dapsone in dermatitis herpetiformis is through its effects on neutrophil function and recruitment. The drug is typically used at doses of 25 to 150 mg daily. Hematological side effects may occur including hemolysis, methemoglobinemia, and agranulocytosis. Consequently, patients require regular blood monitoring, particularly in the early stages of treatment. Non-hematological adverse effects include a severe drug sensitivity reaction (dapsone hypersensitivity syndrome) and peripheral neuropathy. Patients with a glucose-6-phosphate deficiency (G6PD) are more prone to adverse effects of dapsone, and G6PD activity should be checked before treatment. Concurrent administration of Cimetidine via inhibition of cytochrome p-450 has been shown to decrease the adverse effects of dapsone.

Other sulphonamide drugs have utility in dermatitis herpetiformis, including sulphamethoxypyridazine, sulphapyridine, and sulphasalazine. They may be of utility in patients intolerant of dapsone. Systemic corticosteroids are of little benefit, though potent topical corticosteroids may be of use in the short term to lessen pruritis.
