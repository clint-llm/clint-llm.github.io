**Ulnar impaction syndrome:**More common with ulnar positive variance and results from repetitive microtrauma to the lunate from a relatively long ulna. Similar to Kienböck disease, ulnar impaction syndrome results in decreased T1-weighted signal coupled with increased T2 signal if hyperemia exists, or decreased T2 signal if the disease has already progressed to lunate sclerosis. The signal changes in Kienböck disease, however, are more diffuse or more severe on the radial side of the lunate. Additionally, ulnar impaction syndrome affects the ulnar head and triquetrum, which are intact in Kienböck patients.

**Lunate intraosseous ganglion:**Intraosseous ganglia are true cysts which have low T1 signal and high T2 signal on MRI. Sharp, smooth margins on both MRI and radiography allow distinction from Kienböck disease.

**Bone contusion:**May be difficult to distinguish early-stage Kienböck disease on MRI. A history of recent trauma and concomitant injuries to the wrist/hand, in this case, would aid in making the diagnosis.

**Arthritis:**Bone marrow signal changes in inflammatory or degenerative arthritides may mimic those seen in Kienböck disease. Distinguishing features include demographics, clinical presentation, and absence of ulna minus in arthritis.

**Osteoid osteoma:**Osteoid osteoma of the carpal bones is rare, and only a few case reports exist in the literature. Clinical presentation and the finding of a lucent nidus within a sclerotic rim on CT differentiate it from Kienböck disease.

**Enostosis/bone island:**Has low signal intensity on all sequences, however, shows preserved bone morphology and the area of "sclerosis"  is stellate and interdigitated with the normal trabeculae.
