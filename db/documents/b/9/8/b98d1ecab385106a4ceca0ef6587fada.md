There are no recommended T. vaginalis screening practices in the United States. Some suggest performing T. vaginalis screening in specific populations, including populations at high risk for HIV infection, patients attending STI clinics, men with urethritis, sexual partners of an infected patient, women living in endemic areas, and women living in correctional facilities. Trichomonas infection has been shown to increase the risk of acquisition and transmission of HIV.
