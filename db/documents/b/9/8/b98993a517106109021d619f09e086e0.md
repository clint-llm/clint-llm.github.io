A dorsal penile nerve block can be safely performed by an individual trained in the prescribing and administration of a local anesthetic.

With proper prior preparation, it does not require an assistant, but for those performing the procedure for the first time, the assistance of a colleague experienced in performing local anesthetic blocks is recommended.

Assistants can also be useful if any items are dropped or forgotten so that the assistant can quickly replace them without stopping the procedure. Clinicians should talk with the patient to reduce anxiety and improve the performance of the block.
