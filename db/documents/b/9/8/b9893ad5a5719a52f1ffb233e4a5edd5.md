A good history and physical exam of the head and neck are of utmost importance. If there is a suspicion, imaging needs to be ordered for further evaluation and appropriate staging of the malignancy. Which imaging study to order has been somewhat controversial; although, the consensus is that an MRI of the face and neck is the best modality to evaluate the extent of the disease, the T stage. A positive emission tomography (PET) scan is recommended to evaluate for metastatic disease (M stage) given the propensity of nasopharyngeal cancers to metastasize. An appropriate referral should be made to an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) surgeon with expertise for a nasopharyngolaryngoscopy for direct visualization and biopsy. an interprofessional evaluation is needed for these patients which includes consultation with medical oncology, radiation oncology, and surgery. Supportive care teams should be involved in care as well. The team should include dental, ophthalmologic, nutritional, speech pathology, and audiology evaluation where needed. EBV testing of the tumor (through in situ hybridization) and blood (PCR) should be considered for tumors with nonkeratinizing and undifferentiated histology.
