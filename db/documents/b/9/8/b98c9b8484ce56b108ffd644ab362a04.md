The diagnosis and management of acute compartment syndrome are complex and are best managed with a team that includes an orthopedic surgeon, emergency department clinician, radiologist, and nurses. While the actual management of the condition is done by an orthopedic surgeon, the monitoring is usually done by the nurses. The patient's leg has to be continuously monitored for changes in color, pain, paresthesias, and loss of pulses.

Patients with acute compartment syndrome require consultation with an orthopedic surgeon in the emergency department for immediate surgical fasciotomy. Patients with chronic exertional compartment syndrome can be managed as an outpatient by a sports medicine clinician or orthopedic surgeon.

Patients who are managed promptly have a good outcome, but delays in diagnosis can lead to amputation. Even those managed acutely often have a prolonged recovery course. Wound infections, muscle atrophy, and disability are not uncommon complications. [Level 5]
