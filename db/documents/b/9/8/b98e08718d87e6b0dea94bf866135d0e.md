- Take advantage of the free genetic screening services for primary hyperoxaluria and nephrolithiasis that are currently available for patients with significant hyperoxaluria.

- Consider genetic testing for children with recurrent oxalate stones and for adults with daily urinary oxalate excretion of 75 mg or more.

- Hyperoxaluria is often a difficult problem to treat. Initial therapy with calcium citrate supplementation, lower dietary oxalate, and pyridoxine may not be successful.

- In cases where hyperoxaluria treatment has failed to normalize urinary oxalate levels, optimize all of the other treatable urinary chemistries (calcium, citrate, pH, uric acid, and volume) as much as possible.
