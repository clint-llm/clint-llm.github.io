Microcystic adnexal carcinoma is a malignant tumor of sweat gland origin found primarily on the head and neck. Establishing the correct diagnosis requires using an appropriate (deep) biopsy technique. It is one of the "paisley-tie" pattern tumors histologically. Ohs micrographic surgery should be considered the first line of surgical treatment since it allows for intraoperative analysis of the entire surgical margin and can often allow for a more precise assessment and removal of peri-neural spread.
