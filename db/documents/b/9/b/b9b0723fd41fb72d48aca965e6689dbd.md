A specialized interprofessional team is always necessary to perform an EPS. An operator is required for the invasive procedure and another one for the operation of the recording system and the external stimulator. The care of the patient (monitoring of vital signs, administration of oxygen, and intravenous medications) is the responsibility of the nursing staff. Nurses can also help with the setup of the examination and have a critical role in the early diagnosis and treatment of complications. Moreover, they can play a significant role in post-procedural care, and the long-term follow up of the arrhythmia patient. A clinical cardiologist ideally specialized in the care of patients with heart failure, a cardiac surgeon, and a geneticist should also be available for consultation as members of the arrhythmia team. This integrated team approach, although not extensively tested yet, is expected to significantly improve the management of patients with cardiac arrhythmias.

The diagnosis and management of cardiac arrhythmias is not an easy task. Training of the medical and non-medical personnel in high volume centers, along with their active participation in updating educational sessions, is of paramount importance for the achievement of high-quality standards in the electrophysiology laboratory.
