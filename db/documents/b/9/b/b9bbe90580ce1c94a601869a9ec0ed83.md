Evidence for a genetic predisposition for sleepwalking has been observed in some patients. Monozygotic twins have a higher chance of somnambulism than dizygotic twins.****More Whites with somnambulism are found to be positive for the DQB1*0501 gene as compared to Whites without somnambulism, which suggests that DQB1 genes are involved in motor disorders in sleep.****Hyperthyroidism has also been shown to cause sleepwalking in a few cases.
