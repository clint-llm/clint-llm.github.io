The true incidence and prevalence of CKD are difficult to determine because of the asymptomatic nature of early to moderate CKD. The prevalence of CKD is around 10% to 14% in the general population. Similarly, albuminuria (microalbuminuria or A2) and GFR less than 60 ml/min/1.73 mt2 have a prevalence of 7% and 3% to 5%, respectively.

Worldwide, CKD accounted for 2,968,600 (1%) of disability-adjusted life-years and 2,546,700 (1% to 3%) of life-years lost in 2012.

Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) mandates that for labeling of chronicity and CKD, patients should be tested on three occasions over a 3-month period with 2 of the 3 results being consistently positive.

**Natural History and Progression of CKD**

CKD diagnosed in the general population (community CKD) has a significantly different natural history and the course of progression compared to the CKD in patients referred to the nephrology practices (referred CKD).

Community CKD is seen mainly in the older population. These individuals have had lifelong exposure to cardiovascular risk factors, hypertension, and diabetes which can also affect the kidneys. The average rate of decline in GFR in this population is around 0.75 to 1 ml/min/year after the age of 40 to 50 years.

In contrast to community CKD, patients with referred CKD present at an early age because of hereditary (autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ADPKD) or acquired nephropathy (glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, or tubulointerstitial disease) causing progressive renal damage and loss of function. The rate of progression in referred CKD varies according to the underlying disease process and between individual patients. Diabetic nephropathy has shown to have a rapid rate of decline in GFR averaging around 10 ml/min/year. In nondiabetic nephropathies, the rate of progression is usually faster in patients with chronic proteinuric GN than in those with a low level of proteinuria. Patients with ADPKD and renal impairment, CKD stage G3b and beyond, may have a faster rate of progression compared to other nephropathies. In patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis, good blood pressure control and minimal proteinuria are associated with very slow progression.

**Risk Factors for Progression of CKD**

**Non-Modifiable CKD Risk Factors
**

Older age, male gender, a non-Caucasian ethnicity which includes African Americans, Afro-Caribbean individuals, Hispanics, and Asians (South Asians and Pacific Asians) all adversely affect CKD progression.

Genetic factors which affect CKD progression have been found in different Kidney diseases. In a population-based cohort study by Luttropp et al., single nucleotide polymorphisms in the genes TCF7L2 and MTHFS were associated with diabetic nephropathy and CKD progression. In the same study, polymorphisms of genes coding for mediators of renal scarring and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) were found to influence CKD progression.

**Modifiable CKD Risk Factors

These include systemic hypertension, proteinuria, and metabolic factors.

Systemic hypertension is one of the main causes of ESRD worldwide and the second leading cause in the United States after diabetes. The transmission of systemic hypertension into glomerular capillary beds and the resulting glomerular hypertension is believed to contribute to the progression of glomerulosclerosis.

Multiple studies in patients with diabetic and nondiabetic kidney diseases have shown that marked proteinuria (albuminuria A3) is associated with a faster rate of CKD progression. Also, a reduction in marked proteinuria by RAS blockade or by diet is associated with a better renal outcome. However, in large intervention studies like Avoiding Cardiovascular Events Through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension (ACCOMPLISH)

Multiple studies have linked the RAAS system in the pathogenesis of hypertension, proteinuria, and renal fibrosis throughout CKD. Subsequently, interventions targeting RAAS have proved effective in slowing the progression of CKD. This has led to the widespread use of RAAS blockers in proteinuric and diabetic kidney disease.

Obesity and smoking have been related to the development and progression of CKD. Also, metabolic factors such as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hyperuricemia have been implicated in the development and progression of CKD.

**Recommendations for CKD Screening**

Screening, mostly targeting high-risk individuals is being implemented worldwide. The KDOQI guidelines recommend screening high-risk populations which include individuals with Hypertension, Diabetes mellitus, and those older than 65 years. This should include urinalysis, a urine albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR), measurement of serum creatinine and estimation of GFR preferably by chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. It is the most cost-effective approach, and there is no evidence to justify screening asymptomatic individuals in the general population for CKD.
