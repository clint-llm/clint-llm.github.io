Radiological evaluation to detect an IOFB plays a key role in the management of ocular trauma. Several useful imaging modalities include X-ray, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasonography (USG), ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM), and Optic coherence tomography (OCT). Electrophysiological tests like Electroretinography (ERG) play an essential role in assessing retinal damage in ocular siderosis. Ancillary tests, including electrooculogram, fluorescein angiography (FA), and visual field tests, help in assessing further damage.

Metallic IOFBs are recognized on plain X-ray films as radio-opaque bodies. However, it poses a great challenge in localizing and predicting the nature of FB, and therefore, has a limited role as a diagnostic modality.

USG, a popular imaging modality, can detect both metallic as well as for non-metallic IOFBs. On B-scan, IOFB appears as a hyperechoic lesion with acoustic back-shadowing.

Non-contrast CT (NCCT) is the gold standard investigation for identifying metallic foreign bodies. It is highly accurate in predicting the nature, location (intraocular, extraocular, or retro-bulbar), and size of the FB. Thin scans (1.0 to 1.5 mm) are preferred as they provide higher resolution. It has a high sensitivity for detecting IOFBs (45% to 65% ≤ 0.06 mm and 100%  >0.06 mm size), which may otherwise be missed on the orbital X-ray.

MRI has better sensitivity (95%) than CT scan to detect non-metallic IOFBs and visualize optic nerve, orbital apex, and soft tissue details without radiation exposure.

Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) is the preferred imaging for foreign bodies located anteriorly (subconjunctival space, corneal layers, angle, anterior iris surface, ciliary body, pars plana, 100um from the retina). Since UBM requires contact, it should be avoided in cases of an open-globe injury due to an increased risk of intraocular infection.

Anterior segment OCT (AS-OCT), a non-contact, non-invasive imaging investigation, facilitates the visualization of the anterior segment FBs. Unlike UBM, it ensures greater patient comfort and better compliance. It can also be used as an effective prognosticating tool in ocular siderosis. Owing to its poor penetration across the posterior pigmented layer of the iris, FBs lying behind this plane may often be missed.

Posterior segment OCT is a useful tool in detecting the accurate location of an IOFB lying in the posterior segment (epiretinal, intraretinal, or subretinal) and for quantifying cystoid macular edema.  It can also identify the encapsulation of the foreign body, a factor that helps in deciding the timing of surgical intervention.

Full-field ERG (ffERG) is the gold standard electrophysiological test for identifying subclinical siderosis bulbi. It is an efficient diagnostic and prognosticating tool in ocular siderosis.Supernormal response), reduction in the amplitude of Oscillatory potentials, decrease in amplitude of P1 and N1 waves along with a delay in P1-implicit time on mfERG even in the presence of a normal ffERG.

Fluorescein angiography (FA) in ocular siderosis may reveal hyperfluorescent window defects owing to RPE changes, capillary non-perfusion areas, and ischemic maculopathy.
