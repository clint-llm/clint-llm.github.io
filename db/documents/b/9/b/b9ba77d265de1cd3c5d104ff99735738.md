It is estimated that 13% of adults seek dental care for dental infection or toothache within four years and that 1 per 2600 head of the population in the United States is hospitalized due to dental infections

More than 1 in 5 people have untreated dental caries, and 3 in 4 people had at least one dental restoration during their life. Periodontal disease is also common, with estimations that 35% of Americans age 30 to 90 are afflicted

Furthermore, the prevalence of dental caries varies significantly by socioeconomic factors. Untreated dental caries were more than 2.5 times as common in those living 100% below the poverty level (41.9%) relative to those living 200% above the federal poverty level or higher (16.6%). The prevalence of dental caries is also dynamic during the patients' lifetime. Dental caries are present in 90% of adults and 42% of children ages 6 to 19 years
