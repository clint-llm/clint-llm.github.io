Flexor carpi ulnaris is supplied by the ulnar collateral arteries and small ulnar artery branches. The ulnar artery reaches the flexor carpi ulnaris along with the middle third of its muscle belly. Flexor carpi ulnaris lymphatic drainage is part of the upper limb lymph system consisting of superficial and deep lymphatic vessels. The superficial vessels around the basilic vein go to the cubital lymph nodes, which are proximal to the medial epicondyle of the humerus. Vessels around the cephalic vein go to the axillary lymph nodes. The deep lymphatic vessels also drain lymph from the flexor carpi ulnaris and follow the major deep veins, eventually terminating in the humeral axillary lymph nodes.
