Research supporting claims for the use of biotin for nails and hair remains ambiguous, but there has been well-documented research on the interactions of biotin and other drugs. There are no evident contraindications to taking this vitamin. Biotin is a safe and nontoxic vitamin that the body excretes when in excess. There are no known herbal interactions with biotin. Although not a contraindication, it is important to note that if a person is taking biotin and smoking, they may require increased doses due to increased biotin metabolism.
