Coronary artery calcifications, if not addressed, can lead to worse cardiovascular outcomes. Aggressive lifestyle modification and high dose statin in asymptomatic patients with high coronary artery calcium scores are required to reduce the risk of future events. Pericardial calcifications can lead to worsening constrictive pericarditis and symptoms of refractory heart failure. Myocardial calcifications in the long-run can lead to an impaired diastolic filling.
