Pancreatic cancer is the fourth common cause of cancer death, and its 5-year survival rate is only about 12 percent despite the advancement in medical care, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and molecular biology.

The morbidity and mortality associated with pancreaticoduodenectomy and its complications are high. Due to the high morbidity associated with this procedure, a more vigilant postoperative care becomes imperative. High suspicion and early detection of the postoperative complication is the critical factor in the care of the patient. Physicians, nurses, and the entire team should be adequately educated, and the organized team approach for patient care must be implemented.
