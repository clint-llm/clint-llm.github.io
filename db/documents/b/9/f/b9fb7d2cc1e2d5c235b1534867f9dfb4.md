The presenting complaint is typically one of "pins and needles" in the forearm and the hand. On further questioning of the precise nature of the patient's complaint, the tingling sensation usually is present along the little finger and medial half of the ring finger. The symptoms are generally aggravated with elbow flexion. These symptoms may be present transiently initially then gradually get worse. On examination, findings may include a reduced or complete loss of sensation on the palmar and dorsal sides of the little finger and the medial part of the ring finger in advanced cases.

Motor symptoms are less common and usually manifest in severe cases of ulnar neuropathy. Patients may complain of weakness in the hand and frequent dropping of objects. On examination, findings could range from mild weakness of the interosseous muscles to severe atrophy of the hand intrinsics and weakness of the handgrip. Froment's sign can be positive, indicating weakness of adductor pollicis, which is supplied by the ulnar nerve. Ulnar claw hand is unlikely in cubital tunnel syndrome because the flexor digitorum profundus to the ring and little fingers also is denervated.
