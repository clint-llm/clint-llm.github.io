There is no distinct cause for ACO but rather a continuum phenomenon for airflow obstruction between asthma and COPD. The causes are usually a combination of both COPD and asthma causes. This includes cigarette smoking and environmental factors. Most epidemiologic studies show that tobacco use is the most significant risk factor for COPD. For instance, a retrospective cohort study (n = 8045) discovered that subjects who smoked cigarettes for the entire 25-year observation period had a higher risk of developing COPD than non-smokers (36 versus 8%).

Increased airway responsiveness to allergens or other external triggers is a risk factor for asthma and COPD. A retrospective cohort study (n = 9651) found that individuals with increased airway responsiveness had a higher incidence of COPD over 11 years.
