The midgut is the middle segment of the early gut tube that ultimately produces most of the small intestine and a significant portion of the large intestine. The proper development of the midgut is crucial to the overall function of the human digestive tract. Early in development, the incipient embryonic gut is an endodermal-derived tube divided based on its arterial supply into three segments: the foregut, midgut, and hindgut. Each segment of the primordial gut gives rise to different parts of the adult gastrointestinal tract and outgrowth organs.

Midgut-derived organs are supplied by the superior mesenteric artery and include the duodenum distal to the entrance of the bile duct, the jejunum, ileum, cecum, appendix, ascending colon, and proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon. These organs are integral components of the digestive tract and collectively contribute to the digestion and absorption of nutrients, water, and salts that humans consume through their diet. The midgut development is a captivating process involving the rapid growth of the gut segment that outpaces the space available within the developing abdominal cavity. This forces the midgut to herniate outside of the abdominal cavity at the future site of the umbilicus and into the umbilical cord. Later in development, the segments along the midgut loop will derive structures of the mature gastrointestinal tract.
