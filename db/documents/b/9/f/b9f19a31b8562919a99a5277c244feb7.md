Providers have a multitude of treatment options ranging from nonoperative external immobilization to operative stabilization for cervical spine injuries and deformities in both adults and children. In recent history, the halo vest immobilizer has become a less utilized form of external immobilization due to its known common complications, advancement in cervical surgical fixation/fusion, and the understanding to accept more pseudoarthrosis that occurs from elderly immobilization with CO.

Treatment success with HVI is directly proportional to following proper indications, application, and, most importantly, maintenance and management protocols of the device, which should be carried throughout the whole immobilization period (average of 12 weeks).

Additionally, further imaging such as CT scans may help with pre-procedure pin placement planning, as anatomic variation does exist in pediatric patients. This can help avoid pin placement at cranial sutures, thin cranium regions and overall help limit the risk of complications.

Once a provider becomes familiar with the important anatomy and technical steps for safe pin placement and proper halo application, this procedure serves as an essential tool for a cervical spine provider's practice. Despite complications that can commonly occur (often minor), successful treatment with the HVI has been reported to be as high as 85%. Therefore the HVI may serve as a reasonable option, when indicated, for certain cervical spine injuries.
