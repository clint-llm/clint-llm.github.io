The management of a pneumothorax is with an interprofessional team that includes an emergency department physician, trauma surgeon, general surgeon, thoracic surgeon, and a critical care specialist. However, the care of these patients is by a nurse. The nurse is responsible for ensuring the patency of the tube that connects to the chest drainage. In addition, the nurse is responsible to wound care and monitoring vital signs. The majority of patients treated promptly for a pneumothoraxÂ have a good outcome. Patients need to be educated about discontinuing smoking, as this habit increases the risk of a pneumothorax.
