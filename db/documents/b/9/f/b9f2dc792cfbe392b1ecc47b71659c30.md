The majority of coronary artery anomalies are benign, incidental findings that require no treatment. For symptomatic anomalies, treatment is dictated by the nature of the specific anomaly.

ALCAPA treatment in infants requires surgical reimplantation of the anomalous artery to restore two coronary circulation.

Treatment of hemodynamically significant interarterial coronary artery anomalies, such as an origin from the contralateral coronary sinus with an intramural course, involves surgical unroofing of the intramural portion of the anomalous artery or coronary artery bypass grafting.

Coronary artery fistulas have a spontaneous closure rate of only 1 to 2%.

Intrinsic anomalies,Â including an intramyocardial course and a subendocardial course, generally do not require treatment.
