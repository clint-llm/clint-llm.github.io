Vitamin E works as an antioxidant, immunomodulation, and antiplatelet effects.

**Antioxidant Effect**

Vitamin E prevents propagated oxidation of saturated fatty acids within membranes. Also, vitamin E may prevent oxidative changes to LDLs, reducing coronary heart diseases.

**Immunomodulation**

Vitamin E decreases the production of prostaglandin E2 and serum lipid peroxides while enhancing lymphocyte proliferation.

**Antiplatelet Effect**

Vitamin E inhibits platelet adhesion by preventing oxidative changes to LDLs and inhibition of platelet aggregation by reducing prostaglandin E2. Another effect is inhibiting protein kinase C causing smooth-muscle proliferation.

Even though research has shown that vitamin E assists with the prevention of heart disease and atherosclerosis, it has not been approved for this use by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
