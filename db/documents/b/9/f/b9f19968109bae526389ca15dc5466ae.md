Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis, although rare, can present acutely with symptoms in keeping with acute ascending cholangitis. When severe, patients can present in a life-threatening condition. Specific guidelines for the management of acute recurrent pyogenic cholangitis do not exist per se, but guidelines for initial management of acute ascending cholangitis remain relevant given the clinical overlap. Management bundles such as these facilitate a standard approach to the disease across sites, encourage optimized local protocols, and provide a framework within which a clinician can provide excellent patient care.

The Tokyo Guidelines (2018) are a series of management bundles for acute cholangitis and cholecystitis. They include a helpful stepwise approach to the management of acute cholangitis, taking into account the severity of presentation, as well as providing guidance on when to consider drainage procedures and transfer to more specialist centers. Frameworks such as the Tokyo Guidelines can improve patient prognosis if used appropriately. Still, it is important to be aware that advanced management of pyogenic cholangitis does differ from acute ascending cholangitis, so these guidelines should be used with care and by appropriately trained clinicians.
