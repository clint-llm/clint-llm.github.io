Because indeed, “all disasters are local,” individuals and locales are expected to be wholly self-sustaining following a disaster for 72 hours. This sustenance includes food, water, shelter, medication, and other personal or local necessities. Once federal resources are deployed they are intended to supplement, but not replace, local resources and local governments maintain control of all assets used for disaster response. Federal and local disaster recovery assets (including specially trained personnel and equipment) can, and should be, deployed and staged in advance of imminent disasters so that recovery response is accessible to the areas most affected promptly.

Generally, disaster response is thought to be directly proportional to the need generated by the disaster. However, evaluation of responses to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria revealed that Puerto Rico was not equitably compensated when compared to Florida and Houston in the aftermath of each disaster. Disproportionate compensation decreases health equity in the wake of a disaster.

Resiliency is another concept that has been promulgated in disaster research. Disaster recovery actually starts with disaster preparation. Communities who treat disaster response along a continuum of time that begins before disasters happen have better long term health and recovery after disasters occur.
