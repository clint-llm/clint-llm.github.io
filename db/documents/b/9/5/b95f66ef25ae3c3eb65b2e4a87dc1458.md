Loeffler syndrome is a rare disorder, and its presentation may be vague. However, it is important to keep the diagnosis in mind because, without prompt treatment, the disorder is progressive with a poor outcome. An interprofessional team that includes a cardiologist, cardiac surgeon, rheumatologist, internist, and cardiac care nurse is ideal for managing these patients. After valve replacement, the cardiac surgery nurse is responsible for monitoring the patient until discharge.

It's important to diagnose it earlier and closely follow up with the patient even though they are asymptomatic. Based on isolated case reports, the outcomes of most patients with Loeffler syndrome are good to excellent.
