Polycythemia vera-related complications and mortality are related to thrombosis, hemorrhage, peptic ulcer disease, myelofibrosis, acute leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

Thrombosis is a major complication of polycythemia vera (PV), and current treatment recommendations aim to minimize these risks. In the setting of a first thrombotic event, an appropriate dose and length of anticoagulation are recommended. There is currently no difference in treatment recommendations for patients with underlying PV.

Bleeding is another common complication of the disease process, but major bleeding is rare. The risk for bleeding increases with severe thrombocytosis and high-dose aspirin (more than 100 mg/day) or anticoagulation.

Myelofibrosis worsens with the progression of the disease. Recommended treatment for secondary myelofibrosis is the same as primary myelofibrosis. Transformation to myelodysplasia and acute leukemia yields a poor prognosis. Treatment is the same as primary MDS and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
