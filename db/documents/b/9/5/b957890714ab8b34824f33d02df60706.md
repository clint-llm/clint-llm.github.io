The innervation of arterioles mainly derives from the sympathetic autonomic nervous system. Sympathetic nerves form plexuses along the surfaces of the large arteries and run through the smaller arterioles as single, very tiny filaments and more exclusive branches distributed exclusively to the muscular tissue after penetrating the outer coat. The principal role of this sympathetic innervation is controlling the total peripheral resistance, thereby maintaining the upstream mean arterial pressure essential for organ perfusion. Sympathetic fibers are also extensively distributed in the precapillary sphincter and control localized flow by either contraction or relaxation.
