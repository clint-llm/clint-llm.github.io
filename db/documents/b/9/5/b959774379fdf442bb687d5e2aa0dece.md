Training of team members is vital to achieving the ROSC of a patient. This training should consist of fostering familiarity with medication doses, designating roles in a code, and strengthening the ability to perform high-quality CPR. A team leader is responsible for the coordination of individuals involved in resuscitation, and institutions should have education protocols in place to attain basic level training for all staff. Preparation in anticipation of an event and good leadership, and clear, concise communication are high predictors of CPR quality and, by extension, an increased likelihood of a positive outcome.
