Mycoplasma species are the smallest living organisms that can survive alone in nature. There are over 120 Mycoplasma species; only 13 have been isolated from humans, and only four are known to cause disease in humans. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is the pathogen most commonly associated with disease in humans. It is a short rod with no cell wall; therefore, it is not visible on the Gram stain. It can be isolated on media supplemented with serum. However, it is fastidious, and isolation is not usually performed in clinical laboratories.
