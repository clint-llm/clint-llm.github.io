Docusate is administered either orally (in the form of a tablet, capsule, liquid, syrup) or rectally (suppositories, enema).

Oral docusate sodium is administered once daily or in divided doses, while docusate calcium dosing is once a day.

Rectal enema dosing can be one to three times daily.

As a ceruminolytic, the liquid docusate is administered intra-aurally via a syringe and can require irrigation with lukewarm saline.
