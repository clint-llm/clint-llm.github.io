As with most physiologic processes, the structure of an organ largely defines the function it contributes to the body. The gastric wall is specifically designed to aid in the formation of a transient acidic environment that allows for the digestion of food into a semisolid mixture called chyme. The stomach organ has four regions; fundus, cardia, body, and pylorus. The inner surface of the stomach is rugated to increase the surface area of the gastric mucosa allowing for gastric expansion with food ingestion. The wall of the stomach consists of four different tissue layers; mucosal layer, submucosa, muscularis externa, and adventitia/serosa. The gastric mucosal layer further subdivides into three layers; the surface epithelium, a connective tissue layer called the lamina propria, and the muscularis mucosa. The gastric epithelial layer invaginates into the lamina propria forming the gastric pits and glands. These gastric glands are lined with four specialized cells; surface mucous cells (foveolar cells), parietal cells, chief cells, and neuroendocrine cells (G-cells or ECL-like cells) that all contribute independent functions.

The surface mucus cells (foveolar cells) are mucus-producing cells that primarily line the gastric mucosa. The secreted mucus acts as a barrier to the corrosive nature of the gastric acid. The rest of the specialized cells are found deep within the gastric glands (i.e., gastric pits).

- **Parietal cells**are specialized secretory epithelial cells that secrete gastric acid (HCl formation) into the lumen of the stomach through the gastric pits, primarily in the fundus. In addition to secreting HCl, the parietal cells secrete a protein called intrinsic factor. Intrinsic factor is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12 in the terminal ileum of the small intestines. Three regulating molecules control these cells: acetylcholine (enteric nervous innervation) via muscarinic receptors, histamines (neuroendocrine cells) to histamine receptors, and gastrin (neuroendocrine cells) to gastrin receptors. All receptors appear on the basal side of the parietal cells, and they control a protein channel called H+/K+ ATPase on the lumenal side of the parietal cell. This protein transports one proton into the gastric lumen while intaking one K+ ion. Chloride ions follow the proton gradient via K+/Cl- channel into the gastric lumen leading to the formation of HCl.

- **Chief cells**are specialized secretory cells found at the base of the gastric glands within the fundus of the stomach that secrete the zymogen called pepsinogen. Pepsinogen is the inactive form of a proteolytic enzyme called pepsin, which is needed to digest proteins into small units called polypeptides. The zymogen pepsinogen only becomes activated by the gastric acid produced by the parietal cells. This mechanism acts as a safety measure to ensure the proteins found outside of the gastric lumen are not digested inappropriately. Chief cells are stimulated by cholinergic activity from the parasympathetic and by the hormone Gastrin.

- **Neuroendocrine cells**(i.e., enterochromaffin-like cells, or G-cells)Â are also found in the gastric glands on the gastric mucosa that secretes various molecules that aid in the production of gastric acid.
- The **ECL-like cell**s produce and secrete Histamine when stimulated by a hormone called gastrin, which indirectly increases the HCl production byway of histamines' direct actions on the parietal cells. ECL-like cells are primarily located in the fundus of the stomach.
- **G-cells**are located in the pylorus region of the stomach, and they produce the neuroendocrine hormone called gastrin. Gastrin is capable of indirectly and directly increasing HCl production by two mechanisms. The first is by stimulation of the ECL-like cells to release Histamine, which then potentiates Parietal cells. The second is by direct stimulation of the Parietal cells themselves. Both mechanisms increase the H+/K+ ATPase activity.
- **D-cells**are located in the pylorus of the stomach, and they secrete an inhibitory molecule called Somatostatin. D cells are activated when the stomach lumen reaches a certain level of acidity. Somatostatin then acts to suppress the release of gastrin, reducing the overall production of gastric acid.

Compared to other organs of the GI tract, the stomach is unique in that its muscularis externa features an inner oblique layer in addition to a circular and longitudinal layer. Exterior to the submucosa is the submucosal Meissner's plexus, which controls secretions and blood flow. In between the circular and longitudinal layers of the muscularis externa is the myenteric Auerbach's plexus, which controls GI motility.

The right and left gastric arteries, left and right gastro-omental arteries, and short gastric arteries are responsible for blood supply to the stomach. Celiac ganglia and the vagus nerve innervate the stomach. The vagus nerve serves as an essential link between the brain and the gut respective to appetite control, acid secretion, and gastric motility.
