Formalin (i.e., formaldehyde 4%–10%) has been studied and used to treat chronic radiation proctitis for over 20 years.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has reasonable evidence to support its use for radiation proctitis.

Surgery is reserved for patients who did not show improvement in their symptoms following the above medical and endoscopic interventions. It is also used for some of the more severe complications which are associated with radiation proctitis, including strictures that may lead to large bowel obstruction, fistulas, or even perforation. Studies have estimated that only 10% of patients with radiation proctitis will ultimately require operative intervention.
