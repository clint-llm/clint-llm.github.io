While no effective treatment for FA exists, multiple therapies are being developed toÂ increase frataxin levels, such as protein and gene replacement therapies, antioxidants, iron chelators, and inflammation modulators.

**Gene Therapy**

There is ongoing research into the mechanism of gene silencing of the expanded frataxin gene to develop a treatment for FA. While medications involved in iron chelation and antioxidants are being studied, gene therapy is considered the best chance of altering the disease course.

**Iron Chelation**

- Deferiprone - An iron chelator, deferiprone, is used to reduce iron accumulation in mitochondria.

**Antioxidants**

- Idebenone - A synthetic form of coenzyme Q10, idebenone is a free radical scavenger used in FA to combat free radical damage.

- Coenzyme Q10

- Vitamin E

- Vitamin B2 (riboflavin)

- Vitamin B1 (thiamine)

**Inflammatory Modulators**

- INF-gamma

- Phosphodiesterase inhibitors

- Steroids
