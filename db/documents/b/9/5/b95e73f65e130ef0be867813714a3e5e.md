Spider angioma, also known as spider naevus or spider telangiectasia, is a vascular lesion characterized by anomalous dilatation of end vasculature found just beneath the skin surface. The lesion contains a central, red spot and reddish extensions which radiate outward like a spider's web. They may appear as multiple or solitary lesions. A spider angioma has 3 features: a body, legs, and surrounding erythema. The body appears as a 1 to 10 mm central arteriole visible as a punctum or eminence. It is typically painless, resembles a spider's body), and is surrounded by attenuated capillaries radiating in a spider-legged fashion, decreasing in size toward the margins.
