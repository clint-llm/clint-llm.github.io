Von Willebrand disease is estimated to affect approximately 1% of the unselected population, but clinically significant disease prevalence is estimated to be about 125 per million, with severe disease affecting up to five per million.

There is an equal distribution between males and females. Acquired von Willebrand disease prevalence is unknown but may represent 1% to 5% of all von Willebrand disease. Its prevalence is higher in certain groups. For example, it has been reported in up to 20% of malignancies and up to 100% of certain high flow states such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and metallic cardiac valves.
