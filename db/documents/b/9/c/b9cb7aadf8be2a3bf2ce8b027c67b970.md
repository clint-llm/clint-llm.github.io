Hearing loss in the elderly is multifactorial, and a basic understanding of the pathophysiology of normal hearing is key to diagnosing the various etiologies of hearing loss. Normally, the external ear’s primary function is to funnel and localize the sound wave into the ear. The middle ear then amplifies and transfers the sound wave from air to the fluid-filled inner ear. Lastly, the inner ear transduces mechanical energy from sound waves to electrochemical stimuli as an action potential to the cochlear nucleus of the brain.

While there are countless causes of hearing loss in the elderly, pathophysiology for major causes is reviewed below:

Age-Related Hearing Loss (ARHL), or Presbycusis: An often-bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, with a broad, multifactorial etiology, including genetics, noise-exposure, microvascular changes with age, and alterations in metabolism.

Noise-induced: A generally bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, though it can be unilateral when the source of sound is greater from one side, such as in the case of shooting rifles.

Cerumen impaction/external auditory canal debris: A unilateral or bilateral conductive non-pathologic hearing loss, causing the inability of sound to reach the middle and inner ear structures adequately. This condition may present suddenly (as cerumen accumulates to a perceptible level of change in hearing) and often demonstrates subjective normalization of a patient’s hearing and tuning fork exam after debris removal.

Canal cholesteatoma: A typically unilateral conductive hearing loss, which may be acquired (following trauma or inflammation) or spontaneous. Often the result of a localized area of abnormal squamous epithelium proliferation in the canal wall.

Otosclerosis: This condition is becoming less common and often presents as unilateral (although often with gradual contralateral ear involvement) conductive hearing loss, resulting from labyrinthine sclerosis, which leads to stapes fixation and thus an inability to transmit sound waves from the tympanic membrane to the inner ear.
