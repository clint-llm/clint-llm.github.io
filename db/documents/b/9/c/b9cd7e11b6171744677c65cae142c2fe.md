A thorough history needs to be obtained to help diagnose urinary incontinence. The clinician should ask for this information directly since the patient may be too embarrassed to talk about symptoms of increased frequency, urgency, or dysuria. Signs may include hesitancy, slow stream, straining to void, incomplete emptying, or wetting pads or clothes. Details about the nature of incontinence are invaluable. These can include duration, precipitating events, voiding frequency, and fluid intake. Many validating questionnaires can assess symptomatic effects on daily living. Comorbidities and confounding factors should also be explored. Medications that affect urinary incontinence should be reviewed, particularly cholinergic drugs and diuretics. Lack of estrogen during perimenopause or postmenopause should also be discussed. Bladder diaries may be used by both patient and physician for objective means of quantifying incontinence.

The focus on the physical exam on patients with mixed incontinence should focus on abdominal and pelvic areas. A large panniculus, prior surgical incisions, and suprapubic muscle tone should be noted. The patient should be examined with both a full and empty bladder in standing and supine positions. The grade of uterine, vaginal prolapse should be assessed along with obvious stress urinary incontinence with coughing.
