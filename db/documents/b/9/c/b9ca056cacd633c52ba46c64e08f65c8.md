**Antibiotics**

In a clean, non-contaminated wound, there is no evidence to suggest antibiotics are required.

**Anesthetic**

For superficial and extremity wounds, there is the potential for local anesthetic infiltration. If this is not possible or the clinician believes that more extensive washout and exploration is necessary, then a general or regional anesthetic is required.

**Positioning**

With the wide variety of possible wounds, this should be dynamic, as it will be wound/patient-specific. It should allow for adequate exposure and surgeon comfort while operating.

**Further Considerations**

Limb tourniquets may be required. It would not be recommended to use exsanguination as this could displace the foreign body, simple elevation should suffice.
