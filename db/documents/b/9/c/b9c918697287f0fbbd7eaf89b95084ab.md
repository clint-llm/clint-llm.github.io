A complex cascade of growth factors manages fetal development and growth of our lower extremities expressed successively at various checkpoints during the phase of development. In the process of limb bud formation, mesenchymal cells play a pivotal role in integrating the positional information received from the three axes (proximal-distal axis, anteroposterior axis, and dorsal-ventral axis).

The process of embryogenesis usually happens between 4Â to 8 weeks post-fertilization, and it has been noticed that the majority of congenital anomalies had occurred during this time of interval only. Congenital femoral deficiency represents a dysplastic phenomenon that involves a broad spectrum of femoral involvement ranging from the short hypoplastic femur to the complete absence of proximal femur. This dysplasia leads to abnormal gait, impaired childhood growth, psychosocial, behavioral changes, and cosmetic implications.
