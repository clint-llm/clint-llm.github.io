One of the most accepted theories for the development of DIPG is a mutation in the H3 gene. Mutations in the N-terminal tail of histone H3 gene have been recently found in midline pontine high-grade gliomas and at a high frequency in DIPG. Substitution of the lysine at position 27 of the H3 encoding gene is the driving force behind DIPG oncogenesis.
