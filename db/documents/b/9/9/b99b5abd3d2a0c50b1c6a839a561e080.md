Clinical pathology caused by Angiostrongylus cantonensis is localized to CNS. In the CNS, these flukes produce an intense inflammatory response with eosinophilic reaction, resulting in the classic presentation of eosinophilic meningitis. When the inflammation is more severe or affects other areas of the CNS, it will result in cranial nerve deficits, radiculitis, encephalitis, and death. The eye may occasionally be the site of infection.
