Since pulmonary edema is a result of complex physiologic derangements, be it cardiac, hepatic, multiorgan system involvement, toxic stimuli, the complications arising from it are generally secondary to the aforementioned pathophysiologic processes. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema can progress to respiratory failure requiring the utilization of a mechanical ventilator. ARDS is a complication of acute lung injury with progressive hypoxemia, also requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.
