A baseline serum BUN/creatinine should be obtained with subsequent periodical follow-up blood tests during chronic therapy to monitor for effects on renal function. Since elderly patients may have impaired renal function, which may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests like BUN or serum creatinine, a creatinine clearance determination is more advantageous.

Prompt discontinuation of the drug should occur with any signs of renal or otologic damage.
