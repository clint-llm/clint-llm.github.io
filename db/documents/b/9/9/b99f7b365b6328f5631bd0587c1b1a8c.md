Sometimes, an accessory medial pterygoid muscle is also present as a separate muscle near the deep head of the medial pterygoid muscle. Its origin is from the posterior end of the superior border of the lateral pterygoid plate near foramen ovale and merges with the fibers of the medial pterygoid muscle. The merging occurs either on the middle region of the medial surface of the deep head of medial pterygoid muscle or the superior border of the deep head of medial pterygoid muscle near its tendinous portion approximately 1-2cm beyond the point of exit of the muscle from pterygoid fossae.

This accessory muscle is flat and triangular, 2 cm long with its narrowest part towards the insertion. The function is unknown; however, there have been suggestions that it assists the medial pterygoid muscle in lateral jaw positioning during protrusion and closure.
