According to the study by Kulkarni et al., the average union time for tibial and femur fractures in floating knee injuries was 9.52 (+/-6.6) and 10.5 (+/-7.37) months respectively in a population of 89 patients aged 34.34 (+/- 12.28) years. Segmental femur fractures showed a delay in union time by about six months. This delay did not manifest in segmental tibial fractures. Over 50% of these patients had either an excellent or good outcome. Factors accounting for poor outcomes included open tibial fractures and those that required external fixation, segmental fractures, fractures involving the articular surface of the knee joint, and the requirement of additional surgeries to address the injuries.
