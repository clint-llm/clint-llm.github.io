In PV, specimens should be obtained by scraping the periphery of a scaling lesion to optimize fungal yield for direct microscopy. Before staining, a 10% potassium hydroxide solution is then applied to dissolve keratin and debris. Under light microscopy, visualization of spores and hyphae are diagnostic and classically appear as "spaghetti and meatballs." Although direct microscopy is preferred, a biopsy is an option as well. After staining with periodic acid-Schiff or methenamine silver, short hyphae and round budding along with pigment incontinence may be visible in the stratum corneum and keratinocytes.

A biopsy taken of SD may show findings characteristic of one of two stages. Acutely, superficial perivascular and perifollicular inflammatory infiltrates, spongiosis, psoriasiform hyperplasia, and parakeratosis around follicular opening may appear. Chronic lesions may appear similar to psoriasis, displaying psoriasiform hyperplasia and parakeratosis with dilation of venules of the surface plexus.

On biopsy, Malassezia folliculitis will show a follicle dilated by suppurative inflammation with a few small yeast forms. Sometimes budding and a few hyphae may present. Nonspecific findings occur seen in atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.
