Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (HOA) is mainly caused by mainly fibrovascular proliferation. It is characterized by a combination of clinical findings, including severe disabling arthralgia and arthritis, digital clubbing, and periostosis of tubular bones with or without synovial effusion. It can occur as an autosomal dominant condition called pachydermoperiostosis, but more commonly, it occurs as a secondary manifestation of a chronic pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease or malignancy. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy and reviews the interprofessional team's role in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy.
- Describe the typical presentation of a patient with hypertrophic osteoarthropathy.
- Outline the treatment options available for hypertrophic osteoarthropathy.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to expedite the diagnosis of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy and improve outcomes.
