People with secondary hypertension are commonly diagnosed incidentally or they present with resistant hypertension and end-organ dysfunction. The diagnosis and management of secondary hypertension require a multidisciplinary team and collaborative efforts. An inter-professional communication plays a key role in identifying the etiology of secondary hypertension and treating the condition effectively. A comprehensive team including a hypertension nurse, a primary care physician, a cardiologist, a nephrologist, a neurologist, an endocrinologist, a cardiovascular surgeon, and a rheumatologist, is of prime importance for the management of secondary hypertension. This collaborative effort is the key to improving the patient long-term outcomes of secondary hypertension and minimizing the economic burden on the healthcare system.
