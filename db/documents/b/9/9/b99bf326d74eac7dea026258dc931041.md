Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, or RDS, is a common cause of respiratory distress in a newborn, presenting within hours after birth, most often immediately after delivery. RDS primarily affects preterm neonates, and infrequently, term infants. The incidence of RDS is inversely proportional to the gestational age of the infant, with more severe disease in the smaller and more premature neonates. While treatment modalities, including antenatal corticosteroids, surfactants, andÂ advanced respiratory care of the neonate, have improved the outcomes for patients affected by RDS, it continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the preterm infant.
