Metatarsal fractures are relatively common injuries of the foot. The main goal of treatment is to restore theÂ alignment of all metatarsals, hence maintaining the arches of the forefoot and thereby resulting in the distribution of a normal weight under the head of metatarsals. If properly managed, these injuries are easy to treat and have a favorable prognosis.
