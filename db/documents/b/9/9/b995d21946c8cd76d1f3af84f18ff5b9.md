Anemia can result from many events.

-  Blood loss is the most prevalent cause of anemia, causing a direct loss of RBCs. It is the most common cause of acute anemia seen in the ER.

- Emergent conditions include traumatic injury resulting in arterial bleeding, ruptured aneurysm, massive upper or lower gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage, ruptured ectopic pregnancy,  and disseminated intravascular coagulation.

- Hemolytic anemias can also cause either acute or chronic anemia. There are numerous causes, which result in reduced survival of RBCs.

One way to classify hemolytic anemias is intracorpuscular (the defect is within the RBC itself) versus extracorpuscular (the problem is external to the RBC).

- **Intracorpuscular**:
- Affecting the hemoglobin (hemoglobinopathies): Sickle cell disease (caused by a point mutation on the DNA of the beta-globin chain resulting in Hgb S) which causes the Hgb S to polymerize and sickle in response to oxidative stress, alpha and beta thalassemias
- Enzymopathies: RBC enzyme abnormalities including the following: 

- Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (a deficiency which affects the pentose pathway)
- Hemophilia A (caused by factor VIII deficiency) in which severe bleeding is common
- Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiencies
- Phosphofructokinase deficiency
- Phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency
- Aldolase deficiency
- Triosephosphate isomerase deficiency
- Membrane-cytoskeletal defects - Hereditary spherocytosis or hereditary elliptocytosis
- Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)

- 
**Extracorpuscular:**
            
              
- Familial (atypical) hemolytic-uremic syndrome - Familial (atypical) hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) caused due to mutations in any one of several genes encoding complement regulatory proteins.
              
              
- Mechanical destruction (microangiopathic)
- Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)  is a trio of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, severe thrombocytopenia, and organ ischemia, all of which are caused by platelet-rich thrombi; the cause of TTP is a deficiency in ADAMTS13 (a metalloprotease)
- HUS: characteristic presentation is by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure. It is similar to TTP, but lesions are limited to the kidney

- In children, the pathology may present after diarrheal illness caused by Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Shigella species, or viral gastroenteritis.
- In adults, it may be precipitated by pregnancy or estrogen use; uremia may also lead to bleeding resulting from abnormal platelet function


- complement-mediated Thrombotic microangiopathy


              
              
- Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP): caused by IgG autoantibodies binding to platelets, which subsequently get destroyed in the spleen; when platelet counts get very low, bleeding occurs
              
              
- Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC}: a condition in which systemic activation of coagulation occurs, resulting in the formation of intravascular fibrin, which initially causes thrombosis then is followed by bleeding due to consumption of coagulation factors.
              
              
- Toxic agents and Drugs: hyperbaric oxygen (or 100% oxygen), methyldopa, nitrates, chlorates, methylene blue, dapsone, cisplatin, and numerous aromatic (cyclic) compounds; other chemicals include arsine, stibine, copper, and lead
              
              
- Infectious: malaria is the most common cause of hemolytic anemia. In other parts of the world, Shiga toxin–producing E. coli O157:H7 causing hemolytic uremic syndrome; in patients with open wounds, septic abortion, or who received contaminant blood, Clostridium perfringens sepsis can induce life-threatening hemolysis due to the action of a toxin with lecithinase activity
              
              
- Autoimmune hemolytic anemia: can be associated with autoimmune diseases (e.g., lupus, certain types of lymphomas and leukemias), is drug-induced, or, most times there is no identifiable cause. Hemolysis is caused by immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibody binding to the RBCs, resulting in macrophages attacking the RBCs' membrane, changing their shape to spherocytes, which undergo destruction more rapidly
              
              
- Hypersplenism
