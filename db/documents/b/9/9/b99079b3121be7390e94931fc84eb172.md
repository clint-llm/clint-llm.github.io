The lower limbs form in the fourth week of prenatal development. They develop in a cranial to caudal direction. Ossification centers form in the tibia around the sixth week, and during the seventh or eighth week in the fibula. Each bone forms via endochondral ossification. The fusion of the ossification centers starts around the sixteenth year of life, with the proximal ossification center fusing before the distal ossification centers. The fusion of the ossification centers completes normal bone growth.
