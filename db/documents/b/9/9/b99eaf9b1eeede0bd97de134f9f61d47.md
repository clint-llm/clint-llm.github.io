Overall, the risk of death from bupropion toxicity is relatively low, with eight reported deaths from US poison center data in 2020 despite almost 17,000 reported cases.

Co-ingestion with benzodiazepines decreased the odds of having a seizure (OR 0.32); however, the role of treating bupropion overdose patients with prophylactic benzodiazepines is unclear. Another retrospective study of 423 patients found that tachycardia (120 bpm or 20 greater than the age-adjusted upper limit of normal in pediatric patients) was found to have OR 6.7 of having a seizure at some point during hospitalization, while altered mental status increased risk with OR 3.9. No patients who seized were asymptomatic at the time of presentation to ED.

In a retrospective analysis of 30,026 adolescent overdoses, when compared to SSRI overdose, bupropion overdose was associated with increased risk of death (0.23% vs. 0%), seizures (27% vs. 8.5%), and multiple major outcomes such as the need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, intubation, vasopressors, and need for benzodiazepine treatment. This study suggests a higher risk for morbidity and mortality with bupropion overdose than SSRI overdose in adolescents.
