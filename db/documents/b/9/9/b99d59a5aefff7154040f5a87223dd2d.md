Dubin-Johnson syndrome is a rare and benign condition but it is not easy to diagnose. the condition is often misdiagnosed with gallstone disease, and patients are unnecessarily subject to surgery. For this reason, patients should be managed by an interprofessional team. It is essential to diagnose the disorder and to eliminate other conditions that may lead to hepatic injury. A team approach is an ideal way to limit invasive testing, proper management when needed, and correct diagnosis. When assessing for Dubin-Johnson syndrome, the patient should have the following done:

- Evaluated by the gastroenterologist or hepatologist to rule out other potentially harmful disorders

- Be taught by the nurse of possible precipitating factors

- Be consulted by the pharmacist for management of severe neonatal Dubin-Johnson syndrome

- The pharmacist should educate the patient that no drug treatment is necessary and medications like phenobarbital may in fact worsen the hyperbilirubinemia.

With a team approach, the outcomes of DJC can be improved.
