The prognosis for most of the patients with otitis media is excellent.

Children who develop complications can be difficult to treat and tend to have high rates of recurrence. Intratemporal and intracranial complications, while very rare, have significant mortality rates.

Children with a history of prelingual otitis media are at risk for mild-to-moderate conductive hearing loss. Children with otitis media in the first 24 months of life often have difficulty perceiving strident or high-frequency consonants, such as sibilants.
