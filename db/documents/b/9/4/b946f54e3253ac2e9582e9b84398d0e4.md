Interestingly, there has been a study in the literature describing the use of ultrasound in identifying complications of mastoiditis. In a patient population of 10, ultrasound was able to identify complications in 9 of the cases.

Currently, CT scan is the standard of care; however, given the promising results from this study, consideration should be given to further research efforts aimed at using ultrasound to identify complications of mastoiditis; this is especially important in the pediatric population as it can prevent unnecessary CT scan radiation exposure. Even if ultrasound only serves as an adjunct to screening patients who will ultimately receive a CT scan, the benefit is tremendous for the pediatric population and overall healthcare costs.
