More than a third of the current population of the United States is obese. With increasing obesity, the prevalence of OHS is assumed to be on the rise. The prevalence of morbid obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 40 kg/m^2) is 8% among adults in the United States.

The prevalence of OHS in a community-based cohort is unknown, but we can get a rough estimate based on the above data for obesity prevalence. The prevalence of OHS in individuals with OSA is estimated to be between 20 to 30%.
