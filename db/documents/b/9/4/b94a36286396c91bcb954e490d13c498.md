The majority of HPV infection within cutaneous keratinocytes is cleared in the general population without progression to malignancy. In the general population, infection with HPV types 3 and 10 are mainly associated with development of verruca vulgaris.TMC6/EVER1 or TMC8/EVER2 account for over 50% of the mutations which are responsible for the inherited form of EV.TMC6/EVER1 or TMC8/EVER2 are transmembrane channel proteins that serve to limit and restrict viral replication and gene expression of beta-HPV within keratinocytes.
