Diagnostic criteria for a positive GI bleeding scan include all of the following:

- Detection of radionuclide activity outside of the expected blood pool structures

- Increasing intensity of the radionuclide activity on successive images

- Movement of activity conforming to bowel loops

Typically, 99mTc-RBCs distribute within vascular structures. A small amount of activity can present in the bladder due to the presence of free 99m Tc-pertechnetate. Considerable bowel bleeding is identifiable with its linear pattern and peripheral location in the abdomen. Sigmoid bleed scan appears as S-shaped. Small bowel bleed can be differentiated with its rapid curvilinear pattern of activity and central location. Factors associated with low bleeding include; detection of activity after one hour, low target to background ratio (less intense than liver), and short bleeding duration. Factors indicating higher bleeding rates include early and intense activity with longer durations.
