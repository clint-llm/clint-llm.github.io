Patients with alcohol or other substance misuse disorders often have complex presentations of addictive behaviors and medical comorbidities, making these patients uniquely challenging to treat. Because of the complex nature of these patients, communication failures can lead to missed therapeutic opportunities. Given the shift in healthcare to a more patient-centered approach and positive association between high-quality communication with a health care provider and improved patient outcomes,Â it is essential to acknowledge and assess factors that generate dissonance between the patient and the physician.
