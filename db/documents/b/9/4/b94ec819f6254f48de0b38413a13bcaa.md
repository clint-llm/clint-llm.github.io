Austwick and Copland stimulated the production of zoospore and proposed that zoospore plays an important role in pathogenesis.

These zoospores encyst on wounded tissues and secrete glycoproteins which facilitate adhesion on the surface.  The host body temperature further acts as a stimulus for these zoospores. As a result, hyphae are formed, which extend on the infected tissue and penetrate the blood vessels. The high incidence of Pythium keratitis in thalassemia patients is probably due to iron overload, and hemochromatosis can be another major predisposing factor. The phagocytic action of TNF-a, IFN-c, macrophages, and neutrophil production is also inhibited due to iron overload.

Udnaen et al. showed that IFN-c production is lowered by monocytes and macrophages in these patients in response to zoospore exposure. This indicates that T helper 1 (Th1) cell response is inhibited, which is responsible for the increased susceptibility of infection in these patients. It has also been postulated that Pythium induces T helper 2 (Th2) cells, and antigen immunotherapy stimulates the immune modulation from Th 2 to Th1 response, which is thought to be curative in thalassemia patients.  Another hypothesis is that Pythium has a gene encoding ferrochelatase which is thought to be responsible for high virulence in these patients.
