Nurses should ensure that the patient has signed the consent. Even though the procedure is of relatively short duration, the patient requires monitoring by a nurse. During the procedure, the patient must remain still, and the nurse should take measures to avoid unnecessary anxiety. After the procedure, the patient is monitored by the nurse for a few hours before discharge.
