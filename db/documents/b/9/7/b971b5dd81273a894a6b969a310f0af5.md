Patients with a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment may present with a history of a large number of new-onset floaters.Â  They may also have significant photopsia (flashes of light) in their vision.

Essential aspects of the physical exam include getting the patient's best-corrected visual acuity of each eye, checking the pupillary reaction of each eye and ensuring that there is no relative afferent pupillary defect,

The practitioner should complete a slit lamp examination of the anterior segment to look for any abnormalities. A dilated fundoscopic examination should then follow. Important findings include pigment in the anterior vitreous (Schaffer sign) or vitreous hemorrhage. An ophthalmologist or optometrist should repeat the fundoscopic examination with indirect ophthalmoscopy with scleral depression so that the entire retina is visualizable up to the ora Serrata and the examiner can identify any breaks or tears.
