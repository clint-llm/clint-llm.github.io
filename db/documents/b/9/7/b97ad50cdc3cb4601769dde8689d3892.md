The differential diagnosis initially established by the evaluating provider will likely vary based on the initial clinical presentation. Patients who present with epigastric abdominal pain symptoms with or without associated variation based on meals may be thought to have gastritis, pancreatitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), cholecystitis, or cholelithiasis, biliary colic, and may even be evaluated for possible cardiac etiology with atypical presentation.
