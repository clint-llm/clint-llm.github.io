Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a viable treatment for symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee refractory to conservative measures. In those with end-stage degenerative changes compromising the articular cartilage affecting multiple compartments of the knee, the literature has yet to identify a potentially viable alternative option for the regeneration of cartilage. TKA has shown reproducible, long-term, successful results in patients as demonstrated by outcomes such as decreased pain and improved overall quality of life. This activity reviews the indications, complications, and techniques for total knee arthroplasty and highlights the role of interprofessional providers in managing patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the techniques for total knee arthroplasty.
- Review the indications for total knee arthroplasty.
- Identify the complications of total knee arthroplasty.
- Explain a structured, interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to and appropriate surveillance of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty.
