**Imaging**

Standard radiographs will include an AP and lateral of the elbow and humerus. For the distal humerus, the AP should be taken with the elbow flexed to 40 degrees.

Imaging should be done of the entire forearm as well as humerus to rule out coexisting injuries. Additionally, traction views of the elbow may be beneficial to better characterize fracture fragments.

If suspicion of a coronal shear fracture of the distal humerus, the lateral x-ray is the most important film to obtain, and obtaining a true lateral is paramount. The appearance of the “double-arc sign” is pathognomonic for a coronal shear fracture that most likely extends into the trochlea.

CT is useful with surgical planning and can be especially helpful when there is a shear component to the fracture. There is some support for the use of 3D reconstruction in addition to traditional 2D imaging for improved pre-operative planning.

MRI is not usually indicated for acute injury.

**Classification**

**AO**

- Extra-Articular

- Partial Articular

- Complete Articular

Each of these groups is further broken down into subtypes that signify whether it is simple versus multi-fragmentary as well as the location for the partial articular group.

**Milch**

- Type 1 - Lateral trochlear ridge intact

- Type 2 - Fracture through the lateral trochlear ridge

**Jupiter**

- High-T

- Low-T

- Y

- H

- Medial Lambda

- Lateral Lambda

- Multiplane T
