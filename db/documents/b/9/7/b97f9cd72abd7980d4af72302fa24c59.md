Baseline (pre-treatment) and regular monitoring of cardiac function through echocardiography or multi-gated radionuclide angiography (MUGA scan) are recommended for patients undergoing treatment with doxorubicin. Patients who exhibit a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction during doxorubicin treatment should have the drug discontinued. Endomyocardial biopsy may also be utilized to diagnose doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy; findings include loss of myofibrils and cytoplasm vacuolization. Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment available for patients diagnosed with doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy.

Diuretics and beta-adrenergic blockers are potential options, but these treatments do not improve the overall patient prognosis. Cardiac transplantation has been successful in some patients with doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy. Since higher cumulative doxorubicin doses are a risk factor for the development of cardiomyopathy, dose limitation is advocated to reduce cardiotoxicity. Antioxidant drugs (including amlodipine and carvedilol) have been studied as potential preventive agents to reduce the incidence of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Dexrazoxane, an iron chelator, may be co-administered with doxorubicin to reduce the cardiotoxicity of the drug. However, the administration of dexrazoxane may induce myelosuppression, which can be potentiated by doxorubicin, so its clinical efficacy remains in question.
