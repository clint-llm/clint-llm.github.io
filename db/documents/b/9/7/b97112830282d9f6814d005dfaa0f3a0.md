Rumination syndrome is believed to be an unintentionally acquired habit, possibly a learned adaptation of the belch reflex.

The primary mechanism and key event include an often unperceived increase in the stimulation of all abdominothoracic muscles during eating, resulting in an increase in the intra-abdominal pressure. A concomitant expansion of the chest results in negative intrathoracic pressure.

The simultaneous activation of all abdominothoracic muscles in patients with rumination syndrome can be appreciated as a characteristic "R" or retrograde wave on electromyography. Other contributory mechanisms include gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and belching. Pressures involved in the pathophysiology of GERD are unlikely to cause a spike in pressures as high as those seen in primary rumination, but in the younger population, it might be involved in triggering episodes of rumination considered as "secondary rumination."

The maintenance of rumination is often associated with psychosocial diseases. Several smaller studies suggest that many patients with rumination syndrome have a higher burden of underlying somatic disorders, depression, or anxiety.
