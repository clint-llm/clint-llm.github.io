The differential diagnosis for sclerotic lesions of the spine is wide. Paget disease can be considered in the setting of a vertebral body lesion mimicking a hemangioma; however, cortical thickening is often present with a characteristic “picture frame sign.” Squaring of the vertebra can also be appreciated. Sclerotic metastasis such as in the setting of prostate carcinoma, osteosarcoma, and medullary thyroid carcinoma should also be considered in the differential. Other differentials include lymphoma and multiple myeloma.
