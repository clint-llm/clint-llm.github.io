All patients presenting with a lower GI bleed should be triaged and evaluated immediately and consistently as patients with GI bleeding can decompensate fairly quickly. As with all potential medical resuscitations, the patient's airway and respiratory status should be evaluated first. If there is a concern for the patient's airway, a definitive airway should be secured first. If the patient is maintaining their airway but has had a significant amount of melena or signs of shock, then an airway set up should be nearby as these patients can decompensate rapidly.

During initial evaluation and triage, supplemental oxygen, the establishment of two, large-bore peripheral intravenous (IV) drip feeds, and placement on a cardiopulmonary monitor is a standard approach. An IV infusion of crystalloid can be started immediately to resuscitate a patient. Transfusions should be considered during resuscitation guided by the patient presentation, clinical course, and literature.

Labwork should include a complete blood count (CBC), electrolyte evaluation, liver function tests, lactate levels, and coagulation studies if the patient is on medications that would cause them to be coagulopathic.

The BLEED criteria are able to be applied to any patient with a GI bleed (upper or lower) and easy to remember. The criteria are listed below:

Ongoing **B**leeding: Red bloody emesis / NG aspirate or spontaneous passage of red/maroon blood (not counting formed stool)

**L**ow Systolic Blood Pressure: Less than 100 mmHg not counting orthostatic readings

**E**levated Prothrombin Time: Greater than 1.2 times normal

**E**rratic Mental Status: Any altered level of consciousness from any cause.

Unstable Comorbid **D**isease: Another disease process that would warrant intensive care unit (ICU) admission without the presence of a GI bleed.

The presence of any one factor is considered high-risk with patients having been proven to have a significantly higher risk of in hospital complications. When using the BLEED criteria, it is important to know what was considered positive criteria when studied. Active/ongoing upper GI bleeding was defined as red blood by emesis or nasogastric tube, while coffee ground emesis/nasogastric aspirate was not considered active/ongoing bleeding. Active lower GI bleeding was considered the presence of spontaneous passing of red or maroon blood from the rectum, while formed maroon or black stool was not considered to represent active bleeding. A low systolic blood pressure (SBP) is when the patient's systolic blood pressure is less than 100 mmHg, not including orthostatic readings. The prothrombin time is considered elevated when it is more than 1.2 times the normal. A mental status was considered erratic if there was any documentation of altered consciousness, even if attributable to a secondary cause such as drugs. The unstable comorbid disease criterion was not well defined and was considered the presence of another disease process that would warrant ICU admission in the absence of a GI bleed.
