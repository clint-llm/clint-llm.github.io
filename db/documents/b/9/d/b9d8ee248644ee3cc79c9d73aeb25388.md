The cerebellar vermis development varies between individual and usually complete its formation late in the first half of pregnancy. Some fetuses may achieve vermis development around gestational week 18. Therefore, the diagnosis of DWM based on imaging done before the 16th to 18th week of development may be premature and erroneous. Additionally, during the first half of pregnancy, the cisterna magna has not reached its final anatomy. A relatively wide opening in the cerebellomedullary cistern may not be indicative of vermian dysgenesis at that stage of development. Therefore, the cerebellum should be reevaluated at 20 to 22 postmenstrual weeks to rule out vermian abnormalities.

Karyotype and comprehensive fetal ultrasound should be offered for patients with features of the Dandy-Walker complex.

In the absence of other lesions in the posterior fossa, an isolated prominent cisterna magna may not be clinically significant.
