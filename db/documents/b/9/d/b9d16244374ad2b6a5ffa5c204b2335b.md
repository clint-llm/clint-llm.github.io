Determining the etiology of hypercortisolism is a three-tiered process. First, the presence of true HCM has to be established and confirmed based on clinical manifestations and laboratory test results while excluding differential diagnostic considerations detailed below. This process includes the distinction between true pathologic HCM and pseudo-Cushing syndrome (PCS), also known as physiologic HCM. The utilization of a screening test can help determine the etiology.

After establishing the definitive diagnosis of true pathologic HCM, the next step in etiologic determination should be whether the HCM is ACTH dependent or independent. This evaluation should also include a careful determination of whether the HCM state could have iatrogenic or factitious etiologies.

After resolving the determination of ACTH dependency or independency, the final step of etiologic determination then involves definitive anatomic and pathologic diagnoses.

Iatrogenic Cushing Syndrome: Conservative estimates indicate that over 10 million persons in the United States receive pharmacologic dose glucocorticoids annually, and while all these do not develop HCM, there also evidence that strongly suggests significant under-reporting of both the prevalence and incidence of iatrogenic Cushing syndrome. While iatrogenic Cushing syndrome is the dominant etiologic factor in exogenous Cushing syndrome, it is also important to consider the possibility of the less common factitious Cushing syndrome in this subgroup of HCM.

One large cohort that has evaluated retrospectively identified causes of non-iatrogenic, non-exogenous Cushing syndrome in approximately 630 patients at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center identified the following spread of etiologic entities:

- 68% due to ACTH dependent Cushing disease

- 12% due to ectopic ACTH Cushing syndrome

- 10% due to functional adrenal adenomas

- 8% due to functional adrenal carcinomas

- Less than 1% due to ectopic CRH syndrome

- Less than 1% due to micronodular adrenal hyperplasia

- Less than 1% due to macronodular adrenal hyperplasia and

- Approximately 1.5% due to pseudo-Cushing syndrome states, including major depressive disorder or chronic alcoholism.
