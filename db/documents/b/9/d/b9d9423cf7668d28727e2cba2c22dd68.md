Osteofibrous dysplasia is seen in the first or second decades of life. More than half of all the patients are under 5 years of age. Even neonates may be affected. Osteofibrous dysplasia has a characteristic natural course. The lesion grows progressively until the patient reaches the age of 15 years. After the cessation of skeletal maturation, the lesion becomes stable or may even regress spontaneously. It is infrequent to see a patient with osteofibrous dysplasia over the age of 35 years. Management should include an interprofessional team approach with clinicians, radiologists, nurses, and possibly an oncologist, to improve outcomes.
