The most common type of fracture in the pediatric population is elbow fractures. Most commonly, individuals fall on their outstretched hand. Prompt assessment and management of elbow fractures are critical, as these fractures carry the risk of neurovascular compromise. Supracondylar fracture is the most common fracture in children under seven years, and these constitute approximately 15% of all pediatric fractures. The peak incidence occurs at around 6 years of age, with a male predominance. However, there are many other variants of elbow fractures. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of various types of elbow fractures, and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the most commonly seen varieties of elbow fractures and describe their particular mechanism and pathophysiology.
- Describe a complete workup and examination for the elbow, when presented with a possible elbow fracture.
- Review the various treatment options for elbow fractures based on the type of fracture.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by elbow fractures.
