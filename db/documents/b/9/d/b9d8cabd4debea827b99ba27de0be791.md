Because there is no clear consensus about the precise algorithm for the management of Chiari type I malformation, its treatment remains rather empirical. It encompasses a combination of medical and surgical approaches through a multimodal dynamic strategy.

**Medical therapy**

Medical management in Chiari I is limited and generally confined to symptomatology (e.g., headaches or neck pain). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), muscle relaxants, and physical support collars may provide symptomatic relief. However, these options provide little improvement of less common symptoms, for example, gait disturbance. Meditation, yoga, or mindfulness therapy have also been proposed for addressing pain.

**Surgical strategies**

Surgical treatment is typically reserved for patients who present with severe or worsening symptoms who go on to have a confirmation of cerebellar descent on imaging and a Chiari malformation obstructing CSF flow confirmed by cine MRI. Surgery aims to provide decompression of the restricted cervicomedullary junction, allowing CSF flow to be restored to optimal levels. The main approach involves performing a suboccipital craniectomy at the level of the C1 posterior arch (C1/2 laminectomy), with or without associated duroplasty.
