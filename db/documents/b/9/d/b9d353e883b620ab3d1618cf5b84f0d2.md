Establishing a diagnosis of insufficient sleep syndrome requires ruling out other disorders which can result inÂ curtailed sleep and/or symptoms of daytime sleepiness. The differentials include:

- Sleep-related breathing disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea syndromes, and sleep-related hypoventilation disorders

- Central disorders of hypersomnolence such as narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, or hypersomnia due to a medical condition, medication or substance use, or psychiatric disorder

- Chronic insomnia disorder

- Circadian rhythm sleep disorders

- Affective disorder

- Periodic limb movement disorder

Insufficient sleep can also result in abnormal mean sleep latency test (MSLT) findings of short sleep latency and two or more sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMPS). Hence, a thorough clinical assessment, sleep diaries, and polysomnography are vital in establishing an accurate diagnosis.
