Evaluation of a patient with trauma starts with the primary survey, which consists of the airway, breathing, circulation, disability, and exposure. The secondary survey includes a head-to-toe exam. Findings in the secondary survey may suggest bladder trauma includes pelvic instability, blood at the meatus, significant abdominal and pelvic pain, suprapubic tenderness, high riding prostate, and gross hematuria. An unstable pelvic fracture is associated with a high prevalence of massive internal bleeding into the pelvis and should be stabilized with a pelvic binder before surgical intervention. Peritoneal signs such as rigidity, guarding, and rebound tenderness should raise the suspicion not only for perforated viscus in the abdomen but also intraperitoneal bladder injury. The focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) exam can be used to quickly assess for pericardial, intra-abdominal, and pelvic free fluid; however, FAST exams cannot distinguish between blood and urine. Evaluation of the genitals may reveal blood at the urethral meatus, in which case urethral injury needs to be ruled out before inserting an indwelling catheter. A high riding prostate on a rectal exam is also a concern for urethral injury. Gross hematuria is seen in 67% to 95% of cases and is the most classical symptom associated with bladder trauma.
