The adverse effects of docusate are generally mild. Anorexia, diarrhea, and vomiting are usually associated with excess doses of medication. Abdominal cramping is a reported adverse effect. A rash can present but is rare.

Docusate use is not associated with adverse outcomes in pregnancy, and therefore it is considered safe to use.

However, in one case report, chronic docusate sodium intake in pregnancy demonstrated a correlation with symptomatic hypomagnesemia in the neonate.
