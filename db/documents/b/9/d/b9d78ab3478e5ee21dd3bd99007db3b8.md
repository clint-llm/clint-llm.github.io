Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lung disorder where there is scarring of the lungs from an unknown cause. It is usually a progressive disease with a poor long-term prognosis. The classic features of the disorder include progressive dyspnea and a nonproductive cough. Pulmonary function tests usually reveal restrictive impairment and diminished carbon monoxide diffusing capacity. The diagnosis is clinically aided with imaging tests and a biopsy. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the presentation and pathological progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
- Review the typical examination findings, including laboratory and diagnostic imaging results, expected when evaluating a patient with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, including the newer antifibrotic pharmacologic agents.
- Explain possible interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and improve outcomes.
