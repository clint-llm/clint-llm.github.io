Diagnosis of this headache is almost entirely dependent on history, taking revealing a headache that occurs during sleep and causes awakening, typically in a middle-aged adult. It is important to rule out other primary or secondary headaches causing nocturnal attacks. Regarding turtle headaches specifically, individuals will have a pattern where the headache occursÂ after awakening and then attempting to go back to sleep by pulling the blanket over his/her head. Furthermore, neuroimaging (either in the form of a CT scan of the brain or MRI of the brain) should be obtained in individuals with a new or nocturnal headache to rule out an intracranial mass as the cause. No lab work can assist in the evaluation of these headaches.
