Nintedanib is a small molecule indolinone derivative that binds the tyrosine kinase receptors. The proposed mechanism of action is the restriction of neo-angiogenesis by inhibiting a number of growth factors such as *FGFR, VEGFR, PDGFR, CSF1R, and FLT3.

*FGFR: Fibroblast growth factor receptor; VEGFR: Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor; PDGFR: Platelet-derived growth factor receptor; CSF1R: Colony-stimulating factor-1-receptor; FLT3: Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3.
