The prognosis of gastric cancer correlates with the extent of the tumor and includes both nodal involvement and direct tumor extension beyond the gastric wall.

Over 50% of patients can achieve cure from localized distal gastric cancer, but early-stage disease only accounts for between 10% and 20% of all cases diagnosed in the United States. The remaining gastric cancer patients present with metastatic disease in either regional or distant sites. The overall 5-year survival rate for these patients ranges from almost zero for patients with disseminated disease to nearly 50% for patients with distal, resectable regional disease. Even apparent localized disease only shows a 5-year survival rate in patients with proximal gastric cancer of only 10% to 15%. While therapy for patients with disseminated gastric cancer may result in symptomatic palliation and some prolongation of life, extended remissions remain uncommon.
