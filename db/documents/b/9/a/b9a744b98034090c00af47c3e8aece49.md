Virchow's node, a left supraclavicular lymph node, was first described by German pathologist Rudolf Ludwig Karl Virchow  (1821-1901) in 1848 as a sign of metastatic malignancy mainly from gastric cancer.

Following Virchow's and Troisier's work, researchers have conducted few studies on the anatomic description of Virchow's node. One of those studies by MitZutani et al.

Virchow's node is a lymph node and is a part of the lymphatic system. It is the thoracic duct end node. It receives afferent lymphatic drainage from the left head, neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, and bilateral lower extremities, which eventually drains into the jugulo-subclavian venous junction via the thoracic duct.
