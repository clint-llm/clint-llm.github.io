Postdural puncture headache is a potential complication of a lumbar puncture, with symptoms caused by traction on pain-sensitive structures from low cerebrospinal fluid pressure (intracranial hypotension) following a leak of cerebrospinal fluid at the puncture site. Symptoms of this condition include a bilateral frontal or occipital headache that is worse in the upright position, along with nausea, neck pain, dizziness, visual changes, tinnitius, hearing loss, or radicular symptoms in the arms. This activity outlines the diagnosis and management of postdural puncture headache and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in dealing with patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the most common signs and symptoms useful in diagnosis of postdural puncture headache.
