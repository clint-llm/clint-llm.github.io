Various Control Programs started in the seventies (Onchocerciasis Control Program-OCP:1974, African Program for Onchocerciasis Control-APOC:1995, Onchocerciasis Elimination for the Americas-OEPA: 1991

Several studies have recently been completed and others underway. One such study looked into moxidectin, a drug that is more effective and slows down microfilariae repopulation has recently been completed with promising outcomes.

Other studies are using high-resolution retinal cameras andÂ optical coherence tomography (OCT) to study the possibility of finding microfilariae in tissues of the anterior segment and more importantly, the posterior segment. This is based on the structural morphology of the microfilariae which measures 250 to 300 microns in length and 8 microns in cross-section.
