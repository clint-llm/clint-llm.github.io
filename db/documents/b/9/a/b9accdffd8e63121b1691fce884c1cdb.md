Congenital femoral deficiency (CFD) incorporates a broad spectrum of deficiency, discrepancy, and deformity, ranging from the congenital short femur to one of the most severe Proximal focal femoral deficiencies.Â Such patients usually lack stability and mobility at the hip joint and are associated with malorientation of the joint along with soft tissue contractures. In addition, the growth of the affected limb occurs at an inhibited rate which varies with the severity of the underlying condition.

Congenital femoral deficiency patient usually presents with coxa vara proximally and femoral valgus distally. In addition, congenital femoral deficiency is usually associated with other skeletal abnormalities such as fibular hemimelia, which is its most common association. Other conditions include caudal regression syndrome, caudal dysplasia, deficiency of cruciate ligament, and lumbosacral spine deformities.
