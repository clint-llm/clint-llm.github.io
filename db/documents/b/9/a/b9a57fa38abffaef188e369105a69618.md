Tests to detect congenital heart defects can be completed during pregnancy. A fetal echocardiogram can visualize the fetal heart as early as 16 weeks of pregnancy. Some defects only manifest following birth. In these cases, evaluation consists of a thorough history and physical examination, an echocardiogram, and potentially a cardiac catheterization. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a tool to measure the oxygenation of fetal tissues noninvasively, and physicians can then calculate blood flow and oxygen delivery.

In the tetralogy of Fallot, a boot-shaped heart due to right ventricular hypertrophy may be present on a chest X-ray.

Rib notching may present on chest X-raysÂ in patients with coarctation of the aorta because the intercostal arteries enlarge as the patient grows older.

An echocardiogram will show any structural or valve abnormalities in the fetal or newborn heart.
