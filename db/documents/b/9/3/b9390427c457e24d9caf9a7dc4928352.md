Neurologic injury may present with a reduced range of movement of the joints in the hand. For example, in Klumpe palsy, due to damage to the brachial plexus, the wrist and MCP joints will be extended, with flexion at the IP joints. Dupuytren disease can present with benign non-traumatic contractures in the palm of the hand. Osteoarthritis presents with pain, reduced range of motion in the joints of the hand. This can be a complication after a traumatic hand injury or unrelated. Inflammatory arthritis presents with painful joints in the hand, with swelling and erythema due to inappropriate immune responses.
