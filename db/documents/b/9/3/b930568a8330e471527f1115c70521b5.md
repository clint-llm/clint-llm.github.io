As mentioned earlier in the treatment and consultations sections, patients with lacunar infarctions must be managed and seen by a neurologist, a PM and R physician, and physical, occupational, and social therapists to get total care. In the outpatient setting, a neurologist may treat neurologic deficits like ataxic and motor hemiparesis with muscle relaxants like baclofen, tizanidine, and/or botox. More importantly, preventative measures with intense antihypertensive therapy, high-dose statin therapy, and strict control of blood sugars must be initiated immediately after a lacunar ischemic event. Finally, outpatient rehabilitation therapy must be continued until a patientâ€™s neurologic function can be returned to as close to his/her baseline prior to the infarction.
