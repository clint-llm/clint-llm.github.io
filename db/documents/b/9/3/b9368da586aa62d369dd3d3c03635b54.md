Typical intracytoplasmic inclusions and free chlamydiae are identifiable in Giemsa-stained cell scrapings from the eye. Stained conjunctival scrapings are positive in 90% of infants with neonatal conjunctivitis, and 50% of adults with inclusion conjunctivitis. Cytology techniques can be usedÂ to evaluate endocervical scrapings, but the sensitivity and specificity are low.
