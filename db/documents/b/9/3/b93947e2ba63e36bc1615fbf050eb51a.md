Systemic ketoconazole administration most commonly causes gastrointestinal side effects.

Hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported, such as anaphylaxis and urticaria. High-dose ketoconazole has been shown to cause an increase in long bone fragility and lead to fracture. Other side effects include alcohol intolerance, decreased platelet count, epistaxis, fatigue, hot flash, hyperlipidemia, insomnia, myalgia, nervousness, paresthesia, and peripheral edema. Topical ketoconazole can cause dermatological reactions, including pruritis, stinging, and dryness at the application site. There are also reports of dry hair, dry scalp, and oily hair when using ketoconazole-containing shampoo. Less common adverse effects include abnormal hair texture, alopecia, angioedema, contact dermatitis, eye irritation, headache, hypersensitivity reaction, impetigo, and pyogenic granuloma.
