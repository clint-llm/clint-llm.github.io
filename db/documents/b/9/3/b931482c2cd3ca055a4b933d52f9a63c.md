The guidelines (Level II recommendations) implemented by the BTF for managing severe Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) recommend an ICP monitor in the situations listed below:

- Patients with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) less than 8

- An abnormal computed tomogram (CT) scan of the head

- Two or more of the following are present:

- Age greater than 40 years

- Unilateral or bilateral motor posturing

- Systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg.

**Other ICP Monitoring Recommendations (Level III Recommendations)**

- Patients with an initial normal CT scan or with minor changes in CT images but later show features of neurologic worsening or progression on the repeat scan

- Evidence of brain swelling, e.g., compressed or absent basal cisterns

- Patients with large bifrontal contusions independent of the neurological condition

- When sedation interruption to check neurological function is not justified, e.g., respiratory failure from lung contusions and flail chest

- When the neurological examination is not reliable, e.g., maxillofacial trauma or spinal cord injury

- A decompressive craniectomy is performed as a last resort for intracranial hypertension refractory to medical management

- Following craniotomy wherein there are relevant risk factors for the propagation of brain edema, e.g., confounding hypoxia, hypotension, pupil abnormalities, midline shift greater than 5 mm.
