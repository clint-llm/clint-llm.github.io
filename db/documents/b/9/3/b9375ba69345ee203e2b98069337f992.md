Patients with CVID have broad clinical presentations because CVID can involve multi-organ systems from the nature of lacking immune defenses to fight infections, immune dysregulation causing autoimmunity, malignancy, inflammatory disorders, and complications. Patients typically present with recurrent infections that mostly involve the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Both upper and lower respiratory tracts are frequently involved and contribute significantly to overall mortality and morbidity in patients with common variable immunodeficiency. Recurrent sinusitis, otitis, and bronchitis are found in half of the patients. From the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) database, the commonly reported disorders were pneumonia (32%), autoimmunity (29%), splenomegaly (26%), and bronchiectasis (23%). Streptococcus sp., Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus species, Staphylococcus sp., Neisseria meningitides, Mycoplasma sp., Herpes Zoster, and Rhinovirus.Giardia lamblia, Campylobacter jejuni, and Salmonella sp. as the main pathogens.

It is fairly common to see patients with CVID develop autoimmune conditions; hence autoimmunity should always be considered in patients with CVID. The most common and severe manifestations are hematologic disorders, including idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and autoimmune neutropenia. Symptoms of easy bruising, bleeding in the mucocutaneous surface, anemia manifestations (weakness, pallor, fatigue, etc.) are often obtained in history. In patients with older age, we should also evaluate for lymphoid malignancies and gastric cancers.

Physical examination of patients with CVID may vary depending on the spectrum of the disease. Patients may have a normal physical examination, or they may have developed signs of chronic illness such as failure to thrive in children and malnutrition in adults. Patients with chronic respiratory infections often have nasal congestion or discharge and/or facial pain with chronic sinusitis, tympanic membranes scarring with chronic otitis, and abnormal lungs sound on auscultation with digital clubbing with chronic pulmonary disease. Other physical examination findings that we might encounter in patients with CVID are splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and findings related to underlying autoimmune diseases such as arthritis, skin rashes, etc.
