In most cases, open spinal dysraphism or myelomeningocele is diagnosed in utero or at birth. The symptoms differ for open and occult spinal dysraphism. If an open spinal dysraphism was not diagnosed in utero, during delivery, a midline cystic mass in the back is identified with a variable degree of neuronal element protruding through the bone and skin defect. The skin over the lesion is usually not well-developed and can get scraped off during delivery. This leads to cerebrospinal fluid leak and possible exposure of the spinal cord contents. Due to this exposure, the patient can develop infections like meningitis.

Infants with spina bifida cystica present with lethargy, poor feeding, irritability, stridor, ocular motor incoordination, and/or development delay. Older children may show cognitive or behavioral changes, decreased strength, increased spasticity, changes in bowel or bladder function, lower cranial nerve dysfunction, back pain, and/or worsening of spinal or lower extremity deformities.

On physical examination, motor and sensory dysfunction should be assessed, focusing on neuro-segmental levels based on muscle strength of specific nerve roots.
