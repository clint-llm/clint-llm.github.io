Oxaliplatin is an alkylating agent and has non-cell cycle-specific cytotoxicity.

The pharmacokinetics of unbound platinum in plasma following oxaliplatin administration were triphasic, demonstrating a short initial distribution phase followed by a prolonged terminal elimination phase. Oxaliplatin is subject to rapid and extensive nonenzymatic biotransformation and is not metabolized by the CYP450 enzyme system.

As monotherapy, oxaliplatin only demonstrates modest antineoplastic activity against advanced colorectal cancer, but it is effective in combination therapy.
