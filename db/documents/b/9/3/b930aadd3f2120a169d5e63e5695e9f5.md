Prosopagnosia can be acquired or hereditary. Acquired cases can resutl from ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, traumatic brain injury, certain neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric illnesses (Alzheimer disease, depression, and schizophrenia). Hereditary or development etiologies are a hot area of research, given that they are more common than acquired etiologies. The prevalence can approach 2.5% of the population.

Variants of prosopagnosia include an apperceptive variant (deficits in facial structure perception), and amnestic or associative variant (unable to remember faces even though they can perceive them; the perceptual information can not access facial memories because of a disconnection or loss of them).

**Localization/Pathophysiology**

The pathophysiology is still not completely understood and is a prominent area of research. Damage or developmental anomaly in the right or bilateral fusiform-lingual gyrus, with neuron pathways that control facial perception and memory, are thought to be involved. Imaging research shows that deficits in the temporal cortex and amygdala can also be involved. Individuals with fusiform lesions are more likely to have an apperceptive variant, while those with anterior temporal lobe lesions have the amnesia variant. Development prosopagnosia appears to be a result of either a disconnection between the anterior and posterior face networks or reduced functional activation of regions responsible for facial recognition and identification. Advanced imaging studies support these concepts. The hypothesis is that dysfunctional neural migration during development may be the mechanism behind juvenile prosopagnosia.

**Neuropsychological Diagnostic Tests**

Diagnostic tests can divide into three main types. First, perception tests that can accurately evaluate the patient's ability to discriminate between different visual facial stimuli. Second, recognition tests that can specifically assess short and long term recognition patterns of faces. Third, facial identification tests that involve other auditory or tactile cues (such as naming) to help identify facial stimuli. Examples for face perception tests are the Cambridge Face Perception Test, Glasgow Face Matching Test, Benton Facial Recognition, and the Caledonian Face Test.

Facial memories are testable through imagery.

**Imaging**

Advanced imaging is a research tool that uses properties such as cortical thickness, functional activation, and connectivity to study the networks involved in different types of prosopagnosia. Studies using positron-emission tomography scan and functional magnetic resonance imaging show that facial recognition networks are located in multiple brain regions, including the anterior temporal lobe, prefrontal cortex, inferior and middle temporal cortex, the hippocampus, the amygdala, and most importantly, and the fusiform face area or occipitotemporal gyrus. Activation of the fusiform face area in the non-dominant hemisphere appears to be involved in processing, while activation in the dominant hemisphere is associated with analytic processing. The perirhinal cortex in the medial temporal lobe is also involved in familiarity-based recognition. The different brain regions work synergistically to encode, store, and retrieve memories related to face recognition.
