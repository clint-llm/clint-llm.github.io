Rhinoplasty is indicated for the correction of any functional or cosmetic deficits of the nose. The debate continues as to whether closed (endonasal) vs. open rhinoplasty is superior; however, the widely accepted opinion is that the open approach (the more common approach) has numerous advantages, namely improved visualization. The ability to directly visualize the surgical maneuvers underway not only enhances diagnostic accuracy and correction of deformities but also facilitates education and participation of team members.
