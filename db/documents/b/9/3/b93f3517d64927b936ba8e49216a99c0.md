Flutamide comes with a black box warning due to the risk of hepatic failure. Hospitalization and death have occurred, although rarely, due to flutamide use; this is due to cholestatic hepatitis, which leads to failure. Cholestatic hepatitis results from the mitochondrial toxicity that occurs due to flutamide's major metabolite, hydroxyflutamide. This metabolite inhibits enzymes that are necessary for the electron transport chain within the mitochondria of the hepatocyte, leading to a halt of cellular respiration and, ultimately, cellular death. Hepatic failure would most likely be evident within the first three months of use. If the hepatic injury does occur in a patient, discontinuation of flutamide may help reverses the injury. Estimates of the rate at which this adverse effect occurs are three persons in 10,000 or 0.03% of all patients who use the drug. Due to this risk, it is advisable to perform liver function tests if symptoms suggest hepatic dysfunction. Such signs to watch for are abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, and right upper quadrant pain and tenderness. Recommendations are to discontinue therapy if jaundice develops or if alanine aminotransferase increased to two times the upper limit of normal.

The most common adverse effect of flutamide use is hot flashes, which occur in over 50% of patients. It has also demonstrated a decrease in libido in 36% of the patients taking it. Impotence occurs in 31%.

Rarely, flutamide correlates with interstitial pneumonitis that may lead to pulmonary fibrosis, seen in approximately 0.04% of patients.
