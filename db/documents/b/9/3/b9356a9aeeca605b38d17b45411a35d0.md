March fractures (metatarsal stress fractures) were first described in 1855 when the term was coined for the foot pain and swelling experienced by Prussian soldiers on long marches. March fractures are caused by repetitive stress. Intrinsic patient and extrinsic environmental risk factors can both contribute to the development of these fractures. Diagnosis is based on a combination of historical features, physical evaluation, and imaging studies. These fractures are typically managed conservatively but can be complicated by nonunion. In such instances, surgical fixation may be warranted. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of march fractures and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of metatarsal stress fractures.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with a metatarsal stress fracture.
- Review the treatment and management options available for metatarsal stress fractures.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the prevention and treatment of metatarsal stress fractures and improve patient outcomes.
