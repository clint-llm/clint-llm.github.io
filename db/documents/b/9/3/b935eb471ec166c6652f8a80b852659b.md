High-pressure injection injuries account for approximately 1 of every 600 hand traumas presenting to the emergency department. The average trauma center may see 1 to 4 cases per year.

The infection rates of high-pressure injection injuries are inconsistently reported in the literature.  This may be because cultures are not routinely obtained except for when signs of infections are exhibited. A review by Hogan et al. found that only 126 of 435 patients obtained wound cultures and 53 of these cultures were positive.  Of the patients with positive cultures in this review, 31% of patients required amputation of the affected limb.
