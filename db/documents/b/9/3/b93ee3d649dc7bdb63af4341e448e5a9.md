As these inhalants enter the lung, particles that escape mucociliary clearance (under 5 microns) deposit in the terminal bronchioles and alveoli. Alveolar macrophages then take up the smaller particles via phagocytosis. During this process, inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 and TNF-alpha) and lysosomal enzymes are released, free radicals are generated, and there is an increase in cell signaling. Macrophages containing these particles may collect in the interstitium along the perivascular and peribronchiolar regions. Once the inflammation process is complete, the fibrotic process initiates via stimulation of growth factors. Type 1 pneumocytes can then grow over them and enclose them in the interstitium. Fibroblasts then become stimulated to cause fibrosis and tissue remodeling by producing ECM and matrix metalloproteinases. Fibrocytes can induce chemotaxis and attract inflammatory factors and chemokines to amplify the immune response.
