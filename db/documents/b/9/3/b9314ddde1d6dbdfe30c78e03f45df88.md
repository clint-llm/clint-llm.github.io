Whole blood is the required specimen for an arterial blood gas sample. The specimen is obtained through an arterial puncture or acquired from an indwelling arterial catheter. A description of these procedures is beyond the scope of this article; please refer to the StatPearls article “arterial lines” and other references for more information.

ABG Components:

- pH = measured acid-base balance of the blood

- PaO2 = measured the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood

- PaCO2 = measured the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood

- HCO3 = calculated concentration of bicarbonate in arterial blood

- Base excess/deficit = calculated relative excess or deficit of base in arterial blood

- SaO2 = calculated arterial oxygen saturation unless a co-oximetry is obtained, in which case it is measured
