Achieving the best outcomes with intense pulsed light therapy involves an interprofessional team of healthcare providers, including a skilled dermatologist/plastic surgeon and often physician assistant or nurse practitioner, aesthetician, medical assistant, and office staff. The patient should be educated on what to expect during and after the procedure and potential side effects. For example, the patient should be counseled on cold gel application before IPL treatment and using protective eyewear during treatment sessions. It is also important to gauge the patient's expectations and assess clinical improvement. Patients should be informed that the best results are achieved after a series of at least two or more IPL treatments. [Level 1]
