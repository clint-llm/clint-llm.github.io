The word thenar originates from the Greek meaning “palm of the hand.” The hypothenar eminence is located on the ulnar portion of the volar hand at the base of the fifth digit (small finger). The thenar eminence is located on the radial portion of the volar hand at the base of the first digit (thumb).

The thenar eminence is composed of three muscles that control the movements of the thumb: abductor pollicis brevis (APB), flexor pollicis brevis (FPB), and the opponens pollicis. Medical conditions that can affect the thenar eminence include carpal tunnel syndrome, arthritis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), among others.
