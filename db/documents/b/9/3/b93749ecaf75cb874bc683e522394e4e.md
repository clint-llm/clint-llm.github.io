Patients usually present with an asymptomatic testicular mass, which may be associated with infertility. Testicular pain from malignancy is relatively rare but still should be included in the differential diagnosis.

On physical exam, there is usually a unilateral, firm to hard palpable mass in the scrotum, which is localized to the testis. This may be associated with a hydrocele that would preclude palpation, so testicular ultrasonography may be needed to identify the mass. Metastatic disease, although rare, can present initially with lymphadenopathy in the retroperitoneum and the anterior mediastinum. Even massive metastatic disease can be produced from a non-palpable testicular malignancy.

Typically, testicular ultrasonography shows an intratesticular mass that is relatively hypoechoic and homogeneous. As the mass increases in size, it may become less homogeneous due to hemorrhage and necrosis.
