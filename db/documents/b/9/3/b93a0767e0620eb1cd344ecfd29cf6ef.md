When a cell is exposed to an insult, external or internal, it can react to this injury differently depending on the circumstance. Cell response can lead to adaptation, apoptosis, or necrosis. Adaptation successfully maintains homeostasis by reversible responses that can alter cell function and structure. A physiological example of adaptation is seen in pregnancy, where uterine cells increase in size (hypertrophy) and number (hyperplasia). Adaptations may also result in atrophy, a decrease in cell size and activity that isÂ classically seen in the disuse of certain muscle groups. Metaplasia is an adaptation that results in a change of the cell type. Pathologically, this is seen in diseases such as Barrett esophagus, where increased exposure of acid to esophageal cells from the stomach results in a phenotypical change in cells from columnar to squamous.
