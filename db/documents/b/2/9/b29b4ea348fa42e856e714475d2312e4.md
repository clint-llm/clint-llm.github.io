Virchow's node, a left supraclavicular lymph node, was first described by German pathologist Rudolf Ludwig Karl Virchow (1821-1901) in 1848 as a sign of metastatic malignancy mainly from gastric cancer.

Several studies have established its clinical significance by demonstrating its association with various malignancies, including gastrointestinal, pulmonary adenocarcinoma, prostate cancer, lymphoma, among others.

Considering its role in lymphatic drainage, researchers have theorized that its involvement in malignancies could be due to tumor embolization along the thoracic duct.

Although there have been just a few studies on its anatomic description, they have helped understand the possible complications that the mass effect of Virchow's node can cause, which includes thoracic outlet syndrome, horner's syndrome, and unilateral phrenic neuropathy.
