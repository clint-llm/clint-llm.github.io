About 10% of the total population may be affected by dermatophyte infections of the toe clefts. It is mostly attributed to wearing of occlusive shoes for long periods. Sharing washing facilitiesÂ is likely to increase the chances of infection as the incidence of tinea pedis is observed to be higher among those using community baths, showers, and pools. The condition is more common in adult males than in females. The mean age of onset was 15 years in one study.
