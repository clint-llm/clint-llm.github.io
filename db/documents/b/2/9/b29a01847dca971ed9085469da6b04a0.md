Temporal mandibular joint (TMJ) dislocation, or mandibular dislocation, can present as bilateral or unilateral displacement of the mandibular condyle from the articular surface of the temporal bone (the glenoid fossa). Anterior, posterior, superior, and lateral mandibular dislocations can occur. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of mandibular dislocation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of mandibular dislocation.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of mandible dislocation.
- Describe the management options available for mandible dislocation.
- Review the interprofessional strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and care of mandible dislocation and improve patient outcomes.
