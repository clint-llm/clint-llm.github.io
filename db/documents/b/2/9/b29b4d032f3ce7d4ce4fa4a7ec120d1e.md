The bishop score is still an important determination in the prediction of successful induction of labor.  The pelvic score can be ascertained in a patient at the time of induction by a digital cervical exam to determine if cervical ripening is necessary before induction. The score is often performed by a labor and delivery nurse or an obstetrician.
