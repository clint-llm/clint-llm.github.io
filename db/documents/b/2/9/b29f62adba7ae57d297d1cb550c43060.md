Lack of estrogen causes atrophy of the vagina and endometrium. Inside the uterus, the collapsed and atrophic surfaces of the endometrium contain scant or no fluid to prevent friction inside the cavity.

On the other hand, premalignant or malignant conditions of the endometrium often arise after unopposed estrogen. Systemic estrogen-only therapy, chronic anovulation (such as in polycystic ovarian syndrome), obesity, and estrogen-secreting tumors can lead to abnormal endometrial changes. Anovulation also leads to infrequent, insufficient shedding of the endometrium. Some women have genetic predispositions to endometrial cancer, including Lynch syndrome and Cowden disease.
