Over time, numerous antiplatelet agents have been developed with a multitude of indications. Antiplatelet medications divide into oral and parenteral agents, and oral agents subdivide further based on the mechanism of action. Aspirin was the first antiplatelet medication and is a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. Other oral antiplatelet include clopidogrel, ticagrelor, and prasugrel, cilostazol, and dipyridamole. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors such as tirofiban and eptifibatide are only available as parenteral agents and are used in acute phases of acute coronary syndrome. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, action, adverse events, and other key elements of antiplatelet drugs essential to clinical practice.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the mechanisms of action of the different antiplatelet agents.
- Identify the appropriate indications for the various antiplatelet drugs.
- Describe the potential adverse event profiles of the different antiplatelet agents.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance patient outcomes and minimize adverse events with antiplatelet medications.
