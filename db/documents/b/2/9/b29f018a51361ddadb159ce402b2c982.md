Universal childhood immunization with a conjugate pneumococcal vaccine should be done. All individuals who are at increased risk of acquiring pneumococcal infection like old age people more than 65 years old, patients with underlying lung disease, alcoholics, with chronic kidney and liver diseases, who are undergoing splenectomy or have functional asplenia should be vaccinated.

Cigarette smoking has been found to increase the risk of pneumococcal infection in otherwise healthy people. Therefore smoking cessation should be encouraged. Good nutrition, healthy environment and avoidance of daycare attendance decrease the frequency of acquiring the infection.
