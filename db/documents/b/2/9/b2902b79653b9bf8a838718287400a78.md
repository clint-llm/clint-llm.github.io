The eyeball is a complex structure with many small organs that are essential for vision and movement of the eye. An injury to any part of the eye can result in discomfort, reduced vision, and in some cases blindness. The eye is a source of injury, infection, and multiple medical diseases. It is important for all health practitioners to be able to identify and describe the anatomical features of the eye. The ciliary muscle is an important part of the eye that controls aspects of near and far vision.

Glaucoma is an eye disease that damages the optic nerve and can eventually lead to blindness. Increased ocular pressure often causes the damage to the optic nerve. A clear fluid constantly flows out of the anterior chamber of the eye to maintain intraocular pressure. The drainage occurs at the angle where the cornea and iris meet. In open-angle glaucoma, the drainage angle is open, but the fluid is passing through the meshwork too slowly, resulting in increased pressure. It is important to understand that an increase in intraocular pressure does not always lead to glaucoma because certain individuals can tolerate higher pressures. Also, the increased intraocular pressure is not necessary for developing glaucoma. It is possible through increased blood pressure. Individuals most at risk for glaucoma are African Americans above the age of 40, all individuals over the age of 60, and anyone who has a family history of the condition.

In angle-closure glaucoma, the iris presses against the meshwork and inhibits drainage of the aqueous humor out of the anterior chamber of the eye. This causes a rapid increase in intraocular pressure. Both open-angle and closed-angle glaucoma can be treated with muscarinic receptor agonists, such as pilocarpine, that cause the ciliary muscle to contract and leads to the opening of the trabecular meshwork. Once the pores in the trabecular meshwork have opened, the aqueous humor can flow through the canal of Schlemm and eventually lead to a decrease in intraocular pressure.

The contraction of the ciliary muscle can lead to relief in both open-angle and closed-angle glaucoma, making it a target for drugs like pilocarpine.
