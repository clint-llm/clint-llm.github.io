As discussed previously, the Codman triangle sign is clinically significantÂ as it often signals an underlying aggressive bone lesion. Radiologists need to recognize this finding as it can carry substantial clinical weight. Additionally, a clinical physician needs to correlate this finding with other clinical features to arrive at the appropriate diagnosis and ultimately provide the correct treatment.

If there is a suspicion of a malignant primary bone tumor, the clinical course will be much different than a suspected case of acute osteomyelitis, for example. An aggressive bone tumor may require further imaging tests, staging, and a carefully planned biopsy.
