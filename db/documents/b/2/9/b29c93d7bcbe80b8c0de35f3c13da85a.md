There are several clinical methods for the determination of serum alkaline phosphatase levels. They differ by substrate used, pH of the alkaline buffer, and the “normal” values generated. The tests, in principle, rely on the ability of the enzyme to hydrolyze phosphate esters.

Electrophoresis does not reliably differentiate the isoenzymes as the electrophoretic mobility of bone and liver isoenzymes is only slightly different. Electrophoresis on cellulose acetate, with the addition of heat inactivation, is a much more reliable test than electrophoresis alone. Polyacrylamide gel slab-based separation provides accurate identification of the liver, bone, intestinal and placental isoenzymes; this test is, however, not widely available.
