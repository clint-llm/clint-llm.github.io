Clinicians should consider antitrypanosomal treatment for acute infections, congenital, reactivation, indeterminate form, women of childbearing age, accidental high-risk exposures, and chronic phase in the pediatric population (less than 18 years).

Cure rates are variable and dependent on several factors such as the patient's age, stage of the disease, and duration of infection. During the acute phase, cure rates range from 80% to 90% and 20% to 60% in chronic disease.

Treatment for organ-specific sequelae, such as Chagas rhythm disturbances and cardiomyopathy, should follow current recommended treatment for that particular disease (e.g., dilated cardiomyopathy). Conduction or rhythm disturbances are treatable with an implantable pacemaker and/or cardioverter-defibrillator. Amiodarone is recommended for recurrent ventricular dysrhythmias.
