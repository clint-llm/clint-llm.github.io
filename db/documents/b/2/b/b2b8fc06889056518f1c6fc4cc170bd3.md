Band shaped keratopathy: There is an imbalance in the calcium and phosphate metabolism resulting in deposition of calcium phosphate crystals into the subepithelial Bowmans layer, epithelial basement membrane, and anterior stroma. The various local and systemic causes have been mentioned in the etiology section. There exists a lucent gap between the limbus and the BSK. This peripheral clearing is likely due to the absence of Bowmans's membrane in the periphery or buffering capacity of limbal vessels that prevents the deposition of hydroxyapatite. Holes in the BSK gives it a swiss cheese appearance and is because of corneal nerves traversing the Bowman's membrane.

Pseudophakic and aphakic bullous keratopathy: The endothelium is largely responsible for the maintenance of a relatively dehydrated state of cornea apart from tight junctions of the epithelium. Damage caused by ultrasonic energy during phacoemulsification apart from iatrogenic damage during instrumentation results in endothelial cell loss. The surrounding endothelial cells slide horizontally to fill in the gaps caused by endothelial cell death.

Striate keratopathy: Transient endothelial dysfunction due to intra-operative insult to endothelium results in striate keratopathy.

Whorl keratopathy: The various medications owing to the amphiphilic nature reaches the lipids of lysosomal membranes of the basal epithelial layer. There they form an insoluble complex with lipids and appear as deposits.

Exposure keratopathy: Tear film is an important part of the defense mechanism and also has its role in the nourishment of cornea. Its maintenance is of utmost importance. A normal corneal sensation, a normal blink rate, healthy lid anatomy, and appropriate innervation are required for its maintenance. If any of these get altered, the tear film will also get affected. Absent tear film from a part of the ocular surface will make the surface dry and more prone to epithelial denudation and infection.

Infectious crystalline keratopathy (ICK): ICK is largely caused by biofilm-producing organisms. The presence of biofilms protects the bacteria in a well sequestered intrastromal pocket. There is minimal or no inflammation in the surrounding area. The organisms usually enter the corneal stroma along suture tracks.

Neurotrophic keratopathy: Damage to the trigeminal nerve nuclei, or the trigeminal nerve fascicle in its course results in the neurotropic cornea. HZO is a major cause.

Metabolic keratopathy:

Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS): There are various types of MPS, depending on the type of enzyme deficiency. In MPS I (Hurler's syndrome), deficiency of alpha iduronidase results in the accumulation of heparan and dermatan sulfate. In MPS II (Hunter's syndrome), there is a deficiency of iduronate -2-sulfatase. Corneal clouding is noted in almost all types of MPS except type II and III. It is never noted in MPS III but maybe rarely observed in MPS II.

Cystinosis: Here, deficiency of cystinosin results in the accumulation of cystine in the cornea. The corneal manifestations (needle-like crystal deposition) manifest very early in life.

Wilson's disease: This abnormality of copper metabolism results in the accumulation of copper in the cornea, putamen, and liver. In the cornea, copper deposits largely in the Descemet's membrane forming a ring called Kayser-Fleischer (KF) ring.

Lecithin-Cholesterol Acyltransferase deficiency results in decreased cholesterol esters and lysolecithin and increased unesterified cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids. The deposition of these unesterified forms results in the deposition in the corneal layers in the peripheral cornea.

Filamentary keratopathy: In aqueous deficient dry eyes, lack of tear production results in excessive production of mucus by goblet cells. The epithelial injury along with the mucus debris results in filament formation.

Climatic droplet keratopathy: This is a degeneration of cornea and/or conjunctiva characterized by diffusion and coagulation of plasma proteins into the superficial corneal stroma, bowman's membrane, and epithelium, in response to exposure to UV radiation. It is also known as spheroidal degeneration and Labrador keratopathy.

Lipid keratopathy:  There is abnormal lipid deposition and /or metabolism of lipid in the cornea.

Superficial punctate keratopathy: Punctate epithelial loss results in punctate staining with fluorescein stain.

Keratopathy related to vernal keratoconjunctivitis: It is IgE mediated and TH2 cell-mediated reaction.

Keratopathy related to SJS/TEN: In patients with SJS, there are changes in ocular surface changes secondary to epithelial denudation. In the chronic phase, severe dry eye and the lid margin changes like keratinization, scarring of the tarsal conjunctiva cause blink related trauma to the ocular surface including the cornea. This results in keratopathy.

Keratopathy related to aniridia: The total LSCD results in epithelial changes followed by complete conjunctivalization of the cornea.
