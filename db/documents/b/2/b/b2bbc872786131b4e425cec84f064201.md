To understand the mechanism of action of PDE5 inhibitors, one must first understand the normal physiology of penile erection, an area of medicine where most PDE5 inhibitors are currently in use. After sexual stimulation, nerve impulses release neurotransmitters in the corpora cavernosa, causing the production of nitric oxide by endothelial cells, which diffuses into the adjacent smooth muscle cells and stimulates the formation of cGMP, leading to vasodilation and increased penile blood flow.

**Mechanism of PDE-5 Inhibitors on cGMP**

These drugs inhibit the enzyme phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) present in the smooth muscle cells of the vessels. By inhibiting this enzyme, these drugs prevent the degradation of cGMP by PDE-5. GMP can cause activation of protein kinase G, leading to relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle. Prevention of degradation of cGMP by PDE-5 leads to the accumulation of cGMP in the vascular smooth muscle, thereby leading to dilatation of the blood vessels through phosphorylation of different downstream effector molecules. Dilatation of the penile arteries leads to a more prolonged erection. In addition, PDE5Is improve endothelial function and reduce apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells in the corpus cavernosum.

A similar mechanism of action has also been shown to result in vasodilation of the pulmonary arteries, relieving pulmonary hypertension symptoms. They also inhibit the remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature. When given to subjects suffering from heart failure, they have been known to inhibit the remodeling of the myocardium. All the PDE5 inhibitors mentioned above have the same mechanism of action. Still, they differ in their PDE isozyme selectivity with PDE6 (sildenafil), and PDE11 (tadalafil) is also affected by the cross-reactivity, leading to the presentation of specific side effects associated with PDE5 inhibitor use.
