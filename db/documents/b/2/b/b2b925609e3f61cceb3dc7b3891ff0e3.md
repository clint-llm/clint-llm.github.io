Numerous potential complications can occur during the procedural placement of a central venous catheter but also due to the indwelling equipment.

Procedural complications:

- Arrhythmias – typically ventricular or bundle branch blocks due to guidewire irritation of the atria or ventricles

- Arterial puncture

- Pulmonary puncture with or without resultant pneumothorax

- Bleeding – hematoma formation, which can obstruct the airway

- Tracheal injury

- Air emboli during venous puncture or removal of the catheter

Post-procedural complications:

- Catheter-related bloodstream infections – bacterial or fungal

- Central vein stenosis

- Thrombosis

- Delayed bleeding with multiple attempts in a coagulopathic patient
