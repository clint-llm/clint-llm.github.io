Riboflavin or vitamin B2 is a member of the group of vitamins referred to as vitamin B complex, which is a water-soluble vitamin. As a drug, healthcare providers often prescribe it in a combined formulation consisting of other B complex vitamins as a prophylactic supplement to prevent the development of deficiency.

Riboflavin deficiency is rare as it is ubiquitous in a variety of food choices. However, individuals following a diet scarce in milk and meat, which are one of the best sources of riboflavin, and some specific groups of individuals, as discussed below, may be prone to its deficiency.

Milk and dairy products have very high riboflavin content; the dairy intake is the most significant contributor of the vitamin in Western diets, making riboflavin deficiency uncommon among water-soluble vitamins. However, there is an increased intake of semi-skimmed milk in developed countries, depleting milk of its riboflavin content. Although relatively stable, it easily degrades by light exposure. Milk kept in a glass bottle may be susceptible to degradation through this route.

Grain products possess low natural amounts, but fortification practices ensure that certain breads and cereals have become sources of riboflavin. Therefore, according to an article by Morgan KJ et al., high riboflavin levels were found in those having cereals for breakfast.

**Groups of Individuals at a Higher Risk for Low Riboflavin Intake**

**Pregnant/Lactating Women and Infants**

Pregnancy demands higher riboflavin intake as it crosses the placenta

**Children**

Riboflavin deficiency among children is present in many regions of the world where there are inadequate levels of milk and meat in their diet.

**Elderly**

There is an increasing requirement of riboflavin with advancing age as a result of decreased efficiency of its absorption by the enterocytes.

**Athletes**

Some studies report that vigorous exercise may deplete riboflavin due to its consumption in the metabolic pathways.

**Eating Disorders**

Young women with anorexia nervosa or patients with malignancies, malabsorption syndromes, like celiac disease and short bowel syndrome, have been shown to have low riboflavin levels.

**Long-term Use of Barbiturates**

Long-term use of phenobarbital, as well as other barbiturates, can impair riboflavin due to oxidation.

**Prominent Features of Riboflavin Deficiency**

Although clinical features of some vitamin deficiencies are similar and often coexist, the following are more common features of riboflavin deficiency are as follows:

- Lips become red, dry, fissured, or ulcerated.

- Angular cheilitis is often a feature.

- The tongue gets dry, atrophic, magenta red, or sometimes blackish

- Seborrheic dermatitis may be present on the face

- Scrotum or vulva may get hyperpigmented, resembling zinc deficiency

- Conjunctivitis can occur

- Sore throat

- Fatigue
