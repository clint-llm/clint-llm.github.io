Vasculitis refers to inflammation of the blood vessels leading to tissue destruction with or without organ damage. Vasculitis is classified as small vessel, medium vessel or large vessel vasculitis

Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a small vessel vasculitis characterized histopathologically by immune complex-mediated vasculitis of the dermal capillaries and venules. Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis is usually confined to skin with rare extracutaneous manifestations in less than 30% of the cases. Key clinical features of cutaneous leukocytoclastic angiitis include palpable purpura, lower extremity location, small vessel involvement.
