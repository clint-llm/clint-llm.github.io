There are many obstacles associated with implementing robust IP simulation. However, the value of Sim-IPE in aiding learners to achieve team competencies mandates the identification of creative ways to address these barriers.  Educators need to ensure learners are included in a meaningful way throughout the simulation (pre-brief, scenario, and debrief). Table 2 provides recommendations to implement a successful IP simulation.

Table 2. Suggestions to Overcome Barriers to Implementation

- Obtain Institutional Support

- Identify champions and stakeholders at multiple levels
- Reduce costs by enhancing patient care and decreasing burnout
- Obtain protected faculty time as it is crucial for the sustainability of Sim-IPE

- Train and develop faculty on the implementation of Sim-IPE
- Include formal training courses, observations, mentoring, and feedback
- Create a united philosophy and adhere to best practices in facilitation
- Train debriefers to encourage reflection and generate meaningful conversation

- Promote collaboration by developing interprofessional relationships

- Maintain communication with regular meetings
- Identify a champion or liaison from every participating profession to serve on the design team
- Communicate schedule changes early and be flexible with classes and clinical rotations

- Structure the implementation of the simulation

- Identify a date for the simulation early in the planning. Flexibility and negotiation are paramount.
- Pilot test the simulation with all professions involved to refine details and timing
- Utilize a structured pre-brief to establish psychological safety and orient learners to the logistics of participation in the sim
- Provide a structured debrief to encourage reflection and explore frames
- Obtain feedback from facilitators for continued program improvement

- Include challenging communication and teamwork scenarios
- Develop learners’ skills to communicate within authority gradients effectively
- Utilize the IPEC competencies as a framework to develop respect for the expertise of other professions
- Reinforce values and ethics related to interprofessional practice
