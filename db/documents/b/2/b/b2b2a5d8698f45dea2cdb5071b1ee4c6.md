Fat accumulates in the liver for several reasons. Most commonly, it involves increased delivery of free fatty acids (FFAs) to the liver, increased synthesis of fatty acids in the liver, decreased oxidation of FFA, or decreased synthesis or secretion of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL).

Oxidative stress in the hepatocytes can activate stellate cells and lead to theÂ production of collagen and inflammation.

Other factors that may contribute to fatty liver include:

- The use of medications (e.g., tamoxifen, amiodarone, methotrexate)

- Metabolic abnormalities (e.g., glycogen storage disorders, homocystinuria)

- Alcohol

- Nutritional status (e.g., total parenteral nutrition, severe malnutrition, overnutrition, or a starvation diet)

- Other health issues like Wilson disease and celiac sprue.
