Dr. Allen and Dr. Hines pioneered and first described lipedema in the 1940s, a common subcutaneous adipose tissue disorder characterized as enlargement of both lower extremities. Lipedema is not edema; it is a genetically determined disturbance in adipose tissue mass and adipose tissue distribution. In 1951 a second seminal paper provided more description of lipedema. Fat distribution involves lower extremities, upper arms, hips, buttocks, thighs sparing trunks, and feet. Lower extremities are characterized by pain, easy bruisability, firm subcutaneous nodules of adipose tissue, and resistance of fat to traditional diet and exercise.
