Although side effects of IPL are typically rare and minimal in severity, the most common adverse events include pain and erythema. Other reported side effects include edema, bullae, hematoma, crusting, hyper/hypopigmentation, leukotrichia, scarring, keloid formation, and infection.

Shorter wavelengths are generally reserved for fair skin types, as these wavelengths are absorbed by melanin and lead to pigmentation changes in patients with darker skin. However, device-related cooling technology has helped minimize these side effects in darker complexions. Skin reactions typically last for about 2 to 48 hours posttreatment and often depend on the fluence, pulse duration, and specific treatment area. Higher fluences and pulse durations, thinner skin, and darker skin types may increase the likelihood of adverse events.

In patients undergoing hair removal, an adverse effect of paradoxical hypertrichosis may occur.
