This activity reviews the fogging procedure as part of the subjective refraction testing method. Fogging is used to control accommodation and elicit any hidden or latent hyperopia. Fogging involves a plus power build-up until the patients' visual acuity is reduced by one to two lines. This is followed by defogging, where the plus lenses are reduced until there is no further improvement in vision. This activity also outlines indications and contraindications for the fogging procedure. Common errors encountered while fogging are discussed in addition to preferred solutions in special cases. The activity also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with refractive errors, especially hyperopes.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the fogging process.
- Identify the influence of accommodation on the refractive states of the eye.
- Outline the importance of fogging as a tool for adjusting refraction findings.
- Review the relationship between asthenopia and refractive errors.
