Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome requires differentiation from the other mitochondrial disorders associated with POLG gene mutations. These include:

- Childhood myocerbro-hepatopathy

- This disease has some overlapping features with AHS, so it is important to recognize the unique features. Childhood myocerebro-hepatopathy syndrome leads to liver failure and encephalopathy. Helpful distinguishing symptoms for this entity include lactic acidosis, hearing loss, cyclic vomiting, and lack of prominent seizure activity. This disease usually presents by six months of age - earlier than the typical onset of AHS, which is between 2 to 4 years old.

- Ataxia-neuropathy syndrome

- Myoclonus epilepsy myopathy sensory ataxia

- Autosomal recessive progressive external ophthalmoplegia plus

- Autosomal dominant progressive ophthalmoplegia plus.
