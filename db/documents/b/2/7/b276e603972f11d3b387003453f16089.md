ENaC is present in the distal colon, ducts of exocrine glands, lungs, and apical surface of the epithelial surface of the distal nephron.

Additionally, the increased influx of sodium through the ENaC channel causes several different effects on other channels within the membrane. First, it causes increased activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase at the basolateral membrane resulting in increased potassium influx into the cell from the basolateral side. Second, the depolarization of the apical membrane of the cell secondary to sodium entry causes potassium secretion through apical potassium channels and thus potassium is excreted in the urine resulting in hypokalemia.
