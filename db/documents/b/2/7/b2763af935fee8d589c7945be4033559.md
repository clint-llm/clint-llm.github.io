# Continuing Education Activity

Salmonella enterica typhi is a gram-negative bacterium that is responsible for typhoid fever and has been a burden on developing nations for generations. Despite significant efforts in research and medical advancements, typhoid fever is still a major worldwide public health concern. This activity presents the etiology, pathophysiology, presentation, and diagnosis of Salmonella typhi and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of Salmonella typhi.
- Review the presentation of Salmonella typhi.
- Outline the treatment options for Salmonella typhi.
- Summarize the importance of optimizing care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by Salmonella typhi.

# Introduction

Salmonella enterica serotype typhi is a gram-negative bacterium that is responsible for typhoid fever and has been a burden on developing nations for generations. In 1829, Pierre Louis was the first to coin the term “typhoid fever” after identifying lesions in the abdominal lymph nodes of patients who had died from “gastric fever.”S. enterica. It was first cultured in 1884 by Georg Gaffky.

# Etiology

Salmonella enterica serotype typhi is a gram-negative, rod-shaped, flagellated bacterium whose only reservoir is the human body.

# Epidemiology

Typhoid fever is more common in children and young adults and is associated with low-income areas in which poor sanitation is prevalent.Salmonella enterica serotype typhi are reported each year, and approximately 80% of these cases are from travelers returning from an endemic region.

# Pathophysiology

Salmonella enterica serotype typhi is usually contracted by ingestion of food or water that is contaminated with the excrements of people that carry the organism and must survive the gastric pH barrier in the stomach prior to adherence in the small intestine.Salmonella enterica serotype typhi in healthy individuals ranges between 1000 and 1 million organisms but can be related to the host’s defense mechanisms.

Salmonella enterica serotype typhi enter the submucosal region of the small bowel by either direct penetration into the epithelial tissue mediated by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) or via the M-cell, a specialized lymphoid epithelial cell. Once within the submucosa, the bacterium causes hypertrophy of the Peyer’s patches.

Dissemination of the organism from the Peyer’s patches occurs via the lymphatic system and the bloodstream.Salmonella enterica serotype typhi can be cultured from the bone marrow even after anti-microbial therapy has been initiated.

Approximately 1% to 5% of patients will become chronic carriers of Salmonella enterica serotype typhi despite adequate antimicrobial therapy.

# History and Physical

Patients will typically present after a 7 to 14-day asymptomatic period after initial inoculation with Salmonella enterica serotype typhi.

Although classically related to typhoid fever, relative bradycardia in association with a fever is not always seen in patients infected with Salmonella enterica serotype typhi and could be related to the geographical area in which the infection occurs.

# Evaluation

The diagnosis of typhoid fever should be suspected in those living in endemic areas or those who have traveled to an endemic area and are presenting with a febrile illness. Basic laboratory data can aid the clinician in the diagnosis, but no single laboratory value is pathognomonic for typhoid fever. A complete blood count may show either leukocytosis or leukopenia with a left shift depending on the patient’s age.

To confirm the diagnosis, the clinician should obtain blood and stool cultures whenever possible. Blood cultures are positive in 40% to 80% of individuals and stool cultures in 30% to 40%.Salmonella enterica serotype typhi and can stay positive for days after initiation of antimicrobial therapy.

The Widal test measures agglutinating antibodies against the lipopolysaccharide O and flagellar H antigens. Ideally, a positive test requires a four-fold increase in antibody titers taken 10 days apart, but many clinicians use a single acute-phase sample to guide care. Using this method, false-negative and positive results may occur.

# Treatment / Management

The first antibiotic to be used to treat infections caused by Salmonella enterica serotype typhi was chloramphenicol.Salmonella enterica serotype typhi were discovered in the community.Salmonella enterica serotype typhi would be azithromycin.

# Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of those infected with Salmonella enterica serotype typhi should include:

- Malaria

- Q fever

- Amebiasis

- Leptospirosis

- Dengue fever

- Yellow fever

- Leishmaniasis

- Filariasis

- Viral hemorrhagic fever

# Prognosis

The prognosis for patients with typhoid fever depends on how quickly the diagnosis is made and antibiotics are started. The average rate of mortality is less than 1% worldwide, but that varies depending on the region. Mortality rates are highest among the very young (less than 1 year) and the very old.

Approximately 1% to 5% of patients will become chronic carriers of Salmonella enterica serotype typhi despite adequate antimicrobial therapy.

# Complications

Complications occur in 10% to 15% of patients infected with Salmonella enterica serotype typhi. Although many complications have been described in the literature, the most common include gastrointestinal hemorrhage, intestinal perforation, typhoid encephalopathy, and relapse.

Gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurs in up to 10% of hospitalized patients and is related to the necrosis and erosion of Peyer’s patches through the small bowel.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Travelers to countries where Salmonella typhi is endemic should be educated on the importance of avoiding unpeeled fruits or vegetables and only drinking bottled or boiled water. Typhoid vaccinations are available and are indicated for travelers to endemic countries. Patients that have been diagnosed with typhoid fever should be made aware of the importance of medication adherence and the potential consequences of inadequate treatment.

# Pearls and Other Issues

- Relative bradycardia in response to a fever (pulse-temp deficit) has been reported in the literature.

- The majority of patients will develop abdominal symptoms during their hospitalization.

- Hepato-splenomegaly is a common physical exam finding.

- A bone marrow aspirate is the most sensitive diagnostic tool, even after antibiotics.

- Ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin should be seen as the initial anti-microbial of choice in areas with low quinolone resistance.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Salmonella typhi infection is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes infectious disease nurses and clinicians. A pharmacist should assist with antibiotic selection, checking for interactions, and monitoring compliance as well as assisting with patient education. The key to treatment is ensuring hydration. Because of the high morbidity of the infection, prevention should be the goal. Although easily treated through current antibiotic therapies, prevention of the disease should be the mainstay of treatment. In endemic areas, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a vaccination program that should include the conjugate vaccine due to its longer-lasting immunity and safety profile in children. Travelers to endemic countries should be aware of the transmission of the disease, be advised on behavioral precautions, and should receive the vaccine whenever possible. The outcomes for patients who are treated are good but lack of treatment can lead to dehydration, multiorgan failure, and even death.
