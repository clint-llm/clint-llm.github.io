Lymph nodes can become enlarged in response to infections. Mycobacterial, fungal infections, and cat-scratch disease produce necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. Viral infections, like infectious mononucleosis, cause reactive lymph node hyperplasia. Autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus cause reactive follicular hyperplasia. Lymph nodes are one of the first and common sites of metastatic tumors. In such cases, the type, location, size, and the number of lymph nodes involved are the most important prognostic feature that guides management and staging of the tumor.
