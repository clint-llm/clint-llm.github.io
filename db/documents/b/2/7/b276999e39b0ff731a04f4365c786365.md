Management of obesity is with an interprofessional team to get the ideal results. Even though there are several types of bariatric procedures for weight loss, the key is patient education on the prevention of obesity. All healthcare workers including nurse practitioners should educate the patient on a healthy diet, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight. These preventive measures do work as long as the patient is compliant. More important these measures are virtually devoid of risks. Bariatric surgery does not cure obesity and the results are not always guaranteed. However, for those who do manage to lose weight with surgery, there is an added benefit of better glucose control, lowering of blood pressure and lipids. (Level II)
