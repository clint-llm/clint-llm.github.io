PET-CT has never been shown to be cost-effective for HNC in a prospective trial.  Nor has it been shown to be a cost-effective means for extending recurrence-free survival in HNC (vs. other imaging modalities or surgery alone). However, three papers using parameters for American patients have been published, all retrospective and/or theoretical in nature, suggesting cost-savings in three circumstances:

- In 2001, PET-CT was estimated to have a cost-savings per quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) compared to CT alone for N0 patients undergoing radiologic staging.

- In 1010, PET-CT was estimated to be cost-effective for deciding for or against definitive surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation at a threshold QALY value of $500,000.

- In 2012, PET-CT was estimated to be more cost-effective than proceeding straight to node dissection for N2 disease (spread of cancer to one ipsilateral 3-6 cm lymph node, multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes <6 cm, or in bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes <6 cm) at a cost-savings per PET-CT of around $8,000.

Thus, it is likely but still unproven that PET-CT is a cost-effective measure for HNC initial staging.  There is no literature that PET-CT is cost-effective for HNC diagnosis or surveillance.  Healthcare professionals can enhance the performance of the medical system by obtaining PET-CT only in high pre-test probability situations following NCCN guidelines.
