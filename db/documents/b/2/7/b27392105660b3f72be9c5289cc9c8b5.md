Adverse effects of cannabinoids exist on a spectrum, ranging from mild to lethal, and vary on the mode associated risks of administration. The most frequently encountered side effects of cannabinoids are generally those from recreational sources.

Over the long-term, heavy cannabinoid abuse has correlated in numerous adverse health conditions, including:

- Addiction, altered brain development, and cognitive impairment in adolescents

- Chronic bronchitis, ARDS, lung cancer

- Increased risk for myocardial infarction, stroke, and thromboembolic events

- Exacerbation of mood disorders (anxiety, depression) and psychotic disorders (schizophrenia)

- Exacerbation of neurodegenerative diseases (multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease)

In addition to the above, other adverse effects of cannabinoids include hypersensitivity reactions to active cannabinoids in specific formulations or constituent components (e.g., capsules or inactive additives) or disulfiram reaction (nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, and headache) with concurrent disulfiram or metronidazole use.
