Due to the key structures lying within the cubital fossa, damage secondary to traumaÂ can lead to significant long-term effects, most commonly occurring following supracondylar fractures. Supracondylar fractures can be described by the Modified Gartland classification

- Type I - undisplaced

- Type II - displaced, posterior cortex remains intact

- Type III - completely displaced

- Type IV - completely displaced, instability during flexion or extension

Gartland II, III, and IV fractures, in particular, are at risk of causing damage to the radial nerve, median nerve, or brachial artery. Early reduction and/or fixation of these fractures, alongside close monitoring following this, are crucial to management to attempt avoidance of long-term complications.
