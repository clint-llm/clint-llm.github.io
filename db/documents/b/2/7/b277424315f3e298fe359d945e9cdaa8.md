The cardio-selective beta-1-blockers include atenolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, esmolol, acebutolol, metoprolol, and nebivolol. FDA-approved uses of beta-1-selective blockers include hypertension, chronic stable angina, heart failure, post-myocardial infarction, and decreased left ventricular function after a recent myocardial infarction. Non-FDA-approved uses include migraine prophylaxis, treatment of arrhythmias, tremor reduction, and the symptomatic treatment of anxiety disorders. Their use is associated with decreased morbidity and mortality post-myocardial infarction. Treatment with beta-1 blockers reduces the risk of stroke, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure. This activity outlines the indications, mechanisms of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring, of selective beta-1 antagonists, so providers can direct patient therapy in treating indicated disorders as part of the interprofessional team, with a basis on the current knowledge for optimal utilization.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for using selective beta-1 antagonist agents.
- Describe the mechanism of action of selective beta-1 blockers and how it differs from non-selective agents.
- Outline the potential adverse events associated with selective beta-1 antagonists.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance selective beta-1-blockers where it is indicated and improve patient outcomes.
