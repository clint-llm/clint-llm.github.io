The learning that takes place in medical simulation settings is largely experiential in nature. Participants experience a novel situation in a simulated scenario, and subsequently reflect on it, deepening their understanding of the relevant aspects of healthcare and (it is to be hoped) modifying their future behavior in the real world . One important factor which affects this post-experience reflection is the quality of the associated debriefing and analysis. Debriefing is the act of reviewing critical actions that unfolded during the course of a simulation scenario.
