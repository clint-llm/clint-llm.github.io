Myopic foveoschisis, as the name suggests, is almost always seen in eyes with high myopia and posterior staphyloma.

Apart from posterior staphyloma and elongation of the eyeball, other factors contributing to etiology may be traction exerted by pre-macular cortical vitreous, stiff retinal vasculature, or internal limiting membrane rigidity. Multiple consequences of high myopia such as lacquer cracks produced by breaks in the choroid due to ectasia, choroidal atrophy, andÂ choroidal neovascularization, can also co-exist in eyes with myopic foveoschisis.
