Exertional compartment syndrome is often a diagnosis of exclusion and occurs secondary to increased pressures in a muscular compartment, with resultant ischemia manifesting most commonly as pain.

Chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS) occurs in the setting of recurrent, reversible ischemic episodes following the cessation of activity resulting in the predictable decrease in fascial compartment pressures.

Acute exertional compartment syndrome (AECS) is a rare entity that, unfortunately, its diagnosis is often delayed.Â  Just as in acute compartment syndrome (ACS), the diagnosis implies a surgical emergency requiring fasciotomies to help mitigate the risks of ensuing irreversible muscle ischemia and neurovascular injury, which can occur after just a few hours alone.
