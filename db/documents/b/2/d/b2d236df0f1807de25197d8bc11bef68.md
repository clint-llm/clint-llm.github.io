Patients usually present with symptoms such as the sudden onset of floaters, blurred vision, loss of vision, scotoma, or distorted vision. Pain and redness may be present if the anterior segment has also become inflamed as a part of panuveitis. Patients may be asymptomatic when the lesions are present in the periphery of the retina, away from the macula. Some patients may have associated systemic symptoms. Congenital toxoplasmosis is associated with prematurity, intrauterine growth restriction, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, rash, chorioretinal lesions, hydrocephalus, intracranial calcification, microcephaly, and seizures. Young children may present with reduced visual acuity, nystagmus, strabismus, or leukocoria. A history of contact with pets is in the patient history with parasitic infections like toxocariasis and toxoplasmosis.

Most infections have characteristic fundus features. Choroiditis and retinitis a distinguishable on fundus examination. Retinitis appears as a whitish patch with ill-defined borders. It is superficial, with severe overlying vitritis. In contrast, choroiditis lesions appear as yellow patches, with regular borders, deeper to the retinal vessels, causing mild vitritis. Active lesions have fuzzy borders, whereas healed lesions have a sharply demarcated margin with pigmentation. However, in most cases, both retina and choroid are inflamed, resulting in chorioretinitis.
