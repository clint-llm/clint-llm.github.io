The interprofessional team should closely monitor vital signs to ensure adequate augmentation with IABP. In patients with hypotension/hemodynamic instability despite being on IABP, urgent troubleshooting should be considered that includes evaluation of adequate timing of balloon inflation and deflation to assess the positioning of the intra-aortic balloon by fluoroscopy and imaging studies checking for kinking of tubings and functioning of gas supply apparatus. If no problem is detected, then alternate possibilities may be considered that include dehydration, sepsis, or overt hemodynamic collapse due to severe myocardial depression.

If the patient develops a fever, a broad differential diagnosis should be considered that includes but is not limited to sepsis, thrombosis, or thromboembolic phenomena related to IABP catheter/balloon, pressure ulcers, pneumonia/atelectasis, or drug reaction.

Monitor for hemorrhagic complications.

Frequent neurological exams to monitor for cerebrovascular complications (stroke) and to monitor for delirium are needed.

Helium gas leaks secondary to balloon rupture or malfunction can lead to acute embolic stroke. In case of a suspicion of gas leak from the balloon, the patient should be placed in a Trendelenburg position, and IABP should be switched off with termination of gas supply.

Frequent monitoring of peripheral arterial pulses is imperative to promptly identify the vascular complications secondary to IABP and manage them accordingly.
