Early childhood caries is the most common chronic, infectious childhood disease worldwide and a health matter of most serious concern. Healthcare professionals should adopt the following measures in the systematic prevention of ECC:

**Preventing Vertical and Horizontal Transmission of Streptococcus Mutans**

Since mothers are the primary source of Streptococcus mutans to their infants, screening pregnant women for dental caries and improving their oral health reduces the transmission of bacteria.

**Children's Oral Hygiene**

Healthcare providers should educate parents and caregivers about children's oral hygiene. Fewer Streptococcus mutans have been found in children who toothbrush with fluoridated toothpaste.

**Dietary Sugars**

Fruit juice should be avoided in children younger than 12 months of age, limiting it to 120 ml up to 3 years of age and 120 to 180 ml in 4- to 6-year-olds.

In children with chronic medical conditions, the prescribing clinician should consider the risk of early childhood caries when indicating sugar-containing oral medicines. Parents should be advised to brush the infant's teeth immediately after taking such medications.
