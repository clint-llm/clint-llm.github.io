Historically, whole abdomen radiation was practiced during early times; however, due to the increased frequency of toxicity and complications, its use became nonexistent.Â Currently, the role of radiation in ovarian cancer is limited to palliation, either for symptom control or to treat a localized spread of disease. Adjuvant radiotherapy has not even shown any survival benefit in the early stages of clear cell carcinoma, including a high-risk subset of patients.

Due to the advent of advanced systemic therapies, radiation has taken a backseat in the management of ovarian cancer, offering limited use. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is one of the newer techniques for palliative radiation. There is still evidence of high rates of distant progression of lesions with its use, even when local control is achieved.

Currently, with the emergence of new techniques like SBRT, intensity-modulated radiotherapy, and low dose hypofractionation, the role of radiation is strongly considered for local-regionally recurrent ovarian cancer, especially for chemotherapy-resistant lesions.
