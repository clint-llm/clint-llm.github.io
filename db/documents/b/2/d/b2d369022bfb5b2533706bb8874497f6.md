First described by Thomas B. Fitzpatrick in 1972, the Fitzpatrick skin phototypes were developed based on an individual's skin color and their tendency to burn or tan when exposed to sunlight. More specifically, classification was based on a patient's responses to the following questions regarding their skin's reaction to a 45-60 minute, early summer, noon sun exposure in northern latitudes (20-45 degrees): "how painful is your sunburn?" and "how much tan will you develop in a week?" Initially enumerated as skin types I through IV to classify patients with white skin, the Fitzpatrick phototype classification scale was later modified to include types V and VI for persons with darker skin.

By nature of the criteria, Fitzpatrick's skin type classifications are subjective; however, use of the scale has proven valuable as a diagnostic and therapeutic evaluation tool for many situations. Specifically, these classifications are commonly employed to estimate dosages of particular ultraviolet B (UVB), psoralen with ultraviolet A (PUVA), and laser treatments, as well as to predict skin cancer risk and guide sun protection advice.
