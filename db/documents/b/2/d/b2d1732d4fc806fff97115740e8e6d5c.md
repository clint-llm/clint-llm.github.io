The most commonly used PVS is the Denver shunt, which a modified version of the original design.

The venous end of the shunt is inserted into the superior vena cava via the internal jugular veins or the subclavian veins under fluoroscopic guidance until the catheter tip ends in the proximal right atrium. A one-way pressure-sensitive valve is attached to prevent the backflow of blood from the venous end of the shunt.
