To date, there is no classification system for myopic foveoschisis, which is universally accepted. Two classification systems are commonly used.

In 2015, the meta-analysis for pathologic myopia study group published the "International Photographic Classification and Grading System for Myopic Maculopathy" based on the color view of the fundus. The classification system is as follows:

- Category 1: Tessellated fundus (well-defined choroidal vessels)

- Category 2: Diffuse atrophy (whitish-yellow appearance)

- Category 3: Patchy atrophy (well-defined atrophic areas around the disc or at the posterior pole)

- Category 4: Macular atrophy

Recently, Barabara Parolini and colleagues have presented the MTM staging system (MSS) based on the OCT features of the retina.

- Stage1a: Inner-outer macular schisis with a normal foveal profile

- Stage1b: Inner-outer macular schisis with a lamellar macular hole

- Stage1c: Inner-outer macular schisis with a full-thickness macular hole

- Stage2a: Predominantly outer macular schisis with a normal foveal profile

- Stage2b: Predominantly outer macular schisis with a lamellar macular hole

- Stage2c: Predominantly outer macular schisis with a full-thickness macular hole

- Stage3a: Macular schisis detachment with a normal foveal profile

- Stage3b: Macular schisis detachment with a lamellar macular hole

- Stage3c: Macular schisis detachment with a full-thickness macular hole

- Stage4a: Macular detachment with a normal foveal profile

- Stage4b: Macular detachment with a lamellar macular hole

- Stage4c: Macular detachment with a full-thickness macular hole

Each stage can have epiretinal abnormalities, and a "+" sign can be added to indicate its presence.This classification system standardizes the nomenclature, gives an insight into the natural progression of the disease, and helps plan the management.
