Rotation flaps are elevated using an arcuate or curvilinear incision. Although they are referred to as rotation flaps, in practice, these flaps combine both advancement and rotation to pivot a flap into place (see Figure 1). Due to their arcuate shape, solitary rotation flaps are ideal for closing triangular defects. If a circular defect is being closed with a single rotation flap, the defect must be enlarged into an isosceles triangle along the arc of the tissue movement before flap transfer. The apex of the triangle must point to the center of the arc, and the base of the triangle must be continuous with the arc of the flap.

Rotational flaps are unique in that they are subject to a tethering effect known as pivotal restraint. Because of this phenomenon, rotation flaps can fall short by not completely covering the most distal edge of the primary defect.

Pivotal restraint should be considered in the planning stages of the flap. Pivotal restraint is addressed by making the radius of the arc greater than the length of the defect. Some authors suggest the radius should measure 1-2 times the length of the defect. This increase in radius makes the arc taller than the defect and effectively compensates for the loss of length that occurs as the flap is rotated. Another option is to add more of an advancement component to the flap. Doing so, however, increases the closing tension, which can impair the vascular supply to the tip of the flap.

The angle of the arc should be greater than 90 degrees to distribute tension properly.

The vector of tension for a rotation flap is directed perpendicularly along the arc of the incision, which, in a classic rotation flap, is perpendicular to the tension vector for primary wound closure. Like most flaps, the area of greatest tension is at the closure of the secondary defect. For a pure rotation flap, the maximal tension is directed perpendicular to the arc of rotation, 90 to 135 degrees away from the defect.

Due to the primary motion of a rotation flap, a standing cutaneous deformity may be produced at the end of the arc opposite the defect, on the outside of the curve. A common way to address this is to take a Burow’s triangle at some point along the outside of the curve. In some instances, especially with longer incisions, the length difference between the cut skin edges on the inside and outside of the curve can be serially halved using sutures to compress and distribute the excess tissue over the length of the wound. If a back cut is necessary, it can be combined with a Burow’s triangle to create a Z-plasty at the end of the arc.

**Double Rotation Flaps**

**Double Flap
**

Double rotation flaps are commonly used for defects too large to close with a single rotation flap. Typically, these flaps are used on the scalp or around free margins. These flaps produce a combination of both advancement and rotation, which can make categorization as either rotation or advancement flaps challenging. The design of a double rotation flap starts with a single point on the periphery of the defect, from which arcs proceed in opposite directions to form a semicircle with the defect at the apex of the arc (See figure). Each flap is mobilized and rotated in opposite directions to come together and close the defect. An analogy for this type of movement would be closing a book, where both sides are moving equally to meet in the middle. It is important to note that this defect is enlarged into a triangular defect, with the apex of the triangle pointing away from the apex of the semicircle, unlike the other double rotation flaps discussed below.

**O to Z Flap
**

The O to Z flap is a double rotation flap commonly used on the central scalp or large lesions on the trunk.

**Modified Peng Flap
**

The Peng flap is used for medium to large nasal tip defects.

**Unique Rotation Flaps**

**Dorsal Nasal Rotation Flap**

Rieger first proposed the dorsal nasal rotation flap in 1967.

For this reason, back cuts beyond the level of the medial canthus should be avoided because they can compromise the vascular supply of the flap. Making a back cut typically results in a V-Y advancement component to the closure, which also makes categorizing the Rieger flap as a purely rotational technique somewhat incorrect. Patient selection is important in this flap because some patients may not have the tissue laxity necessary to transfer this flap. The Rieger flap can cause a loss of nasal symmetry, lifting of the nasal tip and ala, and distortion of the ala if it is not designed correctly.

**Mustardé/Tenzel Flap**

The Mustardé flap is used for defects of the lower eyelid and cheek.

A similar design, known as the Tenzel flap, is a myocutaneous rotation flap used for lower eyelid defects. This is smaller than a Mustardé flap, and it incorporates some of the orbicularis oculi muscle. The incision is carried along the lower eyelid and proceeds superiorly past the lateral canthus, similarly to a Mustardé flap. However, the Tenzel flap does not extend as far as the Mustardé flap. This flap relies on the rotation of the temporal skin and usually requires lysis of the lateral canthal tendon to fully mobilize the tissue being transferred.

**Spiral Flap**

The spiral flap has several proposed uses, including lower eyelid and ventral fingertip defects.

The flap will move anteriorly and superiorly or inferiorly, depending on the location of the tissue reservoir. The take-off point of the incision is along the inferior aspect of the defect, with the arc extending anteriorly. As mentioned above, the first arm of the spiral is sutured to the flap to initiate the spiral and recreate the alar crease or groove. The second stitch anchors the flap to the point of maximal tension along the inferior aspect of the defect.

**Cervicofacial Flap**

The cervicofacial flap is used for very large defects of the cheek. The flap is created similarly to a Mustardé flap, with the incision carried farther onto the neck. The incision runs from the superior aspect of the defect superolaterally to the preauricular cheek. The incision is then extended, crossing under the ear and inferiorly along the lateral neck. The arterial supply comes from perforators of the facial and submental arteries. The cervical skin is an excellent source of redundant tissue and allows for improved tissue matching compared to a skin graft or a flap taken from a distant site. As in the Mustardé flap, cervicofacial flaps can rotate facial hair from the beard and sideburns onto the cheek in male patients with large defects. This is also a very large flap which may necessitate the use of tacking sutures
