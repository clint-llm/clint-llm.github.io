Low HDL has been described in various forms of familial lipid disorders and as a part of metabolic syndrome.

Tangier disease, discovered 40 years ago in siblings on Tangier Island, is an autosomal co-dominant condition in which the homozygous state has an absence of plasma HDL-C with premature coronary artery disease, peripheral neuropathy, cholesteryl ester deposition in the reticuloendothelial system leading to hepatosplenomegaly, xanthomata, xanthelasma, arcus corneae along with enlarged tonsils and lymph nodes. HDL is about 50% of normal levels in heterozygotes.

Another rare inherited lipid disorder is familial combined hypolipidemia. This disorder is defined by low LDL, triglycerides, and HDL.

Lipoprotein lipase facilitates the transfer of cholesterol to HDL from lipoproteins and triglyceride-enriched lipoprotein hydrolysis, lowering triglyceride levels. The premature coronary disease was present in 15% of those with heterozygotes of the lipoprotein lipase gene mutations in one study.

Lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) is an enzyme that esterifies free cholesterol to cholesterol esters and HDL cholesterol. Very low serum HDL has been observed in those with homozygous mutations of the LCAT gene. Fish-eye syndrome is characterized by LCAT deficiency due to mutations of the LCAT gene with associated classic symptoms of severe corneal opacities, nephropathy, and proteinuria. Typically premature cardiovascular disease is not seen with LCAT deficiency but can occur in some mutations even in heterozygotes.

Low HDL cholesterol is a component of metabolic syndrome atherogenic lipid phenotype. Other features of the syndrome include insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension, borderline high LDL, and elevations of triglyceride enriched remnants.
