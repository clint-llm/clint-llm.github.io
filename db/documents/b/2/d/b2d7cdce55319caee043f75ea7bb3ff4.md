Patients with Becker muscular dystrophy have a less severe and milder clinical course than Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Chances of survival decrease with time as the disease progresses. Thus supportive interventions help prolong life. The average life expectancy of the patient with Becker muscular dystrophy is about 40 to 50 years. Death is most commonly due to dilated cardiomyopathy.
