Naproxen is FDA-approved for treating acute gout, ankylosing spondylitis, bursitis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, osteoarthritis, tendonitis, rheumatoid arthritis, pain, and primary dysmenorrhea. It is the first-line treatment for acute gouty arthritis, osteoarthritis, musculoskeletal pain, inflammation, and dysmenorrhea. While naproxen and other NSAIDs are approved for the treatment of inflammatory arthropathies such as rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, they do not alter the course of the disease, nor do they prevent joint and soft tissue destruction that are common sequelae of these diseases. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of naproxen, so providers can direct patient therapy to optimal outcomes when pain relief is needed.

**Objectives:**
- Describes the mechanisms of action of naproxen.
- Identify the approved and off-label indications for initiating therapy with naproxen.
- Summarize the adverse event profile of naproxen.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients who can benefit from therapy with naproxen.
