Debriefing is arguably the most critical part of the simulation session that pertains explicitly to knowledge consolidation. There is now a small but growing body of evidence addressing this aspect of telesimulation. A study that examined the efficacy and feasibility of teledebriefing as an alternative to in-person debriefing found that teledebriefing was rated slightly lower than in-person debriefing, but was still found to be consistently effective. The authors of this study came to the conclusion that since the overall rating of teledebriefing was very high (receiving a score of "consistently effective/very good" on the Debriefing Assessment for Simulation in Healthcare Student Version (DASH-SV)), it may be a practical alternative to debriefing if faculty or staff is unavailable to provide traditional in-person debriefing for simulation-based medical training.

The authors also report the possible reasons why teledebriefing was rated lower than traditional debriefing. These included the loss of non-verbal cues (in part due to the debriefer only being viewable from the shoulders up on the video screen), the inability to demonstrate maneuvers or procedures physically, and the inability of teledebriefing faculty to visualize or hear subtle forms of communication between participants during their observation of the simulation session.
