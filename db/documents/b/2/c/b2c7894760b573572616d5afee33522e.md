**Symptoms and Signs**

Contralateral paralysis of the upper and lower limb of the body due to lateral corticospinal tract involvement is a common finding.

Ipsilateral deviation of the tongue due to ipsilateral hypoglossal nerve damage (the lower motor type of lesion) can be seen. Although dysphagia is commonly seen in patients with lateral medullary syndrome, it is more common in the bilateral medial medullary infarct.
