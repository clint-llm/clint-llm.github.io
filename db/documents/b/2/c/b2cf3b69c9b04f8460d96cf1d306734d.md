When considering the possibility of a diagnosis of PACNS, it is important to rule out other conditions which can mimic PACNS. These mimicking conditions can be grouped as below

The first group is termed as reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes (RCVS) which include Call-Fleming syndrome, migrainous vasospasm, and post-partum angiopathy. These conditions bear the closest resemblance to primary CNS angiitis. They can be differentiated by their acute onset and normal CSF findings. On further testing, even though angiography may be abnormal in these cases, a biopsy will never show vasculitic changes.

The second group of disorders which can mimic PACNS are secondary CNS vasculitis. This is a broad grouping which encompasses numerous infectious, rheumatic, autoinflammatory disorders along with other disorders which can secondarily cause CNS vasculitis. The infectious causes of secondary CNS vasculitis include bacterial (tuberculosis, syphilis), viral (Epstein-Barr virus, VZV), and fungal (Candida, Aspergillus). The rheumatic and autoinflammatory causes include Churg-Strauss disease, SLE, Behcet syndrome, among others. Other disorders which can cause CNS vasculitis include Moyamoya disease, fibromuscular dysplasia, and radiation vasculopathy. A complete workup for these secondary CNS vasculitides should also be made before confirming a diagnosis of PACNS.
