The initial care of a patient with acute radiation syndrome is based on getting the best history possible. The location, dose, and injuries sustained will make the triage of the patient easier. Record if and when a patient had any vomiting or nausea after the exposure. Vomiting is one of the earliest signs of radiation exposure. A complete physical exam must be performed. At this time it would be a good idea to take mouth and nostril swabs to be sent for radiation testing. Make notes of any burns or blast injuries. The patient should be surveyed for radiation as per your regional protocol. All surgical or trauma injuries must be triaged appropriately.
