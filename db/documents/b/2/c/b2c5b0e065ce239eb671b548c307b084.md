Hyperamylasemia is due to impaired metabolic clearance or pathology involving the organs containing amylase enzyme. In acute pancreatitis, inflammation of pancreatic cells leads to the secretion of amylase intoÂ the bloodstream. Pathologies that involve trauma of the organs, such as blunt trauma to the pancreas or parotid gland or even endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to the pancreatic duct, can lead to the release of stored amylase. Given amylase is cleared by the kidney and the reticuloendothelial system, renal failure and liver disease (i.e., hepatitis or cirrhosis) are associated with hyperamylasemia. Chronic alcohol abuse can also lead to hyperamylasemia and is thought to be related to liver damage.
