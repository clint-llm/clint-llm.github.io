**Therapeutic Effects of Intrathecal Morphine**

When administered intrathecally, morphine has a rapid and smooth onset that is variable in its duration.

**Central Nervous System Effects**

Intrathecal morphine causes miosis and can lower the seizure threshold. It can lead to CNS depression, and the level of consciousness requires vigilant monitoring.

**Cardiovascular Effects**

A single dose of intrathecal morphine can lead to orthostatic hypotension in patients with intravascular hypovolemia or impaired myocardial function on sympatholytic drugs. Intrathecal morphine can lead to bradycardia that may potentiate hypotension further.

**Respiratory Effects**

The single most serious adverse event encountered during the administration of intrathecal morphine is respiratory depression or respiratory arrest. Intrathecal morphine can lead to severe respiratory depression that can last up to 24 hours following administration and could lead to respiratory arrest. This respiratory depression follows a biphasic pattern with initial onset within the first 1 to 3 hours and a late-onset at about 6 to 12 hours after administration. Clinicians should limit additional opioids for the first 24 hours after administration.Â  If additional opioids are necessary, the patient should be monitored closely for signs of respiratory depression/apnea.
