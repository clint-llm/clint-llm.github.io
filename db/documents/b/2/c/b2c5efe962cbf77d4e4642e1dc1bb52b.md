Opisthotonus is defined as a dramatic abnormal posture due to spastic contraction of the extensor muscles of the neck, trunk, and lower extremities that produces a severe backward arching from neck to heel. In most cases, the trunk is elevated off the ground by a few inches. It is usually sudden in onset and can be sustained or repetitive. It can be considered a variant of decerebrate posturing involving a hyperextension of the neck, back, and limbs. Sometimes it is referred to as arc de cercle.
