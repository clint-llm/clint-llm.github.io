As a diagnosis of exclusion, it is vital upon initial presentation of acute chest pain that a wide differential diagnosis is considered. Tietze syndrome is most commonly misdiagnosed as costochondritis, as the latter also presents as anterior chest wall pain that is reproduced with palpation at the sternochondral and costochondral junctions. Costochondritis, however, is associated with multiple ribs typically ranging from 2 to 5 and is not associated with localized swelling over the affected joints. Ultrasound will not demonstrate significant findings with costochondritis, whereas sonogram is a mainstay in aiding a Tietze syndrome diagnosis.

Other pathologies to rule out include acute coronary syndrome, hypertensive crisis, inflammatory processes or infections of the lungs and the accompanying pleura, malignancies, trauma associated fractures in the chest, rheumatoid or pyogenic arthritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or psychogenic disorders.
