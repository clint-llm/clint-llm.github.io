A percutaneous lung lesion biopsy is usually performed by a radiologist, but complete patient care also involves nurses and radiologic technologists and may involve surgeons, pulmonologists, and other medical specialists assisting the surgeon in the preparation and education of the patient. During and after the procedure, the specialty-trained radiology nurse assists the radiologist and monitors the patient reporting any destabilization of vital signs. The nurse should also assist in providing coordinated patient education. A team approach to the care of these patients will lead to the best outcomes. [Level 5]

**Outcomes**

Percutaneous lung lesion biopsies have a high likelihood of diagnostic success and, in most cases, are without complication. However, a sizeable number of patients will experience one or more complications or failure of the procedure. Hence, patients should be educated in advance about such possibilities and ways to help reduce them, and patients must be closely monitored during and after the procedure.
