When prescribing macrolides, the prescriber should consider the variety of gastrointestinal side effects and cardiac effects that the patient could encounter with macrolide use. In most patients, gastrointestinal side effects will be the most common, and the team should be ready to take proper measures to counter these effects. Due to the risk of QT prolongation, careful monitoring of patients with cardiac conditions as well as those taking antiarrhythmics or drugs known to cause interaction should be carried out. Prescribers should also be aware of possible dermatologic side effects and thus should counsel patients on the side effects. Concerning possible side effects in pregnant women and newborns, patients require counsel on the adverse effects of these drugs in pregnancy, including the probable adverse impact on the newborn when prescribing these drugs.
