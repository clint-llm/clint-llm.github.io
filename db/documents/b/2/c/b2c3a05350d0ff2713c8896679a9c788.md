No preoperative preparation, such as bowel prep, is needed. The field is typically prepped with a local antiseptic solution of surgeon's preference.

Antibiotics

Most cases do not require any preoperative intravenous antibiotics.

Anesthesia

A lateral internal anal sphincterotomy can be performed in the office using a local anesthetic, or it can be performed in the operating room under regional or general anesthetic. The choice of anesthesia is decided based on patient and surgeon preference.  However, studies demonstrate a higher rate of fissure recurrence for internal anal sphincterotomy performed under local anesthetic alone.

Patient Positioning

The patient can be placed in the prone jackknife, lithotomy, or lateral decubitus position. This will be determined by surgeon preference, patient body habitus, and patient comorbidities. A morbidly obese patient may not tolerate jackknife and lithotomy position.  It is this surgeon's preference for lithotomy positioning.
