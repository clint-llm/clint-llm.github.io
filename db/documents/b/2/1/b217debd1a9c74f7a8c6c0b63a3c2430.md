When testing for thyroid function, most clinicians rely on serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and serum-free T4. Thyroid-stimulating hormone is responsible for the stimulation of the thyroid to produce more iodothyronines. Therefore, levels inversely correlate with active thyroid hormone concentrations; as T3 increases, TSH decreases, and vice versa. Free levels of thyroxine are measured in the serum rather than total T4 levels, which would include protein-bound T4, which is not available to enter tissues. Free T4, on the other hand, can be a proxy for serum T3 levels. Most often, thyroxine levels are the last to become abnormal in thyroid disorders as the upstream products, TSH and T4, maintain available T3 at their own expense.
