Benzathine penicillin is often administered by healthcare team members, including the primary care provider, internist, infectious disease expert, nurse practitioner, or physicians assistant. While the drug is relatively safe, it is crucial to observe the patient for an allergic reaction. Empirical use of this drug can lead to superinfections. Nursing staff should counsel the patient on how to take the medication and answer any questions they may have regarding their antimicrobial therapy. The pharmacist can reiterate administration points, advise the patient to be sure and take the entire course of medication and not stop if they begin to feel better, and be available for questions, informing the nurse or prescribing clinician of any adverse events or signs of therapeutic failure. In this way, all interprofessional team members can play a role in successful therapeutic patient outcomes with minimal adverse events.
