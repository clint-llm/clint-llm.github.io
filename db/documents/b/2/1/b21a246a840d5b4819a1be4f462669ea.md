Salient points in the history that suggest the presence of renovascular hypertension include:

- Resistant hypertension: Uncontrolled blood pressure necessitating the use of 2 or 3 antihypertensive agents of different classes, one of which is a diuretic

- Trial of multiple medications to control blood pressure

- History of multiple hospital admissions for hypertensive crisis

- Elevation in creatinine of more than 30% after starting an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I)

- Patients with renal artery stenosis secondary to atherosclerosis are usually older and might have the presence of other atherosclerotic diseases such as carotid artery stenosis, peripheral artery stenosis, or coronary artery disease

- A premenopausal female (15-50 years) with hypertension is most likely to have FMD

- Long term history of smoking

- Patients with systemic vasculitis can develop vasculitis of renal arteries and present with renovascular hypertension

- Recurrent episodes of flash pulmonary edema and/or unexplained congestive heart failure

- Unexplained azotemia

- Elevation in serum creatinine upon starting ACE-I, which occurs due to interference with autoregulation and post glomerular arterial tone

- Unexplained hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis

- Unilateral small or atrophic kidney

Physical examination may reveal an abdominal bruit, indicating the presence of renal artery stenosis.
