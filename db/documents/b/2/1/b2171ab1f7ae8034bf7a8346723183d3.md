Two types of otoscope heads can be used to evaluate the ears: 1) surgical or operating, and 2) diagnostic or pneumatic. By inspecting the ears, the degree of tympanic membrane mobility in response to negative or positive pressure can be evaluated to assess for fluid in the middle ear, a hallmark of otitis media. Other abnormalities in the tympanic membrane found are erythema, bulging or fullness, or extreme retraction. The treatment of chronic suppurative otitis media needs to be guided by a microbiologic investigation with the targeting of the microorganism according to the result.

Pseudomonas is one of the organisms most frequently found and ubiquitous in our physical environment and has a predilection for moist areas. It is thought to infect tissues first by adherence to epithelial cells through pili or fimbriae.
