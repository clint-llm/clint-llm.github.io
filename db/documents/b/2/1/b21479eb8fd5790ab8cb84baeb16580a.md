In the healthcare system, support staff should be informed of the possible side effects of a procedure of any kind that interrupts the dural space, which can cause a postural headache secondary to ICH. The staff must be aware of the cause of the symptoms, at least on a basic level, so that they may assist in the conservative measures to improve symptoms and enhance the patient outcomes. It is the goal of all members of the healthcare team that the patient has a complete resolution of symptoms. In order to accomplish this, it is integral to have clear communication between physicians, such as anesthesiologists which perform LPs, and the nurses and nurse assistants caring for the patients on an hourly basis. The support staff needs to be made aware of what to look for and how to improve symptoms and prognosis.
