The diagnosis and management of strongyloidiasis require a high degree of clinical suspicion and careful care coordination among interprofessional healthcare team members to ensure early diagnosis, appropriate treatment, and effective eradication of the disease. The pharmacist plays a crucial role in ensuring medication compliance to ensure eradication occurs with the first treatment course. Subsequent monitoring of all patients is required to ensure that larvae are no longer detectable in the body fluids; nurses participate extensively in monitoring, answering patient questions, reporting/charting therapy progress for the clinician team, and educating patients regarding the need for effective therapy despite minimal symptoms. Response to treatment should be followed up with serial stool exams or anti-Strongyloides titers for one to two years in all patients.
