The classic historical findings include:

- Headache: any location (bilateral, frontal, retrobulbar), often daily, and sometimes associated with increased severity in the morning and with Valsalva.

- Transient vision loss: can be monocular or binocular, partial or complete, and typically lasts for a few seconds at a time. Vision loss is likely due to optic disc edema leading to temporary ischemia of the optic nerve. Transient vision loss occurs in up to 70% of cases.

- Diplopia: binocular and horizontal due to cranial nerve VI (abducens) palsy.

- Pulsatile tinnitus: described as a heartbeat or whooshing sound. Tinnitus can be unilateral or bilateral.

- Photopsia: described as sudden flashes of light; occurs in up to 54% of cases.

- Persistent vision loss: occurs in up to 32% of cases, most of whom are untreated.

The classic physical exam findings include:

- Papilledema: due to increased intracranial pressure.

- Cranial nerve VI (abducens)/lateral rectus palsy: may result in esotropia. The patient may experience horizontal diplopia.

- Visual field loss: occurs more frequently than changes in visual acuity.
