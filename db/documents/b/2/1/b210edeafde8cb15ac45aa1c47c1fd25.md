A gastrostomy tube (G-tube) is indicated in patients that need long-term pre-pyloric feeding. Endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement is now the preferred modality over surgical gastrostomy owing to a less invasive nature and faster time to start feeding. If the tube is dislodged within 4 weeks of initial placement, patients are at significant risk of peritonitis and perforation due to peritoneal spillage of gastric contents through the immature track, and replacement should not be attempted without surgical consultation. This activity focuses on the methods of G-tube replacement, and possible complications of G-tube replacement. and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients that require this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the anatomy of gastrostomy tube placement.
- Outline the indications and contraindications for bedside gastrostomy tube replacement.
- Review how to replace a displaced gastrostomy tube at the bedside.
- Summarize how the interprofessional team can work together to identify complications and how to manage them after gastrostomy tube replacement is performed to improve the care of patients that require this procedure.
