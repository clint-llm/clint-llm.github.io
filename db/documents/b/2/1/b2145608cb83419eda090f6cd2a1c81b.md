Hair loss is a common phenomenon encountered among physicians. It has a myriad of underlying causes. Loose anagen hair syndrome is a non-scarring alopecia that results from defects of keratinization.

The inner root sheath at the level of the bulb normally provides anchoring support for anagen hairs. Degenerative changes as described above disrupt the interdigitation of cuticle cells and inner root sheath leading to hairs easily pulled away by minor trauma.

As the rest of the follicular structure is uninvolved in loose anagen hair syndrome hair replaces itself normally and regrowth is prompt. Clinically this presents as frequent “shedding” of hair and an overall thinned appearance.
