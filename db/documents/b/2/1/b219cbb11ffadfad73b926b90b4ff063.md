Patients with spinal stenosis are often first encountered by the nurse practitioner, primary care physician, emergency department physician, and internist. If the patients are asymptomatic, there is usually no treatment necessary. Patients with pain should be encouraged to participate in an exercise program, discontinue smoking, and maintain a healthy weight. The few patients with nerve compression should be referred to an orthopedic or neurosurgeon. However, the primary care providers should educate the patient on potential complications of the surgery, which can be disabling.Â It is essential to take an interprofessional team including a team of physicians (physical medicine and rehabilitation, pain management, orthopedist, and/or neurosurgeons), physical therapists, occupational therapist, social workers, and case managers who can work together to coordinate mobilization with outpatient therapy and aggressive multifaceted rehabilitation so we can improve a patient's functional status.
