The process of preparing an ear tissue sample for histologic observation can be different depending on which portion of the ear is under assessment. External and middle ear preparations are similar to the development of any other tissue. Initially, the fabric is fixed with a chemical solution to preserve the sample, followed by processing andÂ embedding in a mold. Finally, the mold is sliced into sections, and the tissue sample is prepared onto a microscopic slide. The prepared slide is then stained based on the preparer's needs, with the most commonly used stain being the hematoxylin and eosin stain.

There have also been advances in techniques to prepare the three-dimensional histological reconstruction of the inner ear and other complex tissue structures. One study embedded the compositions in an epoxy resin, followed by serial grinding and digitization.
