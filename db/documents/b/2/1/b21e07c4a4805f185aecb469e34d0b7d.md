Misoprostol is a generally safe and well-tolerated drug. Currently, there are no monitoring guidelines when being used for its FDA approved indication.

Similarly, there are no current guidelines regarding misoprostolâ€™s obstetric and gynecologic indications. When used to induce labor, fetal monitoring is recommended. However, there is some data suggesting induction of labor using misoprostol in an outpatient setting could be feasible.
