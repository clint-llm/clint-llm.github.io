Carbamates are a class of insecticides structurally and mechanistically similar to organophosphate (OP) insecticides. Carbamates are N-methyl carbamates derived from a carbamic acid and cause carbamylation of acetylcholinesterase at neuronal synapses and neuromuscular junctions. While they possess a similar mechanism of action to the irreversible phosphorylation of acetylcholinesterase by organophosphates, carbamates bind to acetylcholinesterase reversibly. Subsequently, carbamates have a similar toxicological presentation to OP poisonings with a duration of toxicity that is typically less than 24 hours
