The middle ear often becomes a functionally closed space due to obstruction or collapse of the Eustachian tube. While this typically does not cause individual distress at his or her home elevation, it may become problematic when changing altitudes during aviation or diving. This is especially true if the Eustachian tube on one side functionally closes at a different ambient pressure than the contralateral side, resulting in a larger or smaller total amount of air within the chamber as compared to the other side. As the volume of air within the closed middle ear expands or contracts with ascent or descent, relative pressure differentials across the tympanic membrane and the middle ear, as well as the middle-inner ear interfaces, are exacerbated by the expansion or contraction of the middle ear chambers as they hold different sea-level volumes of gas. If a pressure differential exists between the left and right middle ears, there becomes a difference in perception across either the vestibular system that manifests symptomatically with vertiginous symptoms. One can expect to experience alternobaric vertigo with differences in middle ear pressures of greater than 60 cm H2O.
