The liver tissue develops as a diverticulum from the ventral foregut endoderm. The ventral foregut endoderm has two portions, the cranial and caudal portions. The intrahepatic duct develops from the cranial portion while the extrahepatic bile ducts develop from the caudal portion of the ventral foregut endoderm.

Around the eighth week of gestation, the epithelium of the intrahepatic duct begins to develop and centrifugally it proceeds from the hilum to the periphery of the liver. The intrahepatic biliary epithelium becomes completely mature only during the first year of life.

The extrahepatic biliary epithelium develops before the intrahepatic duct. Both of the ducts will combine at the level of the hepatic hilum.
