The above clinical trials about hypertension helped solidify the recommendations and formed the latest ACC/AHA guidelines. The DASH diet (1997) has been permanently incorporated into the non-pharmacological management of hypertension. Thiazides became widely used as first-line agents for essential hypertension based on the ALLHAT(2002) trial results.

Similarly, the AASK study done in 2002 emphasized using Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or Angiotensin receptor blockers among patients with Chronic kidney disease. The Accomplish study, which followed in 2008, proved that using the Ace-inhibitors/calcium channel blocker combination helped to decrease cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke. And the HYVET study strengthened the above results by stating that using a diuretic with or without ACE-I decreased all-cause mortality even in patients above 80 years of age.

While the ACCORD BP study done in 2010 showed that intensive BP control (SBP below 120 mmHg) did not show any improvement in the above outcomes, the SPRINT study (2015) showed that in patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease, intensive BP control (target SBP below 120 mmHg) improved cardiovascular outcomes and overall survival compared to standard therapy of treating to target SBP 135 to 139 mmHg.
