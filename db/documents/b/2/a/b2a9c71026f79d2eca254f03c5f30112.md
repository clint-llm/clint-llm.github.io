Globally, stroke is the second leading cause of death and a leading cause of disability, with 62% due to ischemia, 28% to ICH, and 10% to SAH.

Compared to ischemic stroke, ICH and SAH showed more considerable reductions globally in age-standardized rates per year of incident and prevalent strokes, deaths from stroke, and DALYs due to stroke from 1990 to 2019.

Starting at age 25, the global lifetime risk of stroke for men and women is approximately 25% and is particularly high in East Asia and Central and Eastern Europe.
