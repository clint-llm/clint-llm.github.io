Epispadias is a rare urogenital anomaly characterized by the failure of the urethral tube to tubularize on the dorsal aspect. Although commonly associated as a part of bladder exstrophy-epispadias-complex (BEEC), isolated epispadias occurs less frequently. Its diagnosis is clinical and does not require any additional investigations. The most important factor determining postoperative continence in these patients is the availability of a skilled pediatric surgeon/urologist. This activity outlines the etiology, pathogenesis, and surgical management of epispadias and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the etiology of epispadias.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation of epispadias.
- Review the common approaches of surgical management of epispadias in males and females.
- Summarize the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication, leading to superior outcomes of children with epispadias.
