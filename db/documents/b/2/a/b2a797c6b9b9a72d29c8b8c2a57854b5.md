**Hemodynamic Considerations**

Under normal conditions, the chest cavity is under negative pressure, and the negative inspiratory pressure generated by the expansion of the chest cavity not only pulls air into the lungs but it also augments venous return to the heart. When the patient transitions to positive pressure ventilation, venous return to the heart (and thus preload) is reduced, which may lower blood pressure. This is often associated with the concurrent drop in blood pressure caused by many sedative agents. The clinician's response to this drop in blood pressure ultimately depends on the patient and is beyond the scope of the chapter; however, a common error is setting the tidal volume too high, and reducing the tidal volume may lead to lower pressures and help mitigate some of this effect.

**Diagnostics**

This is not an exhaustive list, but there are several common scenarios and the initial moves to diagnose and correct them.

**Sudden Loss of EtCO2 Waveform**

Check the tube placement. Losing the end-tidal waveform may indicate that something has dislodged the tube. Check the sensor; secretions may impair the function of the sensor.

**Rising EtCO2**

Increase minute ventilation (increase respiratory rate and/or tidal volume).

**Worsening Hypoxia or Sudden Desaturation**

In cases of sudden worsening of hypoxia, it is essential to confirm tube placement and assess breath sounds. It is also important to evaluate for any tracheal deviation or subcutaneous emphysema that may suggest the development of a pneumothorax. If hypoxia is confirmed, it is prudent to increase PEEP and/or FiO2. In addition, it is important to disconnect the patient from the ventilator and manually ventilate them with a bag valve mask and 100% oxygen.

**High Inspiratory Pressures**

When there is an alarm for high inspiratory pressures, it is advisable to check the circuit for any obstructions and ensure adequate sedation and ventilator synchrony. Moreover, if the high peak pressure alarms are triggered with normal plateau pressure, then underlying obstructive ventilatory defects should be suspected and treated using bronchodilators.

**Special Considerations**

**Breath Stacking**

Breath stacking occurs when the patient does not fully exhale; thus, with each successive breath, the volume of air in the lungs (and, as a result, airway pressure) rises. This is dangerous and puts this patient at risk for barotrauma. This can occur when patients have severe obstructive disease, particularly asthma. Some ventilators will either display the volume waveform or the inspired and exhaled volumes. The volume of exhaled air should equal the inspired volume, or the waveform should return to zero. If breath stacking occurs, briefly disconnect the ventilator circuit, push on the patient's chest to exhale all the excess volume, and reconnect the ventilator. Reduce the respiratory rate to allow more time between breaths for exhalation, and if the machine has the capability, decrease the inspiratory time of the breath.

**Metabolic Acidosis**

Patients with severe metabolic acidosis, such as diabetic ketoacidosis, rely on respiratory compensation to mitigate the acidemia and thus will require significant minute ventilation above normal. While you should avoid intubating these patients at all costs, if it is unavoidable, you must be extremely careful with setting the respiratory rate. Try to match what rate the patient was breathing before intubation. Note the initial end-tidal immediately after intubation and try to maintain that number or lower. Failure to do so will cause worsening acidemia and further decompensation of the patient's condition.

****Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)****

ARDS is a complicated condition of severe lung injury and inflammation. Ventilation strategies for these patients should be aimed at minimizing lung injury. Tidal volumes in these patients should be reduced to 6 ml/kg of ideal body weight or lower with higher PEEP and FiO2. PEEP usually should be increased to higher than 10 cm H2O in prehospital settings without expert consultation. In these patients, lower SpO2 values of 88 % to 90% can be tolerated with permissive hypercapnia due to low tidal volumes. ARDS is not easily identifiable in prehospital settings as there are specific diagnostic criteria; however, it can be suspected when there are markedly high oxygen requirements.
