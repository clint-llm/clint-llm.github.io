The island pedicle flap should be designed before making any incisions. The flap should have a tapered tail to allow closure of the secondary defect after advancing the flap into the primary defect. The flap should also include tissue adequate to fill the primary defect, at least 3 times the diameter of the primary lesion. An inadequately sized flap requires more extensive undermining of tissue or the use of a skin graft for defect closure.

Island pedicle flaps can be modified to promote healing and cosmesis. The long legs of the triangular island pedicle can be modified to match the curvilinear lines of the face instead of keeping the borders of the flap strictly linear.

When incising the island pedicle flap, use strict vertical to outward beveled incisions to free the underlying vascular stalk from adjacent subcutaneous tissue and muscle. To advance the island pedicle, undermine just above the superficial fascia around the peripheral edges of the flap and the primary defect; the inadequate undermining of tissue limits the mobility of the flap.

Once the flap is adequately mobile, the first key suture of the repair may be placed in the central portion of the advancing pedicle and into the corresponding point of the primary defect. Following the key stitch, dermal and epidermal sutures may be placed to close first the primary and then the secondary defects.
