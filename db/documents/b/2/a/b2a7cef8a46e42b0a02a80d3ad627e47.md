The pre-operative nurse will monitor the patient during placement of the ESP block. ContinuousÂ ECG, pulse oximetry, and blood pressure (at 5-minute intervals at least) require monitoring during the entire peri-procedural period. If using sedation for the procedure, the pre-operative nurse can also help to monitor the patient's level of consciousness and breathing. Post-operatively, the post-anesthesia care unit nurse will again monitor the patient with continuous ECG, pulse oximetry, and blood pressure (at 5-minute intervals at least), but will also monitor the patient's post-operative pain scores. If pain is severe, the anesthesiologist can bolus the catheter (if the catheter placed) with the local anesthetic solution as needed, or the decision can be made to give intravenous medications to manage post-operative pain.
