The oral cavity provides a unique ecological site that harbors a dynamic microbiota. Candida, Aspergillus, and Rhizopus are commensal oral fungi. However, they may become pathological and cause opportunistic infections under certain conditions. The incidence of fungal infections has been on the rise in recent years, especially in COVID 19 patients, due to several factors such as immunodeficiency, hyperglycemia caused by diabetes mellitus, prolonged hospitalizations, and prolonged use of steroids, and hematopoietic malignancies.

The diagnosis of oral fungal infections is mainly based on clinical presentation, cytology, and histopathology of the lesional tissue. The methods to detect fungal organisms have also evolved from culture to rapid molecular tests like polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Prompt evaluation of oral lesions is essential to establish the diagnosis, initiate therapy, and monitor clinical progress.

This article focuses on the epidemiology, patient history, risk factors, oral findings, diagnosis, and treatment of the oral cavity fungal infections, including oral candidiasis, aspergillosis, mucormycosis/zygomycosis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, cryptococcosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, and geotrichosis.
