Approximately one-third of patients in the United States who received hyperbaric oxygen therapy is being treated for late effects of radiation therapy (LERT). Major advances have been made in the past 50 years in the treatment and prognosis of many cancers. Many cancers which were once considered to be universally terminal, are now routinely survivable. Unfortunately, ionizing radiation when used to treat cancer is a double-edged sword. It is highly effective at killing the malignancy and curing cancer. However, it is indiscriminate, and despite best efforts and intentions, there is no way to protect nonmalignant tissues from being irreparably damaged by the ionizing radiation. Thus the patient is fortunate to be cured of cancer, but may be faced with delayed radiation injury months or even decades after the treatment is complete.

Many times, delayed radiation injuries are precipitated by an additional tissue insult such as trauma or surgery.
