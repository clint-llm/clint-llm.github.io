The celiac trunk, also known as the celiac artery, is a short vessel that arises from the aorta and passes below the median arcuate ligament, just as the aorta enters the abdomen at the level of the T12 vertebra. The celiac trunk measures about 1.5cm to 2cm in length.

- Distal esophagus to the second part of the duodenum

- Liver

- Pancreas

- Gallbladder

- Spleen

The celiac trunk classically divides into three major branches:

- Left gastric artery: This artery is responsible for the blood supply to theÂ lesser curvature of the stomach as well as the lower esophagus. It anastomoses with the right gastric artery.

- Common hepatic artery: This artery, through its many branches, supplies the liver, pylorus of the stomach, gallbladder, duodenum, and the pancreas.

- Splenic artery: This artery offers multiple branches to the upper and middle parts of the greater curvature and fundus of the stomach as well as to the pancreas. This artery ends its course by providing oxygenated blood to the spleen.
