Zolpidem is only contraindicated in patients with aÂ known allergy to the drug or inactive ingredients in the formula. Also, before administering zolpidem, other causes of sleep deprivation must be evaluated, for example, any presenting physical or psychiatric histories.

Caution should be used in patients taking drugs that affect drug metabolism via cytochrome P450. Consider giving a lower zolpidem dosage as patients have shown to enhance sedative effects. In addition, patients taking imipramine and chlorpromazine should avoid using zolpidem. When combined, these medications cause decreased alertness and psychomotor performance.

Worsening of depression and/or suicidal ideation may occur with zolpidem therapy. Therefore, clinicians should prescribe the least amount of tablets possible to avoid intentional zolpidem overdose. Consider this risk of respiratory depression before prescribing zolpidem in patients with compromised respiratory function. Withdrawal symptoms may occur if the zolpidem dose is tapered off rapidly or discontinued. Therefore it is recommended to taper off slowly to avoid unnecessary withdrawal and adverse reactions in chronic zolpidem users.
