Radiofrequency ablation is widely used to manage pain and several other disorders. It should be understood that this technique is just one method for pain control, and it has its share of complications. It is not a substitute for other means of pain control but a complementary therapy. An interprofessional approach with input from nurses and pharmacists may help select patients most likely to benefit from this therapy. Once selected, the procedure requires interprofessional cooperation to be successful. This usually involves the surgeon, an ultrasound technician, and a nurse. The ultrasound technician will assist in placement and confirmation of placement. The nurse will assist in monitoring vital signs and reducing the patient's anxiety as they are usually awake during the procedure. The nurse should be prepared with any medications commonly used. The interprofessional team must be aware of the expected complications and be prepared to deal with them. Further, members of the team must report concerns immediately to the operative surgeon performing the procedure. Post-treatment, nursing monitoring will continue. In addition, patient education is often necessary with concerns of the patient the nurse cannot address reported to the surgeon for further discussion. The best outcomes with radiofrequency ablation occur with an interprofessional team approach. [Level 5]
