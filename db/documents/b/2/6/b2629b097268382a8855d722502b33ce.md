The thyroid hormone is synthesized from iodine. Iodine is present in soil and is ingested in food that absorbs iodine from the soil. In mountainous areas and rainy environments, iodine is washed from the land, and the soil may become deficient in iodine. This explains why inhabitants of these areas are at greater risk for developing goiter due to low dietary iodine they consume. There is evidence that giving iodine as a supplement decreases the incidence of goiter in these people. Seminal studies confirmed that supplementation of iodine in table salts decreases the risk of endemic goiter from 20% to 5% in the adolescent girls of Ohio. In the United States, sporadic goiter is the most common cause of nontoxic goiter where it's incidence is about 5%.

The prevalence of palpable nodules is about 5% to 6% in those who are 60 years old. However, the incidence of nonpalpable nodules found at autopsy is about 50% of those who are 60 years old. Internationally, 2.2 billion people have some form of iodine deficiency, most of them being people of iodine-deficient areas. The prevalence of goiter is corollated with the severity of iodine deficiency. The absence of iodine deficiency is associated according to studies with 5% prevalence of goiter. When there is a mild deficiency of iodine, the incidence of goiters is 5% to 20%. In the case of moderate deficiency, the prevalence is 20% to 30%. In areas with severe deficiency, the incidence rises to more than 30%. Goiter is 1.2 to 4.3 times more common in female than in male individuals. A low socioeconomic status is a risk factor for goiter. This may be related to decreasing iodine intake. Sporadic goiter due to dysmorphogenesis and endemic goiter mostly occur during childhood, and the thyroid gland increases more in size with age. There is no racial relation to the prevalence of goiter.
