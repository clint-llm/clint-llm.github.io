OTFC is a solid formulation of lipophilic fentanyl citrate. Its mechanism of action involves acting as an agonist on mu-receptors in the brain and spinal cord, resulting in therapeutic outcomes of sedation and analgesia. As the lozenges of OTFC dissolve, 25% of the total fentanyl is absorbed across the oral mucosa, while the remainder 75% is swallowed. One-third of the 75% escapes the first-pass metabolism and is slowly absorbed in the intestines. OTFC's rapid absorption across the oral mucosa coupled with its fast diffusion across the blood-brain barrier establishes its rapid onset. Delivery of fentanyl as OTFC via the oral mucosa is advantageous due to the nature of the oral mucosa. The oral mucosa is highly permeable and vascular, allowing lipophilic compounds to diffuse across the mucosa into the bloodstream easily. The oral mucosa has a uniform temperature and increased surface area, accentuating the delivery of OTFC.
