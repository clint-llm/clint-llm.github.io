Hemophilia B is an inherited disease, mainly caused by the deficiency of factor IX. It mostly affects males, but carrier females may show some signs of bleeding. It has an X-linked recessive inherited mode of inheritance, but some acquired form has also been reported due to the development of autoantibodies toward factor IX. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the evaluation and treatment of hemophilia B.
