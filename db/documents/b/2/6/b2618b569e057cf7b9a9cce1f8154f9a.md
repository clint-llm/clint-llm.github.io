In the development and maintenance of the structure of the aortic arch, many molecules take over. For example, in an adult structure, the passage of blood stimulates endothelial cells to express the following:

- Vascular endothelial growth factor-C or VEGF-C

- Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 or PECAM-1

- Vascular endothelial cell cadherin or VE-cadherin

- Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 or VEGFR2

- Phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase or PI3K

- Platelet-derived growth factor or PDGF

- Transforming growth factor-beta or TGF beta

- Endothelial nitric oxide synthase or eNOS

During development, many of these molecules play fundamental roles in recruiting cells that will build the aortic arch, such as platelet-derived growth factor B or PDGFB. The latter will activate the receptors on smooth muscle cells and pericytes. These cells will, in turn, produce Ang-1 (angiopoietin-1), which will serve to bind these different cells togetherÂ by activating the endothelial receptor Tie2.
