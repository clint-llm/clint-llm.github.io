Single doses up to 400 mg and multiple doses up to 80 mg per day for three months are well-tolerated and did not result in any significant adverse reactions in the clinical studies. Until further experience is obtained, no specific treatment for an overdose with finasteride can be recommended. There are no reports of overdoses of finasteride, resulting in clinically significant toxicity. However, overdoses could occur as an extension of previously reported adverse drug effects, including orthostatic hypotension.
