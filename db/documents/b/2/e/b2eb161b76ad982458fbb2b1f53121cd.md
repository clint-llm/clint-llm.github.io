The pathophysiology of PVOD is multifactorial and has not been clearly established. It is hypothesized that PVOD may be an aberrant response to endothelial injury leading to widespread fibrosis of the pulmonary venous system.

Two particular genes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease; BMPR2 and EIF2AK4.

BMPR2, or bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II, has long been known as the implicated gene in familial PAH. It has been implicated in at least half of all familial PAH cases and possibly 25% of nonfamilial PAH cases. Mutations in BMPR2 have also been shown in some patients with PVOD.

EIF2AK4, or eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha kinase, has been implicated as the major gene in the pathogenesis of PVOD. Up to 25% of sporadic cases of PVOD have been shown to have mutations in this gene.

The function of this gene is to encode serine-threonine kinase, which induces changes in gene expression in response to amino acid deprivation.
