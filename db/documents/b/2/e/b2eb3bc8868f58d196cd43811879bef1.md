Ventral cord syndrome (VCS), also referred to as anterior cord syndrome or anterior spinal artery syndrome, is caused by any condition that leads to infarction of the ventral two-thirds of the spinal cord. Estimates for the incidence and prevalence of ventral cord syndrome vary, yet it is the most common type of spinal cord infarction. PatientsÂ with ventral cord syndrome present with impairments of both pain and temperature sensation while maintaining vibration and proprioception sensation. Motor deficits are noticeable both at and below the level of injury. Magnetic resonance imaging can provide a visual assessment of the degree of spinal cord ischemia. Current treatment for ventral cord syndrome is primarily supportive and follows guidelines for cerebral ischemia, atherosclerotic vascular disease, and acute traumatic spinal cord injury.
