The development of dermatofibromas remains a controversial topic. Patients who are diagnosed with dermatofibroma often endorse a history of local trauma. This history argues for a reactive process. However, this history of local trauma is not reliably reported and only found in about a fifth of cases. More often, there is no inciting event or trauma, and the dermatofibroma develops spontaneously. Interestingly, although they will develop spontaneously, spontaneous regression is not commonly observed, which may support an argument against a primarily reactive process in favor of a clonal or neoplastic model.

Some studies have identified clonal markers in dermatofibromas cells by analyzing X-chromosome inactivation, which argues for a monoclonal pattern, and possibly favors a neoplastic process as the origin of development for dermatofibromas. Others propose that dermatofibromas are heterogeneously derived. They represent both a reactive and neoplastic process within the same lesion, wherein the histiocytoid component may be neoplastic, and the fibrous portion may result from reactive fibroblastic proliferation.

Most dermatofibromas occur as solitary lesions, only clinically presenting as multiple simultaneous lesions in 10% of cases. Interestingly, although there are multiple histologic benign variants of dermatofibromas, in patients with two or more simultaneously occurring dermatofibromas, the lesions tend to appear histopathologically similar.
