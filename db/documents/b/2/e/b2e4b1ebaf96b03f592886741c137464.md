In light microscopy, the sample must first be supravitally stained, usually using new methylene blue or brilliant cresyl blue, which binds to the RNA. The stain allows cells to be recognized by the blue intracytoplasmic precipitate, ranging from the appearance of granules to a network of reticular material.

Measuring reticulocyte count with light microscopy is not commonly used anymore. It has low reproducibility and can be unreliable, with a coefficient of variation ranging from 25 to 48%.
