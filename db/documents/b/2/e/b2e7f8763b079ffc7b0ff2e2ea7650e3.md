Similarly to other transition metals, cobalt toxicity affects multiple organ systems. In acute toxicity, excessive cobalt exposure has endocrine, cardiovascular, metabolic, central and peripheral nervous system, gastrointestinal and hematologic effects. Chronic inhalational exposures result in diseases of the pulmonary system, including occupational asthma and hard metal disease.

Divalent cobalt (Co2+ or cobaltous) is very similar to common intracellular cations, such as Ca2+ and Mg2+. Cobalt inhibits various enzymes responsible for protein synthesis and RNA synthesis as α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, α-lipoic acid, and dihydrolipoic acid.

CoCl2 inhibits tyrosine iodinase, which leads to decreased thyroid hormone (T3, T4) and hypothyroidism.

There are multiple theories on the promotion of erythropoiesis by CoCl2.

Lastly, cobalt can participate in redox cycling, leading to an excess of free radicals leading to tissue damage. This is the likely mechanism resulting in pulmonary toxicity.

Dermatitis from cobalt is likely a type IV hypersensitivity reaction similar to nickel.
