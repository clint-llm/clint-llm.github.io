In most cases, hypertensive encephalopathy can be reversed with a prompt but conservative lowering of the blood pressure. The prognosis for this condition can vary depending on whether other comorbidities are present.

These patients are at risk for other hypertensive crises if they become noncompliant with their medications in the future.
