Complications include:

- tendon rupture

- reduction in both active and passive ROM

- adhesions

- extension lag (especially in MCPJ)

- loss of flexion and reduced ability to grip

- finger deformities

- Swan neck deformity: This is usually due to prolonged flexion of the DIPJ and dorsal subluxation of lateral bands with consequent PIPJ hyperextension.

- Boutonniere deformity which is characterized by DIPJ hyperextension and PIPJ flexion. It is usually due to central slip injury and volar subluxation of the lateral bands.

The adhesions are the most common of the above and can result in a loss of flexion.

Extensor tendon laceration outcomes can be measured using Miller's criteria which divide them in to excellent (extension lag, 0 flexion loss), good (less than 10 extension lag, less than 20 flexion loss), fair (11 to 45 extension lag, 21 to 45 flexion loss) and poor (greater than 45 extension lag, greater than 45 flexion loss). Notably, all of the above is measured purely on the extent of complications.
