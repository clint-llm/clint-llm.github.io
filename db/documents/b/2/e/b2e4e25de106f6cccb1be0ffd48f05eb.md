Viral hepatitis is the most common cause of jaundice in pregnancy. Viral hepatitis in pregnancy is associated with significant gestational and fetal complications. Adhering to screening guidelines is key to reduce mother-to-child transmission of viral hepatitis. An interprofessional team including obstetric care provides, internists, gastroenterologists, nurses, midwives, and pediatricians is important in providing a holistic and integrated approach to pregnant women with exposure or infected with viral hepatitis to achieve the best possible outcomes.
