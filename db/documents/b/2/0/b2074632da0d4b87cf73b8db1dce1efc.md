The axillary nerve begins at the ventral rami of C5 and C6 spinal nerves and continues as the smaller branch of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus. It innervates the deltoid and teres minor muscles via the anterior and posterior branches, respectively. Innervation of the deltoid muscles allows for the abduction of the arm after action from the supraspinatus has already reached 15 degrees. Teres minor is responsible for lateral rotation and also participates in maintaining the stability of the glenohumeral joint. The posterior branch of the axillary nerve also gives rise to the upper lateral cutaneous nerve after innervating teres minor. The upper lateral cutaneous nerve provides sensation to the inferior lateral deltoid region, at an area called the regimental badge area.
