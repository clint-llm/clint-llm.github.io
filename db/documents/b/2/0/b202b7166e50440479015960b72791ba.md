Nurses are especially crucial in the care of patients with breast cancer undergoing surgery.  Many cancer care centers employ nurse navigators or specialized oncology nurses who can guide patients through each step of treatment and answer any questions that the patient or family may have.  Additionally, nurses are especially crucial in patients who have drains placed, as proper drain care is essential to prevent infection and other complications from occurring.  This care involves teaching the patient about their drains for them to properly care for themselves after discharge.

Most patients do not require much pain medication following breast cancer surgery.  However, if discharged with medication, especially opioids, the nurse needs to review these medications with the patient for safety purposes.
