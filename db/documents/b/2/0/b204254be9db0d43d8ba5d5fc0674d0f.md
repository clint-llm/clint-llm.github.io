The causes of uncal herniation include any situations which will cause a significant rise in intracranial pressure. Any expanding space-occupying lesion within the cranium can subject a patient to be at risk for uncal herniation. Uncal herniation can occur following severe head trauma which may lead to a rapidly expanding subdural or epidural hematoma. In uncal herniation, there is usually some supratentorial driving force occurring with a raised intracranial pressure (ICP) causing the uncus to slide over the supratentorial notch.
