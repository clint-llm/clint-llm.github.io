Duodenal compression is usually due to the loss of the intervening mesenteric fat pad between the aorta and SMA, which in turn, results in a narrower angle between the vessels. The fat pad cushion functions to hold the SMA off the spine and protect it from duodenal compression. A normal aortomesenteric angle is 38 to 65 degrees; however, decreasing the angle less than 25 degrees will decrease the distance to less than 10 mm and cause compression to the third part of the duodenum. Decreases in the aortomesenteric angle can be either congenital or acquired. SMA syndrome is associated with significant weight loss including situations of hypermetabolism (trauma and burns) dietary conditions (anorexia nervosa and malabsorptive diseases) and cachexia causing conditions (AIDS, cancer, paraplegia). Other risk factors include surgical correction of scoliosis, congenitally short or hypertrophic ligament of Treitz, peritoneal adhesions, duodenal malrotation, Ladd's bands, abdominal aortic aneurysm, lumbar hyperlordosis, and mesenteric root neoplasm.
