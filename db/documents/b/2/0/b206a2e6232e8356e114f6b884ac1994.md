Drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DIL) is an autoimmune phenomenon where the patient develops symptoms similar to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) after exposure to certain drugs. While DIL tends to be less severe than SLE, the diagnosis can be challenging. This activity reviews the pathophysiology and management of drug-induced lupus and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the drugs that can induce lupus-like features.
- Describe the laboratory features of drug-induced lupus.
- Summarize the treatment options for drug-induced lupus.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by drug-induced lupus.
