Postoperative care following surgery for posterior shoulder instability involves immobilization in a shoulder brace with the arm in a position that decreases stress on the posterior soft tissues of the shoulder. Recommendations are to immobilize the shoulder in about 30 degrees of abduction and neutral rotation with care to avoid internal rotation, which puts stress on the posterior soft tissue structures.

Active range of motion is started around 6 weeks postoperatively with strengthening programs beginning 2 to 3 months after surgery. A sport-specific rehabilitation program may be started once the patient achieves 80% strength of the contralateral shoulder, which is typically seen 6 months postoperatively.
