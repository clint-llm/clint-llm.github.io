An insulinoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis and ruled out. Postprandial hypoglycemia has been seen in individuals with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); obesity is a risk factor for developing NAFLD.

Exogenous insulin or secretagogue use may also induce hypoglycemia; C peptide levels (low in case of exogenous insulin, normal or elevated with secretagogues) and medication screening may help investigate these causes.

In the appropriate context, the differential diagnosis may also consider hormone deficiencies, autoimmune conditions, or non-islet cell tumors.
