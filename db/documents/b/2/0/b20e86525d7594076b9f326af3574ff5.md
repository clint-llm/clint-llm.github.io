Causes of PDPH include dural puncture during a lumbar puncture (LP), diagnostic myelography, a subarachnoid (spinal) block, or following unintentional dural puncture from epidural anesthesia or injection for pain. Similar low-CSF pressure (intracranial hypotension) symptoms can also occur spontaneouslyÂ or following craniotomy, placement of ventricular shunts, brain/spinal trauma, or spinal surgery. Risk factors for PDPH include dehydration, systemic illness, prior headaches, use of a large caliber or cutting needle, female gender, pregnancy, younger age, the use of a cutting or larger bore spinal needle, or inexperienced proceduralist.
