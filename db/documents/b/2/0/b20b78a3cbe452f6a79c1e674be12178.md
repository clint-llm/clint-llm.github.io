Heart sounds are created from blood flowing through the heart chambers as the cardiac valves open and close during the cardiac cycle. Vibrations of these structures from the blood flow create audible sounds â€” the more turbulent the blood flow, the more vibrations that get created. The same variables determine the turbulence of blood flow as all fluids. These are fluid viscosity, density, velocity, and the diameter of the column through which the fluid is traveling. Auscultation of the heart sounds with a stethoscope is a cornerstone of physical medical exams and a valuable first-line tool to evaluate a patient. Some sounds are very characteristic of significant pathological lesions that have major pathophysiological consequences, and these first present on auscultation. These type of lesions can be heard in systole, diastole, or continuously through the cardiac cycle.
