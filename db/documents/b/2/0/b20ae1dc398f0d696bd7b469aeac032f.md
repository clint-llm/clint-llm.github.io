The muscles of the tongue can be split into intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. The intrinsic muscles of the tongue originate and insert within the tongue. The 4 intrinsic muscles are the superior longitudinal, inferior longitudinal, transverse, and vertical muscles of the tongue, and they all act to change the shape and size of the tongue.

The extrinsic muscles of the tongue all originate outside of the tongue and then insert onto the tongue. There are 4 extrinsic muscles, genioglossus, hyoglossus, stylogossus, and palatoglossus. The hyoglossus muscle depresses and retracts the tongue. The styloglossus also acts to retract the tongue as well as elevating the sides of the tongue. The genioglossus muscle mainly acts to protrude the tongue but can also depress the tongue. The palatoglossus muscle elevates the posterior part of the tongue and is the only extrinsic muscle innervated by the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) instead of the hypoglossal nerve. It is also important to note the chondroglossus, which acts to depress the lingual root.Â The chondroglossus is most commonly described as part of the hyoglossus muscle; however, some argue that it is an extrinsic tongue muscle in its own regard as it differs from the hyoglossus in its origin and course.
