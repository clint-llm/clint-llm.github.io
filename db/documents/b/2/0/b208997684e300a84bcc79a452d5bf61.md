Arteries:

Conventional textbook nomenclature describes a prominent artery in the posterior neck triangle as the transverse cervical artery, a branch of the thyrocervical trunk branching from the subclavian artery. Multiple cadaveric dissection studies have sought to eliminate the use of this term in favor of more specific language to describe more correctly the arteries present in the posterior neck triangle. The following variants are common in frequency and arise from either the subclavian artery of the thyrocervical trunk:

- Cervico-scapular trunk: Gives rise to the superficial scapular and dorsal scapular arteries.

- Cervico-dorsal trunk: Gives rise to the cervical and dorsal scapular arteries

- Cervico-dorso-scapular trunk: Gives rise to the superficial cervical, dorsal scapular, and suprascapular arteries.

- Dorso-scapular trunk: Gives rise to the suprascapular and dorsal scapular arteries.

In addition to the above-listed trunks, many anatomic variants of arteries that arise directly from either the subclavian artery or thyrocervical trunk exist in varying frequency.

Nerves:

Physiologic variants of the spinal accessory nerve also exist within the posterior neck triangle. These include variants of the nerve that communicate with the cervical plexus, although effects on the motor function of innervated muscles are largely unknown. Another variant of the spinal accessory nerve passes under the anterior border of the trapezius muscle as opposed to the posterior border.
