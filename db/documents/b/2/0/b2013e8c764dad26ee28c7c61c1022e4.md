Miliaria frequently affects neonates and individualsÂ suffering from increased sweating as well as those living in hot and humid climates. Although miliaria is seen in both genders and all races, each type affects a slightly different population. Miliaria crystallina, or sudamina, commonly affects neonates with the greatest incidence at 2 weeks of age or less. It affects between 4.5% to 9% of neonates.
