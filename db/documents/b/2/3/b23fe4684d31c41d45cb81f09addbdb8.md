The currently recommended treatment strategy for cystine stone formers is based on a progressive approach starting with the most conservative measures. Initial therapy involves dietary measures, hydration, and alkalinization. In refractory cases, treatment is extended to thiol-based medications. Existing cystine stones are treated similarly to other urinary calculi of similar size, with consideration being given to the high stone recurrence rate and relative resistance to extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) fragmentation.

**Medical Management**

**Dietary measures**alone for cystinuria have shown only relatively minor clinical benefits. Nevertheless, a "bad" diet can certainly increase stone risk. Patients on various supplements high in cystine and methionine have shown rapid growth and production of cystine stones.

**Hydration**is usually the first step in medical management, along with dietary measures. Increasing fluid intake sufficiently to reliably generate 3,000 ml or more of urine per day is recommended. The goal is to dilute the urine sufficiently to get the urinary cystine content to the recommended concentration level of 250 mg/L or less; this frequently requires having the patient wake up in the middle of the night to void and drink extra water. Drinking 240 ml of water every hour during the day and 480 ml before bed and at least once overnight is a standard strategy for maximizing oral hydration therapy and urinary volume. Hydration can be monitored by following the specific gravity, which should always be 1.010 or less. Since some cystinuric patients can generate up to 1,400 mg of cystine per day, hydration alone may not be sufficient, but it is always the initial step in management along with dietary measures. Up to one-third of cystine stone patients can manage their stone recurrences with fluid management alone. Optimal hydration will depend on the patient's individual cystine excretion.

Clinicians should be aware that maintenance of high fluid intake is often difficult for patients, especially at the much higher than usual levels required of cystine stone formers. Maintenance of fluid is so critical that patients are typically advised to drink extra water before bedtime and each time they awaken. In refractory cases, particularly in the pediatric age group, using a nocturnal nasogastric or gastrostomy tube to provide additional overnight fluid can be considered.

Acceptable levels of urinary cystine are 250 mg/L or less at a urinary pH of 7 or more. Some experts have recommended cystine concentrations of 150 mg/L, and possibly even lower at 90 mg/L, as "optimal."

**Urinary alkalinization**can not only prevent cystine precipitation and stone formation but may also dissolve existing calculi. For prophylaxis, the urinary pH should be targeted at 7.5, but a urinary pH higher than 7.5 needs to be maintained for stone dissolution. However, at this high pH level (above 7.5), calcium phosphate stones can precipitate. In such cases, hypercalciuria needs to be controlled tightly with diet and thiazide therapy, while hydration should be optimized. Cystine solubility increases dramatically above a urine pH of 7 at body temperature. At a pH of 7.5, cystine solubility is 500 mg/L, almost double its solubility at a pH of 7.

Mineral water and citrus juices can help increase pH levels, but potassium citrate supplementation is the mainstay of urinary alkalinization therapy. The usual daily potassium citrate dosage in cystinuria is 60 to 90 mEq total in 3 or 4 divided doses and then titrated as needed to optimize the pH at 7.5. A large bedtime dose is suggested as well. Patients should be warned that they may see tablets in their stool and that this is normal. (The tablets are wax-based and designed to pass through the gastrointestinal tract and be expelled in the stool.) Serum potassium should be checked periodically in patients on high dosages of potassium citrate and those with renal failure to detect hyperkalemia early.

Cystinuria patients on alkalinization therapy often need very high doses of urinary antacids. Unfortunately, potassium citrate tablets are notorious for poor long-term patient compliance as they require frequent daily dosing, tend to have significant gastrointestinal side effects, and can be physically difficult to swallow for many patients due to their large size. Liquid potassium citrate formulations can be quite concentrated and offer a relatively large urinary alkalinization effect, but they also often taste exceedingly bad or are unavailable.

A low potassium OTC urinary alkalinizer is available online that overcomes the problems with most urinary antacid products. Each 10 mEq citrate packet contains 5 mEq of potassium citrate, 2.5 mEq of sodium bicarbonate, and 2.5 mEq of magnesium citrate. (This is equivalent in urinary alkalinizing ability to a standard 10 mEq potassium citrate tablet but is better absorbed, has fewer intestinal side effects, is less expensive, and contains half the potassium content.) It has been formulated to have no taste when mixed with water, juice, or other beverages, requires no prescription, and the cost is nominal.

**Sodium bicarbonate**can also be used to help with pH issues, especially in patients at risk for hyperkalemia with potassium citrate therapy, but it tends to have a relatively short-term alkalinizing effect, and the extra sodium intake may actually increase urinary cystine excretion. High animal protein diets are also discouraged in cystinuric patients for the same reason.

**Acetazolamide**is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that increases urinary bicarbonate excretion and raises urinary pH levels. While not a first-line therapy (it can cause hypocitraturia and metabolic acidosis), it may occasionally help maintain high urinary pH levels in addition to the other therapies mentioned. Acetazolamide can be particularly useful in maintaining a high nighttime urinary pH without the need for multiple awakenings or additional overnight alkalinization dosing.

**Alpha-lipoic acid**, a nutritional supplement, has been shown to increase cystine solubility in urine without affecting concentration or pH in both animal models and humans. Studies are very limited, but anecdotal case reports are quite promising.

The goal of all the above therapies is to achieve a cystine concentration of no more than 250 mg/L at a urinary pH of at least 7. To reduce the urinary cystine concentration, additional fluid intake will be necessary. If the pH is not at least 7, additional alkalinizing therapy should be utilized. The optimal urine pH in cystine stone-forming patients is 7.5. When these target goals cannot be achieved, or such conservative measures are insufficient to control stone formation after a three-month trial period, a thiol-based drug regimen will be the next step in treatment for active cystine stone formers.

**Thiol-Based Agents**

Cystine is composed of two cysteine molecules bound together by a disulfide bond. Thiol-based drugs have sulfhydryl groups that can reduce this disulfide bond, producing a mixed cysteine disulfide compound that is far more soluble than the original cystine molecule. As a general guide, most patients with a 24-hour urinary cystine excretion of 500 mg or more are likely to need a thiol medication in addition to hydration therapy and urinary alkalinization.

Thiol-based treatment is thought to have the extra benefit of possibly making cystine stones more amenable to ESWL treatment. This may occur because of the mixing of calcium phosphate along with the cystine creating a more fragile stone that is easier to fragment with ESWL therapy. All patients on thiol-based drug therapy should have routine blood and platelet counts, serum albumin, liver function tests, and 24-hour urine tests for cystine, "cystine capacity" (if available), and protein.

**Penicillamine,**a penicillin derivative,****was the first thiol drug used for cystinuria. Penicillamine-cysteine disulfide is 50 times more soluble in urine than cystine. Each 250 mg penicillamine tablet can reduce urinary cystine levels by about 75 mg to 100 mg per day. The problem with penicillamine is that there is a high incidence of side effects, including fever, rash, loss of taste, arthritis, leukopenia, aplastic anemia, gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances, renal membranous nephropathy with proteinuria, and pyridoxine (vitamin B-6) deficiency. The incidence of significant side effects is about 50% but could be as high as 84%, limiting long-term compliance. Almost 70% of patients discontinued the drug due to these adverse side effects in one study. Penicillamine can suppress the immune system, which will increase the risk of infection, but these patients need close monitoring for renal function, heart effects, liver toxicity, abnormal blood counts, and neurological defects.

**Tiopronin (Thiola, alpha-mercaptopropionylglycine, or alpha-MPG)**is a second-generation thiol drug that works similarly to penicillamine but is roughly 30% more effective (higher dissolution rate) with significantly fewer side effects (approximately 20% to 50%). It received approval for use in the United States in 1988, so there is ample experience with the medication. The typical dose is 300 mg three times per day but can be upwardly adjusted to 1,500 mg/day. (For pediatric patients, the recommended dosage is 20 to 40 mg/kg/day, split into two doses.)

**Captopril**is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor normally used for hypertension, but it is also a unique thiol-based drug that can form captopril-cysteine mixed disulfides that are highly soluble in cystinuric patients. While safe with few side effects, captopril's clinical effectiveness in cystinuric stone-forming patients is uncertain as various studies have produced conflicting results. It may be most useful in patients who have chronic renal failure, hypertension, and proteinuria.  It is not recommended as monotherapy for cystinuria. Pending a more rigorous, definitive study, it should be considered a reasonable treatment option only in cystinuric patients where other thiols are overly toxic or unavailable.

**Bucillamine**is a third-generation, thiol-based drug that is currently available only in Japan and South Korea. Even there, it is only approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis. As a di-thiol compound, it would theoretically be more effective than tiopronin and better tolerated since lower dosages of the drug would be needed. Experience in Asia over 30 years has demonstrated a low toxicity profile. Bucillamine has been shown to be more effective than tiopronin in at least one small cystinuria study.

**Surgical Management**

The surgical treatment of cystine stones is similar to that of other stones except that cystine is notoriously resistant to extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) unless the stones are less than 1 cm in size. Cystine stones appear to be more fragile and more amenable to ESWL in patients taking oral thiol medications.

Total removal of all cystine stones and fragments has demonstrated reduced recurrence rates and better preservation of renal function. This is particularly important in pediatric cystinuric patients, where prophylactic measures should be emphasized to avoid new stone production and the need for additional future surgeries. When carefully and appropriately performed, stone surgery does not generally cause any measurable decrease in overall renal function.

When ureteral double J stents are used, their time in place should be minimized as complete stent encrustation, and blockage in cystinuria patients can occur in less than two weeks.

The spontaneous passage rate is similar for all stone types, although cystinuria patients may be able to pass larger stones due to their greater average number of prior episodes. A maximum of 30 days is recommended for conservative management and spontaneous passage, after which surgical intervention should be performed to prevent further symptoms and complications.

- Stone diameter <5 mm  = 89% stone passage rate

- Stone diameter 5-7 mm = 49% stone passage rate

- Stone diameter >7 mm  = 29% stone passage rate

**Patient Monitoring**

Urinary cystine is found in both soluble (free) and insoluble (bound) forms.

Regular renal ultrasounds are recommended in all active cystine stone-forming patients every 6 to 12 months.

Routine 24-hour urine tests for total cystine excretion, supersaturation, and urinary cystine capacity are recommended for monitoring and optimizing therapy. Regular 24-hour urine testing for protein is recommended for patients on thiol medications and those with renal failure.

There appears to be a correlation between new cystine stone production and the presence of crystalluria on urinalysis.

It is well established that increased patient compliance with therapy, particularly alkalinizing agents, is associated with fewer urological surgery procedures.
