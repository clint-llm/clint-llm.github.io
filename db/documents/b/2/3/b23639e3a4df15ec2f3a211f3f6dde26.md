The term "medical error" encompasses a diverse group of events that vary in magnitude and potential to harm the patient. According to the 2019 World Health Organization (WHO) Patient Safety Factsheet, adverse events due to unsafe patient care are among the top ten causes of death and disability worldwide. However, it is essential to understand that healthcare delivery involves multiple variables in a dynamic environment, with many critical decisions made in a short amount of time. As such, the healthcare system cannot implement rigid protocols used by other high-risk industries, such as aviation. Reducing medical errors requires a multifaceted approach at various levels of healthcare. In the event of a sentinel occurrence or adverse patient outcomes, a thorough evaluation is warranted to prevent such events in the future. Root cause analyses provide a method of evaluation for these situations so that a system-based intervention can be implemented rather than blaming individual providers. This activity reviews the root cause analysis process in medical error prevention. It highlights the interprofessional team's role in performing this analysis in order to prevent medical errors and improve clinical outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Demonstrate effective root cause analysis of a sentinel event and implement strategies for its prevention. 
- Apply root cause analysis reporting standards in accordance with the Joint Commission requirements.
- Identify the indications for reporting sentinel events to the Joint Commission and the steps that should be taken following the occurrence of such incidents.
- Collaborate within an interprofessional team to prevent the most common types of clinical errors and improve clinical outcomes.
