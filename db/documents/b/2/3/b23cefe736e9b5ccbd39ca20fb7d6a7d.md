Gastric ultrasound is performed to evaluate stomach contents prior to induction of anesthesia. This information allows practitioners to proactively manage the risk of aspiration of gastric contents. Information obtained from gastric ultrasound enables anesthesia providers to determine the optimal timing of procedures, type of anesthesia, and airway management technique. This activity reviews gastric ultrasound and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating gastric contents for patients undergoing procedures requiring sedation or anesthesia.

**Objectives:**
- Review the anatomy of the stomach and adjacent organs.
- Describe the necessary equipment and the proper technique to perform a gastric ultrasound exam.
- Describe the imaging findings associated with an empty stomach, liquid in the stomach, and solid food in the stomach.
- Summarize the findings of gastric ultrasound and how they can be used to determine the risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents.
