The upper limb can be divided anatomically into the shoulder, arm, elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand, respectively. The hand muscles can also divide into two compartments separated by two fascial septa, one on the medial side and the other on the lateral side. Muscles of the anterior fascial compartment contain biceps brachii, coracobrachialis, brachialis. The muscle of the posterior fascial compartment contains the three head of the triceps muscle.

The subdivision into compartments and fascial planes, in reality, is a didactic approach, as we know that in vivo, the muscular, vasculonervous, and purely connective structures are a continuum.
