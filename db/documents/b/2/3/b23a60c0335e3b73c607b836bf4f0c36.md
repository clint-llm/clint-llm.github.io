The etiology behind IgA pemphigus is not clearly understood. Based on previously studied cases, IgA pemphigus has been associated with monoclonal IgA gammopathy and multiple myeloma. In a 1992 paper describing IgA pustulosis, Wallach et al. described six out of 29 cases of IgA pemphigus that were found positive for monoclonal IgA gammopathy.
