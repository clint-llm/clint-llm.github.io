Bile duct injury is a potential complication of cholecystectomy. Misidentification of critical anatomical structures is a common cause, mainly due to the proximity of the cystic duct, the CHD, and the CBD. The incidence is higher in a laparoscopic than an open procedure.

Cholecystectomy, surgical removal of the gallbladder, is usually performed laparoscopically. Indications for cholecystectomy include symptomatic cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, porcelain gallbladder, and gallbladder polyps greater than 0.5 cm. Cholecystectomy is recommended for patients with asymptomatic cholelithiasis if there is an increased risk of gallbladder carcinoma or other complications.
