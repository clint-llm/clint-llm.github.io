Scleritis is an inflammation of the sclera, the outer layer of the globe. Scleritis can concurrently involve the cornea, episclera, and uvea.

The clinical symptoms for both infectious and autoimmune scleritis can appear similar. As a result, infectious cases may be managed as autoimmune, possibly worsening the outcome. To differentiate infectious from autoimmune scleritis, accurate history is crucial.Pseudomonas aeruginosa reported as the most common organism in developed countries.

Other known vectors include bacteria or fungal organisms such as Nocardia, Streptococcus, Haemophilus, Candida, and Aspergillus. Untreated, infectious scleritis can result in the loss of the eye due to the spread of infection to surrounding structures or perforation of the globe.
