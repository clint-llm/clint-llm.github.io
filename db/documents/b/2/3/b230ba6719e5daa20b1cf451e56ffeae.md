In the setting of pregnancy, a high-risk obstetrician should be consulted asÂ the hemodynamic changes associated with pregnancy can exacerbate pulmonic stenosis symptoms. Cardiology consultation for a pregnant patient may be warranted if the symptoms are severe. Consult of a pediatric cardiologist is warranted for newborns experiencing symptoms of pulmonic stenosis. Depending on the severity, pediatric critical care may also be necessary. In cases of suspected symptomatic pulmonic stenosis in an adult, a cardiology consult may be warranted.
