Due to intrinsic lipophilicity, certain beta-blockers may cause CNS depression. Prompt management of the airway is, therefore crucial. The airway should be protected with a cuffed endotracheal tube in all deeply obtunded patients. Premedication with atropine may be necessary especially in children since laryngeal manipulation during intubation may cause additive vagal stimulation and bradycardia. Bronchospasm due to beta-blockade may be treated with supplemental oxygen and inhaled bronchodilators like albuterol. Gastrointestinal decontamination with gastric lavage may be necessary for patients who present shortly after massive ingestions and/or with serious symptoms.

Administer activated charcoal to limit drug absorption to patients with minor symptoms who present later than an hour after ingestion. Consider whole bowel irrigation with polyethylene glycol sustained-release preparation and continued until the rectal effluent is clear. Benzodiazepines are the first line of treatment for seizures that may occur due to the high lipophilicity of certain beta-blockers. Prompt recognition of QRS widening and prolongation of QTc interval is crucial.

Administer sodium bicarbonate for QRS widening and magnesium sulfate for QTc prolongation. Although there have been no controlled trials to prove the efficacy of glucagon in poisoning beta-blocker overdose, glucagon is considered as a useful treatment of choice. Premedication with antiemetic may be considered since treatment with glucagon may induce vomiting.

Other possible side effects of glucagon include hypocalcemia and hyperglycemia. Treatment with calcium salts may provide benefits for hypotensive patients who overdosed on beta-blockers alone or in combination with a calcium channel blocker. Cases refractory to fluids, atropine, and glucagon should be considered candidates for high-dose insulin, euglycemia (HIE) treatment. High-dose insulin, euglycemia is a safe and simple way to augment cardiac contractility and does not need invasive monitoring. High-dose insulin, euglycemia can cause profound hypokalemia and hypoglycemia that can potentiate the cardiotoxicity in the setting of beta-blocker overdose.

Potassium and glucose should, therefore, be checked before initiation of high-dose insulin, euglycemia. In general, 1 U/kg of regular insulin bolus along with 0.5 g/kg dextrose intravenously (IV) is administered. Intravenous dextrose bolus should not be administered if the glucose level is more than 400 mg/dL.

Glucose should be monitored every 30 mins initially for up to four hours to maintain strict glycemic control (glucose 100 mg/dL to 200 mg/dL) by starting 10% dextrose infusion and dextrose 50% IV boluses, as needed. Supportive treatment with vasopressors may be needed since the inotropic effect of high-dose insulin euglycemia may be delayed up to 15 min to 60 min. The choice of vasopressor mainly depends on clinical findings. Phosphodiesterase such as inamrinone and milrinone increase the cAMP and may prove beneficial in increasing inotropy.

Prompt initiation of ECMO and continuation of mechanical life support may be needed until the xenobiotic effect wears off. Toxicity secondary to water-soluble and renally excreted beta-blockers (e.g., acebutolol, atenolol, nadolol, and sotalol) may respond to enhanced elimination techniques such as multiple doses activated charcoal, hemoperfusion or hemodialysis.
