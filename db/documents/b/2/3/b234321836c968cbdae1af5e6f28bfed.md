Laryngopharyngeal reflux typically results from the effects of reflux on the glottis and vocal cords. Patients may present with a multitude of symptoms ranging from hoarseness, globus sensation, and chronic throat clearing to heartburn and regurgitation. In contrast to patients with gastroesophageal reflux, which is associated with the lower esophageal sphincter, patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux typically have pathologic changes of the upper esophageal sphincter. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of laryngopharyngeal reflux and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomic etiology of laryngopharyngeal reflux.
- Outline the differences between clinical presentations of patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux and gastroesophageal reflux. 
- Review the management options available for laryngopharyngeal reflux.
- Explain the role of the interprofessional team in care coordination and clinical outcome improvement in patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux.
