The locus coeruleus is a nucleus in the lateral floor of the fourth ventricle and upper dorsolateral pons. Norepinephrine, also called noradrenaline, is a neurotransmitter predominantly released from the locus coeruleus. Norepinephrine helps promote the formation of memories and strengthens memories, especially those created in stressful situations. Noradrenaline released from the locus coeruleus can act on adrenergic receptors (alpha and beta receptors) present on neurons and glial cells (oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, ependymal cells, Schwann cells, microglia, and satellite cells) via adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C pathways. Adenylyl cyclase converts ATP to cAMP; cAMP then phosphorylates protein kinase A (PKA), which in turn has many functions within the central nervous system. Phospholipase C (PLC) is an enzyme that cleaves phospholipids resulting in the formation of diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) that contribute to signal transduction pathways. Noradrenaline can also activate glycogen metabolism and calcium signaling in astrocytes as well as regulate blood flow and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability.
