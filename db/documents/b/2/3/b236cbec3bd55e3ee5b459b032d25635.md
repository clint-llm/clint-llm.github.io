The tricuspid valve (TV) is the largest of all four cardiac valves and is located closer to the apex than the mitral valve. The TV separates the right atrium and ventricle with its fibrous annulus, three leaflets, two papillary muscles, and chordae tendinea. Due to their anatomy and position, the TV leaflets are referred to as the anterior, posterior, and septal. The anterior leaflet is the largest of the three, with the septal leaflet being the smallest. The septal leaflet is fixed medially from the tricuspid annulus on top of the interventricular septum. With the fixation of the septal leaflet, tricuspid annulus sizing is based on the size of the base of the septal leaflet. The anterior papillary muscle provides chordae attachment to the anterior and posterior leaflets while the medial papillary muscle provides chordae attachment to the posterior and septal leaflets.

The tricuspid annulus has a very complex structure that differs greatly from the symmetric mitral annulus. The tricuspid annulus may change shape with different load conditions. This must be taken into consideration when designing or placing tricuspid valve rings. Another area of interest when operating near the TV is Koch’s triangle. This area has borders that involve the hinge of the septal leaflet of the TV, the orifice of the superior margin of the coronary sinus, and the tendon of Todaro. This area is of great surgical importance as the atrioventricular node lies within this triangle. The triangle of Koch must be avoided along with the blood supply to the conduction system to avoid any atrial arrhythmias. The risk of damage to the conduction system is greater with the replacement of the TV than with a repair.

**Tricuspid Regurgitation (TR)**

TV regurgitation occurs when there is a backward flow of blood from the right ventricle to the right atrium and can result from a multitude of issues classified as either primary or secondary. Primary causes occur 25% of the time, while secondary causes occur the remaining 75% of the time.

**Primary**

- Rheumatic heart disease

- Myxomatous

- Endocarditis

- Carcinoid disease

- Ebstein anomaly

- Endomyocardial fibrosis

- Traumatic causes (ex- blunt chest injury, cardiac laceration)

- Iatrogenic (RV biopsy, pacemaker/defibrillator leads)

**Secondary (Functional)**

- Left heart disease due to left ventricle dysfunction or valve dysfunction causing pulmonary hypertension

- Pulmonary hypertension (due to chronic lung disease, pulmonary embolism)

- Right ventricular dysfunction (right ventricle infarction, myocardial disease, chronic right ventricular ischemia)

**Tricuspid Stenosis (TS)**

TV stenosis occurs when the valve is narrow, and therefore, not enough blood can flow from the right atrium into the right ventricle. TS most commonly occurs due to rheumatic heart disease. Isolated TS is rare as there will usually be some form of TR. The pathophysiology of the stenosis is similar to mitral valve stenosis in which the chordae have shortening with fusion and leaflet thickening. Calcific deposits of the valve occur late in the disease process.

Patients usually have signs of venous congestion with distension of the jugular veins, ascites, peripheral edema, and pleural effusions due to the significant increase in the right atrial pressures. Over time, the right atrium becomes dilated and thickens to accommodate the elevated pressures. The right atrium has higher diastolic pressures when compared to the right ventricle by 3 to 5 mm Hg. Patients may present with an array of symptoms ranging from fatigue with malaise to reduced cardiac output if the stenosis is significant. Physical exam findings may have palpable liver due to venous congestion with a fluid wave due to ascites. The TS murmur consists of a diastolic murmur at the lower left sternal border at the fourth intercostal space. The tricuspid valve stenosis murmur is softer, higher-pitched, and shorter than that found with mitral stenosis. The murmur intensity increases with any maneuver than increases blood flow across the TV.
