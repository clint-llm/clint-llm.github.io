Vulvar cancer staging is by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) and is performed surgically.

**Stage I**Tumors confined to the vulva or perineum, no nodal metastasis.

- **IA**: Tumor ≤2 cm with stromal invasion ≤1 mm

- **IB**: Tumor >2 cm or stromal invasion >1 mm

**Stage II**Tumor of any size with extension to adjacent perineal structures (lower urethra, lower vagina, anus), no nodal metastasis

**Stage III**Tumor of any size with or without extension to adjacent perineal structures (lower urethra, lower vagina, anus), with inguinofemoral nodal metastasis

- **IIIA**: 1 node metastasis (≥5 mm) or 1 to 2 node metastasis(es) (<5 mm)

- **IIIB**: ≥2 node metastases (≥5 mm) or ≥ 3 node metastases (<5 mm

- **IIIC**: node metastases with extra-capsular spread

**Stage IV**Tumor invades other regional or distal structures.

- **IVA**: Tumor invades any of the following: upper urethra and/or vaginal mucosa, bladder mucosa, rectal mucosa, or fixed to the pelvic bone, or fixed or ulcerated inguinofemoral nodes

- **IVB**: Any distant metastasis, including pelvic nodes

The exception of FIGO staging of vulvar cancers is melanoma, for which staging is the same as that of cutaneous melanoma and follows the TNM staging system used by the AJCC. The Breslow, Clark, and Chung micro staging systems have been historically used to evaluate pathological characteristics, with Breslow staging affording the most accurate prediction of survival and recurrence.
