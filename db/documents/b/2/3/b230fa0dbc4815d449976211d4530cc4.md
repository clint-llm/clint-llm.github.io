Contraindications applicable to peripheral nerve blockade also pertain to the sural nerve block (i.e., patient refusal, allergy to local anesthetics, infection at the site of injection or systemic infection, malignancy at the needle entry site, and coagulopathy). A regional nerve block is also not advised if pre-existing neural deficits exist in the distribution of the block. While caution is advised in patients maintained on anticoagulation therapy, the ankle and lateral leg are considered compressible or “superficial block” sites.
