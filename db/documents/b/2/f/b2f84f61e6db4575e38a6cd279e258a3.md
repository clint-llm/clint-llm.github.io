Conservative management of rectal prolapse includes stool softeners and/or laxatives, avoidance of prolonged straining, and treatment of any predisposing underlying conditions. Compliance with bowel regimen is important because patients who have repeat instances of rectal prolapse may be less responsive to rectal prolapseÂ in the future. Generally, these conservative tools work for about 90% of patients who develop rectal prolapse before age 3. For children with cystic fibrosis, who as mentioned above are predisposed to rectal prolapse, adjustment of pancreatic enzymes is important.
