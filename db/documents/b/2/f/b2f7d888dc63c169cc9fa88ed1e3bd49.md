The upper and lower lateral cartilages have an area of fibrous attachment (the "scroll" region) subject to several anatomical variations.Â  Nostril shape and nasal sidewall support vary widely, and both influence perception of nasal airflow.

As patients age, alar cartilages soften and soft tissue connections weaken in the lower two thirds of the nose, creating a phenomenon known as Aging Nose Syndrome. This can cause nasal tip ptosis, nasal valve collapse, and nasal obstruction.
