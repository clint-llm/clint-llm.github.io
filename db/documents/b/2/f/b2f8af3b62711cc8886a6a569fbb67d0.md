The abnormal shape and composition of the discoid meniscus are thought to predispose the structure to injury.

Studies show that there is significant disorganization of the circular collagen bundle. In addition, the circumferentially arranged collagen fibers show a heterogeneous course. It is believed that there is a structural problem with abnormal vascularity and increased discoid thickness, which makes it prone to tearing. The discoid meniscus, with its abnormal collagen formation, undergoes mucoid degeneration weakening its integrity in the presence of repetitive microtrauma.
