Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is characterized by burning pain in a normal-appearing oral mucosa lasting at least four to six months.

Studies have shown an association of burning mouth syndrome with Axis I and Axis II psychiatric disorders,

Lamey and Lewis categorized burning mouth syndrome into three categories based on fluctuations in pain severity over a 24 hour period.

- Type 1 typically has no symptoms on waking and progressively worsens throughout the day with variable nighttime symptoms. It may be related to nutritional deficiency or endocrine conditions such as diabetes mellitus.

- Type 2 is associated with chronic anxiety and displays symptoms throughout the day.

- Type 3 displays intermittent daytime symptoms and may have periods without any symptoms. Food allergy is thought to be a potential underlying mechanism.
