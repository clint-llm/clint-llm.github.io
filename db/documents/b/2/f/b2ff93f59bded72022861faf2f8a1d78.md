The ovary is the female gonad. It is a paired intraperitoneal endocrine organ typically found in the lower left and right quadrants of the abdomen, respectively.Â  The ovaries play a fundamental role in reproduction as well as the production of hormones.

On physical exam, healthy ovaries are palpable, but, depending on the anatomical variation and body habitus of the patient, it may not be easy to palpate them. Ovaries that contain cysts may be easier to feel. Ultrasound is one of the most common modes of evaluating ovaries.
