Hamartomas are often incidental findings on imaging and can mimic pulmonary malignancies. Once found, or in the case of asymptomatic hamartoma, there are multiple diagnostic strategies available to determine the nature of the lesion. On imaging, e.g., chest X-ray or CT scans, masses present as coin- shaped and solitary, with well-defined edges, typically measuring less than 4 cm in diameter. Calcification is present in 25% to 30% of patients. The “popcorn” or “comma-shaped” appearance of calcification is pathognomonic for hamartomas.
