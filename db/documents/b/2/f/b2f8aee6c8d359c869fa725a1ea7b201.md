There are multiple different causes of hand trauma. Common causes include falls, sports-related injuries, machine-related injuries, gunshot injuries, crush injuries, high pressure, and thermal and chemical injuries. These injuries can lead to burns, lacerations, limb amputations, tendon and ligament damage, fractures, and dislocations.

Following an injury to the hand, damaged structures will repair through a cascade of processes, aiming to restore the original tissue integrity.

Post-traumatic hand stiffnessÂ can be further influenced by the development of chronic regional pain syndrome (CRPS). CRPS is due to an abnormal inflammatory response following trauma due to sustained sympathetic activity. This can lead to stiffness, as well as pain, swelling, vasomotor disturbance, and trophic skin changes.

Rarely, hypertrophic ossification following trauma can be seen in the hand following trauma; this leads to the formation of atypical bone in tissues, contributing to stiffness.
