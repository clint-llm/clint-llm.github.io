Microscopic polyangiitis is a small vessel necrotizing vasculitis, a part of a large spectrum of disorders termed anti-neutrophil-cytoplasmic-antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV). This umbrella term includes granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA or Churg-Strauss disease), and renal limited vasculitis (RLV). Immunosuppressive medications are used to manage MPA. The choice of drugs depends partially on the rate of progression, the extent of the disease, and the degree of inflammation. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of microscopic polyangiitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in recognizing and managing this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of microscopic polyangiitis.
- Outline the typical presentation for a patient with microscopic polyangiitis.
- Describe the recommended management of microscopic polyangiitis.
- Explain the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding managing patients with microscopic polyangiitis.
