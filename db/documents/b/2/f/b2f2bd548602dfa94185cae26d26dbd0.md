Cluster headaches occur in 0.1% of the general population. Any age is possible for onset, but the typical age is approximately 30 years. Men are three times more likely to suffer from this condition than women, though current research has shown that the ratio has decreased over time.

Patients are 14 to 39 times more likely to be diagnosed if they have a 1st-degree relative who also had cluster headaches and have a 2- to 8- fold risk if a second-degree relative has the same diagnosis.
