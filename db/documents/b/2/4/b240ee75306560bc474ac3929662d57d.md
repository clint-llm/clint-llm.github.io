Treatment of pathologic fractures requires an interprofessional approach, and consultations should be obtained from internal medicine, hematology-oncology, radiation-oncology, and palliative care when indicated. These teams should fully optimize patients prior to any elective surgical intervention. Interprofessional meetings involving musculoskeletal oncology, pathology, and radiology are essential in establishing a diagnosis and treatment plan.
