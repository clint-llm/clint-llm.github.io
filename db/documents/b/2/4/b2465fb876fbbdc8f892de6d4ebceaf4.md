After establishing the diagnosis of nonorganic functional hearing loss, management strategies range from observation to counseling and psychiatric intervention.

A few patients recover without any intervention; however, pursuing this tack without a thorough evaluation runs the risk of failing to recognize possible underlying psychiatric conditions, which may lead to a relapse or worsening of symptoms. Appropriate counseling includes highlighting the inconsistencies in audiological testing in a nonconfrontational manner. Explanation, reassurance, and encouragement are often effective techniques.

The hearing loss should be acknowledged as real; the patient should not be held accountable for the hearing loss.

Assessing which patients need psychiatric intervention and which patients do not is a clinical challenge. Psychiatric needs must be evaluated on an individual basis.

Austen and Lynch suggest that the underlying need motivating the hearing loss must be elucidated and treated. This prevents the nonorganic hearing loss from returning or being converted to another nonorganic behavior.
