The etiology of OAVS is multifactorial and includes both genetic and environmental factors. The presence of familial cases can explain the genetic basis of the syndrome.

**Genetic Factors**

Most commonly, OAVS is sporadic.

- The 5p15.33-pter deletion (most common type)

- Deletion of 12p13.33 region involving the WNT5B gene

- Partially overlapping microduplications on 14q23.1

- Anomalies in 22q chromosome

- Anomalies in 14g32 containing GSC (GOOSECOID) gene

- Deletion of 14q31.1q31.3, a region adjacent to GSC gene

- Linkage to 15q26.2-q26.3 region

- Deletion of 12q13.33

- Partial trisomy of the 22q11 region

- Aneuploidy in chromosome X

- Translocation t(9;12) (p23;q12.2)

- Mosaicism of trisomy 7, 9 and 22

- Duplication of SIX1, SIX6, and OTX2

**Environmental Factors**

These include maternal or prenatal factors like diabetes mellitus during pregnancy, twin or multiple pregnancies, maternal hypothyroidism, assisted reproductive techniques, hormonal therapy, exposure to tamoxifen, celiac disease, thalidomide, embryonic blood flow disruption, vasoactive drug use, smoking, and older age group of parents.

The most accepted hypothesis includes disruption of embryonic blood flow during development due to the factors mentioned above
