These injuries are almost inevitable due to the nature of childrenâ€™s play and the increased incidence of falling on outstretched hands. However, in such cases, prompt evaluation of the site of injury is warranted to rule out fractures and treatment with removable casts. A key component would include parental education on the correct method of management of the soft casts. High-risk activities such as contact sports, or anything with a high risk of falling, should be avoided after injury for a period of up two months to prevent further injury.
