Many patients with chronic diseases require injections as part of their prolonged medical therapy. Hyaluronidase has been shown to enhance the systemic delivery of injectable medications and provide better treatment outcomes for these patients. Examples of current medications being using in combination with hyaluronidase include, but are not limited to: insulin in diabetes, beta interferons in multiple sclerosis, biotherapeutics in rheumatoid arthritis, immunoglobulin replacement therapy in primary immunodeficiencies, and monoclonal antibodies in cancer treatment.

**FDA Approved Indications**

- Absorption and dispersion enhancer of injected drugs

- Subcutaneous fluid administration for hydration therapy - hypodermoclysis

- Subcutaneous urography to improve absorption of radiopaque agents

**Non-FDA Approved Uses**

- Extravasation of medications from intravenous lines management

- Adjunct to local anesthetic eye blocks for ophthalmic surgery

- Keloid scar treatment – involves cryosurgery followed by injections with hyaluronidase, triamcinolone, and 5-fluorouracil

- Reversing cosmetic facial fillers composed of hyaluronic acid

Hyaluronidase is an enzyme that degrades the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan, more commonly known as hyaluronic acid. Hyaluronic acid is a component of the extracellular matrix that absorbs water and has a gel-like consistency.

Recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) formulations are available for therapeutic administration through subcutaneous injections.max decreases when hyaluronidase is co-administered with the target drug, which means that the medication is better absorbed and enters systemic circulation at a faster rate with the aid of hyaluronic acid degradation.
