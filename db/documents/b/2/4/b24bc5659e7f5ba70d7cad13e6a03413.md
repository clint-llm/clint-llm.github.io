Complications associated with diabetes are the leading cause of nontraumatic lower-extremity amputations. Diabetic foot ulcers occur in approximately 15 percent of patients with diabetes mellitus and are commonly located on the plantar weight-bearing surfaces of the foot. Six percent of patients with diabetic foot ulcers will require hospitalization due to infection or ulcer-related complications, and 1 percent will require amputation. This activity discusses hyperbaric oxygen therapy as an effective treatment option and discusses the use of an interprofessional team in the evaluation and treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of diabetic foot ulcers.
- Review the evaluation of a diabetic foot ulcer.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for diabetic foot ulcers.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance care of the diabetic foot ulcer and improve patient outcomes.
