Methyldopa is a centrally acting sympatholytic agent used in the treatment of hypertension. Since its introduction in 1960, the drug quickly became a leading antihypertensive, but its use has decreased markedly, replaced by better-tolerated alternatives. It is still in use in developing countries due to its low cost.Â This drug is also useful in pregnancy because it has no teratogenic effects.
