Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) refers to a subtype of tenosynovial giant cell tumors that diffusely affect the soft tissue lining of joints and tendons. PVNS most commonly affects the knee, hip, and ankle joints and is insidious in onset, with symptoms often being present for years before diagnosis. This activity outlines the evaluation of pigmented villonodular synovitis and highlights the role of the inter-professional team in improving care for patients with this condition. Additionally, this activity illustrates the treatment of pigmented villonodular synovitis and explains the role of the healthcare team in managing patients with this condition.
