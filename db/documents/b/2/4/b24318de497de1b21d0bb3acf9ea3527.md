Alveolar osteitis is a painful, debilitating condition and one of the most common complications after tooth extraction. There is no consensus on the criteria used for diagnosis. Patients exhibit non-specific signs and symptoms such as pain not relieved by analgesics, halitosis, necrotic debris, or a disintegrated blood clot within the alveolus.

While oral and maxillofacial surgeons are often involved in these patients' care, other providers should also be adept at treating this condition. Patients are likely to also present to general dentistry offices and occasionally even to primary care or emergency medicine physicians. Interprofessional communication is essential to enhance patient-centered care and improve outcomes.

Although there is still debate regarding the most effective strategies for prevention and management of AO, chlorhexidine is the intervention with the most support. That recommendation was developed after an exhaustive review of the current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and included large randomized clinical trials and systematic reviews.
