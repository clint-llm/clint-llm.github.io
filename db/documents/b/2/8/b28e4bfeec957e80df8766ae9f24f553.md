The latissimus dorsi is a broad, flat muscle occupying most of the lower posterior thorax. The muscle's primary function is to move the upper extremity, but it is also considered an accessory muscle of respiration. Due to this muscle's broad attachment to several vertebral spinous processes and the thoracolumbar fascia, ongoing research looks at what role the muscle plays in trunk movement. Currently, the evidence is mixed on how much influence this muscle has on spine extension, lateral flexion, or rotation. Even though the muscle has a broad attachment to the trunk and strong actions on the humerus, using this muscle for surgical transposition appears to have a limited reduction of normal function.
