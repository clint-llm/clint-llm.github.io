Postmenopause women are typically greater than 50 years old unless they incurred induced menopause. Postmenopausal women have low estrogen levels, precipitating genitourinary syndrome symptoms. Symptoms appear in the early to the late postmenopausal stage.

The STRAW staging system is a useful tool for health care members and patients to evaluate menstrual transition and postmenopause.
