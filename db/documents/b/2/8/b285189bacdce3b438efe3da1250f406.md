Scar revision using laser technology is an interprofessional process that involves the interplay of the primary caregiver, nurse practitioner, surgeon, and a dermatologist, with a special interest in aesthetics in order to achieve the best possible outcome for the patient. Primary healthcare professionals should refer patients with scars to a board-certified dermatologist or plastic surgeon with the necessary medical expertise and specialized knowledge in treating scars with lasers. A medical consultation to review the patient's overall health, comorbidities, skin type, and scar characteristics is essential to treat a scar effectively. The outcomes of patients with scars are variable. While in some cases, skin aesthetics can improve cosmesis, lasers themselves can cause several complications that can worsen the appearance of scars. Hence, laser therapy for scars requires professionals with experience with this device. The nurse has a crucial role to address the patient's fears and concerns before the day of surgery and assists the clinician in providing education for the patient. A follow-up of laser therapy in scar treatment requires an interprofessional approach with liaison between the dermatologist and nursing staff with specialized training in dermatology, as the nurse may well be the initial point of contact and education for follow-up care. This team approach can ensure the best possible patient outcomes. [Level 5]
