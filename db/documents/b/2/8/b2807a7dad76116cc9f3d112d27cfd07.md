Hemolytic anemia is the destruction of RBCs. Normally, red blood cells have a lifespan of 120 days. This process can be something chronic that has occurred over time or acute and life-threatening. It can be further subdivided as to where the hemolysis is taking place - intravascularly or extravascularly.

When a red blood cell is unable to change shape as it passes through the spleen, it will become sequestered and phagocytosis will occur. This is seen in hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease.

Destruction can also occur with inherited protein deficits (membranopathies ie hereditary spherocytosis), fragmentation [microangiopathic hemolytic anemias ie. thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), HELLP], increased oxidative stress or decreased energy production (enzymopathies ie. G6PD Deficiency), antibodies binding with RBCâ€™s resulting in phagocytosis (immune-mediated), drug-induced hemolysis, infections, or direct trauma (conga drums).
