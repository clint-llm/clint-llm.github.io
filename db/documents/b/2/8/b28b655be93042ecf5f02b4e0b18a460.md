To protect the developing fetus from the outside world, the cervix maintains its anatomy as a tightly-closed tubular structure throughout the majority of the pregnancy. As a mother approaches the term segment of her pregnancy, which is recognized anywhere between 37 and 42 weeks, the cervix undergoes dilation and effacementÂ to enable the passage of the fetus from the uterus down through the vaginal canal.
