**CT Guided Percutaneous Lung Biopsy**: Depending on the decision to perform core biopsy alone or along with FNA, several options for percutaneous lung biopsy needles are available, including aspiration and cutting needles. The choice of the needle also depends upon factors like the size of the lesion, needle trajectory, and operator preference.

**Transbronchial Biopsy:**Essential equipment includes an adult size flexible bronchoscope with a light source and video monitoring. Tissue samples are taken with the help of biopsy forceps that are placed in specimen containers. Suction apparatus, oxygen supply and also, equipment to provide cardiopulmonary resuscitation must be available.

**Cryo-TBB:**A specialized flexible probe is used for freezing and sampling the lung tissue to -89 F using nitrous oxide gas.

**VATS:**The setup for a VATS procedure includes a video thoracoscope, diathermy pen, sponge holding, and biopsy forceps, endoscopic staple transaction devices, rigid or flexible trocar cannula, thoracotomy tray, chest tube with water seal, and suction source with tubing.

**Open Lung Biopsy:**It is an invasive operative procedure under general anesthesia, and all anticipated equipment should be prepared before the procedure, including a thoracotomy tray, forceps, stapling devices, and complementary instruments.
