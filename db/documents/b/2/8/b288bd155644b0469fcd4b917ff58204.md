Epidemiological information regarding odontogenic cysts is as follows:

- Periapical cysts are the most commonly reported odontogenic cysts. Per Johnson et al., periapical cysts comprise approximately 60% of all odontogenic cysts. They are more commonly found in the maxilla about 60% of the time.

- Residual cysts comprise approximately 5% of all odontogenic cysts.

- Paradental cysts comprise 3 to 5% of all odontogenic cysts.

- Dentigerous cysts, Per Johnson et al., comprise 20.6% of all odontogenic cysts. It counts for 20% of all mandibular cysts.

- Eruption cysts occur primarily in young children during the eruption of their deciduous or permanent teeth.

- Lateral periodontal cysts account for less than 3% of all odontogenic cysts. Approximately 70% occur in the mandibular canine to premolar regions, while they occur less commonly in the canine-lateral area in the maxilla.

- Odontogenic keratocysts, per Johnson et al., represent 4 to 12% of all odontogenic cysts. They occur more frequently in the second and third decades of life.

- Orthokeratinizing odontogenic cysts are the most uncommon of all the odontogenic cysts, and they occur typically in males in their 40s.

- Glandular odontogenic cysts are rare, accounting for less than 0.2% of all odontogenic cysts.
