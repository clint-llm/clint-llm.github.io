Following are the investigations to pertinent for aiding in the diagnosis of spinal cord injury.

**Plain radiographs**

In alert patients, three views, the lateral, anterior-posterior, and odontoid, of the cervical spine can be obtained. An adequate lateral cervical spine x-ray should include all seven cervical vertebrae and the superior border of the first thoracic vertebra. An adequate lateral cervical spine film may identify up to 90% of bony injuries. Since physical examination is not adequate for the detection of cervical spine injuries, decision rules can be used to decide when to obtain imaging.

National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS)

NEXUS includes five clinical criteria which determine whether cervical spine imaging is warranted. If the following are present, imaging may not be necessary:

- The absence of midline cervical tenderness.

- A normal level of consciousness.

- No evidence of intoxication

- Absence of focal neurologic deficit

- Absence of distracting injury.

Although there is no validated prediction rule for cervical spine imaging in children, certain factors that warrant imaging are:

- Altered mental status

- Focal neurologic finding

- Neck pain, torticollis

- Significant torso injury

- Condition predisposing to spinal cord injury (Down syndrome, Klippel-Feil syndrome)

- Diving, high-risk mechanisms such as acceleration or deceleration injury.

If the initial radiographs are inconclusive, the spine should remain immobilized until the practitioner reliably excludes injuries.

**CT Scan**

The CT scan is more sensitive and specific for evaluating the cervical spine, particularly at the craniocervical and cervicothoracic junctions, where the sensitivity of plain films is limited. The scan should be obtained in unconscious patients with significant blunt trauma; however, it is not clear whether a negative CT scan in an unconscious patient is adequate or a subsequent MRI should be obtained.

Beware that an absence of radiographic abnormality cannot exclude injury, particularly in children. In children younger than eight years of age, stretching of the spinal cord can cause spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA). This may be due to the horizontal orientation of the facet joints and elastic type of intervertebral ligaments. This may cause upper cervical spinal elements to shift rather than break when force is applied.
