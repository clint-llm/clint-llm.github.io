Sarcomas of soft tissue are uncommon malignancies and account for less than 1% of all cancers.Â Angiosarcomas are a subtype of soft-tissue sarcoma and are aggressive, malignant endothelial-cell tumors of vascular or lymphatic origin with a dismal prognosis. Most angiosarcomas present as intermediate or high-grade lesions. Unfortunately, delays in diagnosis are common as angiosarcomas can present as relatively benign-appearing lesions.
