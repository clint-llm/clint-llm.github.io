Sandifer syndrome is a condition that requires a high index of suspicion. Primary care providers (PCP) should be able to identify and treat SS. When the clinical picture is not clear, the PCP should refer the patient to a pediatric neurologist for further evaluation to determine the underlying etiology.

When GERD is established as a cause of Sandifer syndrome, and if the symptoms are refractory to treatment, a GI referral is pertinent for further treatment of GERD.
