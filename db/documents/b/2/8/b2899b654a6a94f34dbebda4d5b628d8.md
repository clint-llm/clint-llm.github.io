ALS is a disease that necessarily progresses to significant, multifactorial debilitation and eventually death. As the clinical entity of ALS is broad in its subclassifications, involving many potential separate systems and symptoms, there is no single, standard model of patient care. Rather, the care plan of each patient needs to take into account the degree of lower motor involvement and weakness, especially whether it has progressed to the respiratory muscles, upper motor neuron involvement/spasticity, degrees of dysarthria and dysphagia, as well as the presence of other potentially associated symptoms such as frontotemporal dementia and depression. While the composition of these care teams will undoubtedly change based on the presence and degree of these symptoms, the interprofessional team will usually include the following practitioners: Physician, occupational and physical therapists, respiratory therapists, dietician, speech pathologist, social worker, and case manager. When patients with ALS are cared for by such an interprofessional team, there have been significant, demonstrable benefits in both the quality of life, as well as the length of survival.
