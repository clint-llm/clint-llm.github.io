The Lown-Ganong-Levine pattern has been reported in a wide age range of patients and has not been shown to display increased incidence in one particular sex or ethnic background. Bernard Lown, William Francis Ganong, and Samual Levineâ€™s initial retrospective study found nearly 200 electrocardiograms (EKG) of 13500 evaluated, revealing with a short PR interval, with normal QRS complex correlating to a prevalence of just over 1%. Further evaluation has determined that the incidence of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia in Lown-Ganong-Levine patients is significantly higher, nearing 11%. This number compares to an incidence of less than 0.5% in the general population without shortened PR intervals.
