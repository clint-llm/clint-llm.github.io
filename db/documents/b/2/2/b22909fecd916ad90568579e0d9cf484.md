Written consent should be obtained after the patient is informed about the risks, benefits, and alternatives to facet joint injection. The patient should be advised that pain relief with a facet joint injection is variable and that repeated injections may be needed due to the transient nature of pain improvement.

Patient positioning is prone, and a pillow can be placed under the abdomen to allow ease of access to the joint and reduce lumbar curving. The patientâ€™s head and face should be supported for comfort and breathing. For cervical injections, patient positioning may involve a lateral or an oblique frontal approach. If lateral positioning is assumed, a headrest should be used to avoid lateral flexion of the neck, and shoulders should be positioned down.
