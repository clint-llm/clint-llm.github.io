Complications of erectile dysfunction are predominantly emotional, both to the patient and his partner. It can cause a strain on relationships and negatively impact the quality of life of these patients. Of course, the cardiovascular pathologies and diabetic complications that may accompany this condition come with their own health issues.

Priapism from PDE-5 inhibitor medications is relatively uncommon at only about 3% of all priapism cases despite the widespread use of these drugs. Penile injection therapy is involved in about 8.8% of priapism cases and trazodone in about 6%, while second-generation antipsychotic drugs are responsible for 33.8%.

Treatment for drug-induced priapism is intermittent intracavernosal injections of diluted phenylephrine solution, 200 mcg at a time, about 5 to 10 minutes apart until detumescence or a maximum dose of 1 mg of phenylephrine has been delivered. If this fails, a surgical shunting procedure will be necessary. Treatment should begin quickly as permanent corporal fibrosis can occur with delayed therapy.
