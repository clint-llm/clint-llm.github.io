The management of an esophageal ulcer is with an interprofessional team that consists of a thoracic surgeon, gastroenterologist, radiologist, and an internist. Treatment of esophageal ulcers secondary to GERD is aimed at acid suppression, controlling acid secretion, promoting peristalsis and mucosal wall healing.

Treatment of drug-induced esophageal ulcer includes discontinuation of the offending medications and administering proton pump inhibitors. Antituberculous medications with Isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide for 6 to 9 months can be used for esophageal ulcers caused by tuberculosis.

Antimicrobial agents are used for treating mucosal damage caused by infectious esophagitis. InfectionÂ caused by cytomegalovirus is treated with ganciclovir whereas fluconazole is the preferred choice in the treatment of esophageal candidiasis.

Finally, severe cases of esophageal injury are managed by intubation with a nasogastric tube, administration of intravenous fluids, chemoprophylaxis with antibiotics, pain relief with analgesics and treating the ulcer with H2 receptor antagonists and PPIs. The prognosis for patients with esophageal ulcer depends on the immune status, comorbidity, age, and cause. For those who comply with treatment, the prognosis is good.
