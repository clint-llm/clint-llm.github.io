The proper function of the eye depends on its ability to receive and process energy from light in the environment, produce action potentials in specialized nerve cells, and relay those potentials through the optic nerve (cranial nerve II) to the brain. The cornea, iris, ciliary body, and lens all play a role in transmitting and focusing light onto the sensory component of the eye, the retina. Structures such as the choroid, aqueous and vitreous humor, and the lacrimal system are important for physiological balance, appropriate pressure maintenance, and nourishment of ocular tissues.
