There is a pattern of lobular panniculitis that typically spares the interlobular septa, epidermis, and dermis.  A variably dense infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes(neoplastic T-cells and few reactive B-cells), and macrophages are present.  The neoplastic T-cells are atypical with hyperchromatic nuclei and irregular nuclear membranes.  By immunohistochemistry, these neoplastic T-cells express CD8, beta F1 and other cytotoxic T-cell markers including granzyme B, perforin, and TIA1.  These CD8+ T-cells may be sparse but tend to surround or rim the adipocytes and distort the adipocyte membrane.  The neoplastic T-cells directly adjacent to the adipocytes have a higher Ki67 proliferation index compared to LEP, which has a relatively lower Ki67 proliferation index.  Karyorrhexis, mitoses, and fat necrosis are commonly seen
