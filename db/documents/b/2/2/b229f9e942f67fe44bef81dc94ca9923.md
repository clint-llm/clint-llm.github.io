A laceration is a pattern of injury in which blunt forces result in a tear in the skin and underlying tissues. Lacerations in the scalp are different from lacerations in other parts of the face and body due to differences in the anatomy and blood supply. The scalp is stretched over the bone, making it more prone to laceration. This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment of scalp lacerations and reviews the interprofessional team's role in managing affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the anatomical features that make the evaluation/management of scalp lacerations unique compared to the evaluation/management of lacerations involving other body regions.
- Review the management considerations for scalp lacerations.
- Summarize potential complications of scalp lacerations.
- Outline some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance outcomes for patients with scalp lacerations.
