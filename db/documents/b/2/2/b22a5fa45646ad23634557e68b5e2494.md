Trichomonas is a motile organism with a size comparable to a white blood cell. It has at least 4 flagella that provide undulating motility. The organism resides in the lumen of the urogenital tract. The organism releases cytotoxic proteins that destroy the epithelial lining. During an infection, the vaginal pH usually increases.

In women, T. vaginalis has an incubation period of five to twenty-eight days. Women with trichomoniasis often complain of a foul-smelling yellow or green vaginal discharge, dyspareunia, urinary frequency, dysuria, and/or vulvarÂ pruritus or erythema. In men, it often does not cause symptoms. If a male is symptomatic, the most common symptom is urethritis. Less commonly, men may also develop prostatitis and epididymitis.
