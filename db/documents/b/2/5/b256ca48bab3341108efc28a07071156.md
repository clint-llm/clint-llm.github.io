Proteinuria can be classified as transient and persistent.

**Transient Proteinuria**

- Urinary tract infection

- Orthostatic proteinuria (occurs after the patient has been upright for a prolonged period, absent in early morning urine) - this is rare in patients more than 30 years of age

- Fever

- Heavy exercise

- Vaginal mucus

- Pregnancy

**Persistent Proteinuria**

- Primary renal disease

- Glomerular (such as glomerulonephritis)
- Tubular

- Secondary renal disease

- Diabetes mellitus
- Connective tissue diseases 
- Vasculitis
- Amyloidosis
- Myeloma
- Congestive cardiac failure
- Hypertension

**Benign Causes of Proteinuria**

- Fever

- Acute illness

- Exercise/intense physical activity

- Orthostatic proteinuria

- Dehydration

- Emotional stress

- Hear injury

- Inflammatory process

The benign causes of proteinuria do not increase morbidity or mortality otherwise. These conditions are highly variable and usually reversible as the precipitating factor is addressed. Proteinuria is not a part of normal aging.
