The increasing demand for total knee arthroplasty and subsequent increased incidence of periprosthetic femur fractures requires effective communication among multiple departments. The aging patient who suffers a periprosthetic femur fracture often requires a primary medical service, pharmacist, therapist, and surgeon. The goal of care includes preoperative medical optimization, effective fracture management, and focused therapy to decrease hospital length of stay and facilitate early weight-bearing. Nurses, case managers, and pharmacists familiar with orthopedic preoperative and postoperative management play a crucial role in the overall success of treatment. [Level 5]
