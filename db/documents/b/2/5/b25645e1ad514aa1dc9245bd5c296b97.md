Three distinct characteristics seen in these cysts include an epithelial lining representing a part of the gut, a well-defined layer of smooth muscle, and a close approximation with some part of the gastrointestinal tract, such as sharing a common wall.

Cysts can be divided into cystic or tubular on the basis of their structural configuration. Cystic duplications are more common (80% of the duplications) and do not communicate with the bowel lumen. Tubular duplications are less common and communicate with the lumen of the bowel.

These cysts can be divided into foregut, midgut, and hindgut duplications depending on the part of the alimentary tract they are intimately attached to. The ileum, followed by the esophagus, is the most common location for these duplication cysts.
