The diagnosis of L. monocytogenes requires a culture of the bacteria from the blood, cerebral spinal fluid, or placental fluid. Once in the lab, Listeria species grows on a special type ofÂ agar called Meuller-Hinton agar. Culture will reveal gram-positive rods with colonies that are beta-hemolytic.

According to the CDC, stool cultures are neither sensitive nor specific for diagnosing L. monocytogenes.
