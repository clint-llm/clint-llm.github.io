It is also known by the conventional name amphotericin B and has been used for the treatment of invasive fungal infections for more than 50 years. Newer lipid formulations that are less nephrotoxic as compared with conventional amphotericin B are available. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, activity, adverse events, toxicity, and other key elements of antifungal uses of amphotericin B in the clinical setting as relates to the essential points needed by members of an interprofessional team managing the care of patients who present with mycotic infections.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the approved indications of amphotericin B.
- Review the mechanism of action of amphotericin B.
- Describe the adverse of amphotericin B.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance appropriate clinical outcomes with amphotericin B therapy to treat mycotic infections to optimal patient outcomes and mitigate toxicity and adverse events.
