The elbow is one of the most common large joints to dislocate and is the most common large joint dislocated in children.

An elbow dislocation can be categorized as simple or complex based on the association with a fracture. A simple dislocation only involves injury to ligamentous or capsular structures, whereas complex dislocations involve a fracture of the surrounding bony structures.
