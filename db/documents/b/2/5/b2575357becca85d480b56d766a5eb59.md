Healthcare professionals should be aware that in the vast majority of cases, the mega cisterna magna is an incidental radiographic finding with little if any clinical significance that does not require long-term follow-up. In most cases, it is considered a normal radiographic variant. It can, however, be associated with other neurologic or systemic anomalies, albeit rarely. All interprofessional team members, including clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPS, and PAs), and nursing staff, need to engage in open communication, collaborative action, and accurate record-keeping and information sharing to optimize patient outputs.

Appropriate evaluation, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without contrast, should be obtained to rule out other etiologies. For mega cisterna magna, there is no indicated specific treatment or surgical intervention.
