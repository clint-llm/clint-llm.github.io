The posterior compartment of the thigh is separated from the anterior compartment by the lateral intermuscular septum and the medial compartment by the posterior intermuscular septum. The femur is the bony structure that provides support to the muscles, nerves, and vasculature in the posterior thigh. The posterior thigh is composed of three muscles: biceps femoris long and short head, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus. These three muscles are collectively referred to as the hamstring muscles. The hamstring muscles in the open kinetic chain allow extension of the hip and flexion of the knee, and when in the closed kinetic chain, allow extension of the knee.
