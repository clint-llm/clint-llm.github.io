Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) is a variant of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that, in recent years, has received a new identity and nomenclature from the histology perspective. The orphan among lung cancers has found a family, albeit with some newfound stepbrothers and sisters.Â The overhaul in the classification system of solitary adenocarcinomas has been driven by the purpose of identifying tumors that have an indolent clinical course and can be treated with a more conservative approach and a higher success rate.

Until the previous decade, strict pathologic criteria defined a bronchioloalveolar carcinoma as a tumor arising from terminal bronchiolar and alveolar acinar epithelia with an absence of invasion through the alveolar basement membrane into the pulmonary parenchyma. A growing consensus has been to subclassify adenocarcinoma with radiologic features of ground-glass opacities, with no or minimal extrathoracic spread, and histology demonstrating a lepidic growth pattern in the presence or absence of associated minimally invasive or invasive disease. The subgroup has been renamed adenocarcinoma with lepidic growth and classified into subtypes based on the extent of invasive disease.
