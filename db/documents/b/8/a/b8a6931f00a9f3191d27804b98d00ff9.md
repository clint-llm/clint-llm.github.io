In most cases, the involvement of intraocular tissue makes biopsy a risky and impractical decision. In rare cases of external disease, or anterior segment involvement, a biopsy may be taken for histopathologic analysis. Presence of Ziehl-Neelson acid-fast stained bacilli and/or caseous necrosis with epithelioid cells and Langerhans giant cells suggests ocular TB. Bacteria in multinucleated giant cells are inconsistently detected by histologic staining.
