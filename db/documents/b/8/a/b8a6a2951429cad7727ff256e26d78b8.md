According to the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumors, “SCLC is defined by light microscopy as a tumor with cells that have a small size, a round-to-fusiform shape, scant cytoplasm, finely granular nuclear chromatin and absent or inconspicuous nucleoli.” Necrosis may be extensive, and cells manifest a high mitotic rate. SCLCs originate from epithelial cells, and up to 90% will express thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF1). Epithelial cell markers including cytokeratin can be used to distinguish SCLC from lymphoma and other neuroendocrine tumors.
