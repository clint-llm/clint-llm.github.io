- Since IPF is a challenging disease with a poor prognosis, early diagnosis is essential. Interdisciplinary management can involve a pulmonologist, chest radiologist, thoracic surgeon, rheumatologist, and pathologist.

- Patients with IPF will benefit from referral to an Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) specialty clinic for discussion of anti-fibrotic drug therapies and timely referral for a lung transplant.

- Because lung disease is progressive and fatal, it is important to address advanced care plans and end-of-life issues.
