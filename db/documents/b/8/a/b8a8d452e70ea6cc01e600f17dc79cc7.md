The basic equipment includes electrodes (silver/silver-chloride electrodes are the most widely used), an amplifier, and an EEG system (monitor and processor). Previously, mechanical pen and paper recording devices were used for plotting the EEG recordings (analog recording). In current clinical practice, a standard EEG system has the capacity to obtain information from at least 128 channels, with a greater than 10 kHz sampling rate from all the channels along with a 24-bit resolution at each of the amplifiers.

Other important components of the electrode placement are the gel and salts that are applied to improve the scalp conductivity and thereby record waveforms. Nowadays, ‘dry electrodes’ are also used that have improved and hastened scalp preparation.
