It is essential to rule out other neurodevelopmental disorders that can resemble WS, including:

- Fetal alcohol syndrome

- DiGeorge syndrome (deletion 22q11.2)

- Noonan syndrome

- Smith-Magenesis syndrome

- Kabuki syndrome

- Marshall syndrome

Autosomal dominant supra-valvular aortic stenosis is another condition that should be ruled out, as it is a separate disorder from WS.
