**Nasal fractures**

Nasal fractures are the most common facial fracture in adults, midface blunt trauma is the most common mechanism, and it is usually the result of road traffic accidents, sports injuries, falls, and physical fights. These injuries generally result in ipsilateral nasal bone fracture and contralateral out-fracture with septal deformation.

**Modified Murray nasal trauma classification**

- Type I: Injury confined to soft tissue

- Type IIa: Simple, unilateral nondisplaced fracture

- Type IIb: Simple, bilateral nondisplaced fracture

- Type III: simple, displaced fracture

- Type IV: closed, comminuted fracture

- Type V: complicated fracture or open comminuted fracture

**Complications**

The most common complication of nasal bone fractures is nasal deformities. Other complications include septal deviation, nasal obstruction, nasolacrimal duct obstruction with epiphora, diplopia and olfactory disturbances.

If the fracture is simple and noncomminuted, then it is frequently managed by closed reduction.
