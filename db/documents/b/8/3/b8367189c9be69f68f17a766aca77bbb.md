Deep vein thrombosis is a common occurrence in hospitalized patients. The condition has no specific signs and symptoms and to prevent the high morbidity and mortality, it is best managed by an interprofessional team that consists of a nurse practitioner, hematologist, internist, and pharmacist. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are key. Today there are many treatment options but some type of anticoagulation therapy is required. The condition is best treated by prophylaxis with unfractionated heparin or LMWH. Compression stockings and early mobility after surgery are essential. For those treated promptly, the outlook is good but the postphlebiticÂ syndrome is known to occur in a significant number of patients.
