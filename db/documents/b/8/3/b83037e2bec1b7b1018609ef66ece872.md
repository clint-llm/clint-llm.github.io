Interprofessional communication between healthcare teams is essential, especially in the management of cancer patients. Every professional has a vital role to play. Oncologists should select the treatment regimen based on the guidelines after thoroughly assessing the patient factors. For example, in hormone receptor-negative breast cancer or premenopausal patients with breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors may not be appropriate. Clinicians and nurses should be concerned enough about the adverse effects of long-term therapy with aromatase inhibitors, especially osteoporosis and hyperlipidemia. Pharmacists should evaluate the patient's medication history to prevent any drug interactions, especially with tamoxifen and warfarin. Nursing will provide patient counseling on the medication, answer patient questions, and serve as a contact point for patients and other interprofessional team members. Case management should include counseling regarding improving bone health and early initiation of bisphosphonates in the case of osteopenia. Utilizing these interprofessional strategies when using aromatase inhibitor therapy will lead to improved therapeutic patient results with fewer adverse events. [LevelÂ 5]
