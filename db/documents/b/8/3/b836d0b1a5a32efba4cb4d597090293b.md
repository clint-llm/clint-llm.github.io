An inferiority complex coupled with a coexisting fear of rejection is the quintessentialÂ constellation pattern of AVPD. Behaviorally, this manifests as widespread avoidance of social interaction, which is ultimately the salient diagnostic feature of AVPD. This intense aversion towards rejection leads to an excessive suppression of affective expression, resulting in extreme schizoid-like introversion. Often this terrible dread of rejection emanates from a repeated history of disappointing relationships in which the patient places the onus on himself/herself, thus further diminishing self-esteem. This poor self-concept is more descriptively identified as a state of malignant self-regard (MSR). MSR further exacerbates feelings of shame, personal inadequacy, alexithymia, and perfectionism, and can also be observed in masochistic, self-defeating, depressive, and vulnerable narcissistic personalities.
