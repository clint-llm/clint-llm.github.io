Antiplatelet agent administration canÂ be via oral, rectal, or intravenous routes. Oral medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, ticagrelor, cilostazol, and dipyridamole. Intravenous drugs include GpII-IIIA inhibitors and can be used for a short period, most commonly during acute coronary syndromes before or during PCI. Aspirin is available as a rectal suppository if the patient cannot take the drug orally.

Individual agent dosing is covered under the articles for each of these drugs on the Statpearls platform. The reader is advised to seek those articles out for specific dosing information.
