The surrounding musculature of the carotid arteries is clinically important. A thorough understanding of the associated anatomical relationship between the carotid vasculature and the muscles in the area may dictate surgical success. Discussion of surrounding muscles invites a description of the muscles of mastication. The four muscles of mastication include the temporalis, masseter, and medial and lateral pterygoid. These four muscles obtain their vascular supply from the facial artery and also the maxillary artery, both branches of the external carotid artery.

The adjacent temporalis muscle receives its blood supply from the temporal artery.Â Other surrounding musculature includes the sternocleidomastoid muscle, trapezius, and scalene muscles. The sternocleidomastoid muscle has a dual arterial supply from the occipital artery and superior thyroid artery, both branches of the external carotid artery.
