Evaluation with a detailed history and neurologic examination in which bilateral arm strength is impaired and bilateral cervical, facial, and leg strength is preserved are the first steps in diagnosing man in a barrel syndrome.

Neurologic examination in a patient withÂ MIBS is significant for weakness in the bilateral upper extremities and preserved strength in the bilateral neck and lower extremities.

- Depending on the location of the neurologic injury, the mental status may be normal to severely impaired.

- In patients with a central nervous system injury such as stroke or a cervical spine lesion causing MIBS, reflexes are commonly brisk, whereas, in a peripheral nervous system dysfunction causing MIBS such as multifocal motor neuropathy, myasthenia gravis, or bilateral brachial plexus injuries, reflexes are diminished or absent.

Once the clinical diagnosis of MIBS is made based on the neurologic exam, the next step is to localize the causative lesion(s).

- History may suggest the location of the injury; for example, MIBS following a cardiac arrest with prolonged time without a pulse suggests bilateral watershed strokes, whereas a recent neck injury suggests a cervical spine lesion or bilateral upper extremity injury suggests bilateral brachial plexus injury.

- Recent surgery with the traction of the arms can suggest a bilateral brachial plexopathy.
