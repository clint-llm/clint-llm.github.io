Ventricular premature complexes (VPCs), or premature ventricular complexes/contractions (PVCs), are ectopic beats that arise from within the ventricles. They are common and can occur in a wide variety of clinical scenarios and also in a diverse population. They can present in patients both with and without preexisting cardiac disease. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of PVCs and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of ventricular premature complexes.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of ventricular premature complexes.
- Review the management options available for the ventricular premature complexes.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to manage ventricular premature complexes and improve outcomes.
