**The Superficial Cerebral Venous System**

The superficial system starts with subcortical veins that drain the outer surfaces of the cortex, which drain into the pial veins sitting on the surface of the cortex. These pial veins then drain into the cerebral veins, which lie on the surface of the brain. There are many cerebral veins, but the largest three cerebral veins are the superficial middle cerebral veins that lie over the lateral sulcus, the vein of Trolard which connects the superior sagittal sinus to the middle cerebral vein, and the vein of Labbe which connects the middle cerebral vein to the lateral sinus.

The superficial cerebral veins can be divided into three collecting systems: a mediodorsal group draining into the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and the straight sinus (SS), a lateroventral group draining into the lateral sinus, and finally, an anterior group draining into the cavernous sinus. These veins connect by the great anastomotic vein of Trolard, which connects the SSS to the middle cerebral veins. The vein of Labbe connects the SSS and middle cerebral veins to the lateral sinus (LS).

The veins of the posterior fossa divide into three groups. The superior group drains into the Galenic system; the anterior group drains into the petrosal sinus, and the posterior group drains into the torcular Herophili and neighboring transverse sinuses. The cavernous sinus drains blood from the orbits, the inferior parts of the frontal and parietal lobes, and the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses. The union of the inferior sagittal sinus and the great vein of Galen forms the SS.

**Deep Cerebral Venous System**

Internal cerebral veins and the basal veins of Rosenthal drain blood from the deep white matter of the cerebral hemisphere and the basal ganglia. These two venous groups then link to form the great vein of Galen, which drains into the straight sinus.

**Function**

These two venous systems function toÂ drain deoxygenated blood with carbon dioxide and metabolic waste away from the brain, allowing oxygenated blood to take its place. They drain the brain, eyes, meninges, and part of the face through the pterygoid plexus. Additionally, the dural venous sinuses drain the cerebrospinal fluid through arachnoid granulations and allow cerebrospinal fluid to return to the bloodstream.
