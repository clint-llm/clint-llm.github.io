All team members are responsible for monitoring the patient to ensure a safe and successful perioperative experience. Every team member is involved in monitoring the patient. For instance, the anesthesia provider continuously monitors the patient's blood pressure, oxygenation, ventilation, and cardiac function. The operating room nurse may assist in monitoring safe patient positioning when placing and movingÂ the patient on the operating room table.

The surgical technicians should monitor sterile techniques that are practiced to prevent infection or breaks in sterilization. The ophthalmologist is essential for monitoring the intraocular pressure of the eye and changing operating conditions based on anatomy and progression of surgery. Every team member monitors a specific part of the surgery, which collectively increases safety to deliver excellent patient care.
