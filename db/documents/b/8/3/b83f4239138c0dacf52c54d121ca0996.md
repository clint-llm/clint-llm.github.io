Discriminating between gastric and pulmonary sources of bleeding is important. Asking the patient whether the bleeding is from vomiting or coughing can sometimes help differentiate. A pertinent history will include the amount of blood loss, onset, fevers, history of TB infection or travel to endemic areas, smoking history, cancer history, night sweats, weight loss, and history of anticoagulation use. It may be pertinent to ask the patient's exertional status (i.e., ability to climb stairs or walk distances) before the episode, which may give an idea of whether or not the patient can functionally tolerate a lobectomy if indicated.

Initial evaluation of the patient includes an assessment of the ABCs. Evaluate the patency of airway and check oropharynx for a proximal bleeding source. The bulk of the physical exam should focus on evaluating stability and ruling out any non-pulmonary source (i.e., hematemesis or epistaxis).

The exact amount of blood loss varies in the literature from 100 to 200ml, as it is extremelyÂ difficult to measure. It is important to remember that the anatomical dead space of an average adult is ~200ml. Therefore, the patient will present with distress, tachypnea, & hypoxia in the setting of an alarming amount of hemoptysis. This presentation should be enough to guide resuscitation rather than an attempt to measure and quantify blood loss.
