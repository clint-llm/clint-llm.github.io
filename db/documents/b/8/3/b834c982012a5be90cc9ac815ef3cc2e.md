A broad spectrum of disorders is associated with nodules of the thyroid, from benign to malignant conditions that may have indolent or very aggressive clinical courses.

Ionizing radiation is a known risk factor for both benign and malignant nodules of the thyroid. This population may develop thyroid nodules at a rate of 2% annually.

Other factors that lead to an increased risk of thyroid nodules and goiter include smoking, obesity, metabolic syndrome, alcohol consumption, increased levels of insulin-like growth factor-1, and uterine fibroids. Factors associated with possible decreased risk may include the use of oral contraceptives and statins.

Thyroid nodules may be classified as neoplastic and non-neoplastic. Neoplastic nodules may be benign or malignant, with benign neoplastic including non-functioning and functioning nodules. Non-neoplastic nodules include hyperplastic and inflammatory nodules.

Colloid nodules represent adenomatous benign neoplasms, are the most common thyroid nodules, and do not pose an increased risk of malignancy. While most follicular adenomas are benign, they share characteristics with follicular carcinomas.

Thyroid carcinomas may be classified as non-medullary thyroid cancers (NMTCs), arising from epithelial cells and constituting approximately 95% of all thyroid malignancies, or medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) arising from the calcitonin-producing parafollicular cells of the thyroid. Twenty percent of MTCs are familiar and may occur as part of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes.
