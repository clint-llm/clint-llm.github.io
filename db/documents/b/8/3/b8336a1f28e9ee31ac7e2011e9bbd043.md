Lobectomy is the surgical removal of the entire lobe of the lung. Dr. DaviesÂ performed the first reported lobectomy in 1913, but the patient died one week later due to a postoperative infection. With time, the surgical skills got refined, and with improvement in anesthesia technique and infection control, lobectomy became more prevalent with better outcomes. Traditionally, lobectomy has used a thoracotomy approach, but with the advent of video thoracoscope (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, VATS) has become the procedure of choice. Lobectomy is useful for varied benign and malignant lung diseases. The candidate for lobectomy should have an adequate pulmonary reserve to tolerate resection.
