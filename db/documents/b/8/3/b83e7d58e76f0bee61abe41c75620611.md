Patients should be informed that most epiretinal membranes which do not affect the vision or cause metamorphopsia are best left alone. Periodic self-assessment with Amsler grid charts would help one to assess the beginning or progression of metamorphopsia. Besides, self-monitoring monocular vision also helps to detect early central vision changes. Patients should also be made aware that surgical procedures for epiretinal membrane (ERM) are very successful in addressing visual acuity symptoms and improve quality of life. Patient education and appropriate counseling will help patients to have realistic expectations.
