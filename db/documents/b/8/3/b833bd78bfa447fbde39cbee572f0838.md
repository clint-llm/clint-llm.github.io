A transfusion is defined as an infusion of whole blood or any one of its components. Transfusions like any other medical intervention have benefits and risks. Hemolytic transfusion reactions are one of the possible complications from transfusions. Hemolysis is described as rupture of red blood cells and leakage of their contents. The site of hemolysis can be intravascular (in circulation) or extravascular (in reticuloendothelial system). Hemolytic transfusion reactions can be immune or non-immune mediated.

Immune hemolytic transfusions reactions occur due to mismatch or incompatibility of the patient with the donor products. Immune hemolytic transfusion reactions are divided into acute versus delayed hemolytic reactions. Acute hemolytic reactions happen within 24 hours of transfusion and delayed hemolytic reactions happen after 24 hours. Delayed reactions usually occur two weeks after but can go up to 30 days post transfusion. The severity of the hemolytic reaction is dependent on the type and quantity of antigens, alloantibodies and ability to bind to complement.

Non-immune hemolysis can be due to thermal, osmotic, mechanical injury to red blood cells or other blood products. Human or machine error cause these forms of hemolysis.

Hemolytic transfusion reactions, in general, occur most often after transfusion of packed red blood cells but they can also occur after transfusion of other blood products.
