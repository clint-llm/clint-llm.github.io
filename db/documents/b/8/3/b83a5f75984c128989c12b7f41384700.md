Histologically, IgA nephropathy is characterized by the following:

- The diffuse proliferation of mesangial cells and matrix

- Hypercellular or normal glomeruli with diffuse necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis

- Mesangial involvement resembling focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis

- Immunofluorescence will reveal a diffuse granular pattern of IgA deposits in the mesangium

**Light Microscopy**

The most commonly seen light microscopy findings are focal or diffuse mesangial proliferation and expansion of the extracellular matrix.

**Electron Microscopy**

Electron microscopy reveals mesangial hypercellularity and excess mesangial matrix. An important finding is the presence of mesangial electron-dense deposits of IgA; however, subepithelial and subendothelial deposits of the glomerular capillary wall are seen in a minority of patients, particularly those with the more severe form of the disease.

**Immunofluorescence**

Immunofluorescence reveals mesangial IgA deposits in a diffuse granular pattern. These deposits are majorly polymeric IgA of the IgA1 subclass. Additionally, IgG is found in 43% of patients and IgM in 54%.
