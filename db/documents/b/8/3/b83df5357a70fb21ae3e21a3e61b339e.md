Solitary CHRPE and GPR are most likely to be identified by an eye care professional, such as an optometrist or ophthalmologist. Especially in suspicious cases where a second opinion is needed, the two professions work together in patient diagnosis and management.

In addition, PO-FLs require interprofessional management between the patient's eye care professional and gastroenterologist. It is the responsibility of the eye care professional to ensure that the patient receives an appropriate, timely referral and evaluation to improve the patient's outcome best.
