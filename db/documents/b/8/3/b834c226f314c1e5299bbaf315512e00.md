The tunica albuginea a fibro-elastic connective tissue, surrounding each of the corpus cavernosum and the corpus spongiosum, facilitates penile rigidity during erection. Peyronie's disease can lead to the development of plaques in this layer and disrupt the natural ability of tunica albuginea to perform its function.

The Bartholin glands in females are within the superficial perineal space. These glands secrete a fluid that lubricates the vagina. In normal circumstances, the Bartholin glands are not visible, but if the glands are blocked, they can swell and present as a fluid-filled cyst. If the fluid gets infected, a condition known as bartholinitis occurs, which can lead to the development of an abscess. The diagnosis requires a pelvic exam, and the treatment is incision and drainage with marsupialization. Unfortunately, a simple incision and drainage are associated with recurrences.
