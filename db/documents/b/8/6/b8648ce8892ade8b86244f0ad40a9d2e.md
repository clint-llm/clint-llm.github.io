- **Allergic Reactions:**33% of patients can present with an allergic reaction to the drug. It often presents with a rash that heals on stopping the drug. The patient should stop the medication if the patient presents with fever, arthralgia, and lymphadenopathy.

- **Pulmonary:**Patients presenting with dyspnea should undergo a pulmonary function test. It also is associated with obliterative bronchiolitis.

- **Dermatologic:**Patients can present with a drug-induced lupus-like rash and other dermatologic changes. It also has been associated with pemphigus

- **Gastrointestinal:**Patients can present with multiple gastrointestinal side effects such as taste alteration, oral ulceration, and gingivostomatitis. These may require discontinuation of the drug based on severity.

- **Renal:**Penicillamine has shown correlations with multiple renal side effects such as Goodpasture syndrome, proteinuria, and hematuria. Proper renal function tests should be done in patients experiencing such complaints or having risk factors.

- **Hepatic:**Periodic liver function tests should also be done as penicillamine correlates with intrahepatic cholestasis, hepatitis, and increased alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels.

The drug should be used with caution in the elderly as they are more at risk of developing a skin rash and gastrointestinal side effects.
