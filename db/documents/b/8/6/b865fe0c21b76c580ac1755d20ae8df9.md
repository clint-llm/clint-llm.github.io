Patients using H2RAs should be monitored for endoscopic improvement and decreased gastric symptoms to assess the clinical effectiveness and need for therapy adjustments. Patients should also be monitored for adverse effects and possible drug interactions, especially when taking cimetidine.

H2RAs are eliminated by a combination of hepatic and renal metabolism. Famotidine and nizatidine require dose adjustment for patients with a creatine clearance of less than 50 mL/min, while cimetidine doses should be reduced for patients with a creatine clearance of less than 30 mL/min. The half-life of cimetidine may become prolonged in patients with hepatic impairment, but for all H2RAs, no dose adjustments are required for hepatic impairment unless also accompanied by renal impairment.

Rarely, QT-prolongation or central nervous system effects have been observed in patients with impaired renal function whose dose was not properly adjusted. Famotidine use requires caution during renal impairment and in combination with other QT-prolonging medications or conditions. Elderly patients should also be monitored for central nervous system side effects such as dizziness or confusion that may result from decreased drug clearance.
