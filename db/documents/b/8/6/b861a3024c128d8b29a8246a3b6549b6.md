Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), BCR-ABL1-positive, is classified as a myeloproliferative neoplasm predominantly composed of proliferating granulocytes and determined to have the Philadelphia chromosome/translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11.2). CML affects both the peripheral blood and the bone marrow. There is an increased incidence of CML among atomic bomb survivors; however, the predisposing risk factors are unknown. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and explains the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of chronic myeloid leukemia.
- Explain the common laboratory findings associated with chronic myeloid leukemia.
- Describe the management considerations for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team members to enhance care delivery for patients affected by chronic myeloid leukemia.
