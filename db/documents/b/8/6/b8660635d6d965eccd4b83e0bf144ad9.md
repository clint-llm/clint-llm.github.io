A neurologist often diagnoses the condition and further evaluates for neuropathy. An interprofessional team that includes a neurologist, neurosurgeon, physical therapist, hand surgeon, nurse practitioner, and specially trained nursing staff should be involved in further managing this condition. The specific management depends upon the underlying cause if present. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and extensive rehabilitation with strength training are necessary for all individuals to ensure good clinical outcomes. Interprofessional sharing of information and collaborative effort in diagnosis and treatment will bring about optimal patient outcomes. [Level 5]
