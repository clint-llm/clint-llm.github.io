Patients must be educated to practice good hand hygiene, keep the catheter sites clean, monitor for erythema around those sites, and alert their doctors if they feel ill or spiking fevers. Patients should also be aware of the duration that catheters and prosthetic devices have been in place and make sure providers note them down, too.
