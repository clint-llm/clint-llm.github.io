Angioplasty is performed to treat atherosclerotic disease and its resultant complications such as myocardial infarction, strokes, renal failure, and limb ischemia. Radial and femoral are the two common arterial approaches utilized for angioplasty. The main indications for angioplasty include coronary artery disease and peripheral arterial disease. Following angioplasty, stents are often placed to relieve obstructive stenosis. This activity reviews the types of stents typically used in common practice, indications, contraindications, equipment, techniques, personnel, tools, and devices used for angioplasty and percutaneous intervention. It also emphasizes the role of the interprofessional team to optimize procedural outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the equipment used to treat atherosclerotic disease.
- Identify the indications for angioplasty and stent placement.
- Review the various approaches used for angioplasty and their associated complications.
