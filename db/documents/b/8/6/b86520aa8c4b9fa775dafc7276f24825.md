In patients with surgically resectable disease, chest wall resection has been shown to have favorable results. In their study of full thickness chest wall resection for recurrent breast cancer, Toi et al. reported a 5-year survival rate of 47%

If the patient is not initially resectable, chemotherapy, radiation, or the combination of chemoradiation may be used to attempt to shrink the tumor so that it is resectable. If the patient still cannot undergo surgery, then they likely will have less favorable outcomes. Notably, it has been shown that gross disease at the time of radiation therapy is associated with a lower 5-year local control rate (63%) and survival rate (34%) compared to patients without residual disease after resection and systemic therapy (81% and 62%, respectively)
