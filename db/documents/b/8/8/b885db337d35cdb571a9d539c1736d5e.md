**Somogyi Phenomenon vs. Dawn Phenomenon**

A phenomenon known as the dawn phenomenon was introduced by Dr. Schimdt in the 1980s, stating that morning hyperglycemia is due to the decreased levels of endogenous insulin secreted at night.

The Somogyi phenomenon states that early morning hyperglycemia occurs due to a rebound effect from late-night hypoglycemia. However, the dawn phenomenon does not include hypoglycemic episodes to be a factor.

**Insulin Release and Insulin Resistance**

With recent studies attributing early morning hyperglycemia to hypoinsulinemia, there is an observable pattern in which the body secretes insulin. The theory is insulin gets secreted in a circadian pattern, with the lowest concentrations between midnight and 6 AM and the highest concentrations between noon and 6 PM.

The Somogyi phenomenon has been a proposed phenomenon in insulin-dependent diabetic patients. The thinking is that these patients should monitor their blood glucose levels and adjust insulin dosages as necessary to prevent hypo- or hyperglycemic episodes.

In an individual that does not have diabetes, the blood glucose and insulin concentrations stay flat and constant throughout the night, with a transient increase in insulin just before dawn to prevent hepatic glucose production through gluconeogenesis and prevent hyperglycemia.

Insulin resistance, seen in diabetes or metabolic syndrome, has been associated with constant exposure to high insulin levels.
