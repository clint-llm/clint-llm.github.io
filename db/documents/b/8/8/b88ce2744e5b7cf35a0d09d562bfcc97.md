A patient seeking care in the emergency department should have a chemistry panel done to rule out hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, uremia, and drug intoxication. Emergency neuroimaging is recommended for patients with suspected serious brain lesions, persistent neurological deficits, recent trauma, and headache. Computed tomography (CT) is the first imaging modality of choice in the emergency department. Advanced imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) needs to be done, if high suspicion of focal abnormality, despite a negative CT scan.
