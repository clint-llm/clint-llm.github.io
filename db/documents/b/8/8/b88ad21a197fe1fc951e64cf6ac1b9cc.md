Aducanumab is available as a clear to opalescent and colorless to yellow solution currently available in single-dose vials for intravenous (IV) infusion administration. Based on the subject's body weight per kilogram (kg), aducanumab should be diluted with 100 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride injection before administration as an infusion. It is also recommended the diluted agent solution be settled at room temperature before starting therapy and should be administered without delays. Unused diluted portions after administration of aducanumab should be discarded.

**Available Single Dosages Vials**

- 170 mg/1.7 mL (100 mg/mL)

- 300 mg/3 mL (100 mg/mL)

The dosing should be titrated, reaching 10 mg/kg by the seventh infusion. The IV infusion should be administered every four weeks with a minimum of 21 days between infusions. The infusion should be given over a 1-hour time frame.

**Dosing Schedule**

The regimen for aducanumab is titrated upward over time.

- First infusion (1 mg/kg)

- Second infusion (1 mg/kg)

- Third infusion (3 mg/kg)

- Fourth infusion (3 mg/kg)

- Fifth infusion (6 mg/kg)

- Sixth infusion (6 mg/kg)

- Seventh infusion onwards (10 mg/kg)

Missed dose analyses have yet to be studied. Subjects who have missed a dosage of aducanumab are recommended to continue the next dose immediately at the dosage given at the previous infusion. For subjects who have missed three or more infusions and are expected to continue management with aducanumab, infusion dosage should be re-initiated at a dose one step lower than the one administered previously. Continued treatment following the dosing titration schedule is recommended.
