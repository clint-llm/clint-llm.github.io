The etiology of cystic fibrosis-associated liver disease has been attributed to an alteration in hydration and alkalinity of the bile composition due to mutation of the CFTR gene expressed in the cholangiocytes that regulate transmembrane chloride exchange. Approximately 2000 CFTR mutations classified into five different groups based on the involved functional defect (Class I: Defective protein production; class II: Defective protein processing; class III: defective gating of the channel; class IV: decreased chloride conductance; class V: Decreased protein synthesis) have been identified in patients with CF with the most common mutation being the deletion of a phenylalanine residue at position 508 (F508del) on chromosome 7 which is a class II mutation seen in 80% to 90% patients with CF.
