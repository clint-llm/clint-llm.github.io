The esophageal wall consists of four layers: a mucosa, a submucosa, a muscularis propria, and an adventitia. The mucosa is the innermost layer that lines the esophageal lumen. It starts with a mucous membrane comprised of stratified squamous epithelium similar to that of skin. A thin layer of connective tissue called the lamina propria follows the mucous membrane. Finally, a muscularis mucosa made primarily of irregularly arranged smooth muscles forms the deepest part of the mucosa.Â The next layer lying beneath the mucosa is the submucosa, comprised predominantly of blood vessels, small mucous glands, and connective tissue. It also contains a nerve plexus called the submucosal or Meissner's plexus. Underneath the submucosa lies the muscularis propria, which is more complicated than the previous layers. The muscularis propria, also called the muscularis externa, includes an inner circumferential and an outer longitudinal layer, which can be variably composed of striated or smooth muscle. Striated muscles predominate in the proximal esophagus, while smooth muscles predominate in the distal esophagus. A transition zone consisting of both muscle types lies in between the proximal and distal ends. The muscular layer also contains an additional nerve plexus called the myenteric or Auerbach's plexus. The final outermost layer is the adventitia, which is an external fibrous layer that connects the esophagus to other external structures.
