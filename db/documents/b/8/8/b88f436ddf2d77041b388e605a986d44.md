The vertebral column consists of 33 bones (7 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral, and one coccyx) that are connected and function together to give structural support to humans as well as protect neurons as they carry information to and from the brain. The embryological development of the vertebrae is complex, but it is vital to understand as errors in development can result in many congenital abnormalities.
