A giant cell tumor of bone is composed of elongated, oval, or polygonal mononuclear cells with a typical uniform distribution. They are often a low-grade tumor even when they appear aggressive on imaging. When there is a lung metastasis, the histology is the same as the primary tumor, and they have an excellent prognosis.

Interestingly, the development of metastasis and locally aggressive behavior is not well predicted by histological grading. Unless it is associated with malignant transformation, there are no malignant cytologic features. Differential diagnosis tends to be broad as it is challenging to interpret histologically.

H3F3A is found up to 96% of long bone cases and thus can be used to differentiate GCTB from other entities.

**Diagnosis:**When establishing a diagnosis of GCTB, even with a high degree of suspicion, a biopsy is required to confirm the diagnosis; this is true for any other bone tumor, as suspicious lesions require a thorough evaluation for malignancy. Imaged guided biopsy with ultrasound or CT is the most agreed upon method.
