Echocardiography is one of the most commonly used, non-invasive method for looking at cardiac anatomy. Echocardiography is used to provide thin cross-sections of cardiac structures, this includes; left and right atrium, left and right ventricles, valves, and associated valvular structures.

There are four standard views of the heart chambers that are evaluated when using TTE; these include parasternal long axis, parasternal short axis, apical four-chamber, and subxiphoid. The parasternal long-axis view is obtained by placing the probe left of the sternum at the 4th intercostal space perpendicular to the chest wall. As the heart is rotated left in the chest, the initial chamber visualized is the right ventricular; however, views of the left ventricle left atrium, and aortic outflow tract is also obtained, as well as their associated valves, which include the mitral valve, tricuspid, and aortic valve.

The parasternal short axis view is obtained by positioning the probe 90 degrees from the long axis view. The short axis will obtain a cross-section of the left ventricle, which is useful in assessing left ventricular wall function, as well as it's associated papillary muscles; additionally, a cross-section of the right ventricle can also be visualized.
