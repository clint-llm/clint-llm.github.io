The screening workup should include:

- Newborn screening programs check for 21-hydroxylase deficiency

- 17-hydroxyprogesterone will be very high (usually greater than 1000 ng/dL) in a patient with the classic form

- Hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, low aldosterone, and high plasma renin activity (PRA), particularly the ratio of PRA to aldosterone, are markers of impaired mineralocorticoid synthesis

- An ACTH stimulation test should be performed to evaluate adrenal function and differentiate among the various potential enzymatic defects. Administration of 0.25 mg of cosyntropin (a synthetic ACTH) provides a pharmacologic stimulus to the adrenal glands, maximizing hormone secretion.

- A full adrenal profile, including measurement of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), cortisol, deoxycorticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, 17-hydroxypregnenolone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and androstenedione, should be obtained immediately before and 60 minutes after cosyntropin administration.

- Nomograms are available for interpreting the results

- In an infant with ambiguous genitalia, do karyotype to establish the chromosomal sex

- The pelvic ultrasound should be done to check for uterus or associated renal anomalies

- A bone age study is helpful in patients with precocious pubic hair

- In patients with signs of acute adrenal failure, CT of the adrenal glands can be done to exclude adrenal hemorrhage

- Urogenitography for defining the anatomy of the internal genitalia
