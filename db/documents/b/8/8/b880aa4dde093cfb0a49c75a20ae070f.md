The splanchnic nerves can be broken down into five different categories which include, cardiopulmonary nerves, thoracic splanchnic nerves (greater, lesser and least), lumbar splanchnic nerves, sacral splanchnic nerve, and the pelvic splanchnic nerves.

**Greater Splanchnic Nerve:**

The greater splanchnic nerve occurs bilaterally andÂ carries both afferent and efferent fibers.

**Lumbar Splanchnic Nerve:**

The lumbar splanchnic nerves arise from the sympathetic trunk and join the coeliac, inferior mesenteric, and superior hypogastric plexuses.

**Pelvic Splanchnic Nerve:**

The pelvis receives both sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation from the branches of the splanchnic nerves. The sympathetic innervation comes from roots T12 to L2, referred to as the sacral splanchnic nerves. The parasympathetic component arises from roots S2 to S4 and is most commonly known as the pelvic splanchnic nerve.
