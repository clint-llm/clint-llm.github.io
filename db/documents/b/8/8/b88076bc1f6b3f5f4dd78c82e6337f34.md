Management of drug overdose requires an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals, including pharmacists, nurses, laboratory technologists, and several physicians in different specialties. Absent proper management, morbidity and mortality from methyldopa overdose are high. Therefore, the moment the triage nurse has admitted a patient with methyldopa overdose, the emergency department clinician is responsible for coordinating the care, which includes the following:

- Ordering drug level testing in the blood and/or urine.

- Monitor the patient for signs and symptoms of jaundice, fever, drowsiness or sedation, and other preexisting disorders.

- The pharmacist should check the medication record to verify dosing and administration were correct.

- Nursing should review the medicine administration record to ensure there were no administration errors.

- Performing various maneuvers to help limit the absorption of the drug in the body.

- Consult with the pharmacist about the use of activated charcoal. [Level 1]

- Obtain a consult with a toxicologist and nephrologist on further management, which may include dialysis.

- Consult with the radiologist about imaging tests to ensure that the patient has not swallowed any drug packages.

- Consultation with the intensivist about ICU care and monitoring while in hospital.

The management of methyldopa overdose does not stop in the emergency department. Following patient stabilization, one has to determine how and why the patient overdosed. Consult with a mental health counselor if this was an intentional act and assess risk factors for-self harm. Only by functioning as an interprofessional team can the morbidity of methyldopa overdose be decreased. The long-term outcomes for drug therapy include prescribing better-tolerated drugs within a therapeutic range. [Level 2]

Patients should understand the importance of informing clinicians of existing or contemplated concomitant therapy or concurrent diseases. The importance of informing clinicians about a current or planned pregnancy plays a vital role in improving outcomes.Â With an interprofessional team approach to methyldopa therapy, successful results with minimal adverse events are achievable.
