Euphorbia tirucalli and certain other Euphorbia species contain a white latex that is among the most irritating plant substances described. Exposure to the sap can cause severe consequences in humans, most significantly following ocular contact, leading to blindness if left untreated. Due to their widespread proximity to humans worldwide, healthcare providers must recognize the risk associated with these plants and their toxic latex, particularly those working in acute settings such as primary care, urgent care, and emergency rooms. Early treatment is crucial in preventing adverse outcomes, including secondary bacterial infection and blindness.
