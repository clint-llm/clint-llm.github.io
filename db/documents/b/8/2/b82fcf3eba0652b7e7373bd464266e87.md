There are several pitfalls in the evaluation of trauma patients that should be avoided if at all possible. If a patient has a clinical deterioration during the trauma evaluation, do not continue with the next step in the evaluation. Immediately go back to the ABCDE evaluation of the patient as this is most likely to identify a life-threatening condition. Similarly, do not be distracted by obvious injuries such as burns, open extremity fractures, or penetrating injuries and, therefore, not follow the sequence of ABCDE evaluation. Another pitfall to avoid is not to send the hemodynamically unstable patient away from the resuscitation area to obtain testing, such as X-rays or CT scans. Further, do not delay transfer to definitive care, if not at the highest level of care, to obtain tests or perform unnecessary procedures. Once the identification of the need to transfer to a higher level of care is identified, the transfer process should be initiated.
