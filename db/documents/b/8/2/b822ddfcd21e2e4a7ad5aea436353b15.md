In contact hypersensitivity, there are mononuclear cells infiltrates present in both dermis and epidermis. The last one is pushed outward, and a microvesicle forms within it as a consequence of the edema developed. In tuberculin-type sensitivity histologically, there is a dense dermal infiltrate of leukocytes visualized with hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) stain. There is also marked caseation and necrosis within the granuloma. In granulomatous-type hypersensitivity, histology shows a typical epithelioid-cell granuloma. Also, giant cells are visible in the center of the lesion, which is surrounded by a cuff of lymphocytes. The reaction is due to the persistence of the mycobacterial antigen. Mature tissue macrophages can surround the granuloma and are visualized by antibody staining techniques.
