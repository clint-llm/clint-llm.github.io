Currently, there are three proposed theories to explain the formation of tender-points and their treatment via strain counterstrain: proprioceptive theory, local inflammatory circulatory effects, and ligamento-muscular reflex.

The proprioceptive theory is the most common explanation for SCS effectiveness.

The shortened muscle can also limit the joint and range of motion.

Quantifiable studies have shown that symptomatic individuals with tender-points: (1) felt tender at lower electrical thresholds, (2) had reduced stretch reflex amplitudes when treated with SCS, and (3) experienced reduced pain and improved range of motion after SCS.

Local inflammatory and circulation effects appear to be another cause of the effectiveness of strain counterstrain and FPR. Repositioning an individual can increase circulation to that area, help with nutrients and waste removal, decrease swelling, and ameliorate tender-point pain caused by ischemia.

The least studied explanation for SCS and facilitated positional release (FPR) effectiveness is the ligamento-muscular reflex. Ligamento-muscular reflex is defined by the contraction/relaxation of muscles in response to the ligament mechanoreceptors to prevent ligament damage.
