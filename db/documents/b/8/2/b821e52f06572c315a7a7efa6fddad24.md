The epidemiology of anasarca is not well studied as it is a common complaint among the patients with various different medical conditions. Anasarca is noted in higher frequency in patients with organ dysfunction as well in post-operative patients. In a study of 241 patients who underwent major abdominal surgery, around 29% of patients developed postoperative anasarca.
