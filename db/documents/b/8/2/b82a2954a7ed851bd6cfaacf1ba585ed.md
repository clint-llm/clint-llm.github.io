Most patients exposed to organophosphates come into contact with insecticides. The first organophosphate insecticide was created in the mid-1800s but was not widely used until after World War II. Organophosphates are used as medications, insecticides, and nerve agents as a weapon. Symptoms include increased saliva and tear production, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, small pupils, sweating, muscle tremors, and confusion. The onset of symptoms is often within minutes, and it can take weeks to disappear. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of organophosphate toxicity and the role of the interprofessional team in managing this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe common uses of organophosphates.
- Discuss the signs and symptoms of organophosphate toxicity
- Outline the evaluation of a patient with suspected organophosphate toxicity.
- Summarize the evaluation and treatment of organophosphate toxicity and the role of the interprofessional team in managing this condition.
