Operative vaginal delivery is used to expedite vaginal delivery for either maternal or fetal indication. Options for operative delivery include both vacuum-assisted and forceps deliveries. Indications for operative delivery include maternal exhaustion, a non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracing, a prolonged second stage of labor, or a need to shorten the second stage of labor due to particular maternal conditions such as cardiovascular or neurological disease. Vacuum delivery is discouraged when delivering a fetus that is less than 34 weeks. This activity describes the indications, contraindications, and methodology of vacuum extraction and highlights the interprofessional team's role in the management of labor and delivery.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for vacuum extraction.
- Describe the technique for performing vacuum extraction.
- Review the complications of vacuum extraction.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the safe and appropriate use of vacuum extraction.
