The primary movements of the PRUJ are pronation and supination, which occur in conjunction with the distal radioulnar joint.

The primary pronators of the forearm are the pronator teres and the pronator quadratus.

The biceps brachii and supinator muscles are the primary supinators of the forearm. The biceps brachii covers two joints with the long head and short head originating from the supraglenoid tubercle and coracoid process, respectively. The heads then insert onto the anterior capsule and theÂ medial portion of the radial tuberosity through the bicipital aponeurosis and distal biceps tendon, respectively.
