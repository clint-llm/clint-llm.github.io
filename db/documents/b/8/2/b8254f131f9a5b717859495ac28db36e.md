Carbidopa is indicated for combination use with levodopa (L-dopa) for the treatment of motor symptoms encountered in Parkinson disease (PD), post-encephalitic parkinsonism, and parkinsonism symptoms resulting from intoxication by carbon monoxide or manganese. This activity reviews the indications, mechanism of action, and contraindications for carbidopa as a valuable agent in managing PD symptoms. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors pertinent to interprofessional team members in managing patients with PD and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
