Dexamethasone is a potent glucocorticoid with very little if any, mineralocorticoid activity.

COVID-19 produces a hyperinflammatory state. Hence therapeutic effectiveness of dexamethasone is likely due to the broad anti-inflammatory activities of glucocorticoids.

**Pharmacokinetics:**According to the manufacturer's labeling, the pharmacokinetics of oral dexamethasone is dose-proportional between the dose range of 0.5 to 40 mg.****

- Absorption: Dexamethasone median time to peak concentrations (Tmax) is 1 hour (range: 0.5 to 4 hours). A high-fat, high-calorie diet decreased C max by 23% of a single 20 mg dose of dexamethasone.

- Distribution: Dexamethasone is about 77% bound to human plasma proteins in vitro.

- Elimination: The mean terminal half-life of dexamethasone is 4 hours (18%), and oral clearance is 15.7 L/hr following a single dose of dexamethasone.

- Metabolism: Dexamethasone is metabolized by CYP3A4.

- Excretion: Renal excretion of dexamethasone is less than 10% of total body clearance. Less than 10% of dexamethasone is excreted in the urine.
