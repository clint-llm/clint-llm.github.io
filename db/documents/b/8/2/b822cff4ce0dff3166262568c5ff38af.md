The patient's distal flow to posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis should be assessed. If the pulses are not palpable, a doppler should to used for identification. Patients should be discharged on a statin, along with aspirin and/or clopidogrel. If they have a synthetic conduit, dual therapy should be considered. Follow-up should include periodic evaluations of symptoms, pedal pulses, and the ankle-brachial index. Duplex ultrasound is the best non-invasive technique to assess graft patency.
