WS is a difficult condition to manage, and its management is best done by an interprofessional team to deal with all the complications. Consider the impact of WS on psychosocial functioning and quality-of-life and remember that it may be accompanied by psychiatric disorders. The dermatologist, psychiatrist, ophthalmologist, nuerologists and rheumatologist need to work as a team while treating such patients. Dermatology specialty-trained nurses can also help by counseling the patient, providing direction on medical management, and monitoring and charting for any complication. Close communication between interprofessional team members is vital to improve the outcomes.
