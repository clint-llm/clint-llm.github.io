Patients taking selegiline should receive education about the risks associated with the medication usage and specific symptoms they can self-monitor. Prescribers do not have the luxury of continuous monitoring; therefore, patient awareness is crucial for medication safety. The importance of close monitoring increases when initiating the medication or when the dosage is adjusted.

- Blood pressure requires monitoring in patients taking selegiline to decrease falls associated with orthostatic hypotension and prevent hypertensive crisis and long-term effects of elevated blood pressure.

- Patients require monitoring for symptoms of Parkinsonism and serotonin syndrome.

- Box warnings exist for the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior, especially in younger adults. Behavior, mood, and suicidality need assessment in patients taking selegiline to prevent psychiatric disturbances and death.

- Periodic skin examinations are warranted, especially in patients using the transdermal form of selegiline.
