Medication-assisted treatment represents an effective option for the treatment of heroin dependence and opioid use disorder in general. Buprenorphine and methadone are the chief agents used, with buprenorphine being more safe and effective. Buprenorphine also has a higher affinity for the mu-opioid receptors than does heroin.
