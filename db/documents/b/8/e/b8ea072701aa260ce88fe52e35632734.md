Foster Kennedy syndrome forms due to intracranial space-occupying lesions (ICSOL), especially those in the anterior cranial fossa. The presence of the ICSOL causes an increase in intracranial pressure and direct compression of the nerve, which results in ipsilateral optic atrophy due to the death of nerve fibers, considering that the nerve fiber swelling is usually not noticed in the limited fibers remaining after the damage.

The increased intracranial pressure causes the swelling of the optic disc of the contralateral eye, which still has enough nerve fibers that make swelling evident. The anosmia is a result of the ICSOL compressing the olfactory nerve.
