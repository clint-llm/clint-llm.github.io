The pathophysiology of PSS remains unclear. PSS appears to fall into the spectrum of acute uveitic conditions with possible involvement of the trabecular meshwork. With CMV infection of the anterior chamber, possible mechanisms of elevated IOP include

- Trabeculitis,

- Trabecular outflow obstruction by chronic inflammatory cells and pigments, and

- Eventual peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) with evolution to secondary angle closure.****

AroundÂ 26% to 52% of PSS patients may show the presence of CMV DNA in the aqueous.****Polymorphism of both classical and nonclassical HLA types has been observed with PSS.

Hirose, Ohno, and Matsuda noted the presence of HLA-Bw54 in 9 (41%) of 22 Japanese patients with PSS.
