Clinical signs of inflammation can be seen on examination of the hand, such as edema, erythema, pain, and reduced range of movement. Scars and contractures on the dorsum of the hand are more likely to cause a restriction in flexion, whereas injury on the volar side causes a restriction in extension. Differences between active and passive movements can help to differentiate between a joint versus a musculotendinous cause of the joint stiffness. If the active and passive motion is the same, it’s more likely to be the joint itself restricting movement; if the passive movement is greater than the active movement, movement is likely to be restricted due to a musculotendinous reason.

Hand stiffness can usually be successfully evaluated through history and physical examination alone. Further evaluation of the hand stiffness may be indicated with plain radiographs, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, CT, ultrasound, and nerve conduction studies if required.
