White-centered retinal hemorrhages, also known as Roth spots, are retinal hemorrhages that can be seen in a variety of medical conditions. Roth spots are most commonly associated with infective endocarditis and have been detected in 80 percent of cases of subacute bacterial endocarditis. They are also seen in association with conditions including leukemia, anemia, hypertensive retinopathy, preeclampsia, diabetic retinopathy, and anoxia. This activity describes the evaluation and management of Roth spots and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the appearance and clinical significance of Roth spots. 
- Identify additional evaluations that should be done for patients that present with Roth spots. 
- Identify treatment considerations for patients with Roth spots. 
- Describe the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team members to identify Roth spots with their common associating diseases and provide treatment of the underlying condition which will enhance the delivery of care.
