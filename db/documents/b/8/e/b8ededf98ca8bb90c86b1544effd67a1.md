Patients should be kept calm in a controlled environment to try to reduce the risks of progression from mild symptoms to hallucinations. With mild to moderate symptoms, patients should receive supportive therapy in the form of intravenous rehydration, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and have comorbid conditions as listed above ruled out. Due to the risk of a comorbid condition called Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, patients can also receive a “banana bag” or cocktail of folate, thiamine, dextrose containing fluids, and a multivitamin.

The hallmark of management for severe symptoms is the administration of long-acting benzodiazepines. The most commonly used benzodiazepines are intravenous diazepam or intravenous lorazepam for management. Patients with severe withdrawal symptoms may require escalating doses and intensive care level monitoring. Early consultation with a toxicologist is recommended to assist with aggressive management as these patients may require benzodiazepine doses at a level higher than the practitioner is comfortable with to manage their symptoms.

While patients with mild symptoms can be managed as outpatients, the following patients should be admitted:

- Absence of support systems

- Abnormal laboratory results

- High risk of Delirium tremens

- History of withdrawal seizures

- Concomitant psychiatric problems

- Abuse of other substances

- Suicidal ideations

Withdrawal seizures can typically be managed with benzodiazepines but may require adjunct therapy with phenytoin, barbiturates, and may even require intubation and sedation with propofol, ketamine, or in the most severe cases, dexmedetomidine.

Oral chlordiazepoxide and oxazepam are very commonly used for the prevention of withdrawal symptoms. Other drugs often used to manage symptoms include neuroleptics, anticonvulsants like carbamazepine, and valproic acid.

Propofol is used to manage refractory cases of delirium tremens, and baclofen can be used to treat muscle spasms.

Toxic alcohol co-ingestion should be managed with the assistance of a toxicologist.
