There are four different patterns of intrahepatic cholestasis, namely

- **Cytoplasmic cholestasis:**fine yellow pigment (bile) filling the cytoplasm of hepatic cells.

- **Canalicular cholestasis**: Bile found in the canaliculi.

- **Ductular cholestasis:**Accumulation of bile in the periportal bile ductules of Hering. Ductular cholestasis is associated with severe obstruction and sepsis.

- **Ductal cholestasis:**Demonstrates the presence of bile casts in portal bile ducts.

The histopathological changes of excess bile appear to result from the detergent effect of retained bile acids.
