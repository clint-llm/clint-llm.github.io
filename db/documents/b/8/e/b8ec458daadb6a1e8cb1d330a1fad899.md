The primary factors contributing to hypertension in the elderly population are changes in arterial and arteriolar stiffness, with large artery stiffness occurring due to arteriosclerosis calcification and structural alterations. Notably, structural changes in large arteries observed in systolic hypertension are similar to those resulting from aging, making it difficult to differentiate between arterial changes due to disease and those due to aging.

**Arterial Stiffening**

Stiffening of the arteries is one of the hallmarks of aging. In younger individuals, the peripheral arterial system is more rigid than the central arterial system. With time, this finding reverses, and older individuals have greater central artery stiffness compared to peripheral arteries. This reversal and increased stiffening of the larger central arteries is multifactorial in etiology. Changes in structural components, increased reactive oxygen species, inflammatory changes, and endothelial dysfunction are among the causes of the changes in arterial structure and function seen with aging.

**Increased Elastin Degradation and Collagen Deposition**

The ratio of collagen to elastin increases with age leading to an increase in arterial stiffness. This change may also be present in ventricular smooth muscle cells. In the ventricular wall, a decrease in elastin results in a less compliant heart wall, leading to an increase in diastolic filling pressure. There are many hypotheses for why this change occurs in older populations, including material fatigue and various signaling pathways leading to the destruction of elastin and increased collagen deposition. Recent studies have shown that angiotensin II, along with the activation of TGF-B1 and matrix metalloproteinases are some of the signaling molecules that may be involved.

**Inflammatory Mediators**

An increase in the levels of inflammatory mediators seen with aging leads to the production of reactive oxygen species, which may lead to endothelial damage predisposing the vascular system to atherosclerosis.

**Reduced Left Ventricular Compliance**

A decrease in left ventricular compliance and cardiac reserve is widely seen throughout the aging population. Factors affecting left ventricular function include preload, afterload, and contractility. With age, cardiac myocytes tend to hypertrophy and decrease in number. The left ventricle becomes stiffer and, therefore, its compliance decreases. Ventricular stiffening results from many processes, including alteration in structural proteins, an increase in inflammatory mediators, and increases in glycation end products. Another notable change to the left ventricle is prolonged isovolumetric relaxation time. This increase in relaxation time is associated with alterations in calcium signaling. Healthy, older adult hearts have less cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase resulting in lower calcium content. This causes an increased dependency on L-type calcium channels, which explains the efficacy of hypertensive medications used to block these channels.

With aging, there is a decrease in chronotropic, lusitropic, and inotropic responses. A reduced response to atropine due to increased parasympathetic vagal tone and decreased sympathetic tone is a typical finding. These changes may be a direct result of suppressed cAMP production, decreased beta-receptor function and number, and increased G protein activity. Due to these changes, older adults present with elevated production and levels of circulating catecholamines and stress-stimulated levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine.

Other pathophysiologic factors contributing to increased blood pressure with aging include decreased baroreceptor sensitivity, increased responsiveness to SNS stimuli, altered renal and sodium metabolism, and altered renin-aldosterone relationship.

Previously, increasing BP was thought to be unavoidable as we age. However, this is not the case for the elderly in secluded communities and rural, underdeveloped areas. A high salt diet in developed regions of the world is believed to induce vascular smooth muscle cell changes, leading to collagen accumulation in large artery walls and increased arterial stiffness.

**Postprandial Hypotension**

Postprandial hypotension (PPH) is defined as a decrease in blood pressure that occurs 1 to 2 hours after eating. PPH typically affects older adults, especially those with hypertension or autonomic nervous system diseases such as Parkinson disease. PPH is thought to be caused by an increased concentration of vasoactive GI peptides or insulin-related vasodilation.

**Orthostatic Hypotension**

Orthostatic hypotension, also called postural hypotension, is defined as a decrease in SBP by 20 mmHg or a decrease in DBP by 10 mmHg within three minutes of standing. Orthostatic hypotension is due to an inadequate response to postural changes in blood pressure with many possible causes, including ANS dysfunction, cardiac problems, medication side effects, age-related changes, or temporary dysregulation of blood volume.
