Localized prostate cancer typically causes no symptoms. Any lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are usually due to associated benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Over half of men over the age of 50 will experience LUTS related to BPH. Other causes of symptoms include prostatitis, UTI, urethral stricture, and overactive bladder. This can result in an incidental diagnosis of early-stage cancer with an uncertain impact on long-term mortality. Prostate cancer can present with new-onset erectile dysfunction or rarely with hemoejaculate or initial hematuria.

Symptoms which might prompt investigation for prostate cancer include:

- Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) such as hesitancy, post-micturition dribbling, and poor stream

- Hematuria

- Hemoejaculate

- New-onset erectile dysfunction
