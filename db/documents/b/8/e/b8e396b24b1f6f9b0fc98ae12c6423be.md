Psychotherapy has been shown to decrease night-eating symptoms. Twenty-five patients were treated with cognitive behavioral therapy by Allison and colleagues within 12 weeks of diagnosis.

The serotonin system contributes to the regulation of eating, mood, and sleep. Therefore, it was assumed that reduced serotonin could lead to reduced satiety and circadian rhythm disturbances leading to an increased level of evening hyperphagia and nocturnal ingestions.

The rate for remission was 29%. However, the response rate was 67%.

In a randomized study on 44 patients from both genders divided into three groups: education, education plus Progressive muscle relaxation PMR or PMR plus exercise, Vander Wal and colleagues concluded there was the percentage of food eaten was significantly different between the three groups of study with the group doing PMR having the greatest reduction.

On a 51-year-old female with depression and NES, Freidman and colleagues conducted a study using paroxetine and bright light therapy. The results showed that discontinuation of the phototherapy made her NES symptoms return.
