Ischemic strokes are due to the occlusion of vascular supply to a specific part of the brain leading to tissue hypoxia and damage. Lacunar stroke is a common occlusive stroke with significant morbidity and mortality. Advancement in knowledge about modifying risk factors and early diagnosis has led to a favorable outcome. Most lacunar strokes remain asymptomatic due to the involvement of small vessels causing small-sized infarcts. However, accumulating multiple small lacunar infarcts can lead to significant physical and cognitive disabilities. This article reviews the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management options and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in treating patients suffering from a lacunar stroke.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the pathophysiology of lacunar stroke.
- Review history and physical examination findings of patients suffering from lacunar infarctions.
- Outline various treatment options, including medications and rehabilitation for managing lacunar stroke.
- Describe the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to ensure the best outcomes.
