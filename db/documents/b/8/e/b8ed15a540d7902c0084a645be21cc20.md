Tocolysis is an emergent procedure indicated to prolong gestation to decrease fetal morbidity and mortality. In 2006, preterm birth was associated with over 36% of the neonate deaths.

When a patient presents potentially needing tocolysis or is already receiving tocolytic medication, the high-risk obstetrical team should be notified of the patient's presence. Neonatal and anesthesia teams should also be informed so they can be aware of an upcoming preterm delivery. It has been shown that nurses play a crucial role in the care of obstetric patients that are experiencing obstetrical emergencies.
