Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCH) is a common and prevalent hereditary lipid disorder. The inherited primary dyslipidemia is named after its variable expression of increased plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, which affects at least two family members.et al, Rose et al, and Nikkila et al. However, it was later found to have a multigenic mode and complex inheritance.

FCH manifests as increased serum cholesterol levels (hypercholesterolemia) and/or increased triglycerides (hypertriglyceridemia).

The abnormal increases in plasma lipids and triglycerides are significant risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CVD-related mortality. The risk for mortality increases in individuals with underlying metabolic comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM), obesity, alcohol dependence, hypothyroidism, and liver disease.

The management of FCH patients includes therapeutic agents to lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels to prevent cardiovascular disease. FDA-approved treatments include HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), fibric acid derivatives (fibrates), bile acid sequestrants, PCSK9 inhibitors, niacin, and ezetimibe.
