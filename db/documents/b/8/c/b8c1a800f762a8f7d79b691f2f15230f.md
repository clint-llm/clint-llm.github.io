Myelin can be seen using light microscopy using various histological methods, such as but not limited to: hematoxylin and eosin, Luxol fast blue and plastic (paraffin) embedding. These histological methods pronounce myelin and typically makes it appear as peripheral rings surrounding an axon when looking at a transverse section and as long parallel projections when viewing a longitudinal section. The nuclei of oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells are visible on hematoxylin & eosin staining; this presents as circular basophilic nuclei with a perinuclear halo giving a “fried-egg” appearance and as longitudinal basophilic nuclei proximal to an axon respectively. Light microscopy is one of the most commonly used methods used to assess the presence of specific pathology in nervous tissue.
