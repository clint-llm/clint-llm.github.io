Variations of the dorsal scapular nerve innervation have been described as originating from a prefixed C4 anterior rami contribution joining with the C5 anterior ramus to form the dorsal scapular nerve. Also seen frequently is a dual innervation from the anterior rami from both C5 and C6. Additional variations of the dorsal scapular nerve have been identified when this nerve was found to share a communicating branch with the long thoracic nerve.

A 1997 study of 30 cadaver neck dissections reported that the dorsal scapular nerve only innervated the levator scapulae 30% with the majority of innervations coming from cervical plexus origins (C3-4). A 2016 cadaver study reported that the levator scapulae was innervated solely by the dorsal scapular nerve in 48% of cases and that the levator scapulae and rhomboids with both innervated by the same dorsal scapular nerve in 52% of samples.
