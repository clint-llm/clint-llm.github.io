Gehweiler type three has been observed to be the most common subtype of atlas fracture.

The rule of Spence showed that lateral mass displacement (LMD) over 6.9â€‰mm on open-mouth radiographs correlated with rupture to the transverse atlantal ligament (TAL).

There is a high risk of vertebral artery injury among cohorts with associated other injuries to the spine, increased atlantodental interval, and lateral mass displacement.
