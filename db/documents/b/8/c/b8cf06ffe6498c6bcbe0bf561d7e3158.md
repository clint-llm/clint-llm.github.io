Halobetasol cream is administered topically to the skin. As a cream, it is not occlusive like ointments, making it useful in intertriginous areas where ointments are inappropriate. Creams also vanish into the skin easily, making them cosmetically appealing to patients.

The standard dosing of halobetasol cream is once to twice daily for two weeks.

Halobetasol is most commonly available in 0.05% ointment and cream, although as mentioned above, foams and other dose forms are also available. Dosing for steroid-responsive dermatoses is once or twice daily for up to two weeks, with a maximum dosage of 50 g per week. Pateints should be instructed not to apply the drug to their faces, axillae, or groins.
