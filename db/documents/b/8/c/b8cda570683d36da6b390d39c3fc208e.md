Although there are rare instances of Mycoplasma transmission from animals to humans, Mycoplasma is predominantly transmitted by human to human contact. It primarily affects mucosal areas of the respiratory tract and urogenital tract. The organism Mycoplasma
pneumoniae attaches to ciliated epithelium in the upper and lower respiratory tract via attachment by a specialized organelle.

Numerous commensal mycoplasmas also inhabit the body, primarily the oropharynx, with most common being Mycoplasma salivarium and Mycoplasma orale. These species are not pathogenic except for immunosuppressed individuals in which the organism may become opportunistic. Ureaplasma species, another sub-class of Mollicutes, are known to cause urethral, gynecologic and obstetric infections. Ureaplasma species, Mycoplasma genitalium, and M.
hominis are genitourinary mucosal organisms and infection is spread through direct sexual contact.
