**Randomized Controlled Trials**

**Treatment of Comatose Survivors of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac arrest with Induced Hypothermia**

This trial was one of the first randomized controlled studies evaluating the effects of therapeutic hypothermia on comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. This trial, along with the HACA trial, was pivotal to hypothermia, establishing its place in resuscitation guidelines. The study was performed in Melbourne, Australia, between September 1996 and June 1999. Seventy-seven patients were enrolled based on specific criteria, including the initial rhythm of ventricular fibrillation, the successful return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and persistent coma after resuscitation. Patients with cardiac arrest of presumed noncardiac etiology were excluded, along with patients with cardiogenic shock, males under the age of 18, and females under the age of 50.

Patients were randomly assigned to either the hypothermia group (temperature of 33 degrees C) or the normothermia group (temperature of 37 degrees C). The cooling process for the hypothermia group began in the ambulance with the use of external cooling devices. Once these patients arrived at an emergency department, they underwent more vigorous cooling, also through the use of external cooling methods. Core temperature was initially measured using the tympanic or bladder temperature until a pulmonary artery catheter was placed. Once the target temperature of 33 degrees C was reached, it was maintained for 12 hours after arrival at the hospital. Patients were actively rewarmed after 18 hours, for 6 hours using a heated air blanket.

The primary outcome measure for this study was survival to hospital discharge with a sufficiently good neurological function to be sent home or to a rehab facility. 21 of the 43 (49%) hypothermia group patients were found to have a good outcome, as compared with 9 of the 34 normothermia patients (26%, P=0.046). Time from collapse to ROSC and age were found to decrease the likelihood of a good outcome. After adjusting these variables, the odds ratio for a good outcome in the hypothermia vs. normothermia group was 5.25 (95% CI, 1.47 to 18.76; P=0.011). These results indicate a significant improvement in outcomes when therapeutic hypothermia is used on comatose patients after out of hospital cardiac arrest. Therapeutic hypothermia was also found to be safe, with clinically non-significant changes in hemodynamic and laboratory (potassium and glucose) parameters. Previous studies were associated with several complications. The observed difference in this study is thought to be due to the shorter duration and milder degree of hypothermia used.

**Mild Therapeutic Hypothermia to Improve the Neurologic Outcome after Cardiac Arrest**

This randomized controlled trial took place in nine centers in five European countries between March 1996 and January 2001 (enrollment stopped in July 2000 due to enrollment rate being less than expected and funding ending at this date). Like other RCTs on therapeutic hypothermia, the assessment of outcome was blinded, but the personnel involved in the initial care of the patient were not. The inclusion criteria were: witnessed cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac origin, the initial rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, age between 18 and 75, the interval from collapse to initial resuscitation attempts between 5 and 10 minutes, and a collapse to ROSC interval less than one hour.

A total of 275 patients were enrolled, with 137 randomly assigned to the hypothermia group and 138 patients assigned to the normothermia group. In the hypothermia group, cooling was initiated on admission using external cooling devices, to a temperature between 32 degrees C and 34 degrees C. The target time to achieve this temperature was 4 hours, with additional external cooling methods used if the target was not achieved by 4 hours. Temperature measurements were made with a bladder temperature probe. Cooling was maintained for 24 hours, followed by passive rewarming to a temperature of 36 degrees C. The primary outcome in this study was a favorable neurologic outcome within six months. A favorable neurological outcome was defined as a Pittsburgh cerebral performance category of 1 or 2 out of 5. Secondary outcomes included overall mortality at six months and the rate of complications during the first week after cardiac arrest. Fifty-five percent of the normothermia group met the criteria for a favorable neurologic outcome at six months, compared to 39% of the normothermia group (RR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.08 - 1.81). Mortality at six months was 55% for the normothermia group and 41% for the hypothermia group (RR for hypothermia group, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58-0.95; P=0.02). Based on the risk of death difference between the two groups, seven patients need to be treated with hypothermia to prevent one death.

These results show that therapeutic hypothermia increases the chance of a favorable neurological outcome and decreases mortality in patients resuscitated after out of hospital cardiac arrest. Complication rates in the hypothermia group in this study were greater than the study by Bernard et al., particularly the rate of infectious problems; this may be due to the longer duration of hypothermia. The results of this study might have been more profound if cooling was attained earlier. The median interval to reach the target temperature was 8 hours (interquartile range, 4 to 16), double the initial target time. Theoretically, we can assume that a faster cooling rate should be associated with a more favorable outcome since earlier hypothermia should mean earlier retardation of deleterious enzymatic reactions, a lower rate of free radical production and acidosis, and a lower concentration of excitatory neurotransmitters. However, the ideal time to achieve hypothermia is unknown, with some studies showing that a shorter time to achieve systemic cooling is associated with an unfavorable neurologic outcome.

**The Target Temperature Management 33 degrees C versus 36 degrees C after Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (TTM) trial**

This randomized controlled trial recruited 950 patients in 36 intensive care units in Europe and Australia. It is the most extensive trial on the use of therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest. Patients included in this trial were those resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac etiology. Unlike previous trials, patients with both shockable and non-shockable initial rhythms were included. Patients were randomly assigned to receive therapeutic hypothermia with a target temperature of either 33 degrees C or 36 degrees C. Cooling was achieved using an intravascular cooling catheter in 24% of patients, and surface cooling systems were used in 76% of patients. Gradual rewarming commenced after 28 hours in both groups, and patients were rewarmed to 37 degrees C at a rate of 0.5 degrees C/hour. All surviving patients were followed until 180 days after enrollment of the last patient. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcome was a composite of poor neurologic function or death, defined as a Cerebral Performa degrees C group had died, and 48% in the 36 degrees C group (HR in the 33 degrees C group, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.28; P=0.51). There was no significant difference in the composite outcome of neurologic function or death between the two groups (RR for a CPC of 3 to 5 in 33 degrees C group, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.16; P=0.78; RR for a score of 4 to 6 on the modified Rankin scale in 33 degrees C group, 1.01; 95% CI,0.89 to 1.14; P=0.87)

This trial showed no significant difference between a target temperature of 33 degrees C and 36 degrees C. These results, however, may indicate that preventing fever alone or targeted normothermia may be sufficient to provide the beneficial effects of therapeutic hypothermia seen in other studies. Both groups in this study were intervention groups; the inclusion of a third non-intervention group would have clarified the role of therapeutic hypothermia or therapeutic normothermia in these patients. Compared to the control group in the HACA trial in 2002, the 33 degrees C and the 36 degrees C groups in the TTM trial had lower mortality rates.
