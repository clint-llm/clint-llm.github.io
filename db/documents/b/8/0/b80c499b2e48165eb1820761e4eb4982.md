Asymmetric Periflexural Exanthem (APEC) is a distinctive and a self-limited exanthem which classically affects children and less frequently adults. The precise etiology of this condition is unknown, but the hypothesis of a viral cause seems to be plausible but remains unconfirmed. APEC manifests as a unilateral papular exanthem with stereotypical morphology and distribution. Usually, laboratory investigations and biopsy are not necessary for this condition because of its excellent prognosis and its self-limited character in a few weeks. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of APEC and highlights the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Asymmetric Periflexural Exanthem.
- Describe the presentation of Asymmetric Periflexural Exanthem.
- List the treatment and management options available for Asymmetric Periflexural Exanthem.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by Asymmetric Periflexural Exanthem.
