Patients who present with signs and symptoms of shortness of breath, dyspnea, fatigue, or peripheral edema should be evaluated for heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. To diagnose high altitude pulmonary hypertension, the patient must reside at an elevation greater than 2,500 meters.

- An EKG can be consistent with chronic right heart strain and have findings of right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), right bundle branch block (RBBB), and tall p-waves in inferior leads.

- An echocardiogram can show a dilated right ventricle and right atrium, as well as increased pulmonary artery pressure. It is also essential to assess left ventricular function and ejection fraction to rule out left-sided heart failure.

- The chest X-ray may be normal or shows signs of cardiomegaly or pulmonary vascular congestion.

- Pulmonary function tests are useful in excluding other diagnoses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, or other interstitial lung diseases.

Right-sided heart catheterization and pulmonary angiography are the most important diagnostic tools for establishing a definitive diagnosis. A mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) greater than 30 mmHg or systolic PAP of greater than 50 mmHg is diagnostic for pulmonary hypertension.
