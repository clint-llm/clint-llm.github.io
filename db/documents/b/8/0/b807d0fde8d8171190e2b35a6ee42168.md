Many fundamental anatomical concepts are relevant to CPET. Grossly, the cardiopulmonary axis is the organ system of most significant concern. While the heart and lungs can be subdivided into their component organizations (broncho-pulmonary segments and chambers, respectively), it is crucial to appreciate these organs as a closed unit, as each seamlessly regulates the other. One can follow the path of deoxygenated blood returning from the systemic circulation to appreciate the loop. Via the inferior vena cava, this blood is collected in the right atrium and then pumped through the right ventricle into the pulmonary arteries of each lung. These arteries lead the way to smaller capillaries, just as main bronchi lead air to increasingly smaller bronchioles. Gas exchange occurs at the level of the alveoli, during which waste carbon dioxide is exchanged for freshly inspired oxygen. The re-oxygenated blood is then returned to the heart by way of the pulmonary veins. The left atrium and ventricle are then tasked with the collecting and pumping of this blood back through the systemic circulation. The organs themselves receive their blood supplies through the bronchial and coronary vessels, early bifurcations within the systemic circulatory system. By nature of the test, CPET allows for evaluation of the axisâ€™s baseline function as well as compensatory mechanisms during times of physiological stress. The system is a case study on how structure influences function.
