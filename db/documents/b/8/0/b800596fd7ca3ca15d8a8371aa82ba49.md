Patients and their families should be educated about the nature of the disease, its progression, prognosis, and the need to monitor for adverse effects of medical therapy.Â In addition, the following measures are recommended:

**Sun Protective Measures**

Patients should be advised to avoid sunlight, use sunscreen, and adopt sun-protective measures such as wearing wide-brimmed hats and full-body covered clothing to prevent the worsening of photosensitive skin rash.

**Diet**

Patients with severe muscle inflammation may require a high protein diet. The presence of esophageal dysfunction may require a special diet and an elevation of the head of the bed after meals.

**Physical Activity**

Physical exercise and rehabilitation is an important part of dermatomyositis management. Aerobic exercise and resistance training help to enhance muscle strength. Range of motion exercise is also helpful to prevent contractures. If muscle inflammation is severe, sustained rest should be advised, and physical activity should be avoided.
