# Continuing Education Activity

Dyskeratosis congenita, also known as Zinsser-Engman-Cole syndrome, is an uncommon genodermatosis classically associated with the triad of oral leukoplakia, nail dystrophy, and reticular hyperpigmentation. Most affected by the syndrome have a defect in the dyskeratosis congenita 1 (DKC1) gene which encodes the dyskerin protein involved in telomere maintenance. Inheritance is most commonly x-linked recessive, and subsequently, males are affected three times more frequently than females. Clinical findings vary widely and may include atrophic wrinkled skin, eye disease, and bone marrow failure. Treatment is difficult and largely depends on an interprofessional approach. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of dyskeratosis congenita and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of dyskeratosis congenita.
- Review the presentation of dyskeratosis congenita.
- Outline the treatment options for dyskeratosis congenita.
- Explain the importance of improving coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care for patients affected by dyskeratosis congenita.

# Introduction

Dyskeratosis congenita (DKC), which is also known as Zinsser-Engman-Cole syndrome, is a genodermatosis originally described by Zinsser in 1906.DKC1 gene encoding the dyskerin protein which is involved in telomere maintenance.

# Etiology

The defective preservation of telomeres causes dyskeratosis congenita.DKC1, encodes for dyskerin protein and is inherited in an x-linked recessive fashion. Dyskerin is directly involved in stabilizing an enzyme called telomerase that is responsible for catalyzing a reaction that sustains the length of telomeres.TINF2, TERC, TERT, C16orf57, NOLA2, NOLA3, WRAP53/TCAB1, and RTEL1 are mutated in DKC.

# Epidemiology

Males are affected more than females in a ratio of approximately 3:1, which corresponds with x-linked recessive being the most common inheritance pattern.

# Pathophysiology

The clinical phenotype produced by telomere shortening with subsequent senescence, apoptosis, or carcinogenesis in dyskeratosis congenita varies greatly. Classically the triad of oral leukoplakia, nail dystrophy, and reticular hyperpigmentation is seen.

# Histopathology

Histologic findings of dyskeratosis congenita are generally non-specific. Commonly, there are telangiectasias seen superficially, along with hyperkeratosis and atrophy of the epidermis.

# History and Physical

Generally, patients with dyskeratosis congenita first develop presenting signs of dystrophic nails between the ages of 5 to 13 years.

# Evaluation

Evaluation and diagnosis is mainly a combination of history and physical examination, biopsies of skin, mucosa, or bone marrow, and flow-fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Biopsies of skin and mucosa show histological characteristics listed above along with possible malignancy-associated changes. Bone marrow biopsy shows associated bone marrow failure, myelodysplastic, or leukemia changes.

# Treatment / Management

Treatment often involves an interprofessional approach. Surveillance for associated complications is paramount. Lifelong annual skin screening, as well as sun protection, is warranted to detect and protect from cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Dental examinations twice per year are recommended by a dental professional to screen for oral malignancies. Yearly examinations by an otolaryngologist may be warranted to screen for squamous cell carcinoma. Gastroenterologists' involvement with screening endoscopies of the esophagus and/or colon for strictures or malignancies may be beneficial. Bone marrow examination should be performed at the time of diagnosis, and then accordingly pending biannual blood counts to screen for bone marrow failure or malignancy changes. Pulmonary function tests should be done yearly to screen for signs of fibrosis. Calcium and vitamin D levels should be regularly checked and treated accordingly to prevent osteoporosis and/or fractures. Eyes may develop complications like a corneal abrasion secondary to associated eye problems like ectropion. Thus, regular eye examinations may be beneficial. Ultrasound of the liver should be done regularly, along with annual liver function tests.

Transfusions may help intermittently alleviate bone marrow failure.  Medical treatment of bone marrow failure with stem cell transplantation is done when severe, but stem cell transplantation still has a poor long-term survival rate.

Patients should be encouraged to not participate in any carcinogenic habits or practices such as smoking, alcohol, or unprotected sun exposure. Surgical interventions should be acted upon accordingly.

# Differential Diagnosis

Rothmund-Thomson syndrome and epidermolysis bullosa simplex with mottled pigmentation have similar poikiloderma. Dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis, as well as Naegeli-Franceschetti-Jadassohn syndrome, may have similar reticulate hyperpigmentation. Fanconi anemia has a similar presentation to DKC but is due to chromosomal rearrangement and breakage. Patients with graft-versus-host disease have poikiloderma, and mucosal changes are lichen planus-like.

There are also a few variants of DKC that have findings of DKC with a few other specific characteristics. Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome is like DKC but also has cerebellar hypoplasia and intrauterine growth restriction.

# Prognosis

Patients with dyskeratosis congenita have a shortened lifespan. Causes of death from most to least common are bone marrow failure, lung disease, and malignancies.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Dyskeratosis congenita is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes oncology nurses. Because of the high risk of malignancy, patients must not only be screened regularly but should be educated on the harms of nicotine, alcohol, and too much sunlight.
