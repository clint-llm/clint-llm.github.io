Outcomes of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn are dependent on the underlying etiology. Surviving infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension have long-term neurodevelopmental, cognitive, and hearing problems.

Approximately one in four infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension have neurodevelopmental delays and hearing impairment. The risk is higher in infants with underlying conditions such as CDH or genetic disorders. In addition to the severity and etiology of persistent pulmonary hypertension in newborns, small for gestational age and Hispanic ethnicity are independent risk factors for higher mortality and morbidity in the first year after discharge.

Infants with mild disease are at higher risk for hospital readmission than term infants with no persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.
