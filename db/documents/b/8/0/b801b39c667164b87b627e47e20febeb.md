- The Chiari I malformation is the most common of the Chiari manifestations resulting in hindbrain abnormality.

- While the genetics origin of the malformation requires more confirmation, the malformation can occur in several defined genetic syndromes.

- Many patients can be asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic, and the malformation is diagnosed more commonly in adolescents or adults.

- Patients may present with symptoms of occipital pain or chronic headache; however, they may also present with less specific symptoms such as swallow impairment or sleep apnea.

- MRI is the main investigation of choice in these individuals, allowing full visualization of the cervicomedullary junction.

- Because algorithms for the management of the Chiari type I are not well-established, a combination of medical and surgical approaches through a multimodal dynamic strategy is mandatory.

- Surgical decompression is performed in symptomatic individuals with success, often significantly alleviating the patients presenting symptomatology and restoring full neurological function.
