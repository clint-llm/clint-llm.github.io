Patients need to be aware of risk factors that increase stroke risk. Compliance with antithrombotic agents to prevent the recurrence of stroke is essential. Patients are advised to maintain a healthy diet, exercise regularly, avoid smoking, and avoid excessive alcohol use. Together, these habits reduce the risk of having strokes in general. If patients have high blood pressure, lipid disorder, or diabetes, regular follow-up with their primary care provider is essential to keep these risk factors optimally controlled.

The timeline of recovery from a lacunar stroke is different for everyone. Home safety is essential. Fall risk due to physical disability is common. Depression is common in people who have experienced a stroke and should be addressed if present. Cognitive impairment due to multiple subcortical strokes can progress to vascular dementia and should be monitored.
