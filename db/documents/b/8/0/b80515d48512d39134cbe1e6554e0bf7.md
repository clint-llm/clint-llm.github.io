The anterior tibial artery supplies the muscle proximally. The medial tarsal arteries, which are branches of the dorsalis pedis artery, supply the tendon distally. The anterior tibial artery is 1 of 2 terminal branches at the bifurcation of the popliteal artery. The other branch is the tibioperoneal trunk, which further divides into the posterior tibial and fibular arteries.

The anterior tibial artery passes from the posterior popliteal fossa to the anterior leg through an opening in the interosseous membrane between the tibia and fibula. It travels down the leg, supplying the anterior compartment, and into the foot, continuing as the dorsalis pedis artery. The dorsalis pedis artery then gives rise to the medial tarsal arteries at the level of the medial cuneiform, which supplies the tibialis anterior tendon distally.
