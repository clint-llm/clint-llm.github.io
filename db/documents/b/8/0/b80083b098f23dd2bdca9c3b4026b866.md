Commencing home hemodialysis creates unique psychosocial issues affecting the patient and care partner. The home HD health care team must provide proactive inter-professional support, respite care, travel support, peer support, and financial support. Improper redressal of these aspects could cause patients to return to in-center HD. Some centers provide real-time monitoring of home HD treatments,Â and a panic button/alarm may be present to contact the local paramedic unit.
