Decompression sickness in aviation is most commonly seen following flights in nonpressurized aircraft, in flights with cabin pressure fluctuations, or in individuals who fly after diving. Cases also have been reported after the use of altitude chambers. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the recognition and management of decompression syndrome.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and pathophysiology of decompression syndrome. 
- Outline the typical history and physical findings for a patient with decompression syndrome. 
- Discuss the role of using ground-level 100 percent oxygen and hyperbaric oxygen in the management of decompression syndrome. 
- Explain the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding the recognition and management of patients with decompression syndrome.
