The complexity of patients with femoral shaft fractures varies and can range from isolated injuries to a polytraumatized individual. Interprofessional collaboration between emergency services, surgical teams, critical care providers, internists, nurses, therapists, social workers, and case managers is necessary at various stages of treatment and recovery. Dedicated geriatric units have been shown to manage older patients with multiple comorbidities better. This specialized care has resulted in shorter times to surgery, fewer postoperative infections, fewer complications, and shorter length of stay despite treating an older and sicker population.
