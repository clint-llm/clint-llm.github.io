The increased glucose level in the fetus is teratogenic and is the major cause of diabetic embryopathy. Further deterioration of normal physiology and organogenesis starts with hyperglycemia through multiple factors that are involved in this pathogenesis.

**Hyperglycemia and Ketone Bodies**

Several experimental studies in mouse models show a direct correlation of hyperglycemia with congenital malformations. Increased glucose uptake by embryogenic tissue is teratogenic. Increased glucose flux enhances many other pathways, likely glycolytic flux, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, and citric acid cycle. Sorbital accumulation from high glucose reduction by aldose reductase damages the cells through osmotic effect (however, it is not the key mechanism of diabetic embryopathy because the use of aldose reductase inhibitors does not show improvement in dysmorphogenesis in the presence of high glucose). Hyperglycemic stimulated AMP-kinase has found to induce the increased formation of Neural tube defects in in-vitro experiments of mice. Ketone bodies such as beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate are formed in increased amounts in the liver in the hyperglycemic state of the mother that crosses the placenta and also exerts teratogenic effects in the fetus. Synergistic evidence between hyperglycemia and other metabolites like ketones has been established. Hexosamine pathway activation in the hyperglycemic state deteriorates the antioxidant defense system and causes birth defects. Uridine-diphosphate N-acetyl glucosamine formation in this pathway is attached to the serine or threonine residues of proteins causing beta-o-linked glycosylation leading to hexosamine stress that is responsible for teratogenic effects.

**Oxidative Stress**

Diabetes-induced alterations of signaling systems lead to an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and stress defense system. Glucose autooxidation and mitochondrial production of superoxides, as well as unpaired electrons transfer from the mitochondrial electron chain transport system, are responsible for increased reactive oxygen species. Embryonic neural tissue has increased uptake of glucose for the proliferation of tissues. In a hyperglycemic environment, there is a further increase in the uptake of glucose by neural tissue. NADPH utilized in the polyol pathway further decreases GSH (glutathione reductase). GSH is required for DNA and protein synthesis. Gammaglutamilcysteine enzyme involved in GSH production is inhibited by excess glucose. So, the ability to reduce and neutralize the reactive species is decreased that further exacerbates the oxidative stress. Cell membrane integrity is weakened due to oxidative stress. ROS can damage all the components, including cell membranes, DNA, RNA, lipids peroxidation, and proteins. Increased intracellular ROS inhibits the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a rate-limiting enzyme, which then increases the sensitivity to ROS.

**Hypoxic Stress**

Before the development of blood vessels, increased O2 consumption by excess glucose metabolism exacerbates the hypoxic state by favoring the mitochondrial superoxide formation. In many studies, a decrease in oxygen level has shown an increased NTD rate.

**Inositol**

Inositol uptake is decreased by fetal tissue in a hyperglycemic environment. Supplementation of inositol has shown a reduction in dysmorphogenesis and thus, possibly is an important mechanism of diabetic embryopathy. Additionally, a decreased level of phosphoinositol 2 (PIP2), PIP3, and diacylglycerol (DAG) are noted. PIP2 is a precursor of phospholipids, including phospholipase A2 in the embryo. Decreased phospholipase A2 causes the reduced formation of Arachidonic acid.

**Arachidonic Acid and Prostaglandins**

High glucose level inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. This enzyme is required for the production of prostaglandins in the fetus. Prostaglandins are vital for cellular life. Arachidonic acid is engaged in signaling as a second messenger. Prostaglandin E2 producing pathway plays a crucial role in neurulation. Isoprostane formation by peroxidation of arachidonic acid further decreases the arachidonic acid. This, in turn, results in an increased incidence of NTDs.

**Placental Alterations**

Normal placental functioning and structure are imperative for fetal growth and development. Gestational diabetes changes the placental structures and vascular patterns. Higher placental growth factors in the diabetic environment result in neovascularization and thickening of the basal trophoblast membrane. Vascular disorganization, endothelial proliferation, decreased villous space causes fetal vasculitis and hypoxia. Additionally, modification of fibronectin and b laminin expression prevents cellular adhesion.

**Genetic Alterations**

There are polymorphic genes that are responsible for susceptibility to fetal malformations in diabetic mothers, but the exact genetic cause remains unidentified. Advanced glycosylation productsÂ damage the DNA, which then exerts teratogenic effects. Oxidative stress alters the expression of genes encoding the free radical inhibiting enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalases. PAX3 is expressed in the neuroepithelium and is essential for the closure of the neural tube and inhibits P53-mediated apoptosis. High glucose concentration leads to inhibition of the PAX3 gene that, in turn, is involved in the incidence of neural tube defects (NTDs).
