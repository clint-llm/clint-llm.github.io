Mexiletine is largely used to suppress ventricular arrhythmias and has a role in peripheral neuropathy and chronic pain, although the use for either is limited and seldom given its extensive side effect profile. The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society guidelines for ventricular arrhythmias published information regarding the use of mexiletine in patients with long QT syndrome type 3 presenting with Torsades de pointes. Additionally, it can be used in myotonic dystrophy to alleviate muscle pain and severe myotonia. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, pharmacology, monitoring, and relevant interactions of mexiletine, pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in treating patients with conditions where it is of clinical value.

**Objectives:**
- Review the indications for using mexiletine therapy.
- Describe the mechanism of action of mexiletine.
- Identify the potential adverse effects of mexiletine.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance mexiletine use and improve outcomes.
