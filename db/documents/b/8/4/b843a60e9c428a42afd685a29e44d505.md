The overall technique for transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound is the same for all pregnancies, but it differs in the setting of the initial evaluation of pregnancy with trauma.

The transabdominal view in pregnancy is obtained using the curvilinear probe with the patient in a supine position. The probe is placed with the indicator to the head of the patient above the pubis symphysis in the midline. An adequate view of the uterus includes having the length of the uterus in addition to the cervix and part of the vagina visualized.

During a transvaginal examination, the tactile indicator that is located on the handle of the probe is pointed up towards the ceiling, and the probe is inserted approximately 4 to 5 cm in the sagittal plane. The first and critical step is the determination of landmarks in which the bladder is identified, and subsequently, the juxtaposition between the bladder and the uterus is recognized, which makes it less likely that the exam is being performed in the adnexa.**.**

In the setting of trauma, the patient should undergo an assessment with an ultrasound of the abdomen with a FAST exam to evaluate for free fluid in the peritoneal cavity and pericardium. The FAST exam is performed with a curvilinear probe and evaluates the right upper quadrant (Morrison pouch), left upper quadrant, subxiphoid, and suprapubic with additional attention spent evaluating the uterus for intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) while in this position.
