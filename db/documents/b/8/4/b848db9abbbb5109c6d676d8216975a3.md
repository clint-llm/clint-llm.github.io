Other midbrain syndromes are Benedikt, Claude's and Nothnagel syndrome.

Benedikt syndrome, also called Paramedian midbrain syndrome, is also caused by an insult in the tegmentum of the midbrain and cerebellum. It is characterized by the presence of oculomotor nerve palsy and cerebellar ataxia including tremor and involuntary choreoathetotic movements.

Claude's syndrome is similar to Weber syndrome in that it presents with ipsilateral oculomotor nerve palsy with contralateral hemiparesis but also includes contralateral ataxia. It occurs due to the involvement of oculomotor nerve, red nucleus and brachium conjunctivum.

Another famously described Weber syndrome is the Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS), also called encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis, which is a neurocutaneous syndrome with angiomas involving the leptomeninges and skin of the face, typically ophthalmic (V1) and maxillary (V2) distribution areas of the trigeminal nerve. The hallmark of SWS is a facial cutaneous venous dilation, also referred to as a nevus flammeus or port-wine stain (PWS).

Yet another Weber syndrome is the Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome (KTWS), characterized by a triad of port-wine stain, varicose veins, and bony and soft tissue hypertrophy involving an extremity.
