The femoral nerve originates from L2 to L4, innervating the contractile areas of the thigh anteriorly (quadriceps muscle, sartorius muscle), of the hip (comb), and the skin in the anteromedial portion of the thigh, knee, leg, and the back of the foot. It also contains fibers from L1. The roots converge downward and sideways in the thickness of the large psoas muscle, joining in a single trunk near the transverse process of L5. The formed nerve descends and exits caudally from the outer portion of the psoas muscle and continues traveling caudally in the middle of the psoas/iliac muscle complex. This area is covered by the iliac fascia, which separates it from the parietal peritoneum, the cecum colon on the right, and the sigmoid colon on the left.

The fascial system that constitutes the nerve involves the tissues it crosses from the electrical point of view and the mechanical point of view. This is because a reduction in its elasticity will decrease the ability of the joints involved in its passage to move. When an entrapment syndrome is recorded, the nerve acts like a fascial brake.

Arriving at the inguinal ligament, the femoral nerve follows the iliopsoas musculature and divides into some ramifications at about 2 centimeters beyond the inguinal ligament, medial to the sartorius muscle, and lateral to the femoral artery. The nerve in this area is wider and flattened; in some subjects, the nerve can become arborized before it passes the inguinal ligament. At this level, the femoral nerve gives small superficial ramifications to the skin and the fascial structures.

Before branching, the femoral nerve enters (having passed the inguinal ligament) into the femoral lacuna (consisting of the femoral nerve and the iliopsoas muscle complex).

It continues in the Scarpa triangle or femoral triangle (pyramidal fossa with the caudal oriented apex found in the anterosuperior and medial area of the thigh, where the apex is formed by the adductor and sartorius muscle, the lateral portion consists of the sartorius muscle, and the medial one from the long adductor). Here there are vessels and lymphatic pathways (the Cloquet lymph node).

The ramifications of the femoral nerve are found for the most part in the Scarpa triangle, where we find the medial sartorius nerve, the pectineus nerve, the medial and lateral musculocutaneous nerve, the femoral nerve directed to the quadriceps muscle branches by the various vasti muscles, and the saphenous nerve.

The femoral nerve directed to the vastus lateralis is divided into two branches, which will divide into two other branches, each with a course from anteriorly and proximally to posteriorly and distally.

The femoral nerve innervating the vastus medialis follows the anteromedial border of the muscular district. The vastus intermedius receives innervation from the femoral nerve, which arrives in the medial portion of the vastus. The tensor of the vastus intermedius is innervated starting from its proximal portion. The rectus femoris receives innervation near the anterior inferior iliac spine.
