The ocular melanomas can have a spectrum of symptoms and may depend upon the location of the malignancy. Common symptoms include blurry vision, visual field defect, flashing lights, redness, irritation, pain, and a pressure-like sensation. Choroidal tumors can cause retinal detachment based on the shape of the malignancy. Conjunctival melanomas can present as elevated lesions with increased pigmentation. Ciliary body tumors can cause lens displacement and disturbances in accommodation. Iris melanomas can distort the pupil, cause cataracts, and even cause glaucoma.
