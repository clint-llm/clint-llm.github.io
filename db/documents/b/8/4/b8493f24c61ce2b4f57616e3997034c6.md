The uterus functions by nurturing the fertilized ovum, which passes through the fallopian tube. The ovum then implants into the endometrium, where it receives nourishment from blood vessels, which are exclusively developed for this purpose. As the embryo grows and matures, the uterus expands to accommodate the developing fetus. During normal labor, the uterus contracts as the cervix dilates, and this results in the delivery of the infant.
