The NIMS is a nationwide standard template to enable local responders to access scalable support in response to incidents, regardless of location, size, or cause to protect citizens and create an efficient and effective collaboration under a trained Incident Commander.Â  Medical support to the logistics arm of the Incident Command must include providers familiar with the NIMS and ICS constructs which can take command if necessary, as the first responder on the scene. Communication with medical support, mobility, and leadership is critical for an effective response.
