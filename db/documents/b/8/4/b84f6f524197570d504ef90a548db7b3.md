- After a successful weaning trial/SBT, a decision is made to proceed with extubation.

- All necessary equipment should be available for extubation management, and the rest of the equipment should be available nearby in case extubation does not go as planned.

- The patient should be in an upright sitting position.

- Both the ETT and oral cavity are suctioned - if there is a subglottic suction, it should be utilized to remove all secretions above the ETT cuff. If no subglottic suction is available, use a small-bore catheter to insert on the side of the ETT and suction all secretions above the ETT cuff.

- The ETT is removed from the holder; when ready to be removed, ask the patient to take a deep breath and exhale. During exhalation, deflate the cuff and smoothly take out the ETT.

- If an orogastric tube is present, it is also removed alongside the ETT. This decision should be made before extubation, considering the need for oral medications and nutrition. Some patients may not be ready for oral intake and require a nasogastric tube placement upon removal of the orogastric tube.

- After removing the ETT, suction the oral cavity and ask the patient to take a deep breath and cough out all secretions.

- The patient should be placed on supplemental oxygen afterward.

- The patient should be observed very carefully over the next few hours.

- Frequent airway suction should be considered to prevent re-intubation.

- The timing of extubation (day, evening, night) depends on the institution and individual ICU, but the most critical factor to consider is the availability of adequately experienced personnel.

**Strategies for****Smooth Extubation and Smooth Emergence**

- Deep extubation

- Endotracheal tube exchange to Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA)

- A “no-touch” extubation technique

- Pre-oxygenation with 100% Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FiO2)

- Bite Blocks

- Pharmacotherapy**-**IV or intracuff lidocaine, IV remifentanil, and dexmedetomidine.

**Grades of Recommendations Advocated During the Process of Extubation**

- Use of a peripheral nerve stimulator

- Extubation in the left lateral and head-down positions

- Lidocaine to reduce post-procedure laryngospasm

- Topical lidocaine to reduce cough and the cardiovascular response to extubation

- Replacing an ETT with an LMA to reduce adverse sequelae in the airway and obtund the concurrent cardiovascular response

- Staged extubation with an airway exchange catheter in cases of a difficult airway

- Pre-oxygenation with 100% oxygen.

- Deep extubation.

- Extubation should be performed at the end of inspiration.

**Post-Extubation Management**

The immediate post-extubation phase should be managed as carefully as the ventilated phase because the first 24 hours post-extubation are difficult and tenuous.

- Ensure adequate oxygenation: Consider nasal cannula, oxygen mask, full face mask, and venturi mask as appropriate to ensure good O2 supply.

- In recent times, high-flow oxygen systems have gained popularity in selected patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure, and studies have shown to reduce the re-intubation rate.

- If needed, consider CPAP/BPAP for selected high-risk patients to avoid re-intubation.

- Ensure adequate secretion management, encourage coughing and deep breathing, and maintain airway hydration and the patient's central airway.

- Use adequate bronchodilators as needed.

- Encourage sitting up position and mobility if no other contraindications exist.

- Carefully introduce oral feeding. In at-risk patients, continue enteral feeding with a nasogastric tube until the patient is deemed safe to swallow and tolerate food orally.
