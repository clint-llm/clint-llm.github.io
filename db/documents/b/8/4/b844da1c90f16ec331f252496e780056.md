The patients and their families should be informed about the self-limited nature of the disease. As herpangina is primarily a pediatric disease and can be a source of significant stress for the family members, the families need to be reassured. The families should be educated about the contagion of the disease and that the patient should be isolated in a well-aerated room until the symptoms improve. Emphasis should be placed on adequate diet and hydration and close monitoring of symptoms. Close attention should be paid to hand hygiene, and frequent handwashing should be recommended. The importance of handwashing should also be explained to family members in close contact with the patient during care, especially after activities such as changing diapers or feeding the child. The sanitization of surfaces and objects the patient is in contact with is also recommended. Though home treatment is generally preferred, the caretakers should be informed to stay in regular contact with the treating physician and should observe the patient closely for any change in symptoms. Out-patient follow-up care is generally not needed as the disease is short-lived.
