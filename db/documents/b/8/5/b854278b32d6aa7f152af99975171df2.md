Deterrence is achieved by avoiding areas where the risk of nerve agent use is high. For most people, this should not be an issue. However, for those in the military this may be unavoidable. For civilian patients, if there is a concern for potential exposure to an organophosphate nerve agent, they should proceed directly to an emergency room. For those who are at higher risk, such as paramedics or military personnel, these members should carry proper PPE, atropine and pralidoxime auto-injectors, and consider prophylactic treatment when the risk of exposure is very high.
