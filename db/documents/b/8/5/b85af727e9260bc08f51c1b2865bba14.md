According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 3rd edition, (ICSD-3), the diagnostic criteria for exploding head syndrome are

- A complaint of a sudden, loud sound in the head upon waking up at night or during the wake-sleep transition

- Abrupt frightening arousal following the event

- There is no significant pain associated with the experience.

Episodes are reported more frequently during the transition from wake to sleep than from sleep to waking. Flashes of light, hypnic jerks, and physiological signs of fear (sweating, palpitations, shortness of breath, etc.) may accompany events.

During the assessment of EHS, physicians should inquire about other sleep disorders, medical, and psychiatric conditions, which may reveal comorbid sleep apnea.
