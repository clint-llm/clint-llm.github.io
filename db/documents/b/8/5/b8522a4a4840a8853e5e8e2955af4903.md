Esophageal injuries can result from both penetrating and blunt trauma. The need to screen for injury is based on a high degree of suspicion. Many patients may be asymptomatic initially. Imaging using CT scan is helpful to determine the potential for injury, especially in penetrating injury. Further workup should be timely, as an early diagnosis can help prevent further soilage and subsequent morbidity and mortality. Flexible endoscopy and contrast esophagography are complementary and together give the highest diagnostic yield.Â  Primary repair with suture line reinforcement using muscle flaps and wide drainage affords the patient the best outcome. Stent placement in certain conditions can aid as a bridge either to surgery or definitive management. Early enteral nutrition via jejunostomy is preferred. Overall, the morbidity and mortality of esophageal trauma are high, and a high index of suspicion and aggressive treatment plan are required to optimize outcome.
