Patients play a crucial role in their care. They should be educated on the following points:

- Medication compliance is critical - this is especially true with any diuretic medication

- Reduce salt and protein intake

- Maintain fluid intake - even to the point of carrying water at all times

- Monitor for signs of dehydration (e.g., dizziness, light-headedness, confusion, inability to think clearly)
