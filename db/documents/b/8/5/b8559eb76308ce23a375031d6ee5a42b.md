Coarctation of the aorta is characterized by a distinct region of obstructive narrowing involving the descending aortic arch. It is typically present at the juxtaductal position, which is the insertion site of the ductus arteriosus and just distal to the takeoff of the left subclavian artery. Other positions of aortic coarctation include the abdominal aorta or transverse portion of the aortic arch. This narrowed region can also exist as part of a long segment of arch hypoplasia associated with obstructive left-sided abnormalities, including hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Coarctation of the aorta is commonly found in conjunction with other congenital defects, including ventricular septal defect, bicuspid aortic valve, patent ductus arteriosus, and left-sided obstructive circulatory lesions.

Coarctation anatomy plays a significant role in the decision of transcatheter vs. surgical management. Lesions favorable for transcatheter management include native, juxtaductal, or simple coarctation that are found in older children or adolescents/adult patients. The employment of surgical techniques is favored in patients with more complex anatomical considerations. These complexities include transverse aortic arch obstructive lesion, significant tortuous regions of re-coarctation, or deformation of nearby arterial branches. When associated congenital defects require repair, surgical intervention is also given precedence.
