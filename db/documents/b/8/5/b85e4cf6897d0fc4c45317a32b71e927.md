Possible complications in RCC may include:

- Direct tumor effects e.g., hypertension, constipation, abdominal bloating, etc.

- Paraneoplastic phenomenon e.g., erythrocytosis, hypercalcemia, non-metastatic liver involvement e.g., Stauffer syndrome characterized by high levels of serum alkaline phosphatase, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, α-2-globulin, and γ-glutamyl transferase. Thrombocytosis, prolonged prothrombin time, and hepatosplenomegaly may be seen.

- Metastasis e.g., pulmonary function compromise (pulmonary metastasis), varicocele (venous spread), bony pain and spinal cord compression (bone metastasis), seizures (brain metastasis), jaundice and transaminase elevation (liver metastasis).

- Adverse effects from targeted systemic therapies or surgery may include renal function compromise, hypertension, proteinuria, impaired wound healing, gastrointestinal perforation, hemorrhage and thrombosis, reversible leukoencephalopathy, impaired cardiac function and endocrine dysfunction e.g., hypothyroidism.
