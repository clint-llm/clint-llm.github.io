In the absence of a declared or witnessed biological attack, early symptoms of biological warfare agents are likely to be nonspecific. Clues to a biological warfare attack include unusually large numbers of patients presenting simultaneously with similar symptoms and increased morbidity and mortality compared to more common illnesses. Other epidemiologic red flags might include significant numbers of patients who live or work in the same area, attended the same event, ate at the same restaurant, etc. Depending on the biological warfare agent involved, person-to-person transmission may or may not be a concern. The use of agents that areÂ capable of causing severe illness and death may quickly cause healthcare resources to be overwhelmed with patients requiring critical care and life-saving interventions, in addition to what may be a large number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients who seek medical care. Certain agents can be treated with medications or even avoided with post-exposure immunizations or prophylactic medications, whereas others are only manageable with supportive care. Detection of a biological attack, identifying the agents used, and determining the population at risk are vital to both incident management and patient management.
