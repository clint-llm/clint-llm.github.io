Wernicke area is most commonly damaged due to vitamin B1 (thiamine deficiency) resulting in Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. While most often associated with chronic alcoholism, Wernicke encephalopathy may also occur due to poor nutrition, increased metabolic requirement, or in the setting of renal dialysis (water-soluble vitamin depletion).

**Wernicke Syndrome**

The cardinal symptoms of Wernicke syndrome include gait ataxia, horizontal nystagmus, and encephalopathy. The encephalopathy may be characterized by inattentiveness, delirium, and profound disorientation to person/place/time. Although horizontal nystagmus is the most common ocular finding, vertical nystagmus may also occur. The ataxia experienced in these patients is a combination of vestibular dysfunction, cerebellar involvement, and polyneuropathy. Other uncommon findings may include severe hypotension, hypothermia, or coma.

**Korsakoff Syndrome**

Korsakoff syndrome has a more chronic onset and is characterized by confabulation, memory loss, hallucinations, and personality changes. Diagnostic imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used to illustrate contrast enhancement in the mamillary bodies and thalamus.

**Hyperemesis Gravidarum**

During pregnancy, expecting mothers may experience a phenomenon labeled as hyperemesis gravidarum. Over 75% of pregnant women experience severe nausea and vomiting during the first and second trimester of pregnancy. When vomiting becomes severe enough to result in weight loss, it is termed hyperemesis gravidarum. In addition to the variety of electrolyte abnormalities experienced, Wernicke encephalopathy may emerge due to water-soluble vitamin deficiency (Thiamine).****

**Brodmann Area 22 Damage**

Wernicke area may be directly damaged via direct insult to the superior temporal gyrus. These etiologies may include transient ischemic attack (TIA), stroke, cerebral abscess, neoplasm, encephalitis, or seizures. Common presentations of patients with damage to this area include a variety of paraphrastic errors in which either whole-word is improperly substituted (chair for table) or phonemic substitutions such as "cable" for "table." Comprehension may be assessed by giving a series of commands with increasing difficulty. The token test is frequently used in which a series of commands involving 20 tokens of different shapes, sizes, and colors presented in increasing complexity. An impairment in comprehension may be due to failure of word recognition, auditory memory, syntactic structure formation, or speech sound discrimination.
