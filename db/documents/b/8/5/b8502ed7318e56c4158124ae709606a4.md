The etiology of pityriasis rotunda is not established. Authors have attached it to various disorders of keratinization such as ichthyosis vulgaris, late-onset congenital ichthyosis, and acquired ichthyosis. Pityriasis rotunda is also considered a potential paraneoplastic dermatosis since it may be observed during certain malignancies, mainly hepatocellular carcinoma in South African black patients but also in the following:

- IgG myeloma, multiple myeloma

- Acute myeloid leukemia

- Chronic myeloid leukemia

- Adenocarcinoma of the prostate

- Esophagus carcinoma

- Gastric carcinoma

- Squamous cell carcinoma of the palate.

Pityriasis rotunda is also associated with several systemic diseases, such as:

- Malnutrition

- Diabetes mellitus

- Infections (tuberculosis, leprosy, osteitis)

- Hepatic diseases such as cirrhosis

- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and recurrent pulmonary infections

- Heart disease

- Female genital tract anomalies (ovarian cyst and fibroids)

- Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (favism)

- Chronic diarrhea

- Scleroderma

- Sarcoidosis

- Hormonal disorders such as hyperprolactinemia.

However, researchers have not eliminated the idea that the association of some of these conditions associated with pityriasis rotunda, especially favism, could be due to chance.
