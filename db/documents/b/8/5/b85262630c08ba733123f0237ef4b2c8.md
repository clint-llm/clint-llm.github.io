Patient education is important for SCD and even more critical for SCH, as there is not much easily accessible information for patients on SCH. Patients should be taught to know signs of acute sickle cell crisis, one component of which can be acute hepatic crisis, requiring hospitalization. Further, patients should be encouraged to have regular follow-ups with their hematologists or primary care physicians. They should have regular laboratory investigations that include liver function tests, so that hepatic function can be monitored, with any abnormalities necessitating further workup.

Patients should also be educated on gallstones, which is a common occurrence. They should be aware of the signs, such as right upper quadrant pain that is worse with eating greasy foods. They should avoid fatty and spicy foods, and if it is a recurrent problem, they should be educated on possible surgery. Patients with SCH should also be educated on the need for vaccines such as Hepatitis A and B. Patients who show milder forms of SCH should be educated on the signs and symptoms of cirrhosis. They should continue close follow-up with their healthcare providers so that this is not missed.
