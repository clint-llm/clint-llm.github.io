Rheumatoid factors are not routinely detectable in the circulation without an immunogenic stimulus. They are considered to be part of the normal response to a variety of antigenic stimuli, for example, to bacterial toxins like lipopolysaccharides or viruses such as Epstein–Barr virus (EBV).

**Rheumatoid Factors in RA**

The pathogenesis of RA involves a complex interplay between B cells, T cells, and dendritic cells. A multitude of environmental and genetic factors leads to loss of tolerance to the proteins that have a citrulline residue, which leads to the production of autoantibodies like anti-cyclic citrullinated protein/peptide antibody (ACPA) and RF.
