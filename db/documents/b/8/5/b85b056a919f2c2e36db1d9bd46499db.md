Early diagnosis may not be feasible with non-displaced fractures or when it is unclear if there is a fracture or dislocation or both. In the pre-hospital setting, immobilization should be considered with obvious deformities, pain, swelling, and shortened limb and patients unwilling to use actively move the proximal lower extremity. Patients who hold the limb in a fixed position, such as shortened with internal or external rotation, or have other signs of injury should also be considered for immobilization. Often patients with femur fractures will have a significant decrease in pain by manual traction and subsequent traction splint placement.

In the hospital, dislocations should be reduced early, if possible. If the reduction is not successful or there are other life-threatening conditions which need treatment, immobilization is not necessary but is preferred to support the affected limb in a position of comfort until the patient can go to the operating room for definitive treatment.

The location of the fracture or the need to treat other more urgent and life-threatening injuries may direct the initial immobilization in the emergencyÂ department.
