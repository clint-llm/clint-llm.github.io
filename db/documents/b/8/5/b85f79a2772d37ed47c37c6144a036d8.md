Equipment requirements will depend on the selected surgical approach.

Open approach: double-lumen endotracheal intubation, airplane splint for ipsilateral arm extension, rib spreader, electrocautery, and appropriate staples.

Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) approach double-lumen endotracheal intubation, airplane splint for ipsilateral arm extension, a video system with screens for surgeon and assistant, thoracoscope, electrocautery, and appropriate endoscopic instruments.

Robotic approach: similar to the VATS approach with the addition of the robotic system and instruments.
