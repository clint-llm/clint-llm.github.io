Amblyopia or lazy eye is a disorder of sight due to the eye and brain not working together. It results in decreased vision in an eye that may appear normal. It is the most common cause of decreased vision in a single eye among children and younger adults. In practice, the earlier the onset of its sensitive period, the more profound the visual deprivation and the deeper the resultant amblyopia. Refractive amblyopia is typically the most amenable to treatment, especially astigmatic amblyopia. Sometimes refractive correction alone may be all that is needed for treatment. If the amblyopia does not resolve, then patching the non-amblyopic eye is indicated.
