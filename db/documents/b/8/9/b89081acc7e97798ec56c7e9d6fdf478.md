The prognosis for patients with digoxin toxicity who receive appropriate treatment appropriately is good. Hyperkalemia is an important prognostic indicator. In a retrospective study of patients with digoxin toxicity, all patients with potassium levels above 5.5 mEq/L died. In contrast, no patient died in the group with potassium levels of less than 5 mEq/L. The mortality was 50% when the potassium levels were between 5 to 5.5 mEq/L.
