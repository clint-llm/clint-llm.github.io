When evaluating a patient with a suspected metacarpal fracture, looking for the hallmark signs of swelling, ecchymosis, tenderness to palpation, and pain with range of motion are expected to be seen. However, more specific signs of metacarpal fractures, including loss of knuckle height, digit malrotation, or digitÂ crossing over ("scissoring"), should clue the physician into evaluating for an injury to the metacarpals. These signs, combined with a thorough history, will aid the practitioner in deciding to assess further for fracture.

Other clinical pearls include evaluating the integrity of the skin. The latter is extremely important to rule out "fight bite" injuries, and dorsal wounds over the MCP joint are traumatic arthrotomies and open fracture patterns until proven otherwise.
