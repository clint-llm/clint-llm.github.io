Patients with MIRM should be advised that mucosal lesions may become painful, limiting oral intake, and resulting in dehydration and lack of nutrient intake. Cutaneous lesions should be kept as clean as possible to avoid secondary bacterial infection. Although patterns of transmission of MIRM are not well established, it is reasonable for patients and close contacts of a suspected M. pneumoniae pulmonary infection to institute basic infection control measures, including droplet transmission precautions.
