Pancreatic ascites is a somewhat rare entity that results from a pancreatic duct injury, leading to persistent leakage of pancreatic secretions into the peritoneum. The severity of this condition varies widely and is often dependant on the location and degree of ductal injury and any infection in the fluid. While mild cases of pancreatic ascites resolve spontaneously, persistent pancreatic ascites and infection are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment of pancreatic ascites and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing those with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe history and physical exam clues that might lead to consideration of pancreatic ascites.
- Summarize the evaluation of pancreatic ascites.
- Review the management of pancreatic ascites.
- Explain the role of interprofessional team members in optimizing collaboration and communication to ensure patients with pancreatic ascites are recognized early and every effort is made to deliver optimal care, which will lead to enhanced outcomes.
