The majority of hip fractures are the result of a fall in the elderly population. Risk factors for falls in the elderly population are numerous, but those with a strong independent association are a previous history of falls, gait abnormalities, the use of walking aids, vertigo, Parkinson disease, and antiepileptic medications.

Hip fractures that occur in younger adults are often the result of high-energy trauma. These patients are likely to have incurred multiple injuries and should be assessed and managed appropriately as per local trauma guidelines.

Around 5% of hip fractures have no history of trauma, and in these cases, an alternative cause should be suspected.
