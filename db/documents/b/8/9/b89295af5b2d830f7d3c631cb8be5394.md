Adult hookworms live in the intestines of dogs and cats. Eggs are shed in feces and after deposition into the soil hatch within one day. Over the course of the proceeding week, these develop into infective larvae. Worms respond to physical vibration and increased temperature and move in a snake-like fashion. Upon contacting a host organism, penetrate the corneal layer by secreting a hyaluronidase. Despite burrowing through the superficial cutaneous layers, they are unable to penetrate the basal membrane to enter lymphatics are, therefore, are unable to complete their lifecycle. Hookworms subsequently die without reproducing, and disease is self-limited.
