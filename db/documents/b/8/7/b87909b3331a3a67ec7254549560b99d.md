HAPE typically occurs 2 to 5 days after arrival at altitude. It has an insidious onset with a non-productive cough, decreased exercise tolerance, chest pain, and exertional dyspnea. Without treatment, it can progress to dyspnea at rest and severe exertional dyspnea. A cough may become productive of pink and frothy sputum or frank blood. The patient also may have rales or wheezes, central cyanosis, tachypnea, and/or tachycardia. SpO2 is often 10% less than expected for altitude, and the patient often will appear better than expected given their level of hypoxemia and SpO2 value, which typically resides around 40% to 70%.
