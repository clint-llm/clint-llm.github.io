A detailed history and physical examination are obtained prior to proceeding with ablative laser therapy.

Patients should be assessed for any contraindications (i.e., history of keloidal scarring, recent oral isotretinoin therapy, sites of scleroderma, radiation, etc.) prior to initiation of therapy. They should also be informed of the risks, and a discussion regarding expectations of therapy should take place at the pre-procedure visit.

Pre-procedure photographs should be obtained in the standard facial views (i.e., frontal, lateral, oblique, both smiling and non-smiling).

Prophylaxis with antivirals including acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir is recommended to reduce the risk of reactivation of facial herpes infection, starting before treatment and continuing for several days after. An example regimen is valacyclovir 50 mg PO BID x14 days, beginning either the day before or the morning of the procedure.

Pre-procedure topical tretinoin may help prime the skin for quicker healing after ablation.

Prophylactic therapy for bacterial and fungal infections is controversial and not universally recommended.
