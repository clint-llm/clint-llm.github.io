Gross intratumoral or peritumoral hemorrhage strongly suggests solid pseudopapillary pancreatic neoplasm.  Calcification is relatively common in SPENs and may be seen either peripherally or within the center of the lesion. Unenhanced computerized tomography typically shows calcifications in the tumors. The iodinated contrast imaging shows clear enhancement during the arterial phase that persists during the portal and late phases. Hemorrhage contained within a mixed solid and cystic tumor is a characteristic feature of SPENs. These tumors are not associated with elevation of tumor markers such as CA 19-9 or CEA.
