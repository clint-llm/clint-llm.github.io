Interprofessional team-based clinics have shown promise in improving health outcomes. Pediatric interprofessional aerodigestive clinics are a common example of this model of patient care. In this setting, nurse educators assist in educating the patient and family. Multiple medical specialists work with the nursing staff in coordinating care. The pharmacist provides guidance in antibiotic selection and monitoring for side effects. In a recent longitudinal case series of patients with persistent symptoms after evaluation and treatment by a single specialist, 73% of patients showed significant improvement in their presenting symptoms after treatment at an interprofessional aerodigestive clinic.

While each medical professional certainly has his or her role to play in providing excellent patient care, it is important to consider the collective benefit of a more collaborative team-based approach to providing comprehensive medical care.
