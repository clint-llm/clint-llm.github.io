The treatment of an obturator hernia would invariably involve co-ordination of care from different grades of healthcare professionals. The emergency department will most likely be the first point of contact for these patients. The presentation of any individual with severe abdominal pain and bowel obstruction warrants a thorough investigation with appropriate blood tests and imaging. However, the patient should be of the utmost importance in these cases, and they will most likely be in severe pain. Appropriate communication between the physicians and the nursing staff to ensure the delivery of analgesia is essential. The placement of a nasogastric tube might be warranted in cases of intestinal obstruction.

Radiologists play an important role in the diagnosis of these cases, and this involves the handover of important information for them to perform an adequate scan. Obturator herniae may be difficult to call on a CT scan, and therefore require the radiologist to be actively looking for it.

The involvement of the surgical team constitutes a major part of patient care - and this especially requires close monitoring from the intensive care and nursing staff within the team. Post-operatively these patients will require close monitoring, keeping in mind the mortality of such cases.
