Most coronary artery anomalies and variants are not hemodynamically significant and are incidental findings on CCTA. However, flow-limiting anomalies can cause signs and symptoms of myocardial ischemia, including chest pain, shortness of breath, and sudden cardiac death. Coronary artery anomalies such as ALCAPA and coronary artery fistula can present in infancy with failure to thrive, chest pain when crying or eating, as well as sweating, dyspnea, and pallor.
