RAIU with I-123 scintigraphy is a useful thyroid test, which provides overall functional information about the thyroid gland, including its activity. In conjunction with laboratory findings, such as the thyroid hormone levels and thyroid-stimulating hormone, and physical examination, and other imaging tests, I-123 RAIU can aid in diagnosing causes of thyrotoxicosis, help in the calculation of I-131 therapy doses, and detect an iodine organification defect in neonatal hypothyroidism.
