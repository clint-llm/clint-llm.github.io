Hematuria is one of the most common presentationsÂ in outpatient and Emergency department. Asymptomatic hematuria is thought to be much more prevalent than symptomatic hematuria.

In about 50% of cases, a cause can be identified. When hematuria presents with proteinuria, this usually signals moderate to severe kidney disease.

In infants and young children, hematuria may signal Wilms tumor, whereas post-infectious glomerulonephritis and malignancy are more common in older individuals.
