Medial epicondyle apophysitis occurs only in children 6-15 years of age due to fusion of the apophyseal ossification center around age 15. Of all youth sports injuries, about half are due to overuse.

In baseball, the prevalence of medial elbow pain increases with age, and the prevalence of medial epicondyle apophysitis peaks between the ages of 11Â to 12, with a rate of about 30 percent. X-ray screening of Little League Baseball regional and national championship contenders showed that 57 percent had radiographic evidence of medial epicondyle displacement.
