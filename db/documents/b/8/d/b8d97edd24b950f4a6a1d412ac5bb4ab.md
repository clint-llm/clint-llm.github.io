Methadone is a synthetic opioid and full agonist at the μ-opioid receptor and induces other opioid receptors. The μ-opioid receptors, located in the CNS (e.g., brainstem, locus coeruleus, periaqueductal gray matter) and parts of the gastrointestinal tract, act to modulate various neurochemical activities involved in analgesia, euphoria, and sedation. Activation of the μ-receptors by methadone activates the same pathways. It induces downstream effects via G-protein signaling, including inhibition of neuronal transmission of pain afferents from the spinal cord, producing analgesic effects, and receptor internalization and recycling, contributing to less opioid tolerance in patients.

Methadone is also a noncompetitive antagonist to the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, possibly further adding to its benefits for neuropathic pain.
