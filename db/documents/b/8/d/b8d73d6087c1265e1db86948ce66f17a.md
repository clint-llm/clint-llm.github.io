Isotretinoin is an oral medication derived from vitamin A that is primarily used to treat severe acne. Its package insert recommends baseline lipid and hepatic panels followed by repeat testing weekly or biweekly until the response has been established. However, a recent meta-analysis demonstrated that increases in triglycerides or cholesterol levels typically occur within the first 8 weeks of therapy with minimal to no change after that. The data was not sufficient enough to conclude an early rise in liver function tests, although it was determined that elevated liver function values were rarely high risk. Based on these findings, evidence from the meta-analysis does not support monthly laboratory testing for standard doses of oral isotretinoin.
