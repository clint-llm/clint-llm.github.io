There are 4 FDA-approved, first-line treatments for chronic phase CML that are commercially available tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including first-generation imatinib and second-generation dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib.

**Dosing**

- Imatinib: 400 mg daily

- Bosutinib: 500 mg daily

- Dasatinib: 100 mg daily

- Nilotinib: 300 mg twice a day

ForÂ chronic phase, CML with intermediate- or high-risk score, second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (bosutinib, dasatinib, nilotinib) as first-line therapy may have an additional benefit over imatinib.

Ponatinib, a third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, dosed at 45 mg daily, is a third-line treatment option in chronic phase CML for patients who have failed to respond to multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors and for individuals who have the T315I mutation.

Advanced CML (accelerated or blast phase) has additional therapeutic considerations. Second- or third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy should be initiated to reduce the CML burden and be considered for early allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).

Allogenic HSCT should be considered in patients resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in chronic phase CML and cases of advanced CML.

Clinical trial participation should be considered for all patients.
