Abdominal aortic repair is a major surgical procedure done to treat an aortic aneurysm. Elective surgery on an abdominal aortic aneurysm is indicated when an aneurysm is four or five cm or larger. Usually, the aneurysm is resected, and the aorta is replaced with a tube graft. Alternatively, an endograft may be placed, the femoral artery is accessed, and the graft is placed across the aorta under fluoroscopic guidance. This activity reviews the indication, contraindication, technique, and complications of both methods and the role of the healthcare team.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the different approaches for treating abdominal aortic aneurysms. 
- Review the complications of the different treatment approaches for abdominal aortic aneurysms. 
- Summarize the indications for treating an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
- Describe the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interdisciplinary team to improve outcomes for patients affected by an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
