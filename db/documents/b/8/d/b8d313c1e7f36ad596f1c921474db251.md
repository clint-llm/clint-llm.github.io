**Technique Considerations**

- Care must be taken to not artificially raise the intraocular pressure by pressing on the eyelid during IOP measurement. Ensure the patient is comfortable and not attempting to squint, as this can raise IOP.

- Ensure that the patient is appropriately positioned for the specific tonometry method (seated versus supine). Table-top methods such as GAT can only be used in upright and seated patients. Rebound (I-Care) tonometry can only be used in the horizontal plane.

- Clean and disinfect all contact tonometers between patients unless they utilize disposable covers. This assists in preventing disease transmission and possible corneal abrasions from residual debris.

- Methods that rely on applanation are affected by the central corneal thickness and other biomechanical properties such as elasticity and hysteresis.

- GAT currently remains the gold standard technique in measuring IOP, especially in managing patients with OHT, risk factors, and in therapy for glaucoma. Elevated IOP measurements taken with alternative tonometers should be confirmed with GAT.
