Soft-tissue infections associated with Pasteurella multocida generally have an uncomplicated course and resolve with appropriate treatment. Infections in the hand, however, have a worse prognosis due to high rates of complication. Possible complications that may lead to long-term morbidity include tenosynovitis, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis.

In more serious presentations such as bacteremia, meningitis, and endocarditis, the prognosis is significantly worse. Mortality is 25% to 30% in these conditions.
