Complications include the following

- Persistent Infection - Persistently positive results of cultures of CSF after 4 weeks of proven antifungal therapy at an established effective dose is a reasonable starting point.

- Relapsed Infection (based upon two main characteristics)

- The recovery of viable Cryptococci from a previously checked sterile body site is essential.
- Recrudescence of signs and symptoms at the previous site of disease supports the presence of disease.

- Elevated CSF Pressure - Acute elevated symptomatic CSF pressure (sometimes due to initial antifungal therapy) should be managed rapidly by decompression via repeated lumbar taps, transitory lumbar drainage catheter, or ventriculostomy in some patients.

- Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS):

- Unmasking IRIS, in which cryptococcal symptoms appear after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy.
- Paradoxical IRIS during the treatment of cryptococcosis and administration of antiretroviral therapy.

Cerebral cryptococcomas can cause significant short- and long-term neurological complications. They are hard to treat and normally require a long-term antifungal therapy.

Hydrocephalus is a later complication and can present as dementia or chronic headache.
