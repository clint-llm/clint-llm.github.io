**Physiotherapy**

Nerve rehabilitation should provide for the use of electrostimulation to the sternocleidomastoid and the trapezius muscles. Specific exercises to actively stimulate the muscles should be added as well as proprioceptive exercises.

**Osteopathy**

An osteopathic approach could improve the sliding of the tissues in the presence of scars. It could be useful to reduce the presence of pain or high levels of inflammation in the blood as studies show in other pathological conditions.
