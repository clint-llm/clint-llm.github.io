AI can be primary, secondary, or tertiary depending on etiology. Primary AI is also called Addison disease (AD) named after Thomas Addison, who described it first in 1855. Primary AI (AD) may be caused by autoimmunity, genetic factors, infection, hemorrhage, metastasis, or drugs.

Central AI could be secondary to decreased adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) secretion from the pituitary (secondary AI) or decreased corticotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus (tertiary AI). Exogenous steroids cause decreased ACTH secretion and thus secondary AI. Central AI is much more common than primary AI, and prevalence is estimated to be 150 to 280 per million.

The term relative AI was introduced in 1991 by Rothwell et al. for decreased responsiveness of adrenals after injecting 250 mcg corticotropin in critically ill patients.
