The initial evaluation is based largely on results of a thorough history and physical examination. A complete blood count with differential to assess for leukocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia along with other hematologic abnormalities should be completed in all patients. A fasting plasma glucose or hemoglobin A1C to assess for diabetes mellitus should be performed. If infectious etiology is suspected erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and blood cultures may be indicated. A transthoracic echocardiogram is an important initial diagnostic test if endocarditis is suspected. Additional tests such as HIV antibody testing, imaging studies or peripheral blood smear should be considered if indicated based on presenting symptoms and physical examination findings.
