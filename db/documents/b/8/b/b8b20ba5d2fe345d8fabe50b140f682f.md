In general, an interprofessional approach to patient care among interprofessional health professionals should be the goal for every healthcare facility. The key to implementing this is to utilize an evidence-based approach across all levels of care. In the setting of renal trauma, there is evidence of this collaborative effort in how the management of renal trauma has changed to a more renal salvage approach in light of supporting data and advancement in procedural techniques. Most frequently, the trauma surgeons are the clinicians encountering traumatic renal injuries and are very equipped in knowledge and experience in the management of these injuries. However, in the surgical setting where a nephrectomy may be questionable, it is best to involve the urological service to increase the probability of preserving the kidney when feasible. Urological specialty nursing can perform monitoring, assess therapeutic effectiveness, and keep the team informed of progress or lack of the same. Finally, upon discharge from the hospital or trauma service, post-renal trauma patients should have routine follow up with their primary care physician (possibly for life), especially if high-grade injury or post-nephrectomy, to monitor for hypertension. Therefore, it is important to educate the patient and involve social services as needed to help the patient achieve the best outcome given his or her injury.
