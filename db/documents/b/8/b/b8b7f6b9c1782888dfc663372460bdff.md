A high index of suspicion is required to make a prompt diagnosis of PSS. The finding of a unilateral markedly elevated IOP out of proportion with the level of intraocular inflammation with an open anterior chamber angle should raise the suspicion of PSS. Patient education is critical to prevent long periods of elevated IOP during attacks, resulting in earlier complications. Patients should be informed of the recurrent nature of the disease and advised to seek ophthalmologic consultation if symptoms of relapse such as mild ocular discomfort, pain, or blurry vision occur between periods of remission. Because some acute episodes may go unnoticed due to the mild nature of the uveitis, clinic appointments should be kept, and delays should be avoided in seeing PSS patients, especially those at risk of developing complications such as GON, NAION, and ischemic optic atrophy. Prophylactic treatment should be discussed with at-risk patients and escalation to surgical treatment provided if needed.
