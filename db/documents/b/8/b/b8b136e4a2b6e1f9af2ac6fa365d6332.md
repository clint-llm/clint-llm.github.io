LM often presents as an irregular brown macule or patch on chronically sun-damaged skin in the elderly. Lesions are light-brown to black, may display color variegation, may appear asymmetric, and tend to have an ill-defined border. As lesions enlarge, they may develop skip areas with a patchy, non-contiguous pattern. Lesions are usually asymptomatic, although advanced tumors may produce pain, burning, itching, or bleeding. The majority of cases (86%) occur on the head/neck, with a predilection for the cheek.

Due to its in situ nature, LM is typically smooth and non-palpable. If the lesion becomes invasive (LMM), then a papular or dermal component may be felt. LM exhibits slow radial growth and might be misdiagnosed for years or even decades as solar lentigo or other benign lesions (see Differential Diagnosis section).
