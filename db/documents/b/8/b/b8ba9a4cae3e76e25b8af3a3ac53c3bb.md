Workup for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus will begin with the determination that the patient has an underlying infectious disease process. Next, each potential source of infection needs to be evaluated. Specimens from the potential source should be sent for routine cultures before administration of empiric antibiotics to determine the exact species and drug susceptibilities. Sensitivities for fosfomycin, daptomycin, nitrofurantoin, and chloramphenicol are not standard in all laboratories and should be added as clinically appropriate.
