**Opioid Tolerance**

Tolerance is a phenomenon in which an increasing dose of the medication is required to produce the same pharmacologic effect. The body develops tolerance after repeated administration, andÂ higher doses of opioids are required to maintain the same level of analgesia. Tolerance develops quickly to sedation, respiratory depression, analgesia, and gastrointestinal distress. However, there is minimal tolerance to constipation and miosis. Tolerance develops by various mechanisms such as desensitization, downregulation, receptor internalization, and mu/delta heterodimer formation.
