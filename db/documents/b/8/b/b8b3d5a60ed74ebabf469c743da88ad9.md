Neuroendocrine tumors are relatively rare tumors. As mentioned above, only about 10% of neuroendocrine tumors result in carcinoid syndrome. According to Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER), the age-adjusted incidence of nonpancreatic neuroendocrine tumors is 4.7 per 100,000. The incidence of neuroendocrine tumors has been rising. The incidence of neuroendocrine tumors, including nonpancreatic and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, increased from 1.09 to 5.25/100,000 between 1973 through 2004 (per data from SEER). This increase in incidence in the past decades is likely due to an increased number of endoscopic and radio-imaging studies. Incidence varies by gender and race. Recent data suggest the incidence of neuroendocrine tumors is higher in black males compared to Caucasians (6.46 versus 4.6/100,000). The ratio of tumor incidence among male and female is almost equal with slightly higher in a male. The median age of diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumors is between 55 and 60.
