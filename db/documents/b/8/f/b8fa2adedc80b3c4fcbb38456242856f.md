Muscarinic receptors are G-coupled protein receptors involved in the parasympathetic nervous system. The only exception to these receptors is the sweat glands, which possess muscarinic receptors but are part of the sympathetic nervous system. They are named due to their increased sensitivity to muscarine, a component found in certain species of mushrooms.
