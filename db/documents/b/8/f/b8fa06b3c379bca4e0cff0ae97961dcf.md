A correct approach towards diagnosing vascular lesions of the orbit is pivotal in determining the most appropriate management option.

**Hemangioma**

As discussed above, recognizing infantile hemangioma and its differentiation from congenital hemangioma is vital as the preferred line of treatment differs. Medical management, primarily beta-blockers, namely oral propranolol and topical timolol maleate, forms the mainstay of treatment of IH. The child must undergo a comprehensive cardiac evaluation before initiation of therapy. As per the IH guidelines, a trial of atenolol therapy can be given in patients where propranolol is contraindicated or not tolerated. Gel-forming solution of timolol is as effective as systemic therapy with negligible life-threatening complications.

Before the advent of beta-blocker use, systemic and intralesional steroid therapy was the first line of management. Intralesional sclerosing agents, such as bleomycin, are reserved for patients unresponsive to propranolol therapy and are seldom used as the initial mode of treatment. The role of intralesional bevacizumab is unclear, and the drug is under experimental phases. Lasers are not recommended for IH except for treating residual skin changes and scars following resolution.

For congenital hemangioma, there is no proven medical management. Surgical excision, usually performed between 2 to 5 years of age, remains the first line of treatment. For very large NICH, pre-operative embolization by an interventional neuroradiologist prevents the risk of excessive bleed during surgery.

**Vascular Malformations**

**Cavernous Venous Malformation (CVM)**

Observation and periodic follow-up are encouraged in asymptomatic CVMs.

Indications for surgical intervention include:

- Symptomatic CVMs

- Visual loss due to optic nerve compression

- Disfiguring proptosis

- Dystopia

The surgical approach mainly depends upon the anatomic location of the lesion and its relation to the surrounding structures.

Anterior and lateral orbitotomy are performed for malformations not involving the orbital apex.

**Venous and Lymphatic Malformations**

The therapy goals in venous malformations are to reduce the symptoms (persistent pain), improve function (optic neuropathy and corneal exposure leading to visual loss, tense hemorrhage), and achieve acceptable cosmesis. Management options for orbital venous malformations are as follows:

- Observation – for asymptomatic/minimally symptomatic cases

- Surgery – for isolated, localized lesions where complete excision is feasible with minimal morbidity. Surgical can be performed to debulk an extensive lesion or as an adjunct to sclerotherapy

- Sclerotherapy – for extensive facial involvement and lesions not amenable to surgical resection

Intra-operative mapping and glue (n-butyl cyanoacrylate) embolization aid in surgical excision, thereby reducing the risk of rupture and troublesome bleed. Macrocystic lymphatic malformations demonstrate an excellent response to sclerotherapy, whereas microcystic lymphatic malformations, in addition to sclerotherapy, may require surgical intervention. The most commonly used sclerosant is the aqueous bleomycin solution after reconstituting with lignocaine and adrenaline.

Microcystic LMs also respond well to drugs like sirolimus. If microcystic LMs extend into the orbital apex, the lesion can be truncated to avoid the risk of functional damage following complete excision. Surgical decapping of the cysts may occasionally be performed in cases of hemorrhagic macrocystic lesions.

**A-V Malformations (AVMs)**

A crisp understanding of the hemodynamics of AVMs facilitates decision-making regarding the appropriate management strategy. A combined approach involving pre-operative embolization with subsequent resection of the nidus is the preferred line of management. Caution should be maintained to completely resect the nidus to prevent recurrence, as a recurrent AVM grows exponentially and is more cumbersome to treat. Not all AVMs are amenable to resection. Some of these can be managed conservatively as they may carry significant surgical morbidity and iatrogenic risk of damaging surrounding structures. Specific indications of surgical excision include recurrent hemorrhage, pain, and associated visual disturbances.

Successful closure of high-flow direct CCFs can be achieved with minimal morbidity using recently emerged endovascular techniques. Endovascular embolization via transarterial route into the cavernous sinus, using materials such as detachable balloon, n-butyl cyanoacrylate, or ethyl vinyl alcohol polymer, is the preferred management strategy. Recently, due to the non-availability of detachable balloons, coiling has emerged as the treatment modality of choice.

Dural fistulas are frequently managed via a conservative approach as approximately 70% of these close spontaneously due to localized thrombosis of the superior ophthalmic vein. In the absence of high-risk features, a conservative approach is the first line of treatment, including observation, intermittent carotid compression, or IOP-lowering agents.

While performing carotid massage, it is advisable to use the contralateral hand to compress the ipsilateral ICA. This is because if cerebral ischemia occurs due to resultant low arterial pressure, contralateral hemiparesis will itself release the pressure on the artery, simulating a feedback circuit. Carotid compression in the presence of atherosclerotic disease further aggravates the risk of stroke due to pre-existing carotid insufficiency. The additional technique involves superomedial SOV compression in these cases.

**Indications of Intervention in Dural AVFs**

- Persistent diplopia

- Uncontrollable IOP

- Severe proptosis with exposure keratopathy

- Optic neuropathy

- Ischemic retinopathy

- Cortical venous drainage from fistula

- Severe bruit (rare)

The endovascular approach for dural AVFs is similar to high flow CCFs.
