Ocular biometry refers to the measurement of anatomical dimensions of the eye, which include corneal curvature (keratometry), axial length, and anterior chamber depth. These measurements are primarily used to calculate the appropriate power of the intraocular lens (IOL) to be implanted during cataract surgery.

Given the technological advances in cataract surgery, and the introduction of premium intraocular lens implants, patient expectations continue to rise, and refractive error following cataract surgery is no longer tolerated. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to obtain accurate biometric readings to optimize postoperative refractive outcomes.

This article will discuss the different modalities used for ocular biometry, the biometric parameters that are important for calculating the intraocular lens implant, and the variables that can affect the accuracy of the measurements.
