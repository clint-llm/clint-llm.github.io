Environmental, genetic, and antigenic factors appear to contribute to the etiology of Henoch-Schönlein purpura. Many patients report a preceding infection. Upper respiratory tract infections are the most common; however, patients may also present with a previous gastrointestinal or pharyngeal infection.

Group A Streptococcus has been found in cultures of greater than 30% of patients with Henoch-Schönlein nephritis.Mycoplasma, parvovirus B19, Campylobacter, Varicella, and adenoviruses have also been known to precede the development of Henoch-Schönlein purpura.
