Spontaneous coronary artery dissection mainly occurs in a healthier and younger, fairly active patient population without the traditional cardiac risk factors. It does have a significant risk for recurrence. It is important to inform patients about warning signs like diaphoresis, shortness of breath, palpitations, chest pain and they should be advised to seek medical attention immediately. Prognosis depends on controlling underlying risk factors like hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. For patients who survive the initial presentation of SCAD, prognosis remains good. Patients should be advised to seek a close, long term clinical follow-up.

Recommendations regarding subsequent pregnancy in patients with SCAD are limited. Patients considering a subsequent pregnancy must be managed in tertiary cancer centers under the care of a multi-disciplinary team.

Due to a possible association with female sex hormones, hormonal contraception should be avoided with preferred contraceptive methods including vasectomy in the male partner, tubal ligation, and intrauterine devices with local delivery of progestin (levonorgestrel 20 Î¼g/d).
