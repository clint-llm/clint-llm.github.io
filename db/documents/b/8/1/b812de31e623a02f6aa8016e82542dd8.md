Androgenetic alopecia is very common, and for both females and males, the problem is poor cosmesis. The condition is frequently encountered in the dermatology clinic. Most patients are embarrassed to seek medical help and often turn to the internet for remedies. The key to this disorder is patient education. The pharmacist is in the prime position to educate the public on the causes and treatment of androgenetic alopecia. While some men progress to complete baldness within a few years, other may have patterned thinning of the scalp. Women tend to lose hair on the crown and rarely develop complete baldness. Once hair is lost, the scalp is exposed to the UV rays of the sun, and there is accumulating evidence that this increases the risk of actinic keratosis. More important, in males androgenetic alopecia is associated with a higher risk of adverse cardiac events. In females, androgenetic alopecia has been linked to polycystic ovarian disease. Despite the availability of a number of medications and hair transplant, neither works well, and the results are unpredictable. For patients who are not bothered by the hair thinning, simple assurance that this is a benign disorder is all that is required. Clinicians, nurses, and pharmacist need to work together to educate patients about this disturbing problem.
