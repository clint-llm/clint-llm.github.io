The pathophysiology of carcinoid syndrome is based on biologically active amines and peptides entering the systemic circulation and escaping the first-pass metabolism of the liver. Usually, these bioactive products are inactivated in the liver. However, in the cases of neuroendocrine tumors with liver metastasis, either these bioactive products directly enter into the systemic circulation, or they are not inactivated due to deranged liver function.

Less frequently, carcinoid syndrome can occur without liver metastasis in conditions, such as primary gut tumor with widespread retroperitoneal nodal metastases, ovarian tumor, or bronchial carcinoid, which release bioactive amines directly into the systemic circulation.

Neuroendocrine tumors release approximately 40 types of biologically active amines and peptides. The most common ones are serotonin, histamine, tachykinins, kallikrein, and prostaglandins.

Usually, only 1% of dietary tryptophan is metabolized into serotonin. However, in the cases of neuroendocrine tumors, up to 70% of tryptophan is metabolized into serotonin. Serotonin undergoes oxidative reactions that lead to the formation of 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) with the help of aldehyde dehydrogenase, which is then eliminated in the urine.

Serotonin causes increased motility and excessive secretion of the gastrointestinal tract leading to diarrhea. As most of the tryptophan is diverted to the serotonin formation pathway by neuroendocrine tumors, it results in a deficiency of tryptophan, which is needed for the synthesis of niacin. Consequently, deficiency of niacin leads to Pellagra, which manifests as a triad of dermatitis, dementia, and diarrhea. Prostaglandins also play their part in increased intestinal motility and fluid secretion in the gastrointestinal tract, causing diarrhea.

Neuroendocrine tumors of the foregut and lungs lack the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, which metabolizes 5-hydroxytryptophan to serotonin. Thus, the neuroendocrine tumors of lungs and foregut do not produce serotonin. On the other hand, hindgut neuroendocrine tumors usually do not produce any bioactive hormone.

Pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors mainly produce histamine, which can cause atypical flushing and pruritus. Tachykinins (substance p, neurokinin A, neuropeptide k) are also responsible for causing flushing due to their vasodilatory effect.
