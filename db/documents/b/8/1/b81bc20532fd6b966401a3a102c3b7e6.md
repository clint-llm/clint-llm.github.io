**Training**

Education and training by various seminars showed to be effective in training medical students for empathic communication; therefore, training of health care professionals is essential to prepare them for excellent patient care.

**Nursing**

Empathy for nursing is describable as both a human trait and a professional state. Empathy plays a vital role in decision making to deliver patient-centered care.

**Understanding and Educating**

As empathic responses may be dysfunctional in patients with Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia, the professional that deals with these patients need to be trained/educated to understand empathic behavior and deliver proper care for these specific cases.
