The musculoskeletal and nervous systems are the major organ systems treated with strain counterstain and facilitated positional release techniques. The musculoskeletal system, including their proprioceptors, and the local release of cytokines that can create nociceptive pain is responsible for the tender-points treated in SCS and FPR. Additionally, the stretch reflex and gamma-motor neurons that are part of the nervous system are integral to the muscle spindle's function.
