Fecal impaction occurs because of hardened fecal matter retained in the large bowel which cannot be evacuated by regular peristaltic activity. If this is not recognized and treated early, it can give rise to the formation of fecoliths, or stone-like feces. Fecal impaction is a cause for increased morbidity and a significant cause of a decrease in quality of life among the elderly. This activity reviews the causes, pathophysiology and presentation of fecal impaction and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of fecal impaction.
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with fecal impaction.
- Summarize the treatment options for fecal impaction.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by fecal impaction.
