Initial evaluation after history and physical exam should include a complete blood count (CBC) as well as a complete metabolic panel (CMP) as this will further evaluate for any potential hematologic or electrolyte sequelae from NSCLC. This could include hypercalcemia or elevated alkaline phosphatase in the setting of bony metastasis. Imaging should begin with a chest radiograph as the presentation of NSCLC can be nonspecific. If lung cancer is suspected, further evaluation with computed tomography (CT) imaging would likely be warranted to further characterize the pathology noted on the chest radiograph.

Tissue biopsy will be needed for histopathologic and immunohistochemistry evaluation to form the diagnosis of NSCLC. Once a diagnosis is made, a CT chest and upper abdomen to include the adrenals should be ordered to assess for metastatic disease, and a positron emission tomography (PET) scan can be utilized to further stage the patient for the extent of disease and treatment. Also, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is needed to assess for brain metastasis to complete the disease staging.
