**Initial Management**

The management of VIPoma involves medical management and surgery.

- Initial medical management is aimed mainly at controlling the symptoms and prompt and aggressive replacement of fluids and electrolytes.

- Somatostatin analogs like octreotide and lanreotide inhibit secretion of VIP and are used for symptomatic control. Octreotide is usually started at 50 to 100 mcg subcutaneous every 8 hours and titrated for symptom control. A long-acting formulation of octreotide is initiated at a dose of 20 mg intramuscularly (IM) monthly and titrated as needed for optimal symptom control.

- Glucocorticoids are used in patients refractory to somatostatin analogs

- Interferon-alpha has also been used in patients in patients not responding to the above medications.

- Complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice for primary tumors and is usually a distal pancreatectomy. If the tumor cannot be excised completely, surgical debulking may provide palliative benefit

**Management of Metastatic/Progressive Disease**

Metastases at the time of detection of VIPoma have been noted in as high as 60% of the cases

Surgical resection of the liver is indicated in cases of liver metastases in the absence of diffuse involvement of both the lobes, decreased liver function, or extrahepatic metastases.

Radiofrequency ablation and cryoablation have also been the choice of the modality of treatment in cases of small metastases less than 3 cm

Systemic chemotherapy is a treatment modality used in patients with large, bulky tumors or patients extrahepatic metastases. A combination regimen with streptozocin or temozolomide-based regimen has been tried

Novel agents like sunitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, are approved in the United States for treatment of advanced, well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors including VIPomas
