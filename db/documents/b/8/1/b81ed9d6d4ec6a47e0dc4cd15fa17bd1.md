Gastric cancer can lead to loss of appetite and weight loss. Cancer in the stomach can lead to ascites, causing fluid build-up in the abdomen, leading to the patient feeling pressure on their abdomen and shortness of breath.   Metastases are also a complication of advanced gastric cancer. Common sites for gastric cancer metastases include the lungs, liver, or bones. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy can cause adverse effects for some patients.
