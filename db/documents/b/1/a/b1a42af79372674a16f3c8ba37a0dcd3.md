Any decrease in perceived fetal movement should be followed up by the healthcare provider with a non-stress test. This non-invasive test can evaluate fetal movement and fetal heart rate accelerations. A reactive non-stress test must have accelerations of the fetal heart of a specific size, duration, and frequency. This includes at least three fetal heart tone (FHT) accelerations, which are at least 15 beats per minute above the baseline and last at least 15 seconds, all within a 20-minute window. A non-reactive non-stress test, one that does not have the three accelerations, could indicate fetal sleep or fetal compromise, and further testing should be done. Usually, the non-stress test is first extended for a longer time to determine if the lack of accelerations was just due to fetal sleep. If the non-stress test continues to be non-reactive, then a BPP (biophysical profile) is often completed. This is an ultrasound of the fetus to assess fetal breathing movement, fetal movement of the body or limbs, fetal tone, and amniotic fluid volume. If this test does not reassure the healthcare provider, then the delivery of the fetus should be considered.
