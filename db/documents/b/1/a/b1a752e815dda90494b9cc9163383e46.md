The pathophysiology of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) remains evasive, as no specific studies have been conducted, and it is hypothesized that pathways involved in IPF or CTD-ILD would be involved in IPAF. It is generally considered that pathophysiological studies are challenging to design in the absence of clear diagnostic boundaries, and especially in the lack of consensus regarding IPAF being an entity.

In a study by Newton et al., differences were found between patients with IPAF and those with IPF or CTD-ILD about leukocyte telomere length, MUC5B polymorphism, but not TOLLIP polymorphism.
