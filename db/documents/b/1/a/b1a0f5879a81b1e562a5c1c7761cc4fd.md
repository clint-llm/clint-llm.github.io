Locked-in syndrome is caused by any lesion affecting the ventral pons, and midbrain; this includes vascular lesions, masses, infections, traumas, and demyelinating disorders.

**Vascular**

The most common cause is a vascular complication in the form of a hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke. A study by Patterson and Brabois (1986) reviewed a total of 139 cases of locked-in syndrome between 1959-1983 and divided cases into vascular and nonvascular causes.

**Trauma**

Traumatic brain injury has been reported as the second-largest cause of LIS after vascular etiologies.

**Mass**

Masses affecting the ventral pons or caudal ventral midbrain can precipitate the locked-in syndrome. Fibrillary astrocytoma, pontine reticulum cell sarcoma, metastasis from an adenocarcinoma of the lung, and metastasis from a malignant melanoma have previously been reported in the literature as precipitating causes.

**Infection**

Infection is a rare cause of LIS with a limited amount of cases published in the literature. One case reports a LIS stemming from a Pseudomonas predominant pontine abscess.

**Demyelination**

LIS can be caused by metabolic demyelination, most notably from central pontine myelinolysis, which is a result of the rapid correction of hyponatremia.
