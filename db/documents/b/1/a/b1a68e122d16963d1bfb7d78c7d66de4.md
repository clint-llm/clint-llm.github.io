**Total vs. Partial Meniscectomy**

The goal of surgical treatment of meniscal tears is to relieve pain, prevent degeneration of the knee joint, and allow improvement of activities of daily living. Total meniscectomy was the preferred surgical treatment until the 1970s when it became apparent that complete meniscectomy might lead to increased arthritic changes within the knee joint. As a result, there has been a shift toward a partial meniscectomy and arthroscopic meniscal repair to avoid degenerative changes that previously occurred with complete meniscectomy.

The basis for surgical candidacy relies on the type of meniscal injury because of the limited blood supply the meniscus receives. Flaps, radial tears, and degenerative tears are not surgical candidates. Interestingly, concomitant ACL and meniscal repair have a 90% success rate after two years compared to a 50 to 65% success rate of isolated meniscal repair. The current hypothesis is that the bleeding caused by surgery promotes improved healing.

**Arthroscopic Repair**

Arthroscopic meniscus repair is favorable among the younger athletic population and has demonstrated clinically significant results. Arthroscopic repair involves utilizing sutures to stitch together torn portions of the meniscus. A study by Nakayama et al. demonstrated that 14 out of 18 medial meniscus cases returned to play at 5.5 months.

**Transplantation**

Allograft transplantation has also been found of value in patients who have undergone a partial or complete medial meniscectomy. Indications for transplant include pain at the medial meniscal compartment with a complete meniscal tear. Patients are expected to make a total return to painless activity. Synthetic implants are another alternative for patients who have had a partial meniscectomy. The goal with implants is to create a regenerated meniscus using an absorbable model.
