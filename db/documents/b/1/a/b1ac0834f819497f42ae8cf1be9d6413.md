Diagnosis of clostridial myonecrosis is clinical. A patient with excruciating pain at the site of traumatic injury, systemic symptoms such as fever and tachycardia, and gas within the soft tissue is supportive. Definitive diagnosis requires microscopic identification of large gram-variable rods (gram-positive rods when seen in culture) obtained from the wound. Exudate is not purulent, and neutrophils are absent as well.
