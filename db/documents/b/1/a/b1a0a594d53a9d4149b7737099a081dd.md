While administering etoposide, the healthcare team members must consider the different factors that could affect a patient's side effect profile. There was a noted correlation between age and leukopenia/neutropenia risk in patients with normal organ function.Â An increase in age was also associated with a decrease in drug clearance, as well as an increase in drug AUC.

Patients with low serum albumin concentrations may have worsening hematological adverse reactions. Patients with normal albumin levels that had elevated liver enzyme levels could demonstrate an increase in the incidence of neutropenia.
