There are no specific criteria for surveillance of patients with chronically occluded ICA, nor are there criteria to specify the degree of ECA stenosis by duplex ultrasound. A reasonable regimen is to follow the patient clinically every six months to a year, with or without a duplex study. The development of symptoms indicates investigation with imaging of some kind to see if cerebrovascular revascularization is indicated.
