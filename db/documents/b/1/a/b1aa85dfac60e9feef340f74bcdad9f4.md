Key components of the MacConkey medium include crystal violet dye, bile salts, lactose, and neutral red (pH indicator). Crystal violet dye and bile salts halt the growth of gram-positive bacteria. This allows only gram-negative species to form colonies on MAC agar.

Based on the ability to ferment lactose, different species will yield colonies in varying appearance on a MacConkey medium. This gives McConkey agar its differentiating property.

- Lactose (Lac) positive (pink colonies):

- 
              
- Lactose fermenting species will grow pink colonies. Lactose fermentation will produce acidic byproducts that lower the pH, and this turns the pH indicator to pink.
              
              
- Example of Lac positive species: Escherichia coli, Enterobacteria, Klebsiella

- Lac negative (white colonies)

- 
              
- Gram-negative bacterial species will still form colonies, but colonies will have a white appearance as there will be no change in pH in the absence of lactose fermentation.
              
              
- Example of Lac negative species: Salmonella, Proteus, Yersinia, Pseudomonas

- No colonies:

- 
              
- Gram-positive bacteria will not form any colonies on MacConkey medium.

- Slow:

- 
              
- Weak lactose fermenters will form colonies slower than the rest.  
              
              
- Example of slow lac fermenters: Serratia, Citrobacter

- Mucoid: (sticky, wet colonies)

- 
              
- Encapsulated bacteria produce capsules using lactose. This gives sticky, wet-appearing colonies.
              
              
- Example of mucoid colony-forming species: Klebsiella, enterobacter
