**Lower Urinary Tract**

The lower urinary tract has two primary functions: to store and void urine. Regulation of these two functions requires precise but complex neuronal control. Any disruption to this neuronal control system can result in a "neurogenic bladder" (voiding dysfunction). Significant voiding dysfunction can also appear in the absence of any identifiable neurologic lesions.

**Efferent Pathways of Lower Urinary Tract**

Parasympathetic preganglionic fibers originate from the sacral spinal cord, S2-S4. Stimulation of the parasympathetic pathways initiates micturition by causing the bladder detrusor muscle to contract while inhibiting the urethral sphincter. Postganglionic fibers release acetylcholine and synapse with the M2 and M3 receptors in the bladder. M2 receptors are far more abundant in the detrusor, although the contraction of the bladder's smooth muscle is mainly attributed to stimulation of the M3 receptors. Parasympathetic innervation to the urethral smooth muscle that controls the internal urinary sphincter is inhibitory and is mediated by nitric oxide.

Sympathetic preganglionic fibers originate from intermediolateral nuclei in the thoracolumbar region of the spinal cord. Axons will course through the hypogastric nerve and synapse in the inferior mesenteric ganglion, or they will travel through the paravertebral chain and join the pelvic nerves. Sympathetic pathways activation inhibits micturition, causing the detrusor to relax and the urethral sphincter to constrict.

Somatic efferent fibers originate from Onuf's nucleus at S2-S4 and travel as the pudendal nerve to the external urinary sphincter, where they release acetylcholine when activated. The sphincter is composed of skeletal muscle and has cholinergic receptors. When stimulated by acetylcholine, a contraction is elicited, which will inhibit micturition both mechanically and reflexively. The pudendal nerve, together with the hypogastric nerve, also relays sensory input from the bladder neck, urethra, and perineum to the brain and spinal cord.

The guarding reflex protects against accidental leakage from a sudden or involuntary increase in bladder pressure (stress incontinence). During episodes of suddenly increased bladder pressure (coughing, sneezing, standing, or laughing), excitatory afferent fibers signal Onuf's nucleus to activate somatic efferent fibers to contract the external urinary sphincter.

**Afferent Pathways of Lower Urinary Tract**

Sensory information from the bladder travels to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord via the pelvic and hypogastric nerves. Afferent fibers transmit electrical impulses from tension receptors and nociceptors in the bladder wall. Bladder distension is normally mediated by myelinated (AÎ´ type fibers). However, unmyelinated C fibers can become overactive during inflammation and various neurogenic conditions.

Sensory information from the urethra travels to the spinal cord via the pelvic and pudendal nerves. Urethral afferent nerves are activated by the passage of urine through the urethra, enhancing the parasympathetic input to the bladder. This causes a positive feedback mechanism to ensure complete bladder emptying.

Sensory input from the lower urinary tract reaches the pontine micturition center in the brainstem, communicating with the frontal micturition inhibiting center in the cerebrum. This inhibits micturition until voluntary voiding is initiated in the cerebrum by inhibiting the micturition center.

**Rectum and Anal Sphincters**

As the connection between the gastrointestinal tract (GI) and the anus, the rectum acts as both storage and a conduit for stool. The motor component of defecation involves both voluntary and involuntary muscles, while the sensory component is conducted through the pelvic nerves.

**Defecation Reflexes**

Rectoanal sampling, also known as the rectoanal inhibitory reflex, is a temporal reflexive process that occurs every eight to ten minutes when rectal contents are presented to the anal sensory mucosa.

Defecation begins when rectal distension increases to a critical threshold, and this sensory information is relayed to the cerebral cortex.

The external anal sphincter (EAS) is under somatic control from the pudendal nerve.

**Mechanism of Sacral Neuromodulation**

A complete understanding of sacral neuromodulation is yet to be determined as it is likely to have multiple mechanisms of action. The following section provides current theories regarding the proposed mechanisms of action of SNM.

In neurogenic bladder conditions such as multiple sclerosis, meningomyelocele, and spinal cord injury, afferent C fibers can become more active due to neurologic and inflammatory disorders. In these conditions, C fibers can respond to bladder distension and activate voiding reflexes.

As previously described, the urethral guarding reflex protects against stress urinary incontinence. SNM is thought to inhibit the guarding reflex and induce voiding in patients with urinary retention.

Sacral neuromodulation appears to stimulate the relaxation of pelvic floor muscles and the urethra, which helps initiate micturition in patients with impaired bladder pressure, retention, and incomplete emptying.

A possible central mechanism has also been suggested. Refractory overactive bladder patients successfully treated with sacral neuromodulation have shown significant activation of Brodmann's area 9 (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) after SNM treatment.

Additional proposed mechanisms exist for urinary urgency and frequency. It has been suggested that SNM inhibits bladder afferent pathways by stimulating the afferent portion of the pudendal nerve. Incontinence may also be reduced by inhibiting preganglionic neurons of efferent bladder pathways. It is widely accepted that inhibition of the micturition reflex is part of the SNM mechanism because voluntary voiding is maintained throughout therapy.

Precise mechanisms explaining how sacral neuromodulation helps control fecal incontinence are poorly understood. Most research suggests that placement of the SNM lead in the S3 region will cause stimulation of afferent fibers from the anal sphincter, rectum, and pelvic floor. Stimulation of these afferents reduces activation of C fibers during rectal filling, blocking inputs from the rectum to the pontine center.
