As there is no specific treatment St. Louis Encephalitis, and because the disease can cause significant morbidity, prevention of the disease is extremely important. Prevention is best accomplished by avoiding mosquito bites entirely. Even very short periods of outdoor exposure can result in bites; therefore, proper protective clothing like long sleeves, long pants, socks, and closed-toe shoes should be worn. Pant legs can be tucked into socks to prevent bites to exposed ankles. Transmission is common during the warmer months and mosquitoes may bite through very thin clothing so treating clothing with repellents containing permethrin, DEET, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or other EPA-registered insect repellants will reduce this risk. Wading pools should be drained and stored, and tire swings should have holes drilled into the bottom to allow trapped water to drain.
