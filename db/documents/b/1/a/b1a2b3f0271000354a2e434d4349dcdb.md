The primary adverse event associated with all nondepolarizing neuromuscular agents is the extension of the drug's pharmacological effect past the needed time of use, resulting in adverse effects ranging from skeletal muscle weakness to extended muscular paralysis leading to respiratory insufficiency or apnea.

The following serious adverse reactions can occur:

- Prolonged paralysis (seen in long-term use)

- Bronchospasm/respiratory depression

- Apnea

- Anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reaction

Other less common adverse events include:

- Hypotension

- Edema

- Sinus tachycardia

- Erythema

- Urticaria

- Flushing

- Pruritus

- Skin rash

Hypersensitivity associated with histamine release leading to allergic reactions may occur, and in rare instances, life-threatening anaphylaxis may occur. In general, compared to other nondepolarizing neuromuscular-blocking agents such as pancuronium, rocuronium, or atracurium, the safety profile of vecuronium is favorable.
