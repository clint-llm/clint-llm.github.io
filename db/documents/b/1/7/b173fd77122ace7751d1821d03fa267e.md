Although the use of the newer generation drug-eluting stents in the treatment of coronary stenosis with percutaneous coronary intervention has improved outcomes, the occurrence of ISR remains approximately 10%. The following conditions increase the risk of restenosis following stent implantation:

1. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus

2. Continued cigarette smoking

3. High levels of LDL cholesterol

4. Uncontrolled hypertension

5. Renal insufficiency

These conditions should be adequately controlled and monitored. Smoking cessation, moderate exercise, and weight loss are advisable lifestyle interventions.

The metal of the stent scaffold can predispose to blood clot formation within the stent, with severe consequences. Dual antiplatelet therapy [DAPT], aspirin, and a second drug that prevents blood clot formation can help to prevent it, and adherence to DAPT must be per the instructions and duration of the treating cardiologist. Any interruption or cessation of DAPT should be with the approval of a cardiologist.
