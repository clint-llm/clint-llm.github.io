Researchers have developed and improved the bone marrow transplant technique since the first transplant was done in 1984. The technique entails using chemotherapy for conditioning to remove the recipient's cells and replacing them with the donor cells free of sickling. The first transplantation in 1984 used cyclophosphamide at 120mg/kg and fractionated total body irradiation to destroy the patient's bone marrow and replaced it with matched donor stem cells. The patient then received GVHD prophylaxis consisting of a short course of methotrexate and methylprednisolone for 28 days.

There has been an improvement in chemotherapy, including the use of busulfan which was found to sustain engraftment in patients who receive the bone marrow transplant.[4] Various conditioning regimens, as well as post-transplant cyclophosphamide, have improved outcomes in bone marrow transplants.
