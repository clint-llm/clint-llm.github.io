Desmopressin can be administered intravenously, as a subcutaneous injection, as an intranasal spray, and, most recently, as a dissolvable sublingual strip. The tablet form has been discontinued in many countries in favor of the intranasal and sublingual forms due to the latter's superior bioavailability.

The intranasal form of vasopressin is frequently a choice when administration occurs at home.

Sublingual desmopressin, also known as desmopressin lyophilisate, is administered a sublingual melt tablet at a dosage of 120 micrograms.
