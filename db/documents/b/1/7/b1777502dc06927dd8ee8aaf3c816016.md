**Bladder**

Bladder injuries occur more frequently in blunt trauma, with the most common mechanisms being motor vehicle collisions, falls, crush injuries, and blows to the lower abdomen. As mentioned above, pelvic fractures are associated with up to 90% of adult bladder injuries. Bladder injuries are broken into 2 categories: intraperitoneal injury and extraperitoneal injury. Extraperitoneal bladder injuries account for about two-thirds of bladder injuries and are more likely associated with pelvic fractures. Intraperitoneal bladder ruptures are less associated with pelvic fractures at 25%.

American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) Bladder Injury Scale

- I: Contusion, intramural hematoma; partial thickness laceration

- II: Extraperitoneal bladder wall laceration <2 cm

- III: Extraperitoneal bladder wall laceration >2 cm; intra-peritoneal bladder wall laceration <2 cm

- IV: Intraperitoneal bladder wall laceration >2 cm

- V: Intraperitoneal or extraperitoneal bladder laceration extending into the bladder neck or ureteral orifice (trigone)

**Urethra**

Urethral injuries are rare and are more likely to occur in male patients. Almost all injuries are a result of blunt trauma. Urethral injuries occur in up to 10% of pelvic trauma and are referred to as pelvic fracture urethral injury (PFUI).

AAST Urethral Injury Scale

- I: Contusion with blood at urethral meatus and normal urethrography

- II: Stretch injury with elongation of urethra but without extravasation of urethrography contrast

- III: Partial disruption with extravasation of urethrography contrast at the injury site with visualization of contrast in the bladder

- IV: Complete disruption with <2 cm of urethral separation and extravasation of urethrography contrast at injury site without visualization of the bladder

- V: Complete transection with >2 cm urethral separation or extravasation into the vagina or prostate

**Vagina, Uterus, and Ovaries**

Blunt trauma can result in perineal and vaginal injuries; it is uncommon to cause injury to the cervix or non-gravid uterus. Ovaries, gravid uterus, and fallopian tubes are more often injured in penetrating trauma. Female genitalia injuries are reported in up to 50% of sexual assault victims.

AAST Vagina Injury Scale

- I: Contusion or hematoma

- II: Superficial laceration (mucosa only)

- III: Deep laceration (into fat or muscle)

- IV: Complex laceration (into cervix or peritoneum

- V: Injury to adjacent organs (rectum, anus, urethra, bladder)

AAST Vulva Injury Scale

- I: Contusion or hematoma

- II: Superficial laceration (skin only)

- III: Deep laceration (into fat or muscle)

- IV: Avulsion (skin, fat, or muscle)

- V: Injury to adjacent organs (rectum, anus, urethra, bladder)

AAST Non-gravid Uterus Injury Scale

- I: Contusion or hematoma

- II: Superficial laceration (<1 cm)

- III: Deep laceration (>1 cm)

- IV: Laceration involving uterine artery

- V: Avulsion or devascularization

AAST Gravid Uterus Injury Scale

- I: Contusion or hematoma without placental abruption

- II: Superficial laceration (<1 cm) or partial placental abruption (<25%)

- III: Deep laceration (>1 cm) in the second trimester or placental abruption >25% but <50%; deep laceration in the third trimester

- IV: Laceration involving the uterine artery; deep laceration (>1 cm) with > 50% placental abruption

- V: Uterine rupture in the second or third trimester; complete placental abruption

AAST Fallopian Tube Injury Scale

- I: Contusion or hematoma

- II: Laceration <50% of the circumference

- III: Laceration >50%

- IV: Transection

- V: Vascular injury or devascularized segment

AAST Ovary Injury Scale

- I: Contusion or hematoma

- II: Superficial laceration (depth <0.5 cm)

- III: Deep laceration (depth >0.5 cm)

- IV: Partial disruption of blood supply

- V: Avulsion or complete parenchymal destruction

**Penis, Scrotum, and Testes**

Trauma to the penis is rare, mostly due to the mobility of it. Injury to a flaccid penis is especially rare and is usually due to machinery accidents or penetrating trauma.

Testicular trauma is rare due to the position and mobility of the testes. The cremasteric muscle fibers, mobility, and tunica albuginea contribute to the sturdiness of the testes. Testicular rupture is characterized by extrusion of the seminiferous tubules through the ruptured tunica albuginea. Testicular injuries occur most frequently in sporting events. Another common cause is motorcycle accidents when the testes areÂ compressed between the bony pelvis and the fuel tank of the vehicle. Bilateral testicular trauma is uncommon, comprising only 1.5% of testicular injuries. The right testis is more frequently injured. Roughly 80% of testicular trauma has associated injuries of nearby structures, including the thigh, penis, urethra, bladder, perineum, and femoral vessels.

AAST Scrotum Injury Scale

- I: Contusion

- II: Laceration <25% scrotal diameter

- III: Laceration >25% scrotal diameter
