Tear gas and pepper spray are lay terms to describe a group of agents used to subdue combative persons in a non-lethal manner. The three most commonly used in this category are o-chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile (CS), chloroacetophenone (CN), and oleoresin capsicum (OC). This activity reviews the evaluation and management of these common agents and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, treating, and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of tear gas and pepper spray exposure and associated medical conditions and emergencies.
- Explain the clinical evaluation of exposure to tear gas and pepper spray.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for tear gas and pepper spray exposure.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to address and treat tear gas and pepper spray exposure and improve outcomes.
