As the brain has the highest baseline need for oxygen supply, the symptoms of Acute Mountain Sickness are neurologic (central nervous system CNS). As the generalized hypoxia can affect multiple functions, CNS symptoms are not specific or localizing. Lower respiratory rate, typical during sleep, increases the risk for Acute Mountain Sickness, and symptoms are often first noticed upon awakening. For the majority of people, acclimatization at altitudes over 5600 meters is not possible and prolonged stay at these heights can be associated with respiratory distress.
