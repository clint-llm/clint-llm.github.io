In patients with symptomatic obstructive HCM, beta-blockers or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are used first at maximally tolerated doses. Either adding disopyramide to the regimen or SRT should be considered in patients who continue to have symptoms despite medical management. However, patients' preferences, age, and comorbid conditions should be considered when selecting the type of SRT. SM is recommended for symptomatic patients requiring cardiac surgery for other conditions like multi-vessel coronary artery diseases (CAD), hemodynamically significant valvular disease at a comprehensive HCM center by experienced surgeons. As an alternative, ASA is recommended in comprehensive HCM centers by an experienced operator for prohibitive or high surgical risk patients with associated comorbid conditions or advanced age or patients refusing open-heart surgery.

The following criteria have to be met before considering ASA:

- Septal reduction therapy is recommended in patients with clinical symptoms like severe dyspnea or chest pain (NYHA III or class IV), or symptoms like presyncope or syncope during exertion interfering with daily activities due to LVOT obstruction and peak gradient of ≥50mmHg at rest or with provocation in patients with septal hypertrophy and SAM of mitral valves.

- Targeted anterior septal wall thickness>15mm. Septal thickness>30mm will result in a suboptimal outcome.

- A septal perforator perfusing the septal area of interest, causing dynamic LVOT obstruction and gradient.

- No significant CAD.
