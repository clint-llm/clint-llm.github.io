Understanding the appearance of normal, healthy epithelial cells is essential to identify when there is pathology present in a tissue specimen. Light microscopy (LM) is typically used to visualize stained epithelial cells. LM can be used to determine the morphology of the epithelium present in the tissue specimen. Columnar epithelial cells tend to be rectangular, cuboidal cells appear square, and squamous cells are long and flat.
