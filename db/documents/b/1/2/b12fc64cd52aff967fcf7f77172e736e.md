Farmer's lung or hypersensitivity pneumonitis is the immunologic reaction that occurs in response to an inhaled antigen.****To understand the most common exposures that would contribute to hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and by extension farmer's lung, it is important first to understand that chronic exposure to anything that the host body may find offensive and subsequently trigger an immune response can be a possible source. There are numerous varieties of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, often named after the profession or exposure with which they are associated. Examples include woodworker's lung, sauna taker's disease, and gerbil-keeper's lung, to name a few. Farmer's lung, a subgroup of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, has a variety of pathogens. The most common organism leading to farmer's lung are thermophilic actinomycetes likeMicropolyspora faeni, Thermoactinomyces vulgaris, and fungi like Aspergillus.
