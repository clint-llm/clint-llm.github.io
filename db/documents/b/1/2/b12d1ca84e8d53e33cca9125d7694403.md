The management of Dupuytren contracture is with an interprofessional team that may consist of a dermatologist, orthopedic/hand surgeon, hand therapist, and the patient's primary care physician. There are multiple treatment options available. Open techniques offer more comprehensive removal of diseased tissue while directly visualizing critical neurovascular structures.  Injection based therapy has the benefit of being minimally invasive, but there is a greater risk of damage to surrounding structures and incomplete release of contractures. Recurrence of the disorder is common with all treatments, but highest with non-operative and injection-based options.

The follow-up of these patients is usually done by the treating surgeon and the patient's primary care provider.  The primary care physician can help the patient manage blood glucose, reduce alcohol consumption, and discontinue smoking.

Only symptomatic patients with limitations in motion should be offered treatment because all treatments have potential complications. Close communication between the healthcare team is essential in order to improve outcomes.  Hand therapists also play a pivotal role in restoring motion in the treatment of this disease.
