Lichen planopilaris is the prototypical lymphocytic cicatricial alopecia, according to the North American Hair Research Society (NAHRS). It is considered a follicular variant of lichen planus based on clinical and histopathological findings. The most widely accepted theory states that it is a hair-specific autoimmune disorder in which activated T-lymphocytes target follicular antigens.
