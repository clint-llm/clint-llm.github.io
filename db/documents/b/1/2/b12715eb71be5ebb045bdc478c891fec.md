As soon as the diagnosis of Wellens syndrome is made or suspected, consult a cardiologist. In addition, contact an interventional cardiologist because the definitive treatment is cardiac catheterization with PCI. Until this occurs, treat Wellens syndrome similarly to an acute myocardial infarction including antiplatelet therapy with aspirin, anticoagulation with heparin, and nitrates and beta blockers if the patient is not hypotensive. However, it is important to note that Wellens’ patients do poorly with medical management alone, and as stated above, definitive treatment is procedural. Admit patients that are pain-free and stable on a monitored floor. All symptomatic patients need intensive care until (ICU) admission and immediate consultation with an interventional cardiologist for cardiac catheterization on a more emergent basis. Because Wellens syndrome patients have critical narrowing of the LAD coronary artery, a stress test should be avoided as this can precipitate an acute myocardial infarction and sudden death. Upon coronary angiography, the cardiologist can plan for revascularization of the LAD coronary artery.
