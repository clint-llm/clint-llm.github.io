The differential diagnosis for a patient with vitamin E toxicity would include bleeding disorders such as hemophilia, von Willebrandâ€™s disease, drug-induced coagulopathy, and DIC.

The differential diagnosis for patients with gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) includes gastroenteritis, infectious diarrhea, small bowel obstruction, pancreatitis, and cholestasis. The differential diagnosis for weakness can be extremely broad and includes an infectious etiology (urinary tract infection, pneumonia, etc.), anemia, acute kidney failure, electrolyte abnormalities, congestive heart failure, hypothyroidism, etc.
