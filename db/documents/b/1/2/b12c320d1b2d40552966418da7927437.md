Management of skull fractures depends on the location and type of fracture along with the presence (or absence) of underlying brain injury. Most skull fractures that are simple linear fractures without underlying brain injury will require no intervention. Various practice patterns exist in regard to recommendations for observation periods or close outpatient follow-up. There are also variations in whether skull fractures should be treated similarly to concussions. In fact, one study has shown that most fractures requiring intervention do not necessarily require intervention for the fracture alone, but rather for an associated underlying injury. Younger patients, and symptomatic patients, should be admitted to the hospital for an observation period.  Variations to this practice are supported by multiple studies that have shown that asymptomatic children with simple fractures can be safely discharged from the emergency department. However, in each of these cases, a CT of the head had been performed to rule out an underlying brain injury.

Frontal bone fractures are more likely to require neurosurgical repair. A depressed fracture usually requires intervention. Indications for a neurosurgical elevation of a depressed fracture include depression of 5 millimeters or more, dural injury, underlying hematoma, or gross contamination. An open fracture will likely require exploration and washout with antibiotic coverage. Basal skull fractures are usually managed conservatively unless there is persistent CSF leakage. A patient with a basal skull fracture should not have a nasogastric tube or nasal cannula. There is no evidence to support the role of prophylactic antibiotics in preventing meningitis, although, persistent CSF leak may increase the risk of meningitis.
