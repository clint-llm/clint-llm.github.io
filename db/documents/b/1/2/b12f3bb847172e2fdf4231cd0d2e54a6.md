Thrombectomy involves removing a clot from a blood vessel, most commonly from the brain, heart, or lungs. Stroke and myocardial infarction remain two of the leading causes of death worldwide and are increasingly treated through techniques that include intravascular thrombolytics, mechanical thrombectomy, or a combination of both. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of a vascular thrombus using mechanical thrombectomy and highlights the role of the healthcare team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for performing a mechanical thrombectomy.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to mechanical thrombectomy.
- Review the potential complications and their clinical significance when performing a thrombectomy.
- Describe some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance mechanical thrombectomy and improve outcomes.
