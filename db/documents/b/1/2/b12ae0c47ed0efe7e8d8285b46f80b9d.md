Medical imaging is among the most valuable technological advancements in the field of medicine and has resulted in many improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of numerous medical conditions. Image production and evaluation have allowed healthcare professionals to efficiently recognize and assess emergent cases and have been a crucial tool in improving public health. Examples include the use of mammography in breast cancer screening, radiography in the assessment of fractures or identifying pneumonia, ultrasound image guidance in treating tumors, and the use of multiple imaging modalities during procedures such as joint injections and in the insertion of stents, catheters, and other medical devices.
