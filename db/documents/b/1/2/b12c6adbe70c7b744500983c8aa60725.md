Most sporocysts of various species measure about 10 by 15 µm, contain four sporozoites and a residual body. The overall size, presence, or absence of septa and ultrastructural morphology of the wall are some of these features that help identify. However, it varies with the host cell type, the sarcocysts, and the method of fixation. The intact oocysts appear as two adjacent sporocysts with a thin oocyst wall. It often breaks to release the sporocysts, which are the most commonly found structures in the feces.

The histopathological diagnosis is based on the part affected. Most sarcocysts in humans have been found in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Muscle biopsies will show sarcocysts within the muscle fibers. Sarcocysts of Sarcocystis hominis in cattle are microscopic, whereas those of Sarcocystis suihominis in pigs are macroscopic. Hematoxylin-and-eosin(H & E) stain can be used to detect sarcocysts in the muscles of the intermediate host. The walls of sarcocysts are positively stained by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reaction.
