- Patients presenting with mild to moderate EPI may be underestimated or overlooked by general practitioners and clinicians. Early diagnosis and optimization of treatment are critical.

- InÂ EPI, fat malabsorption often develops before protein and carbohydrate malabsorption because pancreatic lipase has a higher susceptibility to denaturation compared to other enzymes.

- The prevalence of EPI is not well known due to differences in the etiologies and hence varying.

- However, the two leading causes of EPI are chronic pancreatitis in adults and cystic fibrosis in children, with varying occurrence in patients with diabetes and after bariatric surgery.

- Multiple diagnostic tests are usually used to help diagnose EPI; the most popular is fecal elastase-1, being widely available and cost-effective.

- The mainstay treatment of EPI is pancreatic enzyme replacement with the need for monitoring and dose adjustments.

- The dose of pancreatic enzyme replacement should be adjusted to the fat content of the meal and administrated with the first bite of a meal and extra by the end of the meal.

- There is a vital role in managing EPI for lifestyle modifications (stop smoking and alcohol consumption) and diet control.

- If EPI is left untreated, malnutrition-related morbidity, poor quality of life, and potentially serious complications, including death, might occur.
