Transthyretin (previously known as prealbumin) is a normal circulating protein that functions as a carrier protein for retinol (vitamin A) and thyroxine. It is primarily synthesized by the liver (>95%). Additionally, in small amounts, it is also produced in the choroid plexus and retinal epithelium.

Chromosome 18 carries the gene for TTR protein. Therefore, a mutation in the gene coding for TTR can cause structural changes in TTR, causing it to misfold. This type of ATTR is referred to as hereditary transthyretin amyloid (hATTR). In addition, it has been observed that the normal aging process can render ATTR tetramer prone to misfolding, even when the genetic sequence of the TTR is expected.

Myocardial deposition of misfolded TTR protein in both types of ATTR (hATTR and wATTR) causes a clinical phenotype of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM). However, emerging clinical data have shown that wATTR-CM is more common than hATTR.
