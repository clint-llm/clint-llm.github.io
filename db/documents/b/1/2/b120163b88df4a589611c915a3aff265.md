An important interplay between RBF and proper kidney functioning is the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, also known as RAAS. Renin is secreted by juxtaglomerular cells in response to decreased renal arterial pressure, increased renal sympathetic activation from beta-1 adrenergic receptors, or decreased sodium delivery to macula densa cells.
