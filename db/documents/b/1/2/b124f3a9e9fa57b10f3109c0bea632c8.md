Prasugrel causes rapid and irreversible platelet inhibition and can be associated with life-threatening bleeding in case of toxicity. Researchers observed lethality in rats with a dose of 2000 mg/kg. There is no antidote available for use in case of toxicity with prasugrel. The active metabolite of prasugrel is likely not removable via dialysis.
