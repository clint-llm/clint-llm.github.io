Triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol esters are insoluble in plasma, and, to be transported to tissues where they are needed, such as muscle and adipose tissue, they must get packaged as lipoprotein particles. Lipoprotein particles comprise a core of TG and cholesteryl ester and a coat comprising phospholipid, free cholesterol, and apolipoproteins.

This short review will focus on the primary TG carrying particles, chylomicrons, and discuss relevant biochemistry, metabolism, and clinical syndromes pertaining specifically to chylomicrons.

Chylomicrons are large triglyceride-rich lipoproteins produced in enterocytes from dietary lipidsâ€”namely, fatty acids, and cholesterol. Chylomicrons are composed of a main central lipid core that consists primarily of triglycerides, however like other lipoproteins, they carry esterified cholesterol and phospholipids.

The backbone structural protein is the truncated apolipoprotein B-48, which is the main non-exchangeable protein. However, it does contain other apolipoproteins, including ApoA1, A2, A3, A5 C2, C3, and ApoE.
