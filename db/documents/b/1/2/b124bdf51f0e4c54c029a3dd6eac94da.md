Because it lacks a cell wall, Mycoplasma is resistant to many common antibiotics; therefore, choices for antimicrobial therapy are limited. Macrolides, tetracyclines, and newer fluoroquinolones have been found to have the highest efficacy against mycoplasma infections. Potential toxicities in children limit treatment options to macrolides. Azithromycin and clarithromycin are most frequently used to treat atypical pneumonia because they are better tolerated than erythromycin. Treatment with Macrolides is typically up to a 5-day course.

Tetracyclines are preferable if there central nervous system involvement. Doxycycline is the first choice to treat M. hominis and U. urealyticum species. Fluoroquinolones are bactericidal and therefore useful for immunocompromised patients and unusual cases of systemic infection. Length of treatment will vary pending the patient's condition and illness.
