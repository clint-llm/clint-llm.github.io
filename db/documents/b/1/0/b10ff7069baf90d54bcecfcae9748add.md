Detection of hypercarbia is often an important part of the work-up and evaluation of acid-base disorders. In practice, hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation is a common reason for admission to an intensive care unit.

Many patients with chronic lung disease have chronic hypercarbia that is compensated by renal retention of bicarbonate. To date, no studies have shown a mortality benefit in correcting the CO2 levels to a normal range in such patients.

Permissive hypercapnia is an important concept in the management of both ARDS and severe asthma. Early in management, some compromise in ventilation and rise in CO2 is acceptable to maintain either lower tidal volumes for a lung-protective ventilation strategy (for ARDS) or to allow more time for expiration on the ventilator (severe asthma).

Treatment of hypercarbia with alkali therapy should generally be avoided, as this may actually worsen the acidosis.
