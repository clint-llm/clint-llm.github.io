Contraindications to exercise include acute illness or injury. The recommendation is to recover to full functional capacity before beginning any exercise regimen. Exacerbations of chronic disease can be detrimental to exercise capacity, and general recommendations include having chronic conditions under control beginning starting exercise. There are alternatives in these populations. For example, patients with acute arthritis flares are often able to perform water and pool-based exercises that are low-impact on joints. Cardiac conditions that qualify for exclusion are valvular heart disease, ventricular hypertrophy, dangerous arrhythmias, and malignant hypertension. In most cases, the great benefits imparted by exercise outweigh the small risks involved with increased activity.
