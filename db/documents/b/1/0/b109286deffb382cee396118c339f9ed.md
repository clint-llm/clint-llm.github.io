**Skin Prick Testing**

Patients should stop taking the following medications; antihistamines 1 week prior, H2 blockers 48 hours prior, tricyclic antidepressants for up to 2 weeks prior, omalizumab 6 months prior because they can decrease or alter the reaction. Patients with an anaphylactic episode within 30 days should not undergo skin prick testing because they can have false-negative results.

**Serum IgE testing**

High levels of antibodies do not always correlate with the severity of the allergies or reactions but do correlate with a higher chance of a reaction.

**Skin Patch Testing**

The results can be hard to differentiate between a true positive allergic reaction and a skin irritant.
