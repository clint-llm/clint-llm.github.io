**Pregnancy**

HCG is an important hormone in pregnancy, and its clinical utility is primarily centered around its detection in early pregnancy, along with serial measurement during pregnancy and pregnancy-related complications.

Levels of hCG can vary widely between women with normal pregnancies. Typically, serum and urine concentrations of hCG rise exponentially in the first trimester of pregnancy, doubling about every 24 hours during the first 8 weeks. The peak is usually around 10 weeks of gestation and then levels decrease until about the 16th week of gestation where they remain fairly constant until term.

Patients who have hCG levels that plateau prior to 8 weeks or that fail to double commonly have a nonviable pregnancy, whether intra-uterine or extra-uterine. Extra-uterine (ectopic) pregnancies usually have a rate-of-rise that is low without the typical doubling. However, given the large range of normal hCG levels and inconsistent rates-of-rise of this hormone, checking serum levels is typically paired with ultrasound evaluation to improve sensitivity and specificity.

Return of hCG to zero following delivery or termination of pregnancy ranges from 7 to 60 days.

It notable that there are many different combinations of antibodies used in commercial assays. This results in heterogeneous results with as much as a 50-fold difference in immunoassay results.

**Gestational Trophoblastic Disease**

Detection of hCG is also useful in the evaluation of trophoblastic disease, including complete and partial hydatidiform mole, postmolar tumor, gestational choriocarcinoma, testicular choriocarcinoma, and placental site trophoblastic disease. All of these entities produce hCG, varying levels of which are reported on commercial assays. A total hCG level of greater than 100,000 mIU/mL in early pregnancy, for example, is highly suggestive of a complete hydatidiform mole,

**Non-Pregnant Patients**

HCG in the serum increases with age in nonpregnant women. A cut off of 14 mIU/mL has been suggested for use in interpreting results in women over the age of 55. In all nonpregnant patients, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, or other malignancy should be evaluated as a source of persistently positive hCG testing.
