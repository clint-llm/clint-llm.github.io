Arterial cannulation has become increasingly significant in the appropriate monitoring and stabilization of the critically ill patient. It allows for continuous monitoring of the patients hemodynamic status by revealing an accurate blood pressure reading as well as a mean arterial pressure. Both of these values, when monitored via the use of arterial cannulation, can depict a sudden change in the patient's condition allowing for more timely and effective intervention thus potentially improving patient outcomes. Arterial cannulation is quickly becoming standard in critical care areas when caring for specific patient populations that have the potential to decline rapidly if certain changes in hemodynamic status go unnoticed. With continued use and increasing comfort regarding arterial cannulation and monitoring, this procedure is sure to aid in improving patient outcomes and aid clinicians in the medical decision making process on a more frequent basis in the critical healthcare setting.
