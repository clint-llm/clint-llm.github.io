Anterior pituitary adenomas are the most common tumors affecting the hypothalamus. They may exert a mass effect that causes headaches and vision changes like bitemporal hemianopsia due to optic chiasm compression. They may produce hormones, causing endocrine diseases. Prolactinomas cause galactorrhea and suppress gonadotropins, leading to decreased libido and infertility. Growth hormone-producing tumors cause gigantism and acromegaly. ACTH-producing tumors cause Cushing Disease due to hypercortisolism. Gonadotropin-producing tumors can cause precocious puberty or hirsutism. The preferred approach for tumor removal is trans-sphenoidal. A complication is damage to the hypothalamus, which can cause osmotic, autonomic, or feeding dysregulation.
