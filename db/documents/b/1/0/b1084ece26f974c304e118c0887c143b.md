Abdominal palpation and examination of the femoral and popliteal pulses are recommended for AAA evaluation although up to 25% of AAAs larger than 5 cm are missed with focused physicals. Patients may report an exaggerated pulse or pulsating mass in the abdomen. Additional presentations include signs of embolic phenomena, originating from the aneurysm wall thrombus such as in blue toe syndrome, as well as signs of deep venous thrombosis from iliocaval compression by an aneurysm. Rare symptoms include chronic back pain from vertebral involvement, early satiety and nausea from gastric outlet obstruction, and urinary retention from ureter obstruction. Frank rupture elicits the classic triad of severe back or abdominal pain, hypotension and pulsatile abdominal mass in 50% of cases.
