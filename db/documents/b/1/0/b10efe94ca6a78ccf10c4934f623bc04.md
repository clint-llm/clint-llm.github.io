Cachexia is a significant loss of muscle and adipose tissue. It occurs in patients with advanced cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic infection including AIDS and tuberculosis, chronic heart failure, and rheumatoid arthritis. Increases in pro-inflammatory factors characterize cachexia. There is a decreased quality of life, decreased tolerance to surgical or medical interventions, and shortened survival. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of cancer cachexia, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of cancer cachexia.
- Describe the pathophysiology of cancer cachexia.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for cancer cachexia.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of cancer cachexia and improve outcomes.
