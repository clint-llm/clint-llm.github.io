Clinical features depend on the degree of the inflammation of the pericardium, myocardium, and acuity of the illness. The clinical presentation can differ from a subtle, self-limiting illness to severe cardiogenic shock and death.

Early symptoms included precordial chest pain, fatigue, dyspnea, palpitations, and fever. Patients may give symptoms suggestive of a viral prodrome (a runny nose, arthralgia, low-grade fever) 1 to 2 weeks preceding the presentation. In predominant pericardial involvement, they can describe the pain as sharp, worse with a cough or inspiration and relieved by sitting forward. If there is significant myocardial involvement, there may be a continuous pain, and sometimes, it is hard to differentiate from myocardial ischemia pain, especially in people with cardiovascular risk factors. They may also have predominant heart failure symptoms such as shortness of breath, orthopnea, pedal edema, and fatigue. Rare symptoms include arrhythmias, syncope, and sudden cardiac arrest. Physical examination findings can be variable, but common findings may include fever, pericardial friction rub and features of heart failure. Look for other signs of systemic illness which may contribute to the etiology.
