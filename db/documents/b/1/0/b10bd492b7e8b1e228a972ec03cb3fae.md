Vertigo can indicate inner ear or vestibular decompression sickness wherein bubbles form in the perilymph fluid of the cochlea.

The differential diagnosis for divers should also consider that the stress of diving can exacerbate chronic medical problems. Consider cardiac disease for patients with chest pain and exacerbation of intrinsic lung disease for shortness of breath. Other considerations include pain from previous musculoskeletal injury and stroke and hypoglycemia for altered mental status. Further concerns include drowning or near-drowning and thermal stress.
