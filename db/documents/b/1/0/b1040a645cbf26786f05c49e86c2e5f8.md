The prognosis of abducens nerve palsy depends on the condition's underlying cause. When caused by a viral illness, it generally remits completely, while cases secondary to trauma may demonstrate residual symptoms. The most significant improvement typically occurs in the first 6 months. Most patients with idiopathic CN VI palsy recover completely, although some may experience permanent vision changes.
