The face is a structure that is heavily innervated by nerves. Any disturbances in the innervation of these nerves will manifest as defects in the face. One example is the middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction. This may manifest as contralateral drooping and impaired sensation of the face sparing the forehead. These clinical features can guide clinicians in the diagnosis of an MCA stroke, while complete unilateral drooping of the face can present in Bell palsy. These differences are useful to determine the etiologies of the conditions.
