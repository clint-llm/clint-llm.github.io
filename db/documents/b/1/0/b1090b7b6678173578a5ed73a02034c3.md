Ultrasound is a safe and readily available imaging procedure that can be easily performed at the bedside. Being radiation-free, easily available, and portable, ultrasound is most important in the initial evaluation of pediatric, gynecological conditions. In most cases, a definitive diagnosis can be made with ultrasound, and it can also help identify cases that need to be assessed further with MRI or CT scan.  Pediatric radiologists should be well aware of the female pelvic organs' normal ultrasound appearance from neonate to adolescent/postpubertal stage. Familiarity with different pelvic pathologies that can affect pediatric patients and their US appearance is very important to suggest the correct diagnosis. For example, thorough knowledge of pathologies such as ovarian torsion and its ultrasound appearance is necessary to salvage ovaries. In conclusion, ultrasound is a simple, reliable, and primary investigation modality in evaluating pediatric, gynecological conditions.
