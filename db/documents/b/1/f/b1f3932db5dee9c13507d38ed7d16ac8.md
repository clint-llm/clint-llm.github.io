Ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm traditionally requires surgical management, although endovascular closure devices have been used with good outcomes. Surgical management of sinus of Valsalva aneurysm is preferred when there is significant aortic regurgitation or a ventricular septal defect. Surgical management remains the preferred method of treatment of ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm. Ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm warrants urgent cardiothoracic surgical evaluation, as patients may quickly deteriorate.

Non-ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm should be surgically repaired if there is associated with significant symptoms or are rapidly enlarging. The 2010 American Guidelines for Thoracic Aortic Disease recommend surgical repair to be considered in those with aneurysms greater than 5.5 cm, greater than 5 cm in those with bicuspid valves, and greater than 4.5 cm in the setting of connective tissue disease. Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm repair should be considered when there is a growth rate of more than 0.5 cm/year. Surgical repair entails the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, cardioplegia, and either primary closure or patch closure. Surgical mortality ranges from 1.9% to 3.6%. Survival rates are close to 90% after 15 years.

Medical management of Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm rupture is insufficient for definitive treatment. Medical management should serve as a bridge to help temporarily stabilize patients until surgical or transcatheter definitive therapy is available. Medical management involves treating arrhythmias as needed, treating endocarditis if present, and treating heart failure if present. Patients with ruptured Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm typically succumb to their disease state within one year of diagnosis due to congestive heart failure in the setting of left to right shunting. Left to right shunting is the usual underlying etiology of decompensation.
