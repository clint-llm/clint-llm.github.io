Like most in the selective estrogen receptor modulator class of drugs, bazedoxifene, combined with conjugated estrogens, presents various contraindications. The most notable is pregnancy, as bazedoxifene/conjugated estrogens is a notable FDA Pregnancy Category X drug, though bazedoxifene as a drug itself is not classified as a potential teratogen.

Other notable contraindications include abnormal uterine bleeding, hypersensitivity allergic reactions to exogenous estrogen, and certain cardiovascular complications such as any prior or current history of deep vein thrombosis, stroke, pulmonary embolism, or myocardial infarction. Usage of the drug is strongly advised against in patients with hepatic and renal impairment, as ineffective metabolism by CYP3A4 and clearance of the drug can lead to unintended pharmacological effects.

Drug-drug interactions are still limited in research analysis regarding bazedoxifene/conjugated estrogens. However, some clinical trials have demonstrated that both CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers pose a risk for potential adverse reactions following the intake of the combination drug.
