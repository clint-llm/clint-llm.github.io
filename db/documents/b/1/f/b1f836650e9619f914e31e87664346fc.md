Seizures in MEI typically resolve; However, some patients have a recurrence of seizures in adolescence. Febrile seizures occur in a higher proportion.  Afebrile generalized tonic-clonic seizures occur in 20% of MEI. Development of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and focal epilepsies have been reported rarely.

Neuropsychological deficits, including fine motor skill deficits, attention deficits, cognitive problems, language impairment, and learning disorders, are observed in long-term follow-ups of patients with MEI. Early-onset recurrent seizures can increase the risk of cognitive deficits.

Treatment-related side effects include but are not limited to behavior and mood disorders with levetiracetam, thrombocytopenia, and hepatotoxicity with sodium valproate. Sodium valproate is avoided in children below 2 years of age due to increased hepatotoxicity.

Monitoring drug levels, checking hematological parameters and liver enzymes is important to prevent complications.
