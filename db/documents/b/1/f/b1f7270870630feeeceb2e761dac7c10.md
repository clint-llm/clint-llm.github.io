Treatment predominantly revolves around the suspected etiology of wheezing. The ubiquitous approach to ensuring Airway, Breathing, and Circulation (ABCs) are stable is the priority. Those with signs of impending respiratory failure may require either noninvasive positive pressure ventilation or invasive mechanical ventilation followingÂ endotracheal intubation. In cases of anaphylaxis, epinephrine would be required. Nebulized, short-acting, b2 agonists such as albuterol and nebulized short-acting muscarinic antagonists are often administered while further workup is being performed.
