The characteristic findings on high resolution computed tomography consist of bilateral ground-glass opacities often associated with interlobular septal thickening with a characteristic feature of 'crazy paving.' In less typical cases, radiologic findings consist of bilateral and symmetrical areas of airspace consolidation or ground-glass opacities. In patients with less severe disease, the radiologic features may consist of hazy areas of ground-glass opacities rather than consolidation. The abnormalities tend toÂ involve mainly the perihilar regions and lower lobes.
