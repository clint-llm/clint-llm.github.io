Antiphospholipid antibodies are autoantibodies that are directed against phospholipid-binding proteins. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS) is characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in the setting of thrombosis and/or pregnancy loss. The most common sites of venous and arterial thrombosis are the lower limbs and the cerebral arterial circulation, respectively. However, thrombosis can occur in any organ. This activity examines when antiphospholipid syndrome should be considered in differential diagnosis and how to evaluate it properly. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the clinical criteria required to make a diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome.
- Review the workup of a patient with antiphospholipid syndrome.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for antiphospholipid syndrome.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome.
