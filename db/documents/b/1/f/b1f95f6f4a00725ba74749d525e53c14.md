**History:**

The important aspects to be noted in history are hand dominance, occupation, time of injury, mechanism of injury, other associated injuries, comorbidities, and NPO status.

**Physical Exam:**

Level of amputation, structures involved, neurovascular status, function, and degree of contamination (if relevant). It is vital to assess the amputated part and ultimately determine its suitability for replanting respective to the mechanism of injury (e.g., crush, guillotine-style, avulsion).

Finger amputations classification is generally according to the level of amputation. The Sebastian and Chung classification is outlined below

- Zone 1 distal amputations 

- Zone 1A - distal to lunula, through the sterile matrix
- Zone 1B - between lunula and nailbed

- Zone 1 proximal amputations

- Zone 1C - between flexor digitorum profundus insertion and neck of the middle phalanx
- Zone 1D - between the neck of the middle phalanx and insertion of the flexor digitorum superficialis
