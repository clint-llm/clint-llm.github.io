Refsum disease is one of the four major peroxisomal biogenesis disorders. Peroxisomes are multiple membrane-bound intracellular organelles involved in catalyzing various functions of cellular metabolism and biosynthesis including beta-oxidation of very-long-chain-fatty-acids (VLCFA); alpha oxidation (strictly peroxisomal); catabolism of branched-chain fatty acids, amino acids, and ethanol; and biosynthesis of cholesterol, bile acids, and plasmalogens phospholipids found in the brain’s white matter.

Due to such a central role of peroxisomes in the various cellular mechanisms, numerous peroxisomal disorders are known today. With ever-increasing advances, it is an expanding class of genetic disorders due to an impairment in either peroxisome biogenesis or one of the metabolic functions. The four most common peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are:

- Refsum disease (both infantile and classic)

- Zellweger syndrome

- Neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy

- Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata

Refsum disease is classified into two subgroups, based on differences of the enzymes affected, metabolites accumulated, genetics, clinical presentations, and treatment.

- Classic/adult Refsum disease (CRD)

- Infantile Refsum disease (IRD)

Classic/adult Refsum disease is also known as hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy IV or heredopathia atactica polyneuritiformis.
