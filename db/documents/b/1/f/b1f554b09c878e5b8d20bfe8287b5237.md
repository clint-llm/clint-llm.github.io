Conceptually, dual organ failure requiring heart and lung transplants may be due to either of the following:

- A primary cardiac disease leading to pulmonary failure

- A primary pulmonary disease leading to cardiac failure

- A systemic process causing both cardiac and pulmonary failure

The most common indications (35%) for heart and lung transplants are congenital cardiac malformations causing Eisenmenger syndrome and secondary pulmonary arterial hypertension.

The second most common group of indications (27%) for heart and lung transplants are primary pulmonary hypertension disorders causing right heart failure.

Systemic disease-causing, both cardiac and pulmonary failure, such as cystic fibrosis and lifestyle factors that include smoking, causing both emphysema and ischemic cardiac disease.
