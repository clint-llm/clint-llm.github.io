Cardiac sarcoidosis can be best dealt with using an interprofessional approach to enhance the chances of diagnosing CS and help recognize the coexistence of extra-cardiac manifestations. CardiacÂ sarcoidosis can be a frequently missed diagnosis given its rarity and the high index of suspicion needed to make the diagnosis. Even amongst specialists, the combined effort of advanced imaging specialists, electrophysiologists, and interventional cardiologists is often required to arrive at the diagnosis of CS.

Early diagnosis and initiation of immunosuppression hold a clear benefit in reducing disease progression.
