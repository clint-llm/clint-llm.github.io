Meissner corpuscles are ellipsoid mechanoreceptors located superficially within the dermal papillae at a depth of approximately 150 micrometers. The corpuscles are approximately 20 to 40 micrometers in diameter and 80 to 150 micrometers in length, with their long axis oriented perpendicularly to the skin surface.

Each corpuscle is comprised of three primary components: elongated Schwann cells, a connective tissue capsule, and a central axon.

Each corpuscle is supplied by a nerve ending derived from an intermediate-large amyloid-beta myelinated afferent fiber.

The development of Meissner corpuscles is dependent on brain-derived neurotrophic receptor (BDNF) signaling via tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB). TrkB is an enzyme-linked transmembrane receptor encoded by the NTRK2 gene. Animal studies involving knockout of BDNF or TrkB in mice resulted in a lack of Meissner corpuscles, highlighting the importance of this signaling system in corpuscular development.
