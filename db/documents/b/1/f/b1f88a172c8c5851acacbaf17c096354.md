Nitric oxide binds to its intracellular receptor soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGP) and increases cGMP levels. Nitric oxide binds to a heme prosthetic group on the receptor. Once NO binds, this triggers a conformational change that increases cGMP synthesis. Nitric oxide (NO) is a freely diffusible intercellular signaling molecule that mediates vasodilation. The activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase leads to increased cGMP concentration, and this leads to soluble guanylyl cyclase transmitting a NO signal to downstream proteins in the signaling cascade: cGMP dependent protein kinase, cGMP gated cation channels, and cGMP regulated phosphodiesterase.

Nitric oxide also binds to the transmembrane receptor guanylyl cyclase; this converts GTP to cGMP, which acts as a second messenger to activate protein kinase G. Activation of protein kinase G causes smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation.
