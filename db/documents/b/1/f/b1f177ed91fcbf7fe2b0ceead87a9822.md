Following discharge from the hospital, a close follow-up must be arranged with the medical provider to assess for relapse or late onset of NAS symptoms, monitor weight to prevent growth failure, and reinforce caregiver education. Arranging follow-up with subspecialty clinics such as developmental pediatrics, child psychiatry, pediatric ophthalmology, pediatric neurology, occupational therapist, physical therapist, and dietician may be necessary for early identification and management of the long-term problems that commonly present in NAS infants.
