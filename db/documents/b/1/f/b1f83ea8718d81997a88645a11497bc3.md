It can be challenging to distinguish Duret hemorrhage from primary brainstem hemorrhages. Traditionally, the presence of Duret hemorrhage was associated with grave prognosis, often leading to the withdrawal of care. With increasingly reported cases in the literature, early identification and aggressive interventions can result in good neurological outcomes. The presence of Duret hemorrhage alone should not be considered as a poor prognostic marker and should not trigger a decision to withdraw care.
