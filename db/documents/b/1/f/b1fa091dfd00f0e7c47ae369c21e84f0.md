Arachnoiditis is a persistent inflammation of the arachnoid mater and subarachnoid space due to mechanical, chemical, or infectious causes. It is a rare but serious condition not well understood by some medical personnel. In its most severe form, adhesive arachnoiditis can be a very painful and debilitating condition. It is, therefore, important for practitioners to have an understanding of this condition to help identify, treat, and hopefully avoid this condition. This activity reviews the causes as well as the evaluation and management of arachnoiditis, highlighting the role of the inter-professional team in improving care for patients suffering from this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the known risk factors for developing arachnoiditis.
- Outline the clinical presentation of a patient presenting with arachnoiditis.
- Explain the management options available for patients with arachnoiditis.
- Describe the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to improve care coordination and communication to advance the understanding of arachnoiditis and to improve outcomes.
