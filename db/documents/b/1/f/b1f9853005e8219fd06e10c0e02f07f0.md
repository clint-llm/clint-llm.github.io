The nephron of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease has cystic dilatations with loss of tubule connection microscopically, and the kidneys in ADPKD are enlarged and distorted with multiple renal cysts.

The microscopic evaluation of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease shows fusiform dilation of collecting tubules, and the kidneys in ARPKD are also enlarged, but the shape of the kidney is preserved.
