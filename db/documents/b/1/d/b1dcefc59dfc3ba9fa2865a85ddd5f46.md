There are two phases of an asthma exacerbation, which include the early phase and late phase. The early phase is initiated by IgE antibodies that are sensitized and released by plasma cells. These antibodies respond to certain triggers in the environment, such as the risk factors listed above. IgE antibodies then bind to high-affinity mast cells and basophils. When a pollutant or risk factor gets inhaled, the mast cells release cytokines and eventually de-granulate. Released from mast cells are histamine, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes. These cells, in turn, contract the smooth muscle and cause airway tightening.

Airway hyperresponsiveness is a crucial feature of asthma; this is an exaggerated bronchoconstrictor response, usually to different stimuli. There are a variety of mechanisms leading to airway hyperresponsiveness. Some explanations are due to increased histamine from mast cells or increase airway smooth muscle mass. Also, there is an increased vagal tone and increased intracellular free calcium that further enhances airway smooth muscle cell contractility.

Remodeling occurs by epithelial cells transitioning to mesenchymal, increasing the smooth muscle content. Epithelial cells lose their cell adhesion and functional polarity with tight junctions, reformatting their cells to develop into mesenchymal cells.
