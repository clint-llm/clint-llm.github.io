Space-occupying orbital lesions produce a variety of ocular signs and symptoms (Table 9). Presenting signs due to orbital masses most commonly include proptosis, extraocular muscle limitation, either restrictive or paralytic, chemosis, exposure keratopathy, and optic neuropathy. Additionally, patients typically present with eye and periocular pain, loss of vision, diplopia, a change in the appearance of the eye or eyelids, a pulsatile sensation, irritation, and rarely a visible mass. Slow-growing lesions are typically painless; however, acute changes, including lesion rupture or hemorrhage, can result in sudden onset of pain and other orbital symptoms.

Recommended clinical examination to evaluate patients with a suspected orbital tumor includes the following:

- **Visual acuity and refraction**with attention to asymmetry or a hyperopic shift

- **Pupillary assessment**in multiple directions of gaze to assess the presence of a relative afferent pupillary defect and dynamic optic nerve compression

- **Color vision testing**to assess for subtle optic neuropathy

- **Intraocular pressure**to screen for secondary ocular hypertension due to mass effect or impaired venous drainage

- **Extraocular motility**to evaluate for restrictive or paralytic muscle limitations

- **Hertel exophthalmometry**to quantify proptosis and establish a baseline for future comparison

- **Dilated fundus exam**to assess for optic nerve asymmetry, pallor, and choroidal folds

- **Optical coherence tomography retinal nerve fiber layer**(OCT RNFL) and**Humphrey visual field**(HVF)**30-2**to further assess and quantify the degree of optic neuropathy

**Table 9.**Common presenting signs and symptoms of orbital tumors and their potential mechanisms.

**Signs and Symptoms**

**Potential Mechanism(s)**

**Decreased visual acuity**

Compressive optic neuropathy; ocular surface disease; glaucoma

**Orbital pain or paresthesia**

Mass effect; rapid expansion; nerve compression

**Eyelid edema**

Inflammatory response; impaired venous outflow

**Chemosis**

Impaired venous outflow; secondary to surface inflammation

**Ocular hypertension**

Direct mass effect or secondary tissue swelling with increased hydrostatic pressure around the globe; mass effect with increased episcleral or orbital venous pressure; rarely secondary angle closure

**Proptosis**

Mass effect with anterior displacement of the globe

**Globe displacement**

Mass effect with vertical displacement of the globe

**Diplopia**

Mass effect with globe displacement or adhesion to globe; restrictive or paralytic extraocular muscle limitation; symptomatic anisometropia

**Hyperopic shift**

Mass effect with posterior globe flattening decreased axial length

**Ptosis**

Mass effect; neuropathy; altered globe position

**Gaze-evoked amaurosis**

Gaze-dependent optic nerve compression
