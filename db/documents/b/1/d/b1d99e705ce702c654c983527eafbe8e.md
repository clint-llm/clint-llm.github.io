Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is a method of slower, continuous dialysis to allow solute and fluid homeostasis. There are different techniques of CRRT that are distinguished by their method of solute removal, each detailed below. The choice of CRRT is primarily based on provider preference instead of specific patient characteristics or outcome data. This activity details the principles, indications, and complications of CRRT, and it discusses when to consider initiating CRRT and when to discontinue it. It highlights the role of the inter-professional team in managing patients on CRRT.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the techniques of continuous renal replacement therapy.
- Identify the indications for continuous renal replacement therapy.
- Review the risks associated with continuous renal replacement therapy.
- Summarize the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients on continuous renal replacement therapy.
