Acute injury with a sudden contraction of the peroneal tendons can lead to acute injuries such as a tear of the tendon, or superior peroneal retinaculum, or avulsion of the tendons or the retinaculum from their attachments. If the tendons chronically subluxate, this can lead to inflammation and irritation causing tendonitis. The tendons rubbing over the posterolateral fibula can also lead to longitudinal tears of the tendons.
