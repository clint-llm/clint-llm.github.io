The majority of patients with dysphagia may present to the primary care provider or the emergency department. The public, nurses, pharmacists, and patients should be educated about dysphagia. At schools, students with severe disabilities, or orthopedic impairments may require help because of dysphagia. In essence, the school support team in such schools may need a speech-language pathologist with adequate training in swallowing evaluation and management. No one should provide such services without proper official up-to-date training in this areaâ€”a team of speech therapists, neurologists, otolaryngologists, oncologists, dietitians, and nurses usually manage patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia. Surgeons, gastroenterologists, radiation oncologists, and rehabilitation teams usually manage patients with esophageal malignancy.
