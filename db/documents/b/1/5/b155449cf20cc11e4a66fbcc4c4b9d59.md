The prostate gland is situated in the true pelvis and plays a supportive role in the male reproductive system.  Its principal purpose is to secrete alkaline solution protective for sperm in the acidic environment of the vagina.  The fluid acts to balance the acidity of the vagina, which increases the overall lifespan of the sperm, allowing the greatest length of time to fertilize an egg successfully.  The fluid also contains supportive proteins and enzymes that provide nourishment to sperm.  The added volume of the prostatic fluid to the seminal fluid and sperm allow for easier mechanical propulsion through the urethra.
