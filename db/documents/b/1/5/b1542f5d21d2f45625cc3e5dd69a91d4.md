The treatment for thyroglossal duct cysts is surgical removal to prevent recurrent infections due to the small risk of malignancy. Simple excision of thyroglossal duct cystsÂ is associated with high recurrence rates (45% to 55%). The Sistrunk operation is considered the standard of surgical management and has dramatically reduced recurrence rates. This procedure requires a more extensive surgical resection including the central third of the hyoid bone and a core of base of tongue tissue.

The Sistrunk procedure should not be performed in the setting of acute infection. The patient should receive systemic antibiotics and removal should be planned after the infection has resolved. If preoperative evaluation reveals no other functional thyroid tissue, removal can still be performed with the acknowledgment that hormone replacement therapy may be necessary postoperatively.
