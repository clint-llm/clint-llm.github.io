The length of time that a patient will require a feeding tube for enteral nutrition must first be addressed. If a patient will only need enteral nutrition for a short period of time, or if the length of time is not known, a temporary feeding tube may be placed. This is most commonly used to provide enteral nutrition to patients requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation and therefore, cannot swallow. This tube is most commonly an 8-12 French flexible tube inserted orally or via a nare with the tip ending in the stomach or jejunum. The location of the distal tip is most commonly confirmed with plain film x-ray.

Need for long term enteral feedings, usually more than 30 days, are often managed by gastrostomy tube placement. Dysphagia, or inability to swallow without aspiration of oral intake, is one of the most common reasons for this, as well as moderate to severe malnutrition.

Gastrostomy tubes are shorter than the nasoenteric tubes described above but have a larger diameter of 18-20 French. Gastrostomy tubes are usually made of a more flexible material, as they are intended to be left in place for a longer duration of time.

Gastrojejunal tubes are dual lumen tubes with one lumen ending in the stomach and one post-pyloric in the jejunum. These are often indicated if a patient requires decompression of the gastric portion and feeding via the jejunal lumen. These are most commonly placed with fluoroscopic guidance but can be performed with endoscopy in the hands of a practiced provider.

Jejunal or post-pyloric feedings are also indicated anatomy has been altered, such as Billroth II or Whipple procedures, gastric outlet obstruction, gastroparesis, recurrent aspiration, severe pancreatitis, hyperemesis gravida, proximal enteric fistula, postoperative anastomotic gastroenteric stenosis.
