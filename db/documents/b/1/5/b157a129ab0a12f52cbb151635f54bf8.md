Patients should be made aware of the triggers and alarming signs. A diet rich in carbohydrates can mitigate the illness. The patients should be counseled regarding the essentiality of fluid intake to ensure adequate clearance of porphyrins. In cases where hypertension develops, a low-salt, low-fat, and low cholesterol diet is the best strategy.

Patients should also be advised to restrict activities that may put them at risk for dehydration, carbohydrate depletion, and exhaustion.
