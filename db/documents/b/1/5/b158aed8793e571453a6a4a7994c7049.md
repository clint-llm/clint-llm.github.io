Ensuring patient safety is of utmost importance. Knowing that fractures are a major risk for patients with osteoporosis, providing patient teaching regarding fracture risk reduction is imperative. This encompasses patient education regarding increased intake of calcium and vitamin D, participating in weight-bearing exercise if not contraindicated, smoking cessation, limiting alcohol intake, and medication regimen compliance. Failure to properly educate patients may result in significant consequences and present liability as well.
