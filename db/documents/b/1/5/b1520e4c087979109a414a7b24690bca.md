The insertion of the device is aided by the placement of either a burr hole or a twist drill technique. Kocher's point is the choice for the ventriculostomy. Other points of ventricular puncture include

- **Keen’s point:**-2.5 to 3 cm posterior and 2.5 to 3 cm above the pinna of the ear

- **Kocher’s point:**This point is 1 to 2 cm anterior to the coronal suture in the mid pupillary line, or 11 cm posterior from the glabella and 3 to 4 cm lateral from midline ipsilateral medial canthus and a line extending coronally from the ipsilateral tragus

- **Dandy’s point**: 3 cm above and 2 cm lateral to the inion

- **Frazier’s point**: 6 cm above and 4 cm lateral to the inion

- **Paine’s point**-  the apex of an isosceles triangle, whose base is 3.5 cm and lies along the Sylvian's veins, and each of the two limbs is 2.5 cm.

- **Tubbs’ point-**a point just medial to the midpapillary point through the roof of the orbit - the trajectory aims 45 degrees from a horizontal line and 15 to 20 degrees medial to a vertical line.

Ghajar first introduced a ventricular catheter guide for optimizing trajectory during ventriculostomy. He advocated a perpendicular trajectory relative to the skull surface.

However, the calvarial slope obviates this trajectory, especially in the coronal plane.

**Kakarla Grading of Catheter Placement******

- **Grade 1**(optimal)-ipsilateral frontal horn, including the tip of the third ventricle

- **Grade 2**(suboptimal and in the non-eloquent area)-contralateral frontal horn, corpus callosum, or interhemispheric fissure

- **Grade 3**(suboptimal and in the eloquent area)-basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus, brainstem, cerebellum, basal cisterns, and occipital cortex
