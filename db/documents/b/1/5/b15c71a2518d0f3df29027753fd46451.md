Reye syndrome is a rare and potentially fatal pediatric illness defined as acute noninflammatory encephalopathy with fatty liver failure. Australian pathologist R.D.K. Reye first described this syndrome in 1963. National surveillance of Reye syndrome began in the United States in the early 1970s and led to strict warnings regarding aspirin use in children. Reye syndrome typically presents in children as vomiting and confusion with rapid progression to coma and death. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology and presentation of Reye syndrome and stresses the importance of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Reye syndrome.
- Recall the presentation of reye syndrome.
- List the treatment and management options available for Reye syndrome.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with Reye syndrome.
