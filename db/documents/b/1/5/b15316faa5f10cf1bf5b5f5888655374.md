The pathogenesis of the parainfluenza virus consists of the host immune response and viral mechanisms.

The HN protein cleaves the sialic acid residue and facilitates the release of new virions from the host cell.

The infection with parainfluenza virus first starts at the pseudostratified mucociliary airway epithelium of the nose and oropharynx, then spreading to the large and small airways.

When the infection of epithelial cells of the small airways occurs, inflammatory infiltrates develop, and the host immune response is thought to contribute to disease pathogenesis.

HPIV usually causes a mild and rapidly repaired focal tissue destruction that may even be unnoticed.
