As mentioned in pathogenesis, the development of primary biliary cholangitis is the result of the interaction between genetic predisposition and an environmental trigger. Once the genetically susceptible patient is exposed to the aforementioned environmental toxins or bacteria, humoral (Â B cell-mediated) and cellular (T-cell mediated) responses occur. B cells and T cells target antigens that infiltrate the liver and start attacking bile ductular cells leading to the destruction of small interlobular bile duct cells. The destruction of bile duct cells leads to the obstruction of bile drainage from canaliculi, which results in cholestasis and the destruction of hepatocytes. This cholestatic hepatitis subsequently leads to progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis.
