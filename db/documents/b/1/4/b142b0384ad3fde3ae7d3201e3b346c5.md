Monitoring parameters include blood pressure, BUN, serum creatinine, and potassium. Blood pressure needs to be closely monitored with first dose administration or change in dose. If the patient has collagen vascular disease or renal impairment, complete blood count with differential is also a periodic monitoring requirement. Each patient should have an assessment for the presence of potential interactions with other medications that may impact their fluid balance or cardiac status. Monitoring for anaphylactic reactions, hypovolemia, angioedema, andÂ postural hypotension is also necessary.
