The HDL life cycle starts inside the cells when very small discoidal Pre beta-1 HDL picks up free cholesterol from cells with the help of ABCA transporter, defect in this stage will result in "Tangier disease." This discoid shaped nascent HDL then undergoes esterification via the enzyme lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) converting it to a mature HDL, defect in this stage will result in "familial LCAT deficiency." These mature HDL particles with the help of cholesterol ester transfer protein(CEPT) will mediate the transfer of cholesterol esters to triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles (VLDL, IDL, LDL) in exchange for triglyceride. This remaining cholesterol-rich HDL will be preferred for the use inside the liver where it is either recycled or transferred to the HDL cycle again through destroying into small discoidal particles again or is catabolized by the liver.
