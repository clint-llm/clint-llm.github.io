Several simple but important actions can be undertaken by prehospital personnel to manage ocular trauma. Harm from chemicals may be effectively stopped with early and extensive irrigation. Corneal foreign bodies and contact lenses may be removed when contraindications are absent. In instances of potentially elevated intraocular pressure or open globe injury, the head of the bed may be elevated at least 30 degrees to avoid an unnecessary increase in IOP or extrusion of intraocular contents, respectively.

In the case of a low-grade traumatic hyphema, this also may keep blood out of the field of vision. Treating pain and nausea may further prevent IOP elevation. And finally, shielding, mainly when there is a concern for open globe injury, protects the eye from further insult. Timely transference to the emergency department for a comprehensive evaluation and possible consultation with an ophthalmologist, especially in the case of orbital compartment syndrome, is key to optimal patient outcomes.
