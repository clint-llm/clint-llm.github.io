Trichoblastomas and trichoepitheliomas are benign hair-germ tumors that most commonly arise on the face and scalp of adults. They may mimic basal cell carcinoma, among other cutaneous adnexal tumors, clinically and warrant histopathologic evaluation. Although these lesions most often appear sporadically, they are sometimes associated with familial genetic syndromes. The exact incidence and prevalence of TE/TB in the general population (as well as familial genetic syndromes) are not known, but cases are rare. Most sporadic lesions present in adults aged 40 or older. This activity illustrates the evaluation of these lesions and highlights the role of the healthcare team in their management.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize histopathologic findings of trichoblastomas and trichoepitheliomas.
- Identify differential diagnoses for trichoblastomas and trichoepitheliomas.
- Review treatment modalities that may be considered for patients with either solitary or multiple trichoblastomas or trichoepitheliomas.
- Explain the relationship between trichoblastomas and trichoepitheliomas, as well as their associated familial genetic conditions.
