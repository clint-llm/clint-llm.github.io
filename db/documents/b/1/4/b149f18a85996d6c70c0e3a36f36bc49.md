In hyperbaric medicine, healthcare professionals must recognize that approved indications are not common knowledge amongst those that do not practice it. Some healthcare professionals may be aware of hyperbaric medicine if the facility they work in has a chamber, but they still may not know the indications or when it is appropriate to refer patients. Part of being a hyperbaric clinician is to educate colleagues in the community to collaborate and provide the best care to patients. When evaluating patients, healthcare professionals must first determine if they have an indicated diagnosis. Healthcare professionals must also educate patients during the consultation and make sure they are willing to comply with safety regulations and rules of the chamber environment, the number of treatments recommended, and the frequency of treatments indicated by their plan of care. This activity reviews the considerations for the use of hyperbaric oxygen and discusses the role of the interprofessional team in appropriately selecting patients for hyperbaric oxygen treatment.

**Objectives:**
- Review the indicated diagnosis of hyperbaric therapy.
- Describe the educational needs of patients that are necessary for hyperbaric therapy.
- Explain the contraindications of hyperbaric therapy.
- This activity discusses the use of hyperbaric oxygen and the role of the interprofessional team in appropriately selecting patients for hyperbaric oxygen treatment.
