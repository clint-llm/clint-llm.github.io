Nightstick fractures are characteristically acute injuries caused by some form of direct trauma to the forearm. Nightstick fractures are typically closed injuries, and patients present with obvious pain and lack of function in the affected extremity.

On physical examination, practitioners should begin with a thorough examination of the skin to rule out an open fracture, which would change the immediate management of this patient. A thorough examination of the elbow and wrist is crucial to identify an associated Monteggia fracture or injury to the wrist. Clinicians should test the patient's range of motion at the elbow, palpating for any "clicks" or "clunks" at the site of the radial head. Similarly, a "shuck test" should be performed at the wrist to assess for weakness or instability at the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ).
