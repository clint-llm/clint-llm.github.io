The majority of individuals with CFRD present with no obvious clinical symptoms at the time of diagnosis. Polyuria and polydipsia as presenting symptoms are less common in CFRD than in other forms of new-onset diabetes. Failure to maintain or gain weight irrespective of adequate nutrition may also present as the first indication of CFRD. Growth deceleration and weight loss generally precede the manifestation of CFRD by several years in the pediatric patient population with CF. A reduction in BMI before the diagnosis of CFRD may not necessarily appear in the pediatric population because of both weight and height decrease together.
