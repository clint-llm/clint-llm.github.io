As with many medications, there must be interprofessional communication regarding the dispensing and monitoring of the various TNF alpha inhibitors. With inflammatory bowel disease and other autoimmune disorders, physicians and pharmacists mustÂ be aware of the treatment guidelines when deciding to treat with TNF alpha inhibitors as opposed to other treatment options.

For example, infliximab requires an infusion over a specified period, cannot be combined with other medications, and there is the possibility of infusion-related reactions. Nursing should be well educated about these facts and coordinate with the pharmacy regarding the dosing and administration. Pharmacy always needs to be involved in dose verification and closely monitor drug interactions, informing the physician if there are any concerns. The healthcare team must work together to ensure patient safety, and the use of electronic medical records may be useful in this setting.

Additionally, the interprofessional healthcare team should be aware of the evolving nature of biosimilars as they relate to prescribing TNF alpha inhibitors and keep up-to-date on the available prescribing options.
