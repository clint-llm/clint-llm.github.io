Patients with osteoarthritis or who are at risk for developing osteoarthritis should be educated on lifestyle modifications to reduce the risk of disease progression or development. Patient education should focus on weight loss and moderate daily exercise to improve mobility and stability. Patients should be advised to avoid overuse of pain medication and watch for unfavorable side effects from their medication's prolonged use. Available assistive devices, including canes and splints, should be offered to patients if clinically indicated.
