Following surgical resection, there is no clear role for chemotherapy or immunotherapy in renal cell carcinoma. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sunitinib and pazopanib), mTOR inhibitors (everolimus and temsirolimus) have been approved for metastatic ccRCC.Â mTOR inhibitor, along with lenvatinib (VEGFR inhibitor), is used as a second-line agent in metastatic ccRCC.
