The examiner elicits the Hoffman-Tinel sign by tapping firmly with the fingertip over the course of the nerve. The point at which symptoms are provoked indicates nerve compression or regeneration depending on the clinical scenario. Recreation of the "pins and needles" feeling is considered a positive Hoffman-Tinel sign. Literature has shown a diverse variety in the sensitivity of the Hoffman-Tinel sign (23Â to 67%), though it has been generally observed to be highly specific (95 to 99%).
