Acetylcholine is closely associated with muscarinic receptors and activation of the parasympathetic nervous system, except for sweat glands, which are part of the sympathetic response. Overstimulation of these receptors can lead to an increased parasympathetic response leading to harmful effects. Several common diseases can be associated with dysfunctional muscarinic receptors. One major overstimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system is COPD and asthma due to the increased bronchial constriction, which leads to shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. Treatment of COPD involves anticholinergics, whereas asthma treatment uses drugs that cause a reversal of acetylcholine binding or an increase of sympathetic to decrease symptoms.

Muscarinic receptors are prevalent on the detrusor muscle and are involved with contraction. Dysfunction of these receptors leads to overstimulation and increased contraction of the bladder.
