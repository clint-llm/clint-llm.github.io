Injury prevention in the home involves limiting access to dangerous chemicals by young children. Childproofing the home to ensure a safe environment requires healthcare providers of all types to educate parents of infants and young children on the importance of injury prevention. Injury prevention in the workplace is multifaceted and requires adequate personal protective equipment when handling chemicals and worker knowledge of the chemicals with which they work. Onsite decontamination capabilities are required by law, and workers must know where they are and how to use them in case of exposure. Periodic hazardous materials training to include decontamination techniques should be offered where dangerous chemical exposures may occur.
