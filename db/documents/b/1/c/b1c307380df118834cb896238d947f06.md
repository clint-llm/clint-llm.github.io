Stratification of these patients is vital to identify those who might benefit from adjunctive treatments. All the salvage therapies described above have been associated with improved oxygenation, but none of them have proven to improve mortality except proning and neuromuscular blockade early in the course of ARDS. Early application within 7 days of respiratory failure is critical for the success of ECMO, and thus early transfer to specialized centers with ECMO capabilities is required. ECMO remains a feasible option as rescue therapy for refractory hypoxemia but needs to be performed in tertiary or quaternary centers, which are better equipped to be able to handle consequences.
