**Safety Goggles**– The eye is an organ that is at particular risk during laser treatment. Therefore, ocular protection during laser use is critically important for the patient and all members of a laser team. Safety goggles should be specific to the wavelength of the laser in use and should fit snugly and comfortably.

**Eye Shields**– In addition to safety goggles, patients undergoing laser therapy in the vicinity of the face or eye should also be provided with corneal shields. Corneal shields can be made of metal or plastic and should be lubricated before insertion. While ocular injury has occurred during the use of corneal shields, the incident of damage is higher when the shields have not been worn.

**Local Anesthesia**- Heat generation and tissue destruction, both hallmarks of laser therapy, can be painful.

**General Anesthesia**- At times, local anesthetics are insufficient for pain control in cutaneous laser therapy. This situation is encountered more frequently in the pediatric population, as it can be traumatic to require a child to stay still during a prolonged and painful procedure. In such cases, general anesthesia exposure should be discussed with patients and their parents, as well as anesthesia colleagues.****

**Coolant**– Cooling of the treated surface may be achieved through a connected device, or immediately postoperatively by placing ice or ice packs over the treated area.
