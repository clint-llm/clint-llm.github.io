Little training is needed for administering this test. The scale can be downloaded or filled out online. It involves 14 mobility tasks, with the tasks varying in degrees of difficulty. The tasks are divided into 3 domains: sitting balance, standing balance, and dynamic balance. In the sitting balance, the task is the evaluation of sitting unsupported. Standing balance consist of standing unsupported, standing with eyes closed, standing with feet together, standing on one foot, turning to look behind, grabbing an object from the floor, reaching forward with outstretched arms, and placing one foot in front of the other.  In the last domain, the dynamic balance is evaluated with the individual going from sitting to standing, standing to sitting, transferring, turning 360 degrees, placing one foot on a step.

Each task is graded on a 5-point ordinal scale that ranges from 0 to 4 for a maximum score of 56. In general, a score of 0 is given when the individual is unable to perform the task, and a score of 4 is given when able to complete the given task independently. Other factors that affect the points given are the time it takes to complete the task, the time a position can be maintained, and the amount of supervision or assistance required. The more time or supervision required or the need to use assistive devices affects the points given.

The 14 tasks each come with specific instructions on how to perform. For example, when testing the standing unsupported with eyes close, the instructions are to “to close your eyes and stand still for 10 seconds". If the patient is able to stand for 10 seconds safely, a score of 4 is given, if able to stand 10 seconds with supervision, a score of 3, able to stand for 3 seconds, a score of 2, unable to keep eyes closed 3 seconds but stays safely gives a score of 1, and a score of 0 is given if the patient needs help to keep from falling.
