The Internal iliac artery branches into the uterine artery, vaginal artery, superior, vesical artery, obturator artery, inferior gluteal artery, internal pudendal artery and obliterated umbilical artery. Simpsonâ€™s artery, a branch of the uterine artery, runs along the length of the round ligament. Ovarian arteries originate directly from the aorta. The left ovarian vein drains into the left renal vein. The right ovarian vein drains directly into the inferior vena cava. The uterine vein drains to the pelvic nodes and para-aortic. The cervical vein drains to the parametrial nodes, obturator nodes, pelvic nodes and para-aortic nodes. The ovarian vein drains to the pelvic nodes and para-aortic nodes.
