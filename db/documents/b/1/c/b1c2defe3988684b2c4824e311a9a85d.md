Grading and staging the disease before proceeding towards treatment is essential. The grading of endometrial cancer is based on the presence of a solid component. If the adenocarcinoma contains 5% or less of the solid component, it is graded as grade I. Presence of 6% - 50% of solid component is labeled as grade II, and tumors that have more than 50% of the solid component are referred to as grade III. Staging of endometrial cancer is done based on the extent of the spread of the disease. Stage I endometrial carcinoma is limited to the uterus. If cancer extends into the cervix, it is labeled as Stage II. Metastasis of the tumor into serosa, vagina, and pelvic lymph nodes is labeled as stage III, whereas metastasis to distant sites (bowel/bladder) or abdominal or inguinal lymph nodes is labeled as stage IV.

According to staging as per International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics Staging System for Endometrial Cancer, 2009, the staging is as follows:

Stage I- Limited to the uterus

- IA- Limited to the endometrium, no invasion or invasion of less than half of the myometrium

- IB- Invasion of more than half of the myometrium

Stage II- Invasion into the cervical stroma

Stage III- Extension into pelvis or vagina

- IIIA- Invasion into the serosa or adnexa

- IIIB- Vaginal or parametrial involvement

- IIIC- Spread to pelvic (III C1) or para-aortic lymph nodes (III C2)

Stage IV- Extension into bladder/rectum or distant metastasis

- IVA- Extension into bladder/bowel mucosa

- IVB- Distant metastasis into omental or inguinal lymph nodes
