Patients taking triamcinolone should undergo monitoring to relieve symptoms and any adverse effects. The liver (LFTs) and kidney (BUN and creatinine concentrations) function also require monitoring in individuals with hepatic or renal impairment, and dose adjustment is made accordingly.

Triamcinolone should be stored in a cool, dry area at room temperature (between 68 to 77 degrees F).
