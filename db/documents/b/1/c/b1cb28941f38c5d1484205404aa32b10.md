Ebola virus was named after the Ebola River, where it first emerged in 1976. The working theory of the zoonotic vector for the Ebola virus infection in humans is the consumption of meat from infected non-human primates such as monkeys, apes, and chimpanzees. Strains of the Ebolavirus can be found in bats. However, it has yet proven transmission to humans.

Infected humans can transmit the virus through contact with bodily fluids, including saliva, blood, urine, feces, sweat, breast milk, semen, or fomites. Interestingly, the Ebola virus can survive in semen for up to 21 days after the patient has recovered. To date, there is conflicting information on whether vaginal secretions harbor or spread the Ebola virus. Once infected, the virus will incubate within the host during an asymptomatic, non-contagious period, usually lasts between several days to a few weeks. An infected person exhibiting signs and symptoms resembling a typical viral illness is considered contagious.

The virus enters the new host through mucosal membranes or broken skin. Note the mucosal membrane does not need to be damaged for the virus to enter the host. The virus can survive outside the human body for an unknown amount of time. Most often, the bedding, clothes, medical utensils utilized in patients are all burned or disposed of as medical waste to avoid contamination and the risk of spreading the virus.
