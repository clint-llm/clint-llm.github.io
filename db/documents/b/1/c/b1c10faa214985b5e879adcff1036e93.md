The severity of complications from external auditory exostoses is proportional to the size of the exostoses. The size of the exostoses is proportional to the duration and frequency of exposure to cold water.

Conductive hearing loss is a common complication of EAE. The degree of hearing loss is relative to the degree of ear canal occlusion, which is predominantly determined by the size of exostoses. The associated hearing loss is generally due to cerumen impaction on the tympanic membrane caused by blockage from the exostoses.

The ear canal occlusion that can occur due to large exostoses may also propagate an inflammatory process leading to acute external otitis.Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.S. aureus. It is particularly important to cover for P. aeruginosa in patients with diabetes.

In severe cases when otitis externa is recurrent or left untreated, patients can be at risk for developing mastoiditis. Patients are particularly prone to this if they develop a perforation in their tympanic membrane. Seawater can then enter the middle ear and stimulate a more serious infection. Mastoiditis requires prompt treatment with IV antibiotics that coverÂ S. aureus, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and enteric gram-negative rods. Unasyn is an ideal antimicrobial agent.
