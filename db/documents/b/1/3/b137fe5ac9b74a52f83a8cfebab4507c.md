The nerves of the foot, their branches, and their origins include

- Superficial peroneal (fibular) nerve (arises from the common fibular nerve)

- Deep peroneal (fibular) nerve (arising from the common fibular nerve)

- Tibial nerve (arises in the popliteal fossa as a division of the sciatic nerve)
            
              
- Medial plantar nerve (arises from the larger terminal branch of the tibial nerve)
                
                  
- Digital nerves (arise from both the medial and lateral plantar nerves)
                  
                

              
              
- Lateral plantar nerve (arises from the smaller terminal branch of the tibial nerve)
                
                  
- Inferior calcaneal nerve, also known as Baxter’s nerve (typically arises as the first branch of the lateral plantar nerve)
                  
                

              
              
- Medial calcaneal nerve (typically arises from the tibial nerve)

- Sural nerve (typically arises from branches of both the common fibular and tibial nerves)

- Saphenous nerve (arises from the femoral nerve)
