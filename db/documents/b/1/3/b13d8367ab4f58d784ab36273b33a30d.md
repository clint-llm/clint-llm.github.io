Hyperoxygenation with 100% FiO2 should be done before airway suctioning. Closed suction catheters are preferable with ventilated patients to reduce the occurrence of airway collapse that may occur when a patient is disconnected from the ventilator. Aseptic precautions should be followed, and personal protective equipment adorned. If unable to advance the suction catheter to the appropriately measured length in a patient with a tracheostomy tube, a healthcare provider should evaluate the patient for possible tube obstruction requiring replacement.
