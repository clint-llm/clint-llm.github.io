The evaluation of cases with AE includes:

A) Visual acuity: Visual acuity should be measured monocularly and binocularly at a distance and near both uncorrected and best-corrected, respectively. Some patients with accommodative excess may report that their visual acuity fluctuates.

B) Refraction: Refractive status of the patients should be evaluated objectively and subjectively. Cycloplegic refraction is the best option for evaluating true refractive status.

C) Ocular mobility: The ocular movements should be assessed in gaze. And the difficulty in movement in any gaze should be noted. This test was performed to rule out the overaction and underaction of a muscle.

D) Cover test: A cover test should be carried out based on the corneal reflection and performed with a small target. IT should be neutralized during the cover test with prisms if any deviation is noted.

E) Near point of convergence (NPC): This test is essential for assessing the binocular function. This test was conducted by a small target. The NPC is the point at which one eye begins to deviate outwards, or the subject report at the point when a small accommodative target becomes double.

F) Amplitude of accommodation (AA): the amount of dioptric power needed to focus an object from infinity to the nearest point; this is known as amplitude of accommodation.

Using a formula based on Diane's data, Hoffstetter proposes an equation to calculate the AA for a different age.

- Mean AA = 18.5 – 0.3 × age

- Minimum AA= 15 – 0.25 × age

- Maximum AA= 25 – 0.4 × age

In clinical practice, we can measure the amplitude of accommodation by the push-up method  (Donder's push-up method) and the minus lens methods.

Donder's push-up method uses the Royal Air Force (RAF) ruler; the near point of accommodation is calculated, thus the accommodation's amplitude.

Minus lens method: In this method, concave lenses are added at 6 feet distance-target monocularly and binocularly until the subject reports blur at a distance. The power of the lens used is the amplitude of accommodation.

G) Relative accommodation: The amount of accommodation required to increase or relax to focus an object binocularly at a specific distance, with a fixed convergence. This can be positive (positive relative accommodation, PRA) or negative (negative relative accommodation, NRA).

NRA refers to the least amount of accommodation or an individual maximum relaxation of accommodation while focusing on an object at a fixed distance. PRA refers to the maximum accommodation used for focusing an object at a fixed distance. A low NRA indicates accommodative excess, and a low PRA indicates accommodative insufficiency.

H) Accommodative facility: This test checks the ability to change the accommodative power rapidly. This test can be done monocularly or binocularly. Clinically this can be measured by an accommodative flipper (+/- 2D or any other combination of plus-minus lenses).

A flipper combines two plus and two minus lenses with the same amount. The subject focuses through one pair of lenses on an object at a fixed distance (generally 40 cm); when the object is well-focused, a flip movement of the flipper is performed, and the asked subject focuses again through them. Then this is reported again; this is one cycle. And record the number of cycles completed per minute. Also, note with which lens the subject faces more difficulty. If the patient has difficulty with plus lens monocularly, then they may have accommodative excess.

I) Monocular estimated method (MEM): This test is done to objectively determine a subject accommodative response that is lead or lag of accommodation.

J) Ocular health and systemic health assessment: External ocular examination to rule out exophthalmos (associated with Graves) and ptosis. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy should be performed to rule out media abnormalities. A refractive procedure is previously done. Dilated fundus examination to rule out retinal abnormalities. Systemic examination to rule out some systemic conditions, i.e., multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus, Graves disease, myasthenia gravis, and mental health assessment.

K) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and or computed tomography (CT) Scan: in case of close head trauma, it is essential to rule out any organic cause using an advanced imaging procedure.
