Two vestigial embryonic structures with no known physiologic function include the following:

- At the cranial end of the paramesonephric duct (Mullerian duct), sometimes one will find the appendix testis. This pear-shaped vestigial structure is found in about 2% of testes, and it is typically located at the superior pole in the groove between the head of the epididymis and testis.

- Also at the cranial end of the mesonephric duct one will sometimes find the appendix of the epididymis which is found in about 25% of testes. Their location is variable but often project from the head of the epididymis.

- In about 7% of males, the epididymis may be located on the anterior surface of the testis.
