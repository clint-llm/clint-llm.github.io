Hypersensitivity to medication, class of alpha-2-agonist. For epidural use: administration above C4 dermatome. Do not suddenly discontinue the drug; otherwise, there is a risk of rebound hypertension and withdrawal symptoms. Dose adjustment is necessary for renal impairment, cardiovascular, bradycardia, hypotension, and severe coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. Also, caution is necessary when treating patients with a history of depression, recent myocardial infarction (MI), and syncope.

Pregnant patients should enroll or be encouraged to enroll in the National Pregnancy Registry for ADHD Medications. Clinicians should weigh the risk vs. benefit of giving clonidine to breastfeeding patients; while there is little adequate human data on risks, there is a chance for infant sedation hypotonia and apnea. The drug could also theoretically impair breast milk production because of decreased prolactin levels.

There are no absolute drug interaction contraindications listed for clonidine; however, there are numerous agents that require caution, and the clinician is recommended to perform thorough medication reconciliation and enlist the services of a pharmacist if necessary.
