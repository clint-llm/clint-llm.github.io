A conjunctival concretion is a benign entity characterized by single or multiple discrete yellowish-white deposits of varying size. They may be idiopathic and are generally a finding in elderly individuals or secondary to chronic conjunctival inflammation like in trachoma. They typically exist in the subepithelial space of palpebral conjunctiva or fornices. Concretions are usually asymptomatic when small but larger ones may cause symptoms.
