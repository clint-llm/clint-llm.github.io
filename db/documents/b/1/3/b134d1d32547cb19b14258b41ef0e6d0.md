The incidence of prepatellar bursitis is difficult to accurately assess, as a large percentage of cases that actually reach the point of presentation to a healthcare setting are likely to be septic, while the mild cases may never seek care. However, it is believed to have an annual incidence of 10/100,000, with more than 80% of all bursitis patients being males aged 40–60 years.
