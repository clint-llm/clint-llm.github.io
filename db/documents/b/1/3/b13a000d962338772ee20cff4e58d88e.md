The prognosis of the nerve injury depends on the severity of the injury and the time of repairs. Minor laceration with immediate surgical repairs with supportive precautions has the best prognosis and helps minimize the associated deformities.

Symptoms of carpal tunnel often resolve six months after the onset of symptoms. Prognosis is better the younger the patient, and prognosis is worse when there is a bilateral positive Phalen test on an exam. Most cases of pregnancy-induced carpal tunnel spontaneously resolve after delivery.

Conservative therapies often improve symptoms within two to six weeks. Maximal benefits for conservative therapies in carpal tunnel occur at three months. When one approach fails to improve symptoms after six weeks of the current management, another approach should merit consideration.

Several predictors are associated with the failure of conservative/nonsurgical therapy.

Surgical decompression has a successful outcome in roughly 70 to 90% of cases. Most patients note significant improvement at one week and can return to their normal routine two weeks post-operatively. However, some patients can take up to a year for a full recovery.
