The patient is placed on the operating table under general endotracheal anesthesia through an orotracheal tube. If difficult intubation is anticipated due to airway compromise, a planned awake fiberoptic intubation or preoperative tracheotomy can be performed with local anesthesia and vasoconstrictor preparation.

Many surgeons plan on an immediate direct laryngoscopy after the airway has been secured to confirm the location and extent of the tumor and to plan the location of the initial pharyngotomy during the laryngectomy (into the pyriform versus the vallecula).
