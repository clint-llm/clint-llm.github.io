The pathophysiology of CAV is complex, with an interplay of immunological and non-immunological factors. Inflammation may be triggered by donor arrest, organ procurement, and allograft ischemia and reperfusion. CAV is a pan-arterial process characterized by diffuse concentric hyperplasia of the intima seen in epicardial coronary arteries. It also extends to the microvasculature, causing concentric medial disease.

Intravascular ultrasound-guided studies have shown that most of the intimal thickening occurs during the first year post-transplant.
