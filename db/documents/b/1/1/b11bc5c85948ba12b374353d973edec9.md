- Avoidance of triggers, especially in those with seasonal symptoms, is encouraged, although it is not always practical, such as in the case of allergy to pollens.

- Precautions can be taken to avoid dust mites, animal dander, and upholstery.

- If removal of a pet from the home is not feasible, isolating the pet to a single room in the house may be an option. It is important to note that it may take up to 20 weeks to completely eliminate cat dander from a home even after removal.

- It is also recommended to use allergen-impermeable bedding covers, wash sheets in hot water, and use a vacuum cleaner with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters.
