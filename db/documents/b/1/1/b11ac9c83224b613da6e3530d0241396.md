In a young, healthy adult male presenting with right lower quadrant abdominal pain, the differential diagnosis includes appendicitis, typhlitis, epiploic appendagitis, perforated viscous, inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis, small bowel obstruction, testicular torsion, epididymitis, hernia, urinary tract infection, and pyelonephritis. Extra-abdominal causes such as abdominal muscle strain or a hernia and skin disorders such as herpes zoster viral infection are less likely.
