**Medical Interventions**

- Anti-arrhythmics

- Anti-epileptics

- Anti-myotonic drugs

- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

- Steroids

**Anti-Arrhythmics: **The pharmacological treatment of patients with a prevalent involvement of the cardiac tissue conduction relies on the use of ACE-inhibitors and appropriate antiarrhythmic drugs. In the case of atrial arrhythmias, the preference is for drugs such as antiarrhythmics (flecainide, propafenone) and beta-blockers. Amiodarone should be limited to patients who do not respond to the previous drugs, taking in mind that these are young patients, long-term therapy, and a high risk of adverse effects on the thyroid and pulmonary function.

**Anti-Epileptics: **Children need to be followed closely by neurologists. Management of epilepsy is necessary for some patients.

**Anti-Myotonics: **The pain associated with muscle rigidity is greatly alarming in the patient.

**Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: **Treatment involves the administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to decrease pain and inflammation.

**Steroids:**Glucocorticoids, administered as prednisone in a dose of 0.75 mg/kg per day, significantly slow progression of muscular dystrophy for up to 3 years.

**Golodirsen (SRP-4053):**This drug is an antisense therapy used for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Patients need to have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene to facilitate exon 53 skipping. It is FDA approved, but the evidence to support its use is not yet well established.

**Surgical Interventions**

- Defibrillator or a cardiac pacemaker

- Contracture release

- Shoulder surgery

- Spinal correction

**Contracture Release:**Surgical release of contracture deformities is used to maintain normal function as long as possible.

**Defibrillator or Cardiac Pacemaker: **Cardiac function requires monitoring, and pacemaker placement may be a consideration if there is evidence of heart block.

**Shoulder Surgery:**Individuals with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy may benefit from surgery to stabilize the shoulder.

**Spinal Correction:**Scoliotic surgery is an option when curves exceed 20 degrees to prolong respiratory function or walking ability or both.

**Other Interventions**

- Supportive physiotherapy

- Supportive bracing

- Supportive counseling

- Genetic counseling

In addition to pharmacologic intervention, general supportive care may be beneficial, including physical therapy, range of motion exercises, padding, skincare, orthotics, and safety awareness.

**Supportive Physiotherapy:** Treatment includes supportive physiotherapy to prevent contractures and prolong ambulation.

**Supportive Bracing: **This helps to maintain normal function as long as possible  Proper wheelchair seating is essential. Molded ankle-foot orthoses help stabilize gait in patients with foot drop.

**Supportive Counseling:
**Some forms of muscular dystrophy may be arrested for prolonged periods, and most patients remain active with a normal life expectancy.

**Genetic Counseling —**Genetic counseling is recommended.
