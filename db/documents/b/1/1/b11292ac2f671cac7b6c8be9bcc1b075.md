Brow ptosis is a relatively common problem but is often misdiagnosed or overlooked due to more apparent upper eyelid pathologies. When patients present to primary care providers, they should be referred to a facial plastic, general plastic, or oculoplastic surgeon for definitive treatment. Once patients are directed to the correct surgeon, close coordination among nurses, physicians, case managers, and others in direct contact with the patients is key to timely and satisfactory outcomes. Cases that are not age-related may require further consultation with neurosurgeons, infectious disease specialists, neurologists, rheumatologists, or other specialists.

Intraoperatively, an interprofessional support staff of specialty-trained nurses who are familiar with the equipment and selected procedure in cooperation with a properly trained and experienced surgeon is crucial to executing a safe and effective procedure that produces satisfactory outcomes.
