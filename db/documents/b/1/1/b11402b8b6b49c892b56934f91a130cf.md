Currently, there no specific antidotes for any antiplatelet medications discussed above, and reversal guidelines are not universal. Activated charcoal can be considered if the patient can safely take oral liquids, and the patient arrives early post-ingestion, typically within the first 1 to 2 hours. Initial treatment should focus on local hemorrhage control. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage, if proximal or distal, may be amenable to endoscopic evaluation and treatment. Management for patients presenting with severe bleeding associated with antiplatelet medications mayÂ include platelet transfusions and desmopressin. However, there is no robust data to support desmopressin.
