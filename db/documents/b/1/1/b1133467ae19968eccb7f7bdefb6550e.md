Like bronchial asthma in the general population, spirometry can help in bronchial asthma diagnosis in pregnancy by detecting reversible airway obstructive pattern and helping to monitor response to asthma treatment.

A methacholine challenge test is contraindicated during pregnancy as it may lead to acute bronchospasm.

An asthma control test (ACT) can be used to assess bronchial asthma control during pregnancy. The ACT is five items, with a 4-week recall of symptoms and daily functioning (self-administered questionnaire). The scores range from 5, indicating poor asthma control, to 25 for complete control. A score of less than 20 on the ACT is defined as uncontrolled asthma.

Bronchial asthma patients are considered to have bronchial asthma exacerbation if they have a change of the basal condition which leads to any of the following:

- Adding oral corticosteroids for BA treatment

- Unscheduled outpatient visits

- Admission to the emergency room or the need for hospitalization
