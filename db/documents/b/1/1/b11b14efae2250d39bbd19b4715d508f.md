Undertriage of geriatric trauma patients at risk for moderate to severe injury is a major problem and often begins during the pre-hospital assessment. Studies have shown that patients treated at a trauma center have improved outcomes**.**Other studies found that compared with younger patients with similar injury severity scores (ISS) patients over 70 had a three-fold increase in mortality**.**Based on these and other studies, the American College of Surgeons’ triage criteria suggests patients age 55 years and above be considered for transport to a trauma center to receive their care**.**Also, geriatric trauma criteria have been implemented at the state level to address undertriage.

These criteria help identify patients who would be more appropriately transported to a trauma center. Data on the use of geriatric trauma criteria suggest overall outcomes have improved.  Pre-hospital providers must maintain a high clinical suspicion for serious injury, regardless of the mechanism of injury.

Elder abuse is under-reported, and the incidence is rising. The prevalence of elder abuse in the United States is estimated to be about 10%. It can present in many ways, for example, physical, emotional, financial, sexual, and neglect. Physicians should maintain a high level of suspicion to identify those at risk. Those in immediate danger should be hospitalized.
