Pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, and pneumothorax could result not only from injuries to the tracheobronchial tree but also secondary to injuries to the larynx, pulmonary parenchyma, and esophagus. Air could also enter the thorax from outside via chest wall trauma, and also via transdiaphragmatic spread from the abdomen. With blunt and penetrating injuries contributing significantly to tracheobronchial tear, it is crucial to carefully evaluate for concomitant injuries to carotid arteries, jugular veins, aorta, pulmonary trunk and recurrent laryngeal and vagal nerve injuries in chest/neck trauma settings. All those associated injuries discussed above could cause shock, sepsis, pneumonia, atelectasis, bronchiectasis, stroke, and multiorgan dysfunction, which could significantly increase the mortality in tracheobronchial injury.
