Despite advances, the prognosis for most malignant pleural mesothelioma patients is grim; death is inevitable within 4 to 6 months. With treatment, some patients may survive 15 to 18 months. Rarely,Â 5-year survivals have been reported. The biggest problem is tumor recurrence, especially in patients managed with surgery.

Patients undergoing surgery may have slightly longer survival, but they also develop many complications related to the procedure. These complications include arrhythmias, wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, air leak, respiratory failure, postoperative bleeding, and myocardial infarction. Poor prognostic factors include nonepithelial histology, poor performance status, age over 75, dyspnea and chest pain on presentation, elevated lactate dehydrogenase and low hemoglobin on presentation, and weight loss.
