The pudendal nerves supply the major cutaneous and motor innervation to the structures in the perineum. It is formed from the anterior division of the anterior rami of the second, third and fourth sacral spinal nerve of the sacral plexus. The pudendal nerve leaves the pelvic cavity via the greater sciatic foramen and passes around the sacrospinous ligament to enter the anal triangle via the lesser sciatic foramen. It lies medial to the internal pudendal artery.

The larger terminal branch of the pudendal nerve, the perineal nerve divides into the muscular branches and the posterior labial or scrotal branches in females and males respectively. In females, the posterior labial nerve has a medial and lateral branch and runs along the lateral part of the urethral triangle to supply the skin of the labia majora and sensory innervation to the skin of the lower vagina. In males, the posterior scrotal nerve also has a medial and lateral branch that runs along the lateral aspect of the urethral triangle to innervate the skin of the scrotum. The dorsal nerve of the penis and clitoris originates in the deep perineal pouch and penetrates the perineal membrane to supply sensory innervation to the penis and clitoris.

Muscular branches of the perineal nerve supply the bulbospongiosus, ischiocavernosus and the superficial transverse perineal muscles. A nerve to the bulb of the urethra supplies the corpus spongiosum of the penis in males and terminates in the urethral mucosa.
