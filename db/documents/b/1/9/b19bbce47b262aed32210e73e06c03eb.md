Events preceding the worsening of neurological symptoms should be analyzed during history taking. Factors including exercise, taking a hot bath or shower, exposure to the sun, menstrual cycle, psychological stress, hot meals, fever, and infection should be addressed as any of these can precipitate worsening of the symptoms in MS patients. The transient worsening of the symptoms induced by such factors is termed 'pseudo exacerbation' or 'pseudo-relapse' as opposed to a true relapse or exacerbation in MS patients.
