The liaison committee on medical education (LCME) highly encourages the use of simulation in a medical student curriculum. It has been shown that the incorporation of high fidelity simulator-based scenarios into a third-year pediatric clerkship curriculum had high student satisfaction and led to improved objective structured clinical exam (OSCE) performance.

Furthermore, there is a trend in medical student education to place greater emphasis on patient encounters early within a studentâ€™s training. As an example, a pre-clerkship pediatric simulation curriculum was implemented at Johns Hopkins that consisted of a 5-day simulation course, after which the shelf scores and procedure performance evaluations improved.
