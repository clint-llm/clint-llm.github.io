Ectopic kidneys are often incidental findings, so they will often be found by non-urologists. Given the relatively uncommon nature of the condition with even fewer cases presenting clinically, most of the studies are small case series without adequate controls.

An interprofessional team approach is needed to do this effectively with good communication between the diagnosing clinician and, if needed, pediatric urologists in antenatally diagnosed cases who would continue care after delivery. In the case of a postnatal diagnosis, the clinician would also need to arrange appropriate follow up. Urology should be involved early to help with diagnosing specific problems associated with ectopic pelvic kidneys and to correct them if necessary. This is of particular importance if the patient develops long term complications such as chronic kidney disease or stones. Patients need to be empowered to take ownership of their care and fully understand their condition and treatment options.
