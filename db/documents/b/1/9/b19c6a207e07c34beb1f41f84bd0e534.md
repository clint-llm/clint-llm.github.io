The blood supply and nerve innervation to the opponens pollicis muscle originates from the recurrent branch of the median nerve. Any damage to either the nerve innervation or blood supply proximally can result in damage to the opponens pollicis muscle. Any compression to the subclavian artery or the brachial plexus can present in the hand's presentation at rest and defected hand movements. If there is damage to the median nerve, it will present as atrophy of the thenar muscles/eminence at baseline.

Damage to the median nerve proximally will present as the "Pope's blessing." When the patient is asked to make a fist, the fourth and fifth digits will flex while the first, second, and third digits remain extended. If the damage to the median nerve is distal, it will present as the "median claw." This presentation will present when instructing the patient to extend the fingers. The fourth and fifth digits will extend while the thumb will stay in a resting position with the second and third digits flexed at the metacarpophalangeal joints.
