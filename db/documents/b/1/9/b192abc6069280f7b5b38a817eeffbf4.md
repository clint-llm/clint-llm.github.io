Superficial peroneal nerve carries sensations from the anterolateral aspect of the leg and the greater part of the dorsum of the foot (except for the first web space). Entrapment of the superficial peroneal nerve is not uncommon. Because of its long course, the entrapment can occur between the fibula and peroneus longus, within peroneus longus, between peroneus brevis and extensor digitorum longus muscles, at the fascial tunnel where it emerges through the deep fascia to become superficial, the lower third of the fibula and in front of the lateral malleolus. Patients having entrapment of the nerve suffer from pain, tingling, and paresthesia along anterolateral aspect of the leg and most of the dorsum of the foot. The differential diagnosis includes L5 radiculopathy, lumbosacral plexopathy, Sciatic mononeuropathy, common peroneal neuropathy, arterial insufficiency, and anterior compartment syndrome. Blocking of the nerve eases the symptoms of the entrapment and allows for painless surgical procedures for pathologies over the dorsum of the foot in the area supplied by the superficial peroneal nerve. The ultrasound-guided block provides better results and lower complications than the landmark-guided block.
