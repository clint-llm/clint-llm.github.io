Laryngeal and tracheal stents are primarily used for the postoperative period to support airways after reconstructive surgery. They are also commonly used as palliative care measures in patients with end-stage airway disease or lung malignancies and inserted mainly by interventional pulmonologists in these patient populations. Experience and knowledge of a surgeon or a provider are crucial in deciding to useÂ a laryngeal or tracheal stent and stent type.

No proper guidelines exist to guide in deciding the type and material of the stent. The future insight should focus on developing an ideal stent capable of maintaining a patent airway, being available in different sizes, expanding, having no complications, and causing minimal tissue reaction.
