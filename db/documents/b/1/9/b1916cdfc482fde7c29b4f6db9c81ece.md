Embryologic development of the limbs begins at the end of the fourth week of fetal development. By the sixth week, the fetus develops hand plates and footplates. During limb development, the shape of the limb is formed by mesenchymal cells condensing and differentiating into chondrocytes which will ultimately differentiate into the bones and cartilage of the upper and lower extremity. The upper and lower extremities undergo very similarÂ embryological development patterns. Limb musculature is first seen around the seventh week. The mesenchyme migrates from the dorsolateral cells of somites out to the limb and is differentiated into muscle cells. The shoulder muscles develop earlier than the distal muscles of the upper extremity.
