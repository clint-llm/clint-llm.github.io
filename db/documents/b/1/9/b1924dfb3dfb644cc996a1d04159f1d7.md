The three types of mesothelioma are epithelioid, sarcomatoid, and mixed. The epithelioid type is associated with better outcomes. The tumor is often multifocal, forming multiple nodules starting with the parietal pleura. Spread occurs locally in the visceral pleura before extending to the chest wall, diaphragm, or mediastinum. Regional lymph node spread begins with the bronchopulmonary or hilar lymph nodes before moving to the carinal, internal mammary or peridiaphragmatic nodes.

The pattern of nodal metastases is different from that seen in lung cancer. With malignant pleural mesothelioma, there is a direct local invasion of the lymph nodes. Overall, the involvement of lymph nodes in malignant pleural mesothelioma is not common.
