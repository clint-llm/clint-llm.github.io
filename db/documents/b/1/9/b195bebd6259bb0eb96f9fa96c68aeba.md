Complement testingÂ is available for many of the complement proteins, including:

- C1

- C1q

- C2

- C3

- C4

- CH50

- CH100

- Total complement

Specific tests may assist in monitoring disease activity and treatment, such as in hypocomplementemia and systemic lupus erythematosus (both with low C3 and C4).

CH50

Testing for 50% hemolytic complement activity of serum (serum CH50) assesses the activity of the classical activation pathway. The normal range is 22 to 40 units/mL, indicating the presence of complement proteins 1 through 9.
