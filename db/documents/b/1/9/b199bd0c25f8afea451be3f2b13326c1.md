**Radiological Differentials**

- Pyogenic and fungal infections

- Neoplastic – Lytic benign, benign aggressive and malignant (primary tumors and spinal metastases): In general, spinal metastasis and primary spinal malignancies present with primary vertebral body involvement and disc space preservation as compared to TB and other infections. Tuberculosis also presents with soft tissue and perivertebral abscess, in comparison with malignant tumors.

**Differentials Based on Pathological Appearance**

- Other pathologies involving granulomatous infections and clinically mimic TB include:

- Atypical bacteria: Actinomyces israelii, Nocardia asteroids, Brucella
- Fungi: Coccidioides immitis, Blastomyces dermatitidis, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillosis
- Spirochetes: Treponema pallidum

- Other pathologies presenting with non-caseating granulomas include Sarcoidosis, Wegener's granulomatosis, Crohn disease, and leprosy.
