One entity that can affect the nasopalatine nerve is a nasopalatine duct cyst, wherein remnants of the nasopalatine duct epithelium are stimulated to proliferate, either by trauma, infection, or mucus retention. It is the most common non-odontogenic cyst of the maxilla, occurring in 1% of the population- most commonly arising in middle age. Standard treatment requires surgical excision via a sublabial or palatal approach. As the cyst is not a true neoplasm, it can also be treated by marsupialization to the nasal cavity.

Dysesthesia of the anterior palate or maxillary teeth may occur after septoplasty, especially if the procedure addressed low septal spurs, and there is a need for the use of cautery or osteotomes.
