The mutation of the lysosomal trafficking regulator  (LYST) gene or Chediak-Higashi syndrome  (CHS1) gene disrupts the protein synthesis and affects the storage and secretory functions of lysosomal granules of leukocytes, fibroblasts, dense bodies of platelets, azurophilic granules of neutrophils, and melanosomes of melanocytes. The defects result in enlarged vesicles and non-functional lysosomes.

On cytology, large, fused, azurophilic granules can be seen mainly in the granulocytes and monocytes but also can be noted in the fibroblasts, Schwann cells,  astrocytes, melanocytes, and hematopoietic cells. These granules are made up of an abnormal fusion between the primary granules (azurophilic) and the secondary granules (specific).

Lymphocytes containing these large granules function poorly in the antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytolysis. Patients also exhibit alterations in the neutrophils, leading to neutropenia, impaired chemotaxis, and delayed phagolysosomal fusion which, in turn, leads to an impaired bactericidal activity. It also was seen that the functions of the natural killer cells also were reduced. A deficiency of serotonin and adenosine phosphate-containing granules in platelets led to the impairment of platelet aggregation as well as prolonged bleeding time.

A diagnosis can be made based on the presence of these granulocytes in the peripheral blood or bone marrow.
