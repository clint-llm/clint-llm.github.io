The significant challenges faced by BRFSS include low response rates, adapting to change in modes of communication, and reaching a multi-language diverse population. The rate of response has dropped significantly since 1993. Currently, surveys are conducted using cell phones and landlines in both English and Spanish. The addition of multi-language versions and new outreach strategies aimed at accessing hard-to-reach respondents is necessary to increase the participation of a diverse and expanding U.S. resident population.
