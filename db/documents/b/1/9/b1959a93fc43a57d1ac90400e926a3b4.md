Minor pancreatic duct injuries are common in acute severe pancreatitis resulting in peripancreatic fluid collection. This fluid collection is often contained and results in pseudocyst formation. Pancreatic necrosis can cause major pancreatic duct injury. Leakage of pancreatic fluid into the necrosis delays the resorption of walled-off necrosis. A persistent internal fistula into peritoneum causes pancreatic ascites. The presence of a pseudocyst or walled-off necrosis increases the odds of pancreatic ascites. Pancreatic fistula could result from a pancreatic duct injury from blunt abdominal trauma, ductal lithiasis, ampullary stenosis, or an iatrogenic cause. Iatrogenic causes of duct injuries include pancreatectomy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and pancreatic biopsy or fine-needle aspiration. Many cases remain idiopathic, and at times, the site of ductal disruption is unable to be found.
