In order to properly perform this procedure, healthcare providers must have a thorough knowledge of the regional anatomy. Digital nerve blocks are intended to anesthetize specific nerves that originate at the wrist from the deep branches of the median, radial, and ulnar nerves. If holding the palm downward and looking down the fingertip toward the hand, there are both dorsal and palmar nerves. The dorsal set of nerves run alongside the digit at the 10- and 2-o'clock positions, while the palmar set of nerves travel at the 4- and 8-o'clock positions (see attached image). The palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve supplies the palmar surface of digits 1-3, the palmar radial surface of digit 4, and the dorsal nailbed of these same digits to approximately the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint. The palmar cutaneous branch of the ulnar nerve supplies the ulnar half of digit 4 on both the palmar and dorsal surfaces, as well as the entirety of digit 5. These nerves are known as the palmar digital nerves. The superficial branch of the radial nerve supplies the dorsal surface of digits 1-3 to approximately the DIP joint and the dorsal radial surface of digit 4. Anatomical knowledge of digital nerve innervations is of clinical relevance due to multiple nerves providing sensation to each finger, in some instances requiring multiple sites of anesthetic to provide adequate analgesia.
