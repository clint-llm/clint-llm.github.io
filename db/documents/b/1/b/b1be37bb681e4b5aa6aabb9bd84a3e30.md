Enhancing outcomes in symptomatic patients with PLD requires an interprofessional team approach from primary care providers, hospitalists, hepatologists, specialty-trained nurses, pharmacists, and interventional radiologists and surgeons at times, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. Clinicians and other specialists will manage the condition overall, but medications should be vetted through a board-certified pharmacotherapy pharmacist, who can collaborate on agent selection, verify dosing, and oversee the medication regimen for drug interactions. Specialized nursing can administer medications, monitor treatment effectiveness, and alert clinicians to any possible adverse effects. In surgical cases, nursing will have involvement throughout the process from surgical prep, assisting during the procedure, and post-operative care, informing the clinician of any issues that they encounter. Such an interprofessional team of health professionals providing an integrated approach to the care of these patients can help to achieve the best possible outcomes. [Level 5]
