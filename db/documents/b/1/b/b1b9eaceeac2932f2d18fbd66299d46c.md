Although the etiology remains unclear, several causes are under investigation. Of these, vitamin E acetate is the most recognized agent associated with an e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI). Supporting this is that a recent study identified vitamin E acetate in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid samples of 48 out of the 51 patients with EVALI as opposed to none in the liquid samples obtained from the healthyÂ control group.
