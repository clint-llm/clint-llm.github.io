**Blood Investigations**

Certain laboratory anomalies have corresponded to cardiovascular involvement and severe illness. These include lymphopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, liver enzymes, ferritin and C-reactive protein, prothrombin time, troponin, creatine phosphokinase, serum creatinine, and D-dimer.

**Imaging**

Transthoracic echocardiography is recommended for inpatients with heart failure, arrhythmia, ECG changes, or newly diagnosed cardiomegaly on chest X-ray or chest CT.

Coronary angiography should be performed depending on the patient's presentation and only if indicated.
