- Discitis is a serious but uncommon cause of back pain

- It is more common in children than adults, has a male predilection, and targets diabetics, and immune-compromised patients

- Diagnosis is often delayed due to the commonality of back pain and unremarkable lab and imagining tests

- MRI is the gold standard of diagnostic testing

- It is usually bacterial

- Treatment consists of antibiotics, immobilization, and less commonly surgery

- Although complete resolution is the most common outcome, neurology deficits can complicate the disease process
