- Most cases of posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD) do not require any treatment.

- In infancy, this condition is easily confused with buphthalmos or congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED).

- Secondary opinion should be sought if the diagnosis is ambiguous.

- The thickened corneal tissue has greater biomechanical resistance to outside force affecting corneal hysteresis.

- Intraocular pressure measurements may be overestimated lending to the appearance of ocular hypertension.

- Asymmetric findings involving the cornea, trabecular meshwork and iris must be differentiated from Chandler syndrome.

- Laser procedures for glaucoma may not be effective if the trabecular meshwork is altered by irregular or aberrant endothelial tissues.

- Goniotomy procedures for glaucoma may not be effective if the trabecular meshwork is altered by irregular or aberrant endothelial tissues.
