The cardiovascular and cerebral effects of altitude are most pronounced at higher altitudes. Generally, high altitude is defined as 1500 to 3500 meters (4,921 to 11,483 feet), very high altitude as 3500 to 5500 meters (11,483 to 18,045 feet), and extreme altitude as greater than 5500 meters (18,045 feet).

Altitude-related illnesses are most common at altitudes greater than 2500 meters (8200 feet), and more severe forms of illness would be uncommon at less than 3000 meters.

The incidence of HAPE strongly correlates with the abruptness of the ascent. In an ascent of 4500 meters over four days, there is a 0.2% incidence of HAPE. This incidence increases to 6% incidence with a one to two-day ascent.
