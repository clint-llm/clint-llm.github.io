Bilateral breast reconstruction is better suited to the small and medium-sized breasts. If unilateral breast reconstruction, the contralateral breast may necessitate mastopexy, reduction, or augmentation to achieve bilateral symmetry.

Large breasted patients can also undergo implant-based reconstruction if they are willing to undergo skin/breast reduction and contralateral surgery.
