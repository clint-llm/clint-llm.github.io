Although the anesthetic plan differs according to the type of fetal procedure and timing of surgery, length, and complexity of the surgery, some common features apply to nearly all the anesthetics for fetal surgeries.

- Altered maternal physiology and maternal anesthesia

- Maintenance of placental blood flow

- Tocolysis

- Fetal anesthetic aspects of fetal surgery

**1. Altered Maternal Physiology and Maternal Anesthesia**

The parturient coming for fetal surgery usually undergo extensive testing and counseling before the procedure and are usually healthy, fall under ASA I or II physical status. However, altered physiology related to pregnancy affects anesthetic management and may pose specific risks. The risks are briefly summarized in the table below.

****

**Physiological Change**

**Anesthetic Significance**

Central nervous system

****

Increased sensitivity to intravenous and inhalational anesthetics due to progesterone and endorphins

****

Decreased minimum alveolar concentration by 30 to 40%

****

Engorged epidural plexus

****

Decreased CSF volume; Less volume of neuraxial medications

Respiratory system

****

Decreased functional residual capacity and increased minute ventilation, increased oxygen consumption

Rapid desaturation with apnea: Preoxygentation and oxygen supplementation

****

Upper airway edema

****

Potential for difficult mask ventilation/ intubation

****

Cardiovascular

****

Increase in plasma volume, Cardiac output, and decreased peripheral vascular resistance

****

Labile blood pressure

Aortocaval compression: May reduce cardiac output by 25%

****

Supine hypotension syndrome: Left laterally tilted position

Gastrointestinal

****

Decreased lower esophageal sphincter tone

Increased intra-abdominal pressure

****

Increased risk of aspiration: Aspiration prophylaxis, Rapid sequence induction, awake extubation

****

Hepatic

****

Decreased plasma proteins and albumin

****

Increased risk of pulmonary edema: Increased risk of fluid overload

****

Decreased levels of plasma cholinesterase

Prolonged succinylcholine effect

The parturient should be counseled on the benefits and risks of various anesthetic techniques in conjunction with the surgical procedures. Informed consent should be obtained. Regional anesthesia is usually considered superior to general anesthesia in parturients because of reduced need for airway management, lower incidence of aspiration, improved pain control, and greater overall maternal safety.

Regardless of the anesthetic plan, the parturient is kept nil per oral for the procedure. They receive Metoclopramide and Sodium citrate for aspiration prophylaxis. Some sedation with midazolam and fentanyl may be helpful to relieve maternal anxiety and to facilitate epidural placement. Left lateral uterine displacement is employed to decrease the risk of supine hypotension syndrome from aortocaval compression. Maintenance of maternal blood pressure is important to maintain placental blood flow and fetal perfusion. Fluids and vasopressors can be used. However, fluids should be cautiously used because of the risk of pulmonary edema from absorption of a larger amount on the irrigation fluid from the surgical site and some procedures from amnioinfusion.

**2. Maintenance of Placental Blood Flow**

The placental blood flow is dependent on maternal blood pressure, as placental vessels cannot autoregulate flow. So, the most important factor for adequate fetal perfusion is to maintain maternal blood pressure. Left uterine displacement, preloading/co-loading, vasopressors help to restore maternal blood pressure. Maternal hypercarbia may cause fetal acidosis, and hypocarbia may result in uteroplacental vasoconstriction, so end-tidal CO2 of 30-35 is targeted, and maternal overventilation is avoided. The conditions such as retroplacental hemorrhage or clot, placental separation, and compression or kinking of the umbilical cord can limit the placental blood flow. Close monitoring of uterine tone is essential as it can lead to early detection of the conditions so that and appropriate intervention can be instituted timely.

**3. Uterine Relaxation**

Tocolysis is the cornerstone of fetal surgery. Surgical manipulations or uterine incisions may initiate uterine contractions. These contractions can compress the umbilical vessels, compromise the placental blood flow, and even lead to placental abruption from the endometrium, leading to complete disruption of fetal blood flow, necessitating emergent fetal delivery. They may also result in premature labor. So, it is an integral component of fetal surgery. It is often needed for a prolonged period, usually for days, as in midgestational fetal surgeries. However, for EXIT procedures, short-acting tocolytics are preferred as adequate uterine contraction is desired immediately after profound relaxation to minimize the bleeding from the hysterotomy site. The choice and dose of tocolytic agents should be discussed with the feto-maternal team and obstetrician. Commonly used tocolytic agents are described below.

- Volatile anesthetic agent: Most of the volatile anesthetics depress the amplitude and frequency of the uterine contraction in a dose-dependent manner (Desflurane> sevoflurane> halothane> isoflurane).

- Nitroglycerine: A rapidly acting tocolytic agent that is rapidly metabolized by the placenta and has minimal fetal hemodynamic changes.

- Terbutaline, Nifedipine, magnesium sulfate, indomethacin, and atosiban are other tocolytic agents used in practice. They are often used in midgestational procedures as an adjunct to volatile anesthetics or nitroglycerine infusion to maintain long-term uterine relaxation. Indomethacin, a prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, decreases the decidual inflammation, which is more pronounced before 30 weeks of pregnancy. However, when it is used after 32 weeks of gestation, it is associated with decreased fetal renal blood flow, oligohydramnios, and premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.

**4. Fetal Anesthesia**

Fetuses have fully developed neuroanatomical structures needed for pain perception by midgestation. They also show humoral response, behavioral response, and hemodynamic response to noxious stimuli comparable to older infants and adults after 26 weeks of gestational age.

However, depending upon the type of surgery and age of the fetus, it can also be given directly to the fetus via intravascular or intramuscular injection or indirectly from the intraamniotic infusion.

Anesthetic doses of commonly used drugs such as volatile anesthetics, induction agents, benzodiazepines, and muscle relaxants, have not been associated with teratogenicity.
