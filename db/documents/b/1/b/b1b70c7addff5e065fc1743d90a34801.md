MDMA is absorbed via the GI tract with an onset of effect between 20 minutes and 1 hour after consumption. Peak concentrations occur 2 hours after oral ingestion, and it is broken down in the liver by the enzyme CYP2D6. MDMA has a half-life of about 8 hours, taking approximately 40 hours to clear 95% of the drug from the body. Thus, continued effects of the drug will continue to linger for several hours after ingestion.
