In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ritonavir in 1996 to treat HIV. After saquinavir, it was the second approved protease inhibitor in the United States. Although ritonavir was initially designed to inhibit HIV protease, studies have found that it also inhibits cytochrome P450-3A4 (CYP450-3A4), which is its chief mechanism of action. It is currently used to augment HIV treatment by increasing the bioavailability of co-administered anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs. Combined with triple therapy, initial results for ritonavir showed increased CD4+ count and decreased HIV RNA levels in treatment naïve patients.

In combination with other standard ARV medications, lopinavir/ritonavir has provided significant virological suppression and better immune outcomes in both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients.

In combination with nirmatrelvir, ritonavir has received emergency use authorization as an investigational drug combination to treat COVID-19 in patients with mild-to-moderate severity. It is limited to the use in adults and children aged 12 years and older (weighing 88 pounds or more) with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing and at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. Some evidence exists for using ritonavir in combination with lopinavir to treat COVID-19 infection, but large clinical trials are needed to achieve more reliable results.
