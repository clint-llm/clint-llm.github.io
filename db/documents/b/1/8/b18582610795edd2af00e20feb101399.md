The Monroe-Kellie doctrine states that the contents of the cranial cavity have fixed volumes. There is approximately 1400 mL of brain tissue, 150 mL of CSF, and 150 mL of blood within the cerebral vasculature.

A particularly important example for tonsillar herniation is a cerebellar hemorrhage, which can cause rapid herniation of the cerebellar tonsils down through the foramen magnum where it compresses the medulla. In 1901, Cushing published his paper "Concerning a definite regulatory mechanism of the vasomotor center, which controls blood pressure during cerebral compression", describing the physiological changes that occur during compression of the medulla. This later became known as Cushing's reflex, which gives rise to Cushing's triad of elevated blood pressure, bradycardia, and irregular breathing.

Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is equal to the mean arterial pressure (MAP) of the carotid arteries minus the ICP [CPP = MAP - ICP].

Regardless of which mechanism explains the bradycardia, this is considered a terminal stage as blood pressure continues to rise to perfuse the brainstem as it is compressed against the clivus/odontoid process by the cerebellar tonsils. As further damage occurs to the brainstem, the heart rate may become tachycardic, and breathing slows with apneic episodes.
