Complications of nabothian cysts include hematometra, labor passage obstruction, rectal compression, abnormal uterine bleeding, specifically in case of giant cysts, and chronic urinary retention by restricting the bladder's outlet or by compressing the pudendal and sacral nerves, thus, disturbing the nerve supply to the detrusor muscle.

Furthermore, during whole-body scanÂ studies using the uptake of iodine -131, nabothian cysts were found to be a very common cause of false-positive iodine uptake in the uterine cervix. In such cases, MRI can be used to identify the nabothian cysts.
