Currently, no antidote has been identified in the event of an overdose. Patients suspected of or experiencing an overdose should be managed supportively. The highest maximum dosage administered during clinical trials was 12 mg intravenously. The safety and efficacy of pegloticase in individuals under the age of 18 have not been reported.

Pegloticase use in pregnancy has not been adequately evaluated in reproductive studies in humans or animals and is not distinguished if fetal harm may occur. Pegloticase is labeled as Pregnancy Category C. It is also not fully understood if pegloticase is excreted in the human milk of nursing mothers; therefore not recommended in women who are breastfeeding.
