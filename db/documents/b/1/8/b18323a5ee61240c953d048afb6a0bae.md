The oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe affects multiple organ systems. The visual and neuromuscular complications in this patient population significantly impact the patient's quality of life. Congenital cataracts may lead to amblyopia, but treatment with cataract surgery can also lead to secondary aphakic glaucoma, which can be severe and difficult to control.

Patients are at risk for seizure disorders and febrile convulsions. Hypotonia may result in dysphagia, leading to respiratory infections and complications. Mineral loss secondary to renal disease can result in complications such as failure to thrive and hypophosphatemic rickets. Impaired hemostasis may lead to intra-operative complications in patients requiring surgery.
