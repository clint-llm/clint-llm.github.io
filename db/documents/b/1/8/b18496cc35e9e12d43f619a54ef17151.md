The differential diagnosis for xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis includes:

- Clear cell renal cell carcinoma

- Papillary renal cell carcinoma

- Sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma

- Renal parenchymal malakoplakia

- Renal tuberculosis

- Renal abscess

- Megalocytic interstitial nephritis

- Angiomyolipoma of the kidney

The clinical presentation and radiographic appearance of XPG and renal cell carcinoma are similar. However, fever and raised inflammatory markers (CRP and ESR) are most commonly associated with XPG. If present, the "bear paw" sign****is aÂ pathognomonic feature of XPG. However, histology gives the confirmatory diagnosis for XGP.
