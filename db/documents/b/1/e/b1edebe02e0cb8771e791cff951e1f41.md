Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease caused by five protozoa: Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale, and most recently implicated P.knowlesi. Infection with P. falciparum is being accounted for more than 90% of the worldâ€™s malaria mortality and therefore remains an important threat to public health on a global scale.
