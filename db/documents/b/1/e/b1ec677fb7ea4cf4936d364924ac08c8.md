Various types of topical and systemic medications, phototherapy, laser therapy, and surgical therapy are used for the treatment of vitiligo. Topical treatment, modalities include corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and vitamin-D analogs. Phototherapy is an effective treatment option. It induces repigmentation in most of the patients with early and localizes the disease. Narrowband UV-B is widely used, mostly two to three times in a week with 311-312nm wavelength. It has largely replaced the psoralen photochemotherapy because of its toxic side effects. Excimer Laser is used to treating limited, stable patches of vitiligo. In segmental vitiligo which is resistant to most of the treatments, Tacrolimus and systemic corticosteroids can be combined with it.

Surgical treatment options are limited to segmental or localize vitiligo that is limited to a small area. Five basic methods of repigmentation include non cultured epidermal suspensions, thin dermo-epidermal grafts, suction epidermal graft, punch grafting, and cultured epidermis with melanocytes.

- Segmental vitiligo

- Localize vitiligo involving small area

- Vitiligo in areas which usually not re-pigment well (hairline, dorsal fingers, forehead, ankles)

- The lesion must be stable.
