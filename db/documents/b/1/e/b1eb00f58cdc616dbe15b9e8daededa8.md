Treatment goals in buckle fractures are for patient comfort and parental reassurance. These are inherently stable injuries and almost never require any further intervention.

Following an adequate history and physical examination, if the relevant X-rays show an isolated injury, then the treatment is with removable wrist splints, a pre-fabricated removable cast, or a soft cast that can be removed once at home by the parents once the treatment has finished. This splinting/casting is usually only necessary for two to three weeks because these fractures are considered stable.

Evidence from RCTs have shown removable splints to be the best treatment, which offers easier use for daily activities, better physical function, and are generally preferred by patient and parent in comparison to below elbow casting.

Ideally, the treatment mentioned above is offered in the emergency department, and the patient is discharged, but in many cases, they are often referred onwards to fracture clinics for follow-up.
