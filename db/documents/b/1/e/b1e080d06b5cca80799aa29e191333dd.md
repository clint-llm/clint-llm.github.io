The palatoglossus muscle along with the palatopharyngeus muscle functions to elevate the velar region and this in conjunction with the function of the levator veli palatini muscle provides velar positioning.

**Role in obstructive sleep apnoea:**Studies have shown that if the nerve to the palatoglossus muscle is electrically stimulated, retropalatal space can be dilated which in turn aids in reducing the burden of obstructive sleep apnoea. The mechanism behind this function is that when the nerve is stimulated, it causes forward movement of the tongue base which may result in the advancement of the palate by anteriorly displacing the anterior palatal pillar. Simultaneously, the palatoglossus muscle also moves the soft palate in the anterior direction and help in increasing the retropalatal space**.**

**Role in tonsillar cancer:**Tonsillar cancer, which in the majority of cases has its origin from the anterior tonsillar pillar, has a tendency to spread locally anteroinferior to the tongue, superomedial to the soft palate, or nasopharynx region. Through the anterior tonsillar pillar and the palatoglossus muscle, the tumor can involve the palatal region (hard and soft palate)Â or the base of the tongue. If the tumor involves the palate, it may affect the tensor palatine, levator palatine, and the pterygoid musculature.

**Role in tongue base cancer:**Tumor of the base of the tongue, particularly involving the posterior third, may spread along the palatoglossal muscle and involve the anterior tonsillar pillar.

**Role in cleft lip and palate:**In cleft patients, to close the cleft involving the soft palate, both continuity and function of the soft palate require attaining an adequate length of the soft palate; this requires the reconstitution of the levator veli palatini, the palatopharyngeus, and the palatoglossus muscles.
