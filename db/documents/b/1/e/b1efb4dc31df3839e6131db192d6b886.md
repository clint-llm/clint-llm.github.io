The palatoglossus muscle functions to elevate the posterior portion of the tongue. It also draws the soft palateÂ inferiorly, thereby narrowing the diameter of the oropharyngeal isthmus. This action plays a significant role during swallowing by propelling the food bolus towards the esophagus and occluding the oral cavity, thereby preventing retrograde flow of the food.

It has also been shown to be active in some individuals during speech.
