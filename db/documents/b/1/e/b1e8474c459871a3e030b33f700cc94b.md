Papillary thyroid carcinoma usually presents as an asymptomatic (painless) thyroid mass with or without enlargement of regional (cervical) lymph nodes. Hoarseness and dysphagia occur in approximately 20% of cases, signaling recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement with vocal cord paralysis or tracheal compression. Nodal metastases in the lateral neck are reported in 27% of patients at presentation, most often originating from tumors in the ipsilateral thyroid lobe.

The examination reveals a painless hard lesion that is usually less than 5 cm. The mass is often fixed and has irregular borders.
