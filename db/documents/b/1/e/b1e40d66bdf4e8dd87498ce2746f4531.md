Initial treatment of suspected acute anabolic steroid toxicity starts with discontinuing the offending agent followed by largely supportive measures while awaiting the results of the diagnostic workup.

The provider should tailor further treatment to the underlying pathology caused by theÂ anabolic steroid use as signs of toxicity may manifest in multiple organ systems.

Multivitamins consisting mostly of vitamin B1, B6, B12, nicotinamide, and linoleic acid have been shown to protect hepatocytes from AAS-induced toxicity.
