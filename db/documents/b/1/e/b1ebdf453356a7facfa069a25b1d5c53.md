Anticoagulation is the treatment of choice for patients with internal jugular vein thrombosis.

In patients with asymptomaticÂ IJV thrombosis, anticoagulation is the recommendation, as a delay in therapy increases the risk of potentially life-threatening embolization. Anticoagulants include subcutaneous low molecular weight (LMW) heparin, subcutaneous fondaparinux, the oral factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban or apixaban), or unfractionated heparin (UFH) (Level III). Anticoagulation management requires individualized customization along with clinician experience. Thus, a pharmacist should be heavily involved with agent selection with the prescriber, interaction checking, monitoring, and patient counseling.

The duration of anticoagulation ranges from 4 to 12 weeks. It is standard to obtain an imaging study before discontinuing anticoagulation.

The pharmacist should assist with medication selection, dosing, and management. The specialty-trained nurse should assist with patient education, coordinating follow up, and patient education. an interprofessional team approach will result in the best outcomes. [Leve 5]
