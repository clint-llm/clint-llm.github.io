When aggressive radiation and chemotherapy treatments are utilized, seminomas are curable no matter the size. The recommended initial treatment had transitioned from only radiation to cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy. The prognosis of patients who undergo surgical treatment for mediastinal seminoma is poor. Almost half of the tumors recur post-op and less than 50% of patients live pastÂ five years with complete tumor resection and greater than 40% show recurrence when undergoing complete resection. Over the years, newer treatment regimens have increased remission rates to over 80% as well as increased the 5-year survival rate. Recent studies have shown survival rates > 90% when cisplatin-based chemotherapy is started early.
