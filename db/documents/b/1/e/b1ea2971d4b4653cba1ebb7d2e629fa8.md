Mesotheliomas represent a proliferative neoplasm made up of epithelial and mesenchymal cells of the mesothelium, which make up part of the serosal covering and lining of various organ surfaces within the body. Mesotheliomas can broadly divide into benign and malignant types. This article will focus on the benign form. Although they are referred to as "benign," after removal, these lesions have demonstrated a high propensity for local recurrence, and in some rare cases, there are suspicions that they may undergo malignant transformation.
