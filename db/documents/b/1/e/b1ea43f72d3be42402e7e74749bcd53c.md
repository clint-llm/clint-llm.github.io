Characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the retinal layers or the subretinal space, it is the leading cause of visual impairment in cases with uveitis. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of uveitic macular edema and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of uveitic macular edema.
- Explain the common physical findings associated with uveitic macular edema.
- Outline the typical imaging findings associated with uveitic macular edema.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by uveitic macular edema.
