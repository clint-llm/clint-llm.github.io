Due to its low therapeutic index and high toxicity, the administration of bleomycin should only be performed in dedicated treatment centers under expert supervision with an interprofessional team. Improper management of patients at high risk for adverse effects, including those with pulmonary and renal dysfunction, can lead to avoidable instances of drug-related harm and death. For these reasons, regular interprofessional communication involving online charting tools, verbal confirmation of prescribed dosages and infusion rates, and regular patient monitoring must take place. Clinicians, pharmacists, and nursing staff should be knowledgeable regarding individual patient histories and risk factors; whenever possible, these interprofessional team members should have specialty oncology training. Notably, patients with previous bleomycin treatment are predisposed to developing rapid pulmonary deterioration due to the sensitization of pulmonary tissue to oxygen. As with other chemotherapy agents, close monitoring of patients' symptoms during treatment with bleomycin is necessary. Monitoring measures include pulmonary function tests, regular lab value assessment, and periodic chest radiographs.
