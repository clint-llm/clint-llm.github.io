The nasal placodes, oval thickenings of surface ectoderm, develop inferior and lateral to the frontonasal prominence at the end of the fourth week of the embryonic period. They contain mesenchyme near the outer edges that begin to proliferate to form the medial and lateral nasal prominences (MNP, LNP). As a result, the nasal placodes reside in deep nasal pits, which are the primitive anterior nares and nasal cavities. The LNP form the alae of the nose. The MNP forms the nasal septum, ethmoid bone, and cribriform plate.

As the maxillary prominences proliferate the cause the nasal structures to move medially and by the end of the sixth week, the maxillary prominences begin to merge with the LNP at the nasolacrimal groove.Â During the sixth to eighth weeks, the nasal cavity and the oral cavity begin to communicate through the choanae. As this is occurring, the lateral wall of the nasal cavity begins forming five ethmoturbinals. The ethmoturbinals eventually form the turbinates and other structures found within each meatus of the nasal cavity.

- One: agger nasi cells and uncinate process

- Two: ethmoid bulla

- Three: basal lamella of the middle turbinate

- Four: superior turbinate

- Five: supreme turbinate (a normal variant that undergoes

The olfactory epithelium is developing from the ectoderm in the roof of the nasal cavity while the conchae are forming.
