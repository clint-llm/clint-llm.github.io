- Using a compression garment is essential because the mobility of the grafted fat may cause volume loss.

- The patient should avoid massaging the grafted area in the early post-treatment phase, as doing so can shift the grafted fat.

- Applying a warm compress may improve blood flow to the grafted fat but will likely worsen edema. A cool compress may decrease swelling, but cold compresses should be avoided because of the risk of graft compromise.

- As part of the preprocedural counseling process, risks and warning signs of complications such as blindness, fat embolism, infection, and keloid formation should be discussed with the patient to facilitate early identification and intervention.
