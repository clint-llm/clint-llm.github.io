Although the majority of cases of ulnar collateral ligament injury do not require surgery, referral to an orthopedic or hand surgery specialist is prudent for long-term care planning and therapy referral. In the acute setting, such as the emergency department, the provider's goals for therapy should include acute pain relief and immobilization (thumb spica splint). Splint placement can be performed by providers, nurses, or techs.  Splint care and patient education can be provided by the orthopedical specialty nursing staff. Further therapy that can be performed at home by the patient includes ice therapy, rest, and elevation. Complete ulnar collateral ligament tears usually mandate surgical intervention. Complications of an untreated complete tear include the Stener lesion and development of chronic arthritis. Judicious use of pain medication can be considered. Collaborating with specialists and working in the acute setting with an interprofessinoal team approach will help ensure the best outcome for these patients.
