The diagnosis and management of scrub typhus are complex, and this is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an infectious disease expert, emergency department clinicians,Â primary clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists. When lab testing is available, skilled laboratory technicians are also an important part of this team. Patients with severe illness will require an intensive. The care is supportive including IV fluids, acetaminophen for fever, and antibiotics including doxycycline or azithromycin. A confirmed diagnosis is established by antigen detection, polymerase chain reaction, or serologic testing. No laboratory tests can predict the progression to severe disease. The prognosis for untreated scrub typhus is abysmal, but with proper care, most patients can survive, albeit sometimes with residual multisystem organ damage.
