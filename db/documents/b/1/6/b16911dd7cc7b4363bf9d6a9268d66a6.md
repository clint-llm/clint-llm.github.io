Simulation has been used by humans to assist with teaching and learning since the beginning of time. People learn from past experiences and refine lessons learned to improve their future. More recently, simulation-based training and education have been used extensively in several high-risk fields, such as aviation, the military, and health care.

A simulation technician is an individual who specializes in both the technologies and methods used in the planning, preparation, and execution of simulation-based healthcare training and education events. These individuals are essential members of every simulation team. Simulation technicians may also be called simulation operations specialists, simulation technology specialists, among other similar titles. Like the title, the roles and responsibilities of the simulation technician vary depending on the type of program they support - nursing, medical, allied health, in-situ - as well as the type simulation center they support. While there is variance, there are core roles and responsibilities that each simulation technician will hold.
