The cause of central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia is not clear. There are various theories about the etiology of CCCA. One hypothesis suggests that there is a strong association between CCCA and different hair care products used by black women, like chemical relaxers, hot combs, and various traction inducing hairstyles.

Current evidence does not support these various theories. The etiology of central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia is multifactorial. Various other suggested causes include infections, autoimmune disease, or genetic factors. It could be idiopathic, but still, more studies needed to clarify this concept.
