The xiphoid process is considered a variable bone, and most commonly, it varies in shape. It has been reported in the literature that the xiphoid process can take different shapes, from thin to broad. Its pointed distal end may also be curved or bifid. Some case studies have reported xiphoid foramina or a non-ossified xiphoid, which are considered unusual variations. In-depth knowledge and awareness of these variations are essential as they may lead to misdiagnosis, primarily due to their proximal anatomical relationship to vital structures in the thoracic and abdominal regions.
