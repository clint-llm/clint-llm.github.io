Since the tetanus toxoid is generally safe and rarely leads to any severe issues, monitoring is not necessary. However, if a patient wanted to know their immunity status against tetanus, this could be accomplished by using multi-analyte fluorescent detection. It can detect the antibody titer level in their blood, confirming whether or not there is full immunity. A level of higher than 0.01 IU/ml rates as a protective concentration of tetanus antibodies.

There is the possibility of an Arthus reaction (type III hypersensitivity) occurring after administering vaccines containing tetanus toxoids. Possible symptoms include, but are not limited to, severe pain, swelling, induration, edema, hemorrhage, and occasionally necrosis. However, it bears mention that this is extremely rare and usually self-limited.  Furthermore, a history of an Arthus reaction is not a contraindication to the tetanus toxoid.
