Managing patients who may independently choose to use cannabinoids to treat glaucoma requires an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals that may include a nurse, pharmacist, and several physicians in different specialties to improve outcomes and reduce morbidity. A patient may report their use of cannabinoids to the ophthalmic nurse or technician, and the ophthalmologist must educate the patient about the lack of clear evidence demonstrating these agents' usefulness in the treatment of glaucoma as the importance to not stop using proven glaucoma therapies.

The care of such a patient does not stop at this discussion. Because of cannabinoids' potentially addictive nature, secondary systemic and psychotropic side effects, very short duration of action, management of chronic cannabinoid use in a patient, especially in the presence of comorbidities or mobility impairments, will also require the collaboration of the patient's primary care doctor, behavior and mental health professionals, and home health aides.
