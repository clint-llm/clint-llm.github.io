The differential diagnosis includes:

- Infectious mononucleosis

- Cytomegalovirus infection

- Viral hepatitis

- Herpes simplex virus infection

- meningitis

- Rubella

- Viral pneumonia

- Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome)

In children with classic roseola infantum, HHV-6 is the etiologic pathogen. However, several other diseases can cause fever and rash. More severe, less benign, causes of such symptoms requires exclusion. In immunocompetent adults, infection with HHV-6 manifests similarly to mononucleosis. Thus EBV and CMV should be excluded. Immunocompromised patients, especially those receiving organ transplants and those with AIDS are generally symptomatic. This cohort of individuals with HHV-6 disease are often concomitantly infected with CMV, and antiviral treatment should commence promptly. HHV-6 correlates with several other diseases including hepatitis, herpes simplex, meningitis, rubella, viral pneumonia, and DRESS syndrome.
