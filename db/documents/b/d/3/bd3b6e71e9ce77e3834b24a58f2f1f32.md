Prior to invasive urodynamic testing, patients should receive clear and concise written information to enable understanding and cooperation. It should be made clear to patients before testing that urodynamics is a diagnostic procedure, that there is a possibility of failure to progress diagnosis, and that it is not a therapeutic procedure.

Urodynamics are generally well tolerated by patients. Embarrassment can be a significant cause of apprehension. Efforts should, therefore, focus on creating a relaxed atmosphere through informed and effective communication.

The only absolute contraindication for urodynamics is the presence of a urinary tract infection. In such cases, urodynamics should be postponed until this is treated.

Relative contraindications for urodynamics include patient inability to comply with instructions or communicate sensations,Â inability to catheterize bladder, medications for bladder dysfunction (which can be stopped 48 hours before testing), indwelling catheter, and autonomic dysreflexia.

Autonomic dysreflexia (AD) is a potentially life-threatening condition that arises in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI), particularly in those with an injury above the level of T6.

Patients most commonly describing headache, discomfort, nausea, anxiety, blurred vision, and pain.
