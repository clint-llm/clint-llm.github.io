Following an explanation of the procedure and obtaining informed consent, the patient is placed in a lateral or seated position. A seated position will exacerbate symptoms, and some patients will not tolerate this for more than a few minutes, if at all. The back injection site, either from a previous dural puncture or a vertebral interspace one above or below, is sterilely prepped and draped as well as the extremity from which blood is to be drawn.
