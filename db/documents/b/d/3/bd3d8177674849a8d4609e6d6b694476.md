Data from postmortem examinations of cardiopulmonary arrest and sudden cardiac death (SCD) victims correlate with the clinical observations on the prevalence of coronary artery disease as the major structural etiologic factor. Higher than 80% of victims have pathologic findings of coronary artery disease. The pathologic description often involves a combination of extensive atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries along with unstable coronary artery lesions, which include various permutations of fissured, eroded, or ruptured plaques; and/or thrombosis. As many as seventy percent of men who die suddenly have preexisting healed myocardial infarctions, whereas only twenty percent have recent acute MIs, in spite of the prevalence of thrombi and unstable plaques.
