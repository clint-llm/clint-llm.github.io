- Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis (SLK) is characterized by a hypersensitivity reaction to thiomersal or preservatives found in contact lens solutions and is often associated with thyroid eye disease. This condition typically manifests bilaterally but can exhibit asymmetry. Similar to lid wiper epitheliopathy (LWE), patients commonly experience pain, foreign body sensation, and intolerance to contact lens wear.
            Upon slit lamp examination, hypertrophy and inflammation of the superior bulbar conjunctiva are frequently observed, and these areas can be highlighted by lissamine green or rose bengal staining. Additionally, anterior segment findings may include punctate epithelial erosions and papillary hypertrophy of the superior tarsal conjunctiva.

- Ocular foreign bodies on the cornea or conjunctiva are frequently encountered in clinical practice and can lead to significant symptoms. Patients often report pain, discomfort during blinking, bulbar conjunctiva redness, light sensitivity, and tearing. Corneal foreign bodies account for approximately 80% of cases, while tarsal or bulbar conjunctival foreign bodies make up around 13% of incidents.
            Prompt removal of the foreign body is crucial to prevent complications such as microbial keratitis and corneal scarring, potentially resulting in permanent vision loss. Following removal, the affected area should be treated with a combination of topical antibiotics and steroids to minimize the risk of infection and inflammation. Close monitoring of the patient's condition is necessary to ensure proper healing and address potential complications.

- Floppy eyelid syndrome (FES) is a specific eyelid disorder primarily observed inÂ men with a body mass index exceeding 30 kg/m2. It is characterized by the spontaneous eversion or turning inside out of the eyelid during sleep, resulting from excessive eyelid laxity. Symptoms experienced by patients with FES resemble those of lid wiper epitheliopathy (LWE), including the sensation of a foreign object in the eye. On slit lamp examination, findings may include punctate epithelial erosions and chronic papillary conjunctivitis.
            One of the common complaints in individuals with FES is the presence of unilateral or bilateral discharge, which can be aqueous or mucoid. This discharge is often attributed to chronic exposure keratopathy, which occurs when the eyelid involuntarily everts during sleep, leading to prolonged ocular surface exposure.

- Giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC) is a specific form of conjunctivitis characterized by the formation of enlarged papillae on the superior tarsal conjunctiva. This condition typically occurs as a result of both allergic and traumatic responses to the wearing of contact lenses. Patients with GPC commonly present with symptoms such as ocular itching, decreased tolerance to contact lens wear, blurred vision, and excessive mucous production in the eyes. Complications associated with GPC can arise due to infrequent replacement of contact lenses, prolonged wearing of lenses, poor hygiene practices related to lens care, and a history of atopic conditions.
            The development of GPC is believed to result from mechanical trauma to the superior tarsal conjunctiva, coupled with an immunologic response by the conjunctiva to deposits on the anterior surface of the contact lens. These factors can trigger an inflammatory reaction leading to the formation of giant papillae. It is essential to recognize the association between GPC and contact lens wear and the potential underlying allergic and immunologic mechanisms involved.
