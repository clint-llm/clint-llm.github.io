Two clinically useful classification systems of osteogenesis imperfecta have been described by Sillence et al. and Shapiro et al.

Osteogenesis imperfecta classification based on phenotypic characteristics and mode of inheritance modified from Sillence et al.:

- Type I: Autosomal dominant (COL1A1 gene does not produce viable mRNA for procollagen); collagen amount is 50% reduced; however, the molecule is structurally normal. General manifestation shows generalized osteoporosis, abnormal bone fragility (fractures typically during the ambulatory years of child development and reduced bone maturity), blue sclera, conductive deafness, and mild stunting. IA (Normal Teeth), IB/IC (dentinogenesis imperfecta).

- Type II: Originally classified as autosomal recessive; however, recent work indicates that it follows a dominant negative inheritance (7% risk of disease in subsequent pregnancies), often due to spontaneous mutation. This form results in severe disruption in the qualitative function of the collagen molecule: lethal perinatal form. General manifestation demonstrates extreme bone fragility (accordion femur), delayed skull ossification, blue sclera, and perinatal death. Type IIA  has short and wide long bones with fractures and wide ribs with sparse fractures. II-B manifests with short and widened long bones with fractures and ribs with sparse fractures. II-C presents with thin long bones with fractures and thin ribs.

- Type III: Autosomal recessive or dominant negative inheritance; type I collagen alteration is both qualitative and quantitative. Most children with severe clinical manifestations belong to this category. General manifestation presents with blue sclera in infancy and returns to normal hue in adolescence. Moderate to severe bone fragility, coxa vara, multiple fractures, and marked long bone deformities (more severe than type I with greater ambulation difficulties). These patients require intramedullary nailing prophylactically. Other specific features: Early onset scoliosis, triangular facies, frontal bossing, basilar invagination, and extremely short stature.

- Type IV: Heterogenous group; autosomal dominant that also has qualitative and quantitative changes in type I collagen—more severe clinical manifestations than type I OI. General manifestation shows normal sclera, moderate to severe bone fragility and deformity of the long bones and spinal column, and moderate to severe growth stunting. Type IV A presents with normal teeth, while Type IV B shows dentinogenesis imperfect.

- Type V: Autosomal dominant; mutation in the gene encoding interferon-induced transmembrane protein-5 (IFITM5); histologically demonstrates a mesh-like appearance of the lamellar bone. It presents with mild to moderate degrees of severity. Specific features include normal sclera, the absence of dental involvement, calcification of interosseous membrane, especially the forearm that can lead to secondary dislocation of the radius, hypertrophic callus, and a radiodense band near long bone physis are specific characteristics of this type.

- Type VI: Mutation involving SERPINF1 gene; characteristic histological presentation includes lamellar bone with fish scale pattern under a polarized light microscope and severe mineralization defects. This type presents with moderate to severe skeletal manifestations, normal sclera, and an absence of dental involvement.

**Types VII, VIII, and IX**

**Common Features**

- A defect in the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (which helps in the assembly of the triple helix)

- Autosomal recessive

Specific defects include cartilage-associated protein defects (CRTAP) - type VII, prolyl 3-hydroxylase (LEPRE1) - type VIII, and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase B (PPIB) - type IX.

**General Manifestation**

- Type VII: Moderate to severe. Associated with rhizomelia and coxa vara.

- Type VIII: Severe to lethal. It is associated with rhizomelia.

- Type IX: Similar to types VII and VII; however, no rhizomelia.

**Types X and XI**

**Common Features**

- A defect in collagen chaperones that accompany procollagen molecules from ER to Golgi apparatus

- 2.Autosomal recessive

Specific defects: SERPINH1 - type X, FKBP10 - type XI.

**General Manifestation**

- Type X: Severe bone dysplasia, dentinogenesis imperfecta, transient skin bullae, blue sclera, pyloric stenosis, and renal stones.

- Type XI: Bone dysplasia, ligamentous laxity, scoliosis, and platyspondyly. Normal sclera and absence of dental involvement.

The pitfall of Sillence Classification: Significant variability in the severity of deformities and fractures within different classification categories. Less prognostic relevance.

Looser et al. (1906):

Classified OI into two types - OI congenita (presence of numerous fractures at birth); and OI tarda (fractures occur after the perinatal period).

Shapiro's modification of Looser classification (4 types): Excellent practical application regarding prognostication for survival and ambulation.

- Congenita A (Incompatible with life) - Sustain fractures in utero or at birth; Radiographically, present with crumpled long bones, crumpled ribs, rib cage deformity, and fragile skull.

- Congenita B (Compatible with survival) - Sustain fractures in utero or at birth; Radiographically, present with more tubular long bones with funnelization in the metaphysis, normally formed ribs, and no rib cage deformity.

Tarda A - Fractures before walking; Age of onset of fractures - not prognostic for ambulation.

Tarda B - First fracture after walking age; All patients usually ambulate.
