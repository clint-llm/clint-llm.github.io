Familial hypercholesterolemia is a disorder that results from absent or defective low-density lipid-protein (LDL) receptors. The LDLR gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 19, and the LDLR is comprised of 860 amino acids. The LDLR is primarily responsible for hepatic uptake of LDL, which constitutes about 70% of circulating LDL. Two ligands, apolipoprotein B-100, and apo-E bind to the receptor.

The normal number and function of LDL receptors in the liver are important for the uptake of LDL cholesterol. Receptor-negative FH patients have less than 2%, and receptor-defective patients have about 2% to 25% of normal LDLR activity.

There are five different classes of alleles based on the phenotypic behavior of mutant protein that results from mutations at the LDLR locus. These are as follows:

- **Class I:**Null, synthesis of LDLR is defective

- **Class II:**Transport defective, intracellular transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi apparatus is impaired.

- **Class III:**Binding defective, binding of LDL protein to the receptor is defective.

- **Class IV:**Internalization defective, proteins can bind normally, but receptors do not internalize LDL proteins do too ineffective clustering in the coated pits

- **Class V:**Defective recycling, dissociation of the receptor and like and is interrupted, thereby interrupting recycling of the receptor.

Reduced or absent uptake of LDL cholesterol by the liver leads to very high LDL cholesterol levels from birth with resultant premature atherosclerosis, critical aortic stenosis, and coronary artery disease (CAD).

Homozygous FH patients often have untreated LDL-C levels above 500 mg/dL, but lower levels do not rule out HoFH. HoFH causes severe CAD by the first and second decade of life. Heterozygotes are also at increased risk of CAD between 30 to 60 years of age. Stroke is uncommon. Xanthomas, which are yellowish patches of cholesterol build-up due to extremely high levels of LDL-C, can occur around eyelids (xanthelasma), within tendons of the elbows, hands, knees, and feet. A thickened Achilles tendon should raise a high level of suspicion for HoFH. The prevalence of xanthomas increases with age. Another diagnostic sign on the physical exam is corneal arcus which is a white, gray, or blue opaque ring around the corneal margin when seen in individuals younger than 45 years of age.
