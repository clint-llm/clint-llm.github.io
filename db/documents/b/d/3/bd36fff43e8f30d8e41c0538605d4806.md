Chronic interstitial nephritis in agricultural communities is a new form of chronic kidney disease. Its etiology is not linked to diabetes, hypertension, glomerulopathies, or other known causes of renal diseases. It had reached epidemic proportions in Central America, Sri Lanka, and other tropical countries. It was reported mainly in young men, occasionally women, and adolescents. The causes are potentially preventable and must be promptly diagnosed and treated to avoid the high morbidity associated with this condition. This activity examines the etiology and diagnosis of this condition and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with chronic interstitial nephritis in agricultural communities to ensure the best patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Review the epidemiological characteristics of chronic interstitial nephritis in agricultural communities.
- Describe the etiology of chronic interstitial nephritis in agricultural communities.
- Outline the histopathological findings in patients with chronic interstitial nephritis in agricultural communities.
- Explain how the interprofessional team can manage chronic interstitial nephritis in agricultural communities to ensure the best patient outcomes.
