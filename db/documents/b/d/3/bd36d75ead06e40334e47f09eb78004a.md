Tumor suppressor genes are integral for normal tissue growth control. These genes encode proteins that function to limit proliferation. However, if the tumor suppressor genes are inactivated by a point mutation, deletion or loss of expression, there is no longer any restraint on tissue growth. Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 are thought to act as tumor suppressor genes. Over the decades, it has been shown that mutations in the BRCA genes can lead to the development of breast, ovarian, prostate and colon cancer. In excess of 100 discrete germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 have been identified. Over the lifetime, there is a very high penetrance of germline BRCA mutations.
