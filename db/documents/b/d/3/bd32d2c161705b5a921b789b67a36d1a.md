The deep peroneal nerve is one of 5 nerves that are often blocked or anesthetized to perform foot or ankle surgery. It can be performed as a regional block and is a great alternative to achieve regional anesthesia for surgery in patients at high risk during general anesthesia. It has minimal risks, reduces complications of wound healing when compared to infiltration anesthesia, and provides better postoperative comfort for the patient. This activity describes the technique of a deep peroneal block, its indications, contraindications, and potential complications. This activity reviews the deep peroneal nerve block and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in safely performing this procedure.

- Describe the technique of a deep peroneal block.
- Review the complications of a deep peroneal block.
- Summarize the deep peroneal nerve block and the role of the interprofessional team in safely performing this procedure.
