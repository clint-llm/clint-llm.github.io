According to "Sax's Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials" (by Richard J. Lewis, 2004 - DOI: 10.1002/0471701343), studies in rodents showed an LD50 (a lethal dose in 50% of subjects) between 59 to 163 mg/kg. In humans, dopamine can lead to peripheral vasoconstriction resulting in gangrenous extremities and cardiac arrhythmias.
