At its root, hypercapnia is caused by either increased CO2 production metabolically or Respiratory failure. Metabolic processes that increase CO2 production may include fever, thyrotoxicosis, increased catabolism seen in sepsis or steroid use, overfeeding, metabolic acidosis, and exercise. Respiratory failure in this pathology is a failure to eliminate CO2 from the pulmonary system, which is synonymous with hypoventilation secondary to decreased respiratory rate or decreased tidal volume.
