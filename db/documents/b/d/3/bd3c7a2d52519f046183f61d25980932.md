It is a small irregular shaped structure; its shape varies from pinhead, irregular, oval to rectangular. It is situated approximately 1 cm in front of the medial end of the superior orbital fissure. Here it is embedded in orbital fat and is connected to the nasociliary nerve. It is a collection of multipolar neurons. Three roots of the ciliary ganglion are attached to its posterior border. These roots are motor root, sensory root, and sympathetic root.

The motor root is parasympathetic. Preganglionic parasympathetic fibers arise from the Edinger Westphal nucleus. Then these fibers pass through the nerve to inferior oblique muscle branch of the oculomotor nerve and reach the ciliary ganglion. At the ciliary ganglion, preganglionic fibers synapse with postganglionic fibers. Postganglionic fibers pass through short ciliary nerve and end by supplying sphincter pupillae and ciliaris muscle.

The sensory root derives from the nasociliary nerve. Sensory fibers from eyeball pass through ganglion uninterrupted. It carries general sensations from the cornea, iris, and ciliary body.

The sympathetic root forms from the plexus of post-ganglionic sympathetic fibers from superior cervical sympathetic ganglion around the internal carotid artery, then it enters into orbit through the common tendinous ring of the superior orbital fissure. Post-ganglionic sympathetic fibers from superior cervical sympathetic ganglion pass through ciliary ganglion uninterrupted and distributed via short ciliary nerves. Sympathetic root supplies blood vessels of the eyeball.
