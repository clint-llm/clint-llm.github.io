Sensorineural hearing loss tends to have a typical slow progression and can be managed with conservative measures and hearing aids for the vast majority of patients with regular follow-up appointments and audiograms. If patients are eligible, even profound hearing loss can be rehabilitated with a cochlear implant.

With suddenÂ SNHL, four factors have been shown to help predict the outcome.

- **Time since onset**- the earlier it presents, the better the prognosis

- **Age**- worst prognosis in older patients

- **Vertigo**- poor prognostic indicator

- **Degree of hearing loss**- if profound and with a downward sloping audiogram indicates a poorer prognosis.

Patients who seek early medical attention and engage with their treatment will likely have better outcomes. In SNHL, 32% to 65% of the cases resolve without intervention. The cause is unknown at the presentation in 80-90% of the cases. Even after a thorough investigation, it is possible to identify a cause in only one-third of the patients. It has been shown that improvement within the first two weeks may predict an excellent long-term outcome.
