Labyrinthitis is an inflammation of the membranous labyrinth of the inner ear and typically presents with vertigo, nausea, vomiting, tinnitus, and/or hearing loss. It is normally caused by a bacterial or viral infection; however, it can be a manifestation of systemic autoimmune disease or human immunodeficiency virus in some cases. Although most patients achieve complete recovery, patients may be left with residual balance or hearing problems. Treatment is tailored to the etiology as well as symptom control. Although most patients will achieve complete recovery, patients may be left with residual balance or hearing problems. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of labyrinthitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the different causes of labyrinthitis.
- Explain the common examination findings associated with labyrinthitis.
- Outline the treatment options for the different etiologies of labyrinthitis.
- Summarize the importance of communication and coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the care of patients with labyrinthitis.
