All myotonias can result in worsening or more significant myopathy over time, particularly the periodic paralyses. In addition, dystrophic myotonias can result in significant systemic symptoms, including cataracts, insulin resistance, facial dysmorphisms. Patients can also suffer iatrogenic harm, as most medications used to treat myotonia have significant side effect profiles.
