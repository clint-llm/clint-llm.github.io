Stasis ofÂ the gallbladder results in the buildup of intraluminal pressure, which eventually results in ischemia of the gallbladder wall and inflammation. This stasis can also lead to the colonization of bacteria, which contributes to the inflammatory response. If the pressure is not relieved, the gallbladder wall will become progressively ischemic and eventually result in gangrenous changes and perforation, leading to sepsis and shock. These findings are referred to as acute cholecystitis. Chronic acalculous cholecystitis is less insidious. Symptoms are more prolonged and less severe. The mechanism is the same, but it has not progressed to the findings associated with acute acalculous cholecystitis. Symptoms can also be more intermittent and vague, although often patients can present with signs of acute biliary cholic. Patients with hydrops of the gallbladder usually present with signs of more acute cholecystitis.
