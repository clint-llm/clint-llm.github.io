Isolated anemia and reticulocytopenia in the presence of normal white cell count and platelet count are suggestive of PRCA. A review of the peripheral smear is the first step in the evaluation of PRCA. Further evaluation is pursued to determine the degree of anemia and the etiology of PRCA and rule out other diagnoses.

- Tests for evaluating the degree of anemia:

- Complete blood count with differential (Anemia along with a normal white count, platelet count, and a markedly reduced reticulocyte count strongly support the diagnosis of PRCA)
- Erythropoietin level (A high level supports the diagnosis)
- Type and Cross (for pure red blood cell transfusion)

- Peripheral blood to determine the etiology of PRCA:

- Autoimmune conditions

- Antinuclear antibody
- Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody
- Rheumatoid arthritis antibody


- Viral studies

- Parvovirus B19
- Viral hepatitis A, B, C and E
- Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
- Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)
- Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
- Human T-cell leukemia-lymphoma virus (HTLV-1)


- Flow cytometry (of peripheral blood cells) to rule out malignant clonal cells
- T-cell gene rearrangement
- Plasma cell disorder

- Quantitative immunoglobulins
- Free light chains (Kappa and Lambda)
- Serum electrophoresis and Immunofixation


- Pregnancy test (in case of women)

- Bone marrow should have testing for the following:

- Cytogenetics
- Flow cytometry
- T-cell gene rearrangement

- Tests to determine iron overload
- Ferritin level- increases as the number of transfusions increase
- Iron level
- Total iron-binding capacity
- Hepatic and Renal panel (Useful in monitoring the liver and kidney function and in choosing iron chelator)
- MRI Liver to determine the liver iron concentration

- Diamond Blackfan syndrome is associated with increased activity of erythrocyte adenosine deaminase. Critical challenges exist in performing this test.
- Very few labs perform this test all over the world (In the US, only one lab performs this test)
- The test must be performed only in patients who have not received red cell transfusions. 
- The test must be done only on a fresh blood sample or on a blood sample stored at 4 degrees C only for a few days.
