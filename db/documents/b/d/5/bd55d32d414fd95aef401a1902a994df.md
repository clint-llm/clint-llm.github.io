Carotid Sinus Hypersensitivity (CSH) is a condition that commonly manifests as syncope. There are hypersensitive receptors in the carotid sinus, which cause an exaggerated response when they are stimulated, leading to CSH. The place where the internal and external carotid arteries meet to make the common carotid artery is called the carotid sinus (dilated area in the carotid bifurcation); this is a kind of neurovascular structure, which contains baroreceptors ("baro" is the Greek word for pressure or stretch).

The baroreceptors at the carotid sinus shoot neural signals through the glossopharyngeal nerve to the solitary nucleus in the medulla. Increased pressure or stretch sensed via baroreceptors activates the parasympathetic nervous system, with the net effect of vasodilation, bradycardia, and hypotension. Hypotension further eliminates the inhibitory effect of baroreceptors**.**

However, the objective definition of CSH includes the evolution of 3 seconds or more of cardiac pause "asystole" (cardioinhibitory) or/and a decrease in the systolic blood pressure 50 mmHg "hypotension" or more (vasopressor), if the massage results in hypotension and bradycardia then it is called Mixed (cardioinhibitory and vasopressor), while a carotid sinus massage is made regardless of symptoms occurrence (i.e., might fulfill the criteria but be asymptomatic).

There are three subtypes of CSH: cardioinhibitory, vasodepressor, and a mixed type (cardioinhibitory and vasopressor).
