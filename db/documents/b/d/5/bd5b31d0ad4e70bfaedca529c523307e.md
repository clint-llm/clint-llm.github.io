Over the years, various preventive strategies have been employed to reduce hospital-acquired infections. The major principles of prevention include hand hygiene, contact precautions when indicated, antibiotic stewardship to avoid the rise of MDR organisms, appropriate antimicrobial prophylaxis, particularly for surgeries, patient positioning, subglottic suction to avoid aspiration, strict asepsis when placing a central line, limiting unnecessary use of external devices, removal of catheters as soon as no longer indicated, and decontamination with chlorhexidine bathing for patients in the intensive care unit.
