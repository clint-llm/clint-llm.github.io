Despite appropriate treatment in the ICU, around one-third of patients will die in the first 48 hours after admission. Almost half of the patients admitted with Hantavirus will not require mechanical ventilation via intubation if appropriately managed with judicious fluids and close monitoring.

Should patients improve within the first few days, there is a good probability of extubation within the first week, and often there are no major long-term complications. However, subjective complaints of dyspnea, fatigue, and myalgias may occur.

Higher titers of antibodies neutralizing the viral nucleocapsid immune complexes correlate with aÂ higher likelihood of survival.
