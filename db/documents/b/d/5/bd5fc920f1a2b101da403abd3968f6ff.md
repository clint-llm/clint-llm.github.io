Hypospadias is a common genital defect in males. Early diagnosis and single-step surgery can restore the functional capacity and cosmetic appearance in most cases. This condition is best managed by an interprofessional team consisting of the urologist, neonatologist, pediatric surgeon, reconstructive surgeon, endocrinologist, geneticist, nurse, and mental health counselor. Careful examination of the genitalia should be done at birth and, of course, before planning circumcision.
