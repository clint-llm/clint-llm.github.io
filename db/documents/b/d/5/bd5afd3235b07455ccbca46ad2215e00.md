SPS is often an underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed condition that can lead to permanently impaired physical and mental health if not treated timely. Therefore, health care providers should aim at recognizing and managing the disease as early as possible and under the care of a neurology specialist. Patients with SPS would be best managed by an interprofessional team, including a physical therapist, psychiatrist, and orthopedic surgeon to increase their chance for recovery and preserve their quality of life. In addition, it is crucial to monitor patients who receiveÂ immunotherapy for possible side effects. For patients with a paraneoplastic variant, a thorough search for underlying malignancy should be promptly initiated.
