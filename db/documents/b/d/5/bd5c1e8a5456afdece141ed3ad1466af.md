Due to peliosis hepatis being difficult to diagnose, the differentials are different for both microscopic findings and radiographic findings. Under the microscope, peliosis hepatis can appear similar to other causes of sinusoidal obstruction and volume overload states such as portal vein thrombosis as well as heart failure and nephrotic syndrome.

Radiographically the lesion can appear similar to many other hepatic lesions. Ranging from 1 to 2 millimeters to centimeters in size and occupying any portion of the liver, it is often mistaken for malignant lesions. To further evaluate, a variety of imaging modalities exist and can be of utmost utility. Angiography often demonstrates contrast accumulating within the parenchyma itself or the sinusoids, depending on when the image is captured. Depending on the degree of involvement and severity of the condition, these findings may or may not be present and often need further advanced imaging with either a triple-phase CT, which can reveal alternating regions of low then high foci, or MRI findings of hypo or hyperintensity based of which weighted image is utilized to observe that there is likely a pooling of blood in these regions.
