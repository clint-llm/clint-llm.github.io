This procedure is not without risk, but the ultrasound-indicated and physical examination-indicated cerclages likely incur more risk than history-indicated cerclages. Risks include infection or sepsis, inadvertent rupture of membranes, lacerations at the surgical site, and anesthesia-related complications. Recent reviews suggest that initial dilation greater than 4cm is associated with a poor prognosis.
