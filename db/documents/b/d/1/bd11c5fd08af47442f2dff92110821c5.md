Health care professionalsÂ dealing with patients of the biliary tract cancer must keep in mind that educating the patient and family regarding the physical and medical status of the patient is very necessary. Patient and family should be provided information about the diagnosis, disease progression, prognosis, status of the patient, both preoperatively and postoperatively. Complications of the surgery should be explained as well.

In the event that the tumor is advance enough to be unresectable or the patient is not a candidate for surgery, details must be provided by the health care professionals about the disease, its prognosis, its effects on the mental and physical health of the patient, details of the treatments other than surgery, their complications and how to manage these complications. A comprehensive approach that covers the patient's emotional, social, physical, and mental health should be taken.
