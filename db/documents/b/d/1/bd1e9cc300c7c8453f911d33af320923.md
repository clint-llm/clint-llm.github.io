As with any instance where a toxic poisoning is suspected, it is prudent to touch base with the local poison control center for recommendations and treatment direction. Decisions with regards to disposition, treatment guidance, and further consultation recommendations may be provided. Once the call has been placed, request to discuss your patient's case with the on-call Toxicologist for optimal treatment guidance.

Ideally, once the diagnosis is confirmed or suspected, neurological services should be consulted in tandem, given the similarities to various different neurological diseases and advanced treatment therapies. This will ensure that the proper imaging modalities to confirm and rule out concomitant differential diagnoses are properly obtained.
