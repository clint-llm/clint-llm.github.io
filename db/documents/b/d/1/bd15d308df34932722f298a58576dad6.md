Diagnosis can usually be made based on clinical findings and epidemiological clues. Confirmation of the suspected clinical diagnosis can be made in four ways. Some lab findings can include: a relative left shift, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels, elevated LDH levels, and hyponatremia. Worsening synthetic liver function, thrombocytopenia, and diffuse epidermal purpura are ominous signs of disseminated and severe disease. These laboratory studies are largely non-contributory to the diagnosis of BF, as their prevalence varies significantly in the reported literature, and diagnosis can be made based on clinical evaluation alone, followed by confirmatory testing.

Confirmatory testing is done in four basic ways: serology, polymerase chain reaction, immunologic detection, and isolation of the causative organism. Serologic testing is the mainstay of diagnosis at present. There are several tests available, including Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot immunoassay. They may detect IgM and IgG antibodies 10 to 14 days after symptoms. Thus, the use of these modalities in acute clinical management is limited, especially at the initial onset of symptoms. Serologic testing also has significant cross-reactivity between various subspecies, reducing specificity. Species-specific diagnosis is routinely achieved by PCR followed by culture.
