The choice of specimen used for glucose determination depends on the analytical method to be used. Serum or plasma, free of hemolysis, is the specimen of choice for automated enzymatic methods.

The plasma should be separated from the cells within 60 minutes of collection unless the tube contains a glycolysis inhibitor. Serum samples are appropriate for glucose analysis, provided the serum is not in contact with the cells for longer than 90 minutes.

To preserve blood that cannot be separated rapidly, samples should contain the glycolysis inhibitor sodium fluoride (which inhibits the enolase enzyme) at 2.5 mg fluoride/mL of blood.
