Complications are mainly related to ICD implantation and are uncommon but may include:

- Infection at the implant site that may extend from a mild reaction and seroma up to suppuration and necessitates leadÂ extraction

- Allergic reaction to medications used during the procedure

- Bleeding or bruising where your ICD was implanted

- Damage to the vein where your ICD leads are placed

- In rare cases, upper limb deep vein thrombosis (DVT)

- Bleeding around the heart, which can be life-threatening. May include pericardial effusion and may lead to tapping and surgical intervention

- Pneumothorax during the procedure of implantation.
