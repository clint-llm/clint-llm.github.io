Greater awareness of keratopathy as an adverse effect of amantadine therapy is needed by the interprofessional team that cares for patients with neurodegenerative or neurocognitive disorders. This team includes neurologists, ophthalmologists, and primary care clinicians. Ophthalmologists should understand the pathophysiology of amantadine keratopathy and the irreversible damage to corneal endothelium associated with it. Because medications prescribed by neurodegenerative and neurocognitive disease specialists have an extensive profile of adverse reactions, increased diligence in the review of medications may be necessary for these patients. Nurses and pharmacists can help in identifying this disease by extensively screening patients' past medical history and medications list. The prevalence, risk factors, and complications of amantadine keratopathy remain largely unknown and serve as a possible topic of future research.
