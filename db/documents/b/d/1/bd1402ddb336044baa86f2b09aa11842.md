Bancaud et al. proposed a classification for epilepsia partialis continua (EPC) in 1982 based on findings in a cohort of 23 patients.

**Type 1 (Classic)**

- Rolandic fixed lesions

- Neurological deficit

- Preceding focal motor seizures

- The long delay of onset of myoclonic jerks

- Localized EEG changes

- The nonprogressive course of the disease

- Surgical intervention effective

**Type 2 (Rasmussen)**

Early onset of seizures

- High frequency of seizures

- Abnormal EEG pattern with slow spikes (sharp waves) with variable localization

- Progressive course and associated

- Neuropsychological symptoms of sleep and behavior

- Diffuse cerebral lesions

- Short delay of onset of myoclonic jerks

Furthermore,Â Bancaud and his team divided type 2 into three stages.

**Stage 1**. Only focal motor seizures with preserved awareness or loss of awareness

**Stage 2**. Symptoms of EPC along with progressive neuropsychological deterioration

**Stage 3**. The arrest of deterioration and decrease in the frequency of seizure or eventual resolution
