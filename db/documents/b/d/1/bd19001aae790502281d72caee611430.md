Since asteroid hyalosis is most often asymptomatic, it needs observation only.

**Cataract surgery in the presence of AH**

Cataract surgery in the presence of AH may pose certain issues of which the surgeon must be aware.

- A scan may show falsely short axial length due to confusing echoes from ABs. A comparison with the axial length of the fellow eye may be helpful.

- Reflections from the ABs can cause an impaired view of the posterior capsule.

- Silicone intraocular lenses should be avoided due to possible deposition of calcium and phosphorus content of ABs over the posterior lens surface.

Though there are reports of successful removal of calcium deposits from the surface of silicon IOLs in the presence of AH by laser capsulotomy and pars plana vitrectomy, IOL exchange remains the preferred treatment of choice in these settings.

There are certain scenarios where vitrectomy is needed in AH.

- Poor visualization of fundus and failure of imaging modalities like FFA, OCT and B scan to detect the cause of visual symptoms

- Inability to perform laser photocoagulation especially in a case of DR

- Inability to find retinal breaks in the presence of a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment

- Visual symptoms e.g., floaters or visual decline (rarely)
