Neonates with suspected meningitis should optimally be in the care of a neonatologist in an intensive care setting. Consultations with a pediatric infectious diseases physician and pediatric neurologist may be warranted based on presenting symptoms. An experienced neuroradiologist may help assess for complications. An audiologist is needed when the neonate is stable to evaluate for hearing problems. Finally, a neurodevelopmental and/or developmental-behavioral pediatrician is recommended to assess and follow patients as they mature after hospital discharge. If complications develop, neurosurgical consultation may be necessary to assist with the management of patients with neonatal meningitis.

Neonatal meningitis requires diligent clinical assessment, with multiple diagnostic tests and early CSF assessment. The emergency medical provider is an essential team member, as they are tasked with performing an LP in all patients with suspected disease. The neonatal intensive care physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and nurses help monitor the neonate and will be the first to notice if any neurologic complications arise. Doing so can help address these complications early to minimize long-term consequences. The clinical pathologist must report Gram stain findings as soon as they are confirmed to ensure appropriate antibiotic therapy. The pharmacist will help with adequate dosing of gestational aged and weight-based antimicrobial agents required for treatment. Clinical audiologists are essential for assessing hearing impairment in patients with meningitis in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. A neurodevelopmental team consisting of physicians, nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and social workers can facilitate early intervention and help to maximize positive outcomes in patients with neonatal meningitis. A well-integrated interprofessional team can better ensure timely assessment and management of this potentially devastating condition and help improve clinical outcomes.[Level 5]
