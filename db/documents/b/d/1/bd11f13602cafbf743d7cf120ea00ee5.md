Arterial catheterization is a frequent procedure in intensive care settings and the operating room. This procedure involves the placement of a catheter into the lumen of a peripheral artery to facilitate hemodynamic monitoring and arterial blood sampling. Arterial catheterization can be achieved via multiple anatomical sites; each has risks and benefits. However, practitioners must be mindful of procedural indications and contraindications, the proper preparation of equipment and personnel, and be skilled in insertion techniques. As with all invasive procedures, arterial catheterization may present complications, and personnel must be ready to intervene promptly to prevent unnecessary harm to the patient. This activity reviews the pertinent anatomy, indications, contraindications, complications, and techniques for arterial catheterization and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in ensuring safe access to improve patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify possible sites of arterial catheterization, discussing the risks and benefits of each.
- Enumerate the steps in preparing patients requiring arterial catheterization and the procedural technique.
- Discuss the potential complications of arterial catheterization.
- Design and implement a structured, interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to and appropriate surveillance of patients undergoing arterial catheterization.
