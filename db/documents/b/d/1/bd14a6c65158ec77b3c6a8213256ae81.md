Typically the first manifestation of ILD is the onset of progressive breathlessness with exertion, a persistent nonproductive cough, or pulmonary symptoms associated with another disease, such as a connective tissue disease. Prior to the consensus criteria for idiopathic interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF), there were four different proposed terminologies in various articles used to describe non-typical ILD entities:

1) Undifferentiated CTD-ILD

2) Undifferentiated connective tissue disease—strict definition

3) Lung dominant-connective tissue disease

4) Autoimmune-featured interstitial lung disease (AIF-ILD)

It wasn't until the2015  ERS/ATS consensus paper that certain criteria were advocated. The published IPAF criteria (Table 1) required:

(1) Radiological or histopathological evidence of interstitial pneumonia and,

(2) Complete clinical evaluation excluding other etiologies for interstitial pneumonia and,

(3) Incomplete features of a defined CTD,

To meet the criteria for IPAF, cases must fulfill the three a priori requirements, in addition to a minimum of one element from at least two of the following domains:

A. Clinical domain (specific clinical features)

B. Serological domain (specific circulating autoantibodies)

C. Morphologic domain (specific chest imaging features, histopathological features, or multi-compartment involvement)

According to three published cohorts, there was a significantly higher prevalence of patients meeting serological and clinical criteria. Between 47 and 63% of IPAF patients had at least one clinical sign. The most common clinical signs were the Raynaud phenomenon (28-39%), followed by the mechanic's hands (4-29%) and Gottron sign (5 to 18%).
