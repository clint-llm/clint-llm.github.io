Baricitinib is administered orally in two formulations, 2 mg or 4 mg. The recommended dosage for rheumatoid arthritis is 2 mg oral daily, and in COVID 19 infection, 2 mg oral baricitinib was evaluated in clinical trials with 10 to 14 days of antiviral therapy.

In clinical pharmacology trials, approximately 75% of the drug has renal clearance, and 20% is eliminated through the gut. The elimination half-life of baricitinib is about 12 hours in patients with rheumatoid arthritis with a renal clearance of around 12L/hour.

**Dose Adjustment**

As baricitinib is mainly excreted via the kidneys, in patients with moderate renal impairment with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) between 30 to 60 mL/minute /1.73 m^2, the dose should be reduced to 1 mg oral daily. The drug is not recommended for patients who have GFR less than 30 mL/minute /1.73 m^2.

Mild to moderate liver impairment does not require any dose adjustment. Baricitinib should be avoided in patients with severe hepatic impairment due to a lack of clinical data.

No specific dose adjustment has been recommended for the geriatric population.
