Treatment of leukemia cutis points toward addressing underlying leukemia using aggressive systemic chemotherapy. Systemic chemotherapy for leukemia depends on cancer subtype. Usually, remission of hematological abnormalities occurs concurrently with complete or partial resolution of cutaneous lesions. While chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment, radiation therapy, in the form of electron beam therapy may be used for refractory or palliative cases.
