Several etiologies have been attributed to the development of cardiomegaly resulting in either dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

- Coronary artery disease, including myocardial infarction and ischemia (most common cause)

- Hypertensive heart disease

- Valvular heart diseases, including stenosis or regurgitation of the aortic, mitral, pulmonary, or tricuspid valves and sub-acute bacterial endocarditis

- Congenital heart disorders, including atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, tetralogy of Fallot, Ebstein anomaly, and coarctation of the aorta

- Pulmonary diseases such as primary pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and pulmonary embolism with cor-pulmonale

- Infectious myocarditis secondary to viral infection (most common), HIV, Chaga disease

- Infiltrative/deposition diseases, such as amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hypothyroidism, acromegaly, and hemochromatosis

- Toxin-induced cardiomyopathy (alcohol, cocaine, chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, trastuzumab, and radiation)

- Autoimmune cardiomyopathy, including eosinophilic myocarditis, idiopathic giant cell myocarditis, and collagen vascular disease

- Arrhythmia, including atrial fibrillation and flutter leading to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) with the fibro-fatty replacement of RV

- Systemic diseases leading to a high output state, including anemia, hyperthyroidism, vitamin B1 deficiency (“beriberi”), and AV fistula

- Physiologic conditions include stress cardiomyopathy, exercise-induced cardiomegaly or “athletic” heart, and pregnancy

- Familial cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM)

- Peripartum cardiomyopathy

- Idiopathic cardiomyopathy
