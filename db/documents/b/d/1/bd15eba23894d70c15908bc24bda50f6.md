Mucous membrane graft acts as a basement membrane and is indicated in many cases like Steven Johnson syndrome, chemical injury, socket reconstruction, and Ocular Cicatricial Pemphigoid. The graft can be harvested from labial or buccal mucosa. Though being safe and simple, the procedure can have untoward complications like graft failure, graft shrinkage, dislodgement of graft, and donor site morbidity. The article, in brief, describes the indication, technique, and complications of the procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Review the basic anatomy of labial mucosa, which is the chief donor site of the graft.
- Describe the indications of the mucous membrane graft.
- Explain the procedure of performing mucous membrane graft.
- Outline the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients undergoing mucous membrane grafts.
