The medical history review of systems and medications captures most of the causes of peripheral neuropathy. Electromyography and/or nerve conduction studies are suggested if there are severe or rapidly progressive symptoms or motor weakness. Minor symptoms may not need laboratory workup. Persistent unexplained symptoms may warrant laboratory investigation, including serum glucose, hemoglobin A1c, complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, rapid plasma reagin, serum electrophoresis, and vitamin B1, B6, and B12 level. A lower extremity neurological physical exam should be performed to include muscle strength, reflex evaluation, and sensation evaluation (light touch with a monofilament, vibratory sensation, and proprioception). A dermatological exam demonstrating dry/cracked skin may point to autonomic neuropathy, while pedal deformities (hammertoes) suggest motor neuropathy.

Measurement of epidermal nerve fiber density (ENFD) by skin biopsyÂ can be considered in patients with idiopathic cases. The number and morphology of axons within the epidermis can be evaluated, and intraepidermal nerve fiber density is compared to age-dependent normal values.
