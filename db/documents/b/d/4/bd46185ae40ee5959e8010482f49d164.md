It is imperative to get a thorough history in persistent postural-perceptual dizziness patients, as the diagnostic criteria include symptoms alone. Given the psychological associations, it is important to inquire about anxiety and depression. It is critical to note that PPPD is not a diagnosis of exclusion and that the criteria for diagnosis are quite specific. Vague, nonspecific complaints should be avoided when ruling PPPD in or out. PPPD may also coexist with other disorders. For example, the sensation of veering or swaying to the side is seen, but falls or near falls are not commonly seen in PPPD. Testing is not used to rule in the disorder but rather to rule out other diagnoses.

**Physical Exam**

Generally, patients presenting with PPPD will have a normal physical and neurological examination. Head Impulse test, Nystagmus, and Test of Skew (HINTS) exam is indicated in acute settings of dizziness and less helpful in a chronic setting; hence, the HINTS exam will be normal.

On a gait exam, a patient may sway, demonstrating a vestibular imbalance or disruption in compensatory mechanisms, but they will often not fall. It is important to rule out other diagnoses or assess for comorbid conditions.
