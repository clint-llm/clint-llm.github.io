Nontoxic goiter usually evolves slowly and asymptomatic, so it needs no treatment and left for follow up. Medical therapy for nontoxic goiter is controversial as it has little or no results in longstanding goiters.

Some goiters may respond to levothyroxine therapy but close monitoring of the patient is required to avoid arrhythmias, hyperthyroidism, and bone thinning. However, thyroid hormone therapy is not recommended if the goiter is autonomous.

Non-emergent surgical treatment is indicated in patients with compressive symptoms or complications. Thyroidectomy is indicated in retrosternal goiter even if asymptomatic because delaying treatment to symptoms appearance may need more complicated surgical procedures. However, the patient's preoperative workup should be thorough. If the surgery is an emergency for an active goiter, the patient will require beta-blockers, antithyroid medications and a stress dose of corticosteroids. Close monitoring is required intra-and postoperatively. A common complication postoperatively is hypocalcemia.

Radioiodine ablation is another modality of therapy that can lead to goiter involution but has more complications.
