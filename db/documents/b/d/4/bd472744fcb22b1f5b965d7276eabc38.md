Metabolic acidosis is seen in infants and children with dehydration, the pathophysiology of which is multifactorial.

1. excess bicarbonate loss in the diarrhea stool or in the Urine is certain types of renal tubular acidosis

2. Ketosis secondary to the glycogen depletion seen in starvation which sets in infants and children much earlier when compared to adults.

3. Lactic acid production secondary to poor tissue perfusion

4. Hydrogen ion retention by the kidney from decreased renal perfusion and decreased glomerular filtration rate.

In children with pyloric stenosis have very unique electrolyte abnormalities from the excessive emesis of gastric contents. This is seen mostly in the older children. They loose chloride, sodium, potassium in addition to volume resulting in hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. Kidney excretes base in the form of Hco3 ion to maintain acid-base balance of loss of Hydrogen ion in the emesis in the form of hydrogen chloride. It is interesting to note that kidney also excretes hydrogen ion to save sodium and water, which could be the reason for aciduria. Recently published article has shown that many children with pyloric stenosis may not have metabolic alkalosis.
