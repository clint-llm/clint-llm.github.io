Transdermal iontophoresis of analgesics involves the use of an electromotive gradient (i.e., voltage) across a positively-charged anode and negatively-charged cathode to induce percutaneous infiltration of a therapeutic agent via active transport for local, regional, or systemic delivery (Figure 1). The primary interface medications must travel through is the stratum corneum (SC) of the skin, approximately 10Â to 100 micrometers in thickness.

- Electrochemical properties of the analgesic solution (e.g., charge, concentration, molecular size, delivery mechanism, buffer type, and viscosity of analgesic and non-analgesic constituents)

- Iontophoretic equipment parameters (current amplitude, type, frequency, and duration)

- Patient physiology (skin moisture, local blood flow, temperature)
