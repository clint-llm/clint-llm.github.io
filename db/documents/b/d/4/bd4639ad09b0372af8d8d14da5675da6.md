Humans possess three pairs of major salivary glands and approximately 600 to 1000 minor glands. The major salivary glands are the submandibular gland (SMG), sublingual gland (SLG), and the parotid gland (PG). Of these, the parotid gland is the largest and most important in terms of salivary production, providing approximately 50% of the total saliva volume. Collectively, all the major salivary glands function to secrete saliva, which contains a host of electrolytes, such as bicarbonate, and enzymes, such as salivary amylase, which break down carbohydrates in the oral cavity.
