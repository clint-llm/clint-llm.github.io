LMDF has been considered by some as a variant of granulomatous rosacea, whereas other authors make the case for LMDF as a distinct entity.Demodex folliculorum mites are often found in skin biopsies from patients with rosacea and may play an etiologic role, butÂ Demodex mites have not been consistently observed in skin biopsies from patients with LMDF.

As above, a ruptured follicular infundibular cyst has been found in histologic sections of some patients with LMDF.Propionibacterium acnes bacteria within granulomatous areas separated by microdissection, as compared with normal-appearing regions of skin. The authors suggested that the presence of P. acnes in the dermis around a disrupted hair follicle, in combination with host factors, may play a role in pathogenesis.
