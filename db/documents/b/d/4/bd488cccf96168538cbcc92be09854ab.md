Prognosis of pseudomyxoma peritonei correlates closely to histopathological classification. The ten-year survival rate of patients with low-grade tumors/DPAM is 63% compared to 40.1% in patients with high-grade tumors/PMCA and 0% in patients with high-grade tumors with signet ring cells following the treatment of CRS/HIPEC in one recent study.
