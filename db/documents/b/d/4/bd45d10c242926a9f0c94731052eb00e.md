The major differentials to cranial CSF leaks include other disorders that can result in watery nasal or ear discharge, which is not CSF. These can be infectious etiologies like the common cold or allergic etiologies like allergic rhinitis. Ruling out such mimics is more pertinent among patients with no history of trauma or previous surgery. As highlighted in the evaluation section earlier, it is important to confirm that the leaking fluid is CSF using clinical signs like reservoir or halo sign and laboratory tests like beta-2 transferrin.
