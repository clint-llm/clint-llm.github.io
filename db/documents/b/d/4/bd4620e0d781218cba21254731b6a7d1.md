Traditional catheter angiography is the gold-standard for the assessment of the intracranial vasculature. However, it is an invasive procedure and presents inherent procedural risks associated with vascular access as well as thromboembolic events within the cerebral vasculature. The workup of sellar and suprasellar lesions does not routinely include traditional angiography, but before the advent of CT and MRI, traditional angiography was the imaging modality to evaluate for possible mass effect on the cavernous carotids.
