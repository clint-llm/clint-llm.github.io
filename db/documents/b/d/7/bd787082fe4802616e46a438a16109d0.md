Cystoscopes come in both flexible and rigid options. They are manufactured in a variety of sizes expressed in French (Fr) gauge. A 1 French instrument has a circumference of one-third of a millimeter. Rigid cystoscopes use the Hopkins rod-lens optical system, which has the advantage of providing improved optical clarity when compared with the fiberoptic bundles used in flexible cystoscopes. However, this is becoming less noticeable with the adoption of flexible digital cystoscopes. Visualization is also enhanced in the rigid model due to the greater irrigant flow rate. Rigid scopes also have larger working channels which allow for a wider variety of instruments that can be used with them. The advantage of the flexible scopes is that they are smaller in size and provide greater patient comfort, which is why they are used for routine flexible cystourethroscopy in the office setting. The flexible endoscope can also be passed easily with a patient in the supine position; whereas, in rigid cystoscopy, the patient must be in the frog-leg or lithotomy position. Another excellent advantage is the movement of the tip of the flexible cystoscope, which allows for easier inspection of the bladder and negotiating around an elevated bladder neck or large median lobe of the prostate. With a rigid cystoscope, it is necessary to use multiple lenses with varying degrees of angle to achieve proper inspection of the entire bladder.

**Rigid Cystourethroscopy**

Rigid cystoscopes are produced in sets that consist of an optical lens, bridge, sheath, and obturator. These configurations are different depending on the vendor. Vendors that produce these sets include Karl Storz, Olympus, Gyrus/ACMI, and Wolf.

The optical lenses come with tip angles that range from 0 to 120 degrees. The most common lens degrees used during a typical rigid cystourethroscopy include the 30-degree lens and the 70-degree lens. The urethra is best visualized using the 0 to 12-degree lens. A 30-degree lens is most often used for therapeutic purposes. The 70 or 120-degree lens is often required to inspect the bladder's anterior and inferolateral walls, dome, and neck.

The bridge connects the optical lens to the sheath. There are varying types of bridges. A diagnostic bridge has no working channels. Bridges used for therapeutic cases can have 1 to 2 working channels. An Albarran bridge is a specialized bridge that contains a lever that can deflect wires and catheters that pass through the working channel to facilitate ureteral orifice cannulation. This can sometimes be required in patients with elevated bladder necks or large median lobes of the prostate. It can also be helpful when attempting to cannulate a transplanted ureter or ureters entering the bladder at odd locations.

The cystourethroscopy sheaths come in a variety of sizes. Sheaths can range in size from 15/17 Fr to 25 Fr. Smaller sheaths are ideal for diagnostic cystoscopy and cause less trauma. Larger sheaths are used for therapeutic procedures as they allow more irrigant flow and larger working channels for instruments. Each sheath has an obturator that blunts the distal end of the sheath for passage into the bladder without visual assistance. Blind endoscope passage is generally only recommended to be performed in a female.

**Flexible Cystourethroscopy**

Flexible cystoscopes range between 16 and 17 Fr. There are differences in all models about their dip deflection, the direction of view, the field of view, working channel size, illumination and optics. Vendors that manufacture these scopes include Karl Storz, Olympus, and Wolf. Most models provide a field of view of approximately 120 degrees and do not have an offset lens. Tip deflection ranges between 120 to 210 degrees and can either be intuitive (same direction as lever deflection) or counterintuitive (opposite direction of lever deflection). The irrigation and instruments have to pass through the same working channel. This necessitates discontinuing the irrigation to pass a flexible grasper through the scope, for example. However, adaptors have been developed to allow the irrigation to be connected while passing instruments. The amount of irrigation is significantly decreased with the instrument passing through the channel. Photodynamic and narrow-band imaging capabilities are available in some models.

Both Karl Storz and Olympus produce fiberoptic and digital models. Digital scopes are now available in high definition (1920 x 1080 pixels) and standard definition (720 x 480 pixels). These scopes do not require focusing or white balancing. Studies have been performed to compare the resolution, contrast evaluation, depth of field, color representation, and the illumination of fiberoptic, standard, and high-definition flexible cystoscopes. One study demonstrated that the high definition scope had significantly higher resolution and depth of field, with slightly improved color representation and no difference in contrast evaluation. Illumination was significantly better in the fiberoptic models when compared to digital.

Irrigant material depends on the situation, but sterile water or normal saline is most commonly used. Nonionic irrigants (water, glycine, sorbitol) are required when using monopolar electrocautery. Isotonic irrigating fluids (normal saline/lactated ringers) can be used when using bipolar electrocautery instruments. This offers the advantage of eliminating the risk of electrolyte disturbance from systemic uptakes, such as Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) syndrome. Sterile water should be used when bladder samples are collected for cytologic evaluation.
