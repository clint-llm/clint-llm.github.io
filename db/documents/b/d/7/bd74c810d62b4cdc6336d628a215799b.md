Most gallbladder polyps are asymptomatic. Patients with cholesterol stones related to hypokinetic gallbladder function, cholesterolosis, or stasis may exhibit symptoms of chronic cholecystitis. Right upper abdominal pain, food intolerance, bloating, and nausea may be present. Elicitation of a positive Murphy's sign, pain with deep palpation to the right upper abdomen, is often present. Patients with larger adenomatous lesions may have more severe and persistent right upper abdominal pain. Cases of progressive polyps that have deteriorated into a malignancy may present with jaundice, due to growth and impingement of the common or hepatic bile duct. There may also be a palpable mass in the right upper abdomen.
