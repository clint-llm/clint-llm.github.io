An arterial blood gas can be analyzed as a point-of-care test, along with electrolytes (often called a Shock panel). It is essential that these machines are calibrated/standardized appropriately to ensure accurate and precise readings for clinical decisions. Please refer to the appropriate user manuals to ensure the appropriate device calibration at all times in discussion with the clinical laboratory team.
