Diabetic foot care requires interprofessional care. The severity of amputation, length of stay, and mortality rates improved in patients receiving care from a team when compared to those who did not. There may also be an improvement in regards to ulcer healing and quality of life.

Proper diabetes management is an essential part of diabetic foot care. In addition to routine management with endocrinology/diabetology, studies show that a group-based self-management education system improves body weight, fasting blood glucose, waist circumference, diabetic knowledge, and triglyceride levels. These monitoring activities can fall between the clinicians, nursing, and pharmacists; in any event, the results and observations require charing and communication with the rest of the team. Interventions done by interprofessional teams with peer supporters improved HgA1c when compared to peer-led groups.
