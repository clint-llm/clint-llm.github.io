**Primary Virulence Factors**

- Internalins (InlA and InlB): Bacterial surface proteins for host cell attachment

- Listeriolysin O (LLO): Helps the bacteria escape from host cell vacuole

- Actin polymerization (ActA): Helps the bacteria move within and between cells

- Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC): Helps the bacteria escape host cell vacuole and cause membrane disruption

L. monocytogenes can grow at refrigerator temperatures.  Low temperatures induce enzymes such as RNA helicase which improves L. monocytogenes’ activity and replication at low temperatures. The ability to produce biofilms enhances L. monocytogenes ability to survive harsh environments. L. monocytogenes also utilizes flagella at lower temperatures. This mechanism enables the ability to propel itself and latch onto enterocytes early in infection, but eventually losing the flagella the longer the bacteria is exposed to higher temperatures.

L. monocytogenes has cell-surface galactose residues, lipoteichoic acids, and surface proteins called "internalins" (internalin A and B) that binds primarily to gastrointestinal epithelial cells via host protein cadherin, allowing entry into the cell. After invasion into host cells, the bacteria has a propensity to initiate a cell-mediated immune response in the host. Phagocytized L. monocytogenes can lyse the internalized vacuole via a pore-forming cytotoxic protein called "listeriolysin O," (LLO) among other phospholipase proteins which are not pore-forming.  LLO is also responsible for the beta-hemolysis seen when grown on blood agar. Once free of the vacuole, the bacteria can disrupt the normal cellular processes by moving through the cell via actin polymerization.  The bacterium surface protein, ActA, is stimulated by host intracellular proteins that innately regulate actin filaments. These actin monomers are connected asymmetrically (only at one end) utilizing host intracellular cytoskeleton filaments. This tail, often referred to as a rocket tail, gives the bacteria the ability to move swiftly through the intracellular cytosol, between cells, or disseminate hematogenously.

Cadherin is an epithelial attachment protein that is found in abundance in the blood-brain barrier as well as the placental-fetus barrier which may explain why the bacteria can infect neonates and cause meningitis. L. monocytogenes forms "rocket tails" via actin polymerization that allows the bacteria to move rapidly between cells, avoid antibody detection, and spread hematogenously.

Once the infection has occurred, L. monocytogenes can cause amnionitis, sepsis, spontaneous abortion in pregnant women, granulomatosis infantiseptica, and meningitis. Healthy individuals infected with L. monocytogenes typically have self-limiting gastroenteritis with diarrhea and vomiting.
