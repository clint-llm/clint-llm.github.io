- **Amblyopia:**Stimulus deprivation or anisometropic amblyopia may take place if there is no timely correction.

- **Squint:**Convergent strabismus

- **Angle-closure disease:**Hyperopia is a predisposing condition to develop angle-closure disease.

- **Anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (AION):**Hyperopia is a risk factor of the development of AION (non-arteritic).

- **Retinal vein occlusion:**Though few studies denied its association with hyperopia, branch retinal vein occlusion might be more likely to be associated with hyperopia than central vein occlusion.

- **Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD):**ARMD may be associated with hyperopia.

- **Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR):**Hyperopic eyes may be more prone to develop CSCR.

- **Uveal effusion syndrome:**Posterior microphthalmos with hyperopia predisposes the eye to develop uveal effusion.

- **Nanophthalmos/posterior microphthalmos:**Serous retinal detachment, pre-retinal folds with macular cysts, macular folds, and thickening of the fovea and retinal pigment epithelium are common retinal features of nanophthalmos or posterior microphthalmos.
