Surgical oncologists play a very important role in the management of patients with endometrial carcinoma. Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is the treatment of choice in patients with stage I disease. The most common complication associated with total abdominal hysterectomy is an excessive loss of blood. Other complications include infection, side effects of anesthesia, bladder rupture, and ureter damage. Sexual function remains unaffected after treatment.

Radical hysterectomies done for stage II cancer involves the removal of the uterus along with all the ligaments and the upper one third or half of the vaginal canal. Stage III and IV are most commonly treated with hysterectomy plus bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and radiation. Laparoscopic surgery has been found to have an equal risk of death compared to laparotomy and hence is now often performed.
