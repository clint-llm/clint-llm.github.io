Atypical parkinsonian disorders are also known as Parkinson-plus syndromes.

All these syndromes may have parkinsonian features that have an inadequate response to levodopa.

**These include:**

1) Multiple system atrophy: It manifests as autonomic symptoms like orthostatic hypotension, erectile dysfunction in males, and urinary incontinence along with motor symptoms of parkinsonism. Individuals also have cerebellar ataxia and orofacial or craniofacial dystonia.

2) Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB): DLB has features of both cognitive dysfunction and parkinsonism. It characteristically presents by alternating cognition such as varying alertness and concentration, presence of visual hallucinations, and rapid eye movement sleep disorder along with motor symptoms of parkinsonism.

3) Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP): PSP occurs due to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Its presentation is with a vertical gaze palsy along with a decrease in blink rate due to eyelid dystonia. It also presents with an unstable posture resulting in an increased risk of fall.

4) Corticobasal syndrome: It is manifested as an asymmetric movement in the form of limb dystonia along with myoclonus sometimes referred to as 'useless arm.' Patients also present with gait disturbances and cortical sensory loss. Patients have early-onset dementia, as well.
