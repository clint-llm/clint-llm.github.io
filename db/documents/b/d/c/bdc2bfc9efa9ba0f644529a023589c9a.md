Healthcare workers should encourage healthy nutrition in all their patients. However, some groups may be at risk for B6 deficiency. These include patients with renal impairment, autoimmune disorders, and chronic alcohol use. Patients with chronic renal failure, especially those receiving hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, have low plasma levels of B6. Autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, have increased catabolism of B6, resulting in higher demand for dietary supplementation of B6.

Besides, emergency department physicians should be aware that pyridoxine is the emergency antidote for isoniazid (INH) overdose, ethylene glycol, hydralazine, and gyromitrin mushroom poisoning.Â  The two most common uses of vitamin B6 are in the treatment of toxicological emergencies: INH and ethylene glycol overdoses.

Of great clinical importance in toxicology is that drug antagonists to vitamin B6 occurs with the tuberculosis medicine isoniazid. Also, penicillamine and levodopa, as well as some anticonvulsant medications, may interfere with B6 metabolism.

The outcomes for patients with B6 deficiency are good if supplementation is undertaken before severe deficits have developed. (Level V)
