Sagi et al 2011 JOT

- Dr. Sagi and colleagues evaluated pelvic ring injuries under dynamic fluoroscopy in the operating room and found a subset of pelvic ring injuries to be more unstable than predicted by fracture pattern alone.

- Which patients require examination under anesthesia (EUA) still requires clarification.

- Can use EUA during fixation of pelvic ring injuries to determine how much fixation is required.
