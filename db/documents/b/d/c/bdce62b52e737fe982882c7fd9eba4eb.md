The prognosis for patients with keratoendotheliitis fugax hereditaria is fair. While the frequency and severity of the condition lessen with time, stromal scarring, seen in 50% of patients, may permanently affect vision. These permanent opacifications seem to increase with repeated attacks as they are denser and more debilitating in older patients.

It is possible that other individuals with less severe forms of the mutation exist, or that less severe expressivity in an individual may result in mild or subclinical symptoms. If these cases do exist, the prognosis is likely good to excellent, and may not need treatment.
