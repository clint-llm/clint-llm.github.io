Complications from pericardial cysts are often due to compression of adjacent structures, which include but are not limited to the lung, esophagus, and heart. As such, symptoms are often vague and nonspecific. Rarely, complications can manifest as cyst infection, compression of the superior vena cava, and hemorrhage into the pericardial space, causing tamponade and death.
