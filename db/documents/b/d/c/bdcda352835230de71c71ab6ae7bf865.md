The primary mechanism of action of amoxapine is through inhibition of presynaptic reuptake of norepinephrine; patients should not take it alongside other antidepressants or drugs which impart similar effects, such as MAO inhibitors. Patients should not take the drug within 14 days of other antidepressants, allowing time for the previous antidepressant to leave the system entirely before initiating amoxapine or any other TCA.

Furthermore, due to the QTc prolongation effect of the drug, patients with increased QTc intervals or acute myocardial infarction should not be prescribed this medication to avoid exacerbating their symptoms.

Amoxapine carries an FDA black box warning regarding suicidality risk in patients under 24 years of age and patients 65 and older.
