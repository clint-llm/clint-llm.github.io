There are three common types of gliomas, which are classified based on the phenotypic cell characteristics: astrocytomas, ependymomas, and oligodendrogliomas. These cell gliomas are further classified to low grade, atypical, and high-grade tumors based on cell morphology, mitotic activities, and molecular marker. The World Health Organization (WHO) grading system utilizes molecular markers that have shown to have significant prognostic and therapeutic implications.

- **Astrocytomas**:  Originated from astrocytes and can be encapsulated,  preserving clear borders between normal and tumor cells, or infiltrative, indicating advanced grade. Low grades are common in children while high grades are common in young adults and older patients.

- **Oligodendrogliomas**:  Originated from oligodendrocyte cells. These are less infiltrating than astrocytomas and are common in adults.

- **Ependymomas:**Originated from ependymal cells which are found lining the ventricular cavities and the central canal of the spinal cord. These are common in the pediatric patient population.
