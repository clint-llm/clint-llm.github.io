Management of VTE is to prevent further extension of DVT proximally and the prevention of pulmonary embolism. Treatment is divided into an initial active treatment phase of 3 months and a subsequent secondary phase.

Initial treatment consists of the administration of an anticoagulant. Anticoagulants include low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux or unfractionated heparin (UFH) for a minimum of 5 days, with early administration of a vitamin-K antagonist (VKA) like warfarin.

Treatment for portal venous obstruction includes thrombolysis using tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) through the transhepatic route, followed by prolonged anticoagulation therapy with warfarin for at least 3 months.
