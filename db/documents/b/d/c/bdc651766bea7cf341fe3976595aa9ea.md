Hurthle cell carcinomas can be more aggressive than other differentiated types of thyroid carcinomas. There are no routine screening methods to diagnose thyroid neoplasms recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force for use in the general asymptomatic population. Patients with a family history of medullary thyroid carcinomas, multiple endocrine neoplasias and personal history of thyroid cancer, familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome, or exposure to radiation have a high risk of developing thyroid cancer and are suggested to have a high risk of developing thyroid neoplasms and need to be educated to be vigilant about any suspicious signs and symptoms. Patients should be educated on the importance of timely evaluation of any suspicious thyroid nodules or neck masses.
