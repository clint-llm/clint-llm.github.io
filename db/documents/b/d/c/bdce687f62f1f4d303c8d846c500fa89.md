The etiology behind burning mouth syndrome is not well understood. Multiple theories exist regarding the underlying etiology, and most believe the condition to be multifactorial.

As previously stated, the disease has a higher prevalence in peri- and postmenopausal women, which supports the theory that estrogen plays a role in the underlying process.

In some cases, the infection may precede the development of symptoms, and certain pathogens are more commonly found in patients actively suffering from burning mouth syndrome, including Candida, Enterobacter, Fusospirochetal, Helicobacter pylori, and Klebsiella.

Diabetes mellitus and associated peripheral neuropathy may also cause symptoms related to burning mouth syndrome, although the underlying mechanism is neuropathy in this case.

There is an association with certain irritants, including dental materials such as mercury, amalgam, methyl methacrylate, cobalt chloride, zinc, and benzoyl peroxide.

As previously stated, there is a connection with patients with neuropsychiatric conditions such as major depression, chronic anxiety, and mood disorders. The most common association is with a major depressive disorder, and it may follow acute symptoms or share an association as a comorbid condition at some point in the patient's life.

Other causes include orthodontic appliances, possible prescription drug adverse effects, increased bradykinin, and comorbid dermatologic conditions.
