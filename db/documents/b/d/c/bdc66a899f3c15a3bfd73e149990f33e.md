The first step after completing a thorough history and physical examination is to perform either rigid sigmoidoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy. An experienced colorectal surgeon or gastroenterologist should perform this exam with minimal insufflation as the inflamed bowel is more susceptible to perforation, especially as it becomes fixated. The examination is likely to reveal a friable mucosa with a multitude of changes, including edema, oozing, and ulcerations.

The mucosa may sometimes appear similar to that which is seen in inflammatory bowel disease with pseudopolyp formation. Areas of ulceration may require a biopsy, but this must be done with caution. There are likely to be multiple areas of strictures that can be indistinguishable from recurrent malignancy.

Barium or water-soluble enema studies may also be performed, which can identify strictures, obstruction, shortening, and narrowing of the rectosigmoid area with loss of the normal curvature. It may also demonstrate decreased compliance of the rectum. The pre-sacral space may appear to be increased due to rectal wall thickening.
