Lipolysis is the metabolic process through which triacylglycerols (TAGs) break down via hydrolysis into their constituent molecules: glycerol and free fatty acids (FFAs). Fat storage in the body is through adipose TAGs and is utilized for heat, energy, and insulation. The body uses fat stores as its main source of energy during starvation, conserving protein. Overall, fats are quantitatively the most important fuel in the body, and the length of time that a person can survive without food depends mainly on the amount of fat stored in the adipose tissue. Thus, lipolysis is especially important in the fasting state of metabolism when blood glucose levels have decreased. However, it also occurs under non-stimulated (basal conditions).

The glycerol produced by lipolysis is a source of carbon for gluconeogenesis in the liver. FFAs are transported in the blood bound to albumin and are either oxidized in tissues by a process called beta-oxidation or converted to ketone bodies. The byproducts of beta-oxidation, ATP, and NADH, promote gluconeogenesis. FFAs convert to ketone bodies in the liver, which serves as an energy source for the brain, thus decreasing further consumption of already depleted blood glucose. FFAs are utilized throughout the body for energy production or biosynthetic pathways except in white adipose tissue (WAT) where they are stored. In a metabolic "fasting" state, when the body is deprived of nutrients, WAT releases FFAs and glycerol to supply non-adipose tissues.
