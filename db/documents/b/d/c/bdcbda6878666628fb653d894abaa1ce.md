The main complications of IAN and LN injury are persistent or worsening neurosensory deficits. Dysfunction in these nerves can cause significant discomfort or distress during daily activities, such as lip and tongue biting as well as drooling. More severe injuries are less likely to recover spontaneously and may require surgical intervention, which itself is not without risk.
