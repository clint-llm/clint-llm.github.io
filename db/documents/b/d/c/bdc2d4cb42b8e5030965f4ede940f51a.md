Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic derived from the organism Streptomyces roseosporus. Daptomycin is used to treat various bacterial infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE). Daptomycin has numerous FDA-approved and off-label clinical uses.

**FDA-approved Clinical Uses of Daptomycin**

- Complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) in adult and pediatric patients

- S. aureus bacteremia in adult patients, including those with right-sided infective endocarditis

- S. aureus bacteremia in pediatric patients, 1 to 17 years old

**Off-label Clinical Uses of Daptomycin**

- Diabetic foot infections

- Cerebrospinal fluid shunt infection

- Left-sided infective endocarditis due to S. aureus or Enterococcus spp. in adult patients

- Osteomyelitis and/or septic arthritis due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)

- Native vertebral osteomyelitis

- Intracranial or spinal epidural abscess

- Prosthetic joint infection caused by Staphylococci or Enterococci

- Septic arthritis

- Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) infections

**Limitations of Use**

- Pulmonary surfactant inactivates daptomycin. Therefore it should not be used for the treatment of pneumonia. Daptomycin is not recommended in pediatric patients younger than one year of age due to its likely effects on the muscular, neuromuscular, and/or nervous systems.
