Performing electrodiagnostic studies in patients with ulnar nerve entrapment has few absolute contraindications. Needle EMG is contraindicated in those with severe bleeding disorders. Needles should also never be inserted into areas of active soft tissue infection. Nerve conduction studies are contraindicated in patients with implanted cardiac defibrillators or if connected to external defibrillators. Patients should be screened for pacemakers, and electrical stimulation should not be performed directly on or near the device itself.
