Aphasia is a term to describe a disturbance of language function that results from brain injury. Most commonly, clinicians characterize aphasia as either a Broca aphasia/expressive aphasia (with decreased verbal fluency) or a Wernicke aphasia/receptive aphasia (with decreased comprehension) depending onÂ the location of the brain lesion.
