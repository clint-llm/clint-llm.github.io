The alignment on a long-term basis following either non-surgical or surgical management depends on a few underlying factors. The essential prognostic factors determining long term outcomes include:

- Fusion control in the pre-operative period

- Duration of misalignment of eyes – longer the gap between the onset of exodeviation and treatment, the higher the chances of recurrence

- Tenacious proximal fusion – associated with better postoperative results

- Correction of refractive error and orthoptics exercises – better compliance means better alignment
