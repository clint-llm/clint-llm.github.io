The uterus is a midline pelvic organ located between the urinary bladder and rectum. Ovaries are located on each side of the uterus. Uterus and ovaries vary in size according to age. Neonates show a larger size of the uterus (compared to later in infancy) under the maternal and placental hormonal influence. After early infancy, the uterus and ovaries remain stable in appearance up to 7 to 8 years of age.

**Uterus**

In neonates, the uterus is prominent and measures approximately 3.5 cm in length and 1.4 cm in width with an echogenic endometrial line. The cervix is thicker than the fundus with a fundus to cervix ratio of around 1/2. The prepubertal uterus is tubular with a length of 2.5 to 4 cm and thickness not more than 1 cm. At puberty, the uterus gains an adult configuration with enlargement of the uterine fundus, the fundus to cervix ratio becomes 2/1 to 3/1. Uterine length varies between 5-8 cm, with a width of 1.5 cm.  The endometrial thickness varies according to the menstrual phase.

**Ovaries**

The ovaries also undergo various changes in appearance and volume according to age, affected by maternal hormones during infancy and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) during puberty.

Approximate volume of the ovaries according to age are:

- Infancy: approximately 1 cm

- Up to 2 years: around 0.67 cm

- Up to 6 years: less than 1 cm

- Up to 10 years: increases in volume and measures around 1.2 to 2.3 cm (prepubertal stage)

- Premenarchal stage: ovary measures 2 to 4 cm

- At the time of the first growth spurt: ovarian volume measures 8 cm [the ovarian follicles mature secondary to the secretion of FSH]

- Post menarchal: ranges between 2.5 to 20 cm
