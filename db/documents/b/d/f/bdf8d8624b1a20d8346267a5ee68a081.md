Damage to surrounding neurovascular structures is a concern with any surgical decompression procedure. Iatrogenic injury to the recurrent motor branch of the median nerve is the most common complication associated with carpal tunnel release. Many anatomic variations of the recurrent motor branch of the median nerve have been identified, but a dissection of the nerve is not routinely recommended. Instead, current recommendations are to avoid transecting the transverse carpal ligament too radially, as this increases the risk of iatrogenic injury to the recurrent motor branch of the median nerve.
