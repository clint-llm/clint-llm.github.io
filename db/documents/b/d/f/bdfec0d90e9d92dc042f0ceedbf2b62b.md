An excellent approach to understanding the arterial supply, venous drainage, and lymphatics of the anal canal is to consider the supply above and below the pectinate line and the area of overlap.

**Arterial Supply and Lymphatic Drainage**

Above the pectinate line, the anal canal is supplied by terminal branches of the superior rectal artery, a branch of the inferior mesenteric artery. Lymphatic fluid from this region is conveyed to the inferior mesenteric lymph nodes.

Below the pectinate line, the anal canal is served by the middle and inferior rectal arteries. The middle rectal artery is a branch of the internal iliac artery, while the inferior rectal artery is a branch of the internal pudendal artery that arises from the internal iliac artery. The lymphatic drainage below the pectinate line is primarily to the superficial inguinal lymph nodes.

**Venous Drainage**

The venous drainage of the anal canal superior to the pectinate line is to the superior rectal veins, which drain into the inferior mesenteric vein. These veins are part of the hepatic portal venous system, conveying oxygen-poor, nutrient-rich blood to the liver for processing. The venous drainage of the anal canal below the pectinate line is to the internal pudendal veins, which convey their contents to the internal iliac vein. These veins are part of the systemic venous system that transports oxygen-poor, nutrient-poor blood to the heart. Anastomoses of the portal and systemic venous systems within the anorectal canal allow for potential collateral circulatory routes. In patients with portal hypertension, anorectal varices may be apparent. Not unique to the anal canal, these portosystemic anastomoses are also present elsewhere in the body.
