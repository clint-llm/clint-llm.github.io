This section will cover the pregnancy rates per cycle for each of the treatment modalities. The data are mostly from the evaluation of unexplained infertility but is also consistent for known causes of infertility. The rates of IVF will vary drastically according to multiple individual factors. The following pregnancy rates wereÂ collected from a retrospective analysis of 45 separate studies

- No treatment: 1.3% to 3.8%

- IUI alone: 4%

- Clomiphene citrate (CC) alone: 5.6%

- CC with IUI: 8.3%

- Gonadotropins alone: 7.7%

- Gonadotropins with IUI: 17.1%

- IVF: 20.7%

Letrozole alone and letrozole with IUI result in similar pregnancy rates as CC plus IUI and can be used for women who IVF is not an option and have failed CC plus IUI.

In 2009, a study showed that women who failed CC plus IUI should go straight to IVF instead of gonadotropins plus IUI prior to IVF. This study resulted in less time to achieve pregnancy, fewer treatment cycles, and lower total financial cost per delivery.

The research above suggests that providers can use clomiphene alone as a first-line treatment for infertility. This is no longer true. In 2008, a randomized control trial showed that clomiphene alone had lower live birth rates than expectant management, respectively 14% and 17%.
