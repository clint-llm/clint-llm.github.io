Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may have many adverse effects, including changes in taste, fatigue, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, tinnitus, paresthesia, and headache. Both oral and topical drugs are sulfonamide derivatives. Sulfonamide structure can cause allergic reactions such as rash, anaphylaxis, and in rare cases, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).Â Adverse effects of topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors include burning, superficial punctate keratopathy, and local inflammatory reactions of the conjunctiva. A bitter aftertaste is a common effect reported by patients. Systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors correlate with increased side effects, such as those previously mentioned, and serious effects such as metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, nephrolithiasis, and fulminant hepatic necrosis.
