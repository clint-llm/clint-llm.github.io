Dens evaginatus, also known as a talon cusp, results from a developmental tubercle, often seen on the lingual aspect of the tooth structure; however, it can occur on the occlusal surface. A coronal anomaly, these accessory cusps typically project from the cingulum or cementoenamel junction of anterior teeth.

Dens invaginatus, also known as dens in dente, is a dental malformation that results from an inward folding of the developing tooth germ. Dental anomalies have a multifactorial etiology, with genetic and environmental factors being the most common.

Amelogenesis imperfecta is a developmental condition with a genetic etiology. It affects both the clinical and structural appearance of some or all of the dentition. Mutations in the amelogenin gene (AMELX) and enamelin gene (ENAM) are also responsible for this condition.

Dentinogenesis imperfecta is a developmental condition that also has a genetic etiology. It is caused by mutations with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance that alters the structure of dentin.
