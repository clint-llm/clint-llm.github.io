The general condition of prolapse, even to the extent of procidentia, is not life-threatening. The treatment has its basis in the severity of the individual patient’s symptomology. For those who have an incidental diagnosis of prolapse and are not symptomatic, observation and pelvic floor muscle training are reasonable options.

For patients who are symptomatic, but do not wish to proceed with surgery or are not surgical candidates, pessaries have often been an option. Pessaries are usually silicone-based products fitted for a patient’s specific type of prolapse. There is a multitude of sizes and shapes. Examples for usage include young women desiring future pregnancies with symptomatic prolapse, elderly females with chronic medical issues that contraindicate anesthesia, patients wanting medical treatment, etc.

Surgical options depend on many factors including the stage of prolapse, vaginal length, hormonal status, desires for further coitus, concurrent urinary or bowel dysfunctions, etc.
