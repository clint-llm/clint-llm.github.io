For this technique, endorectal linear or convex transducers with high frequencies are used (7.5Â to 10 MHz are acceptable, however, the higher, the better). These may be single or biplane transducers. However, biplane transducers are preferred as probes do not have to be exchanged to view both transverse and sagittal planes necessary for a complete evaluation, decreasing the patient's overall discomfort. Images are obtained using B-mode.

There are supplemental tools that may be utilized for evaluation that vary in availability based on the institution:

- Color and power Doppler are universally available and assess vascularity best used when there is a concern for inflammatory conditions.

- Elastography is an emerging technology that helps to identify differences in tissue stiffness, such as in prostate cancer.

- 3D ultrasound gives a more detailed view of the prostate and allows evaluation in the coronal plane and spatial relationships of the prostatic capsule and adjacent structures.

- Contrast-enhanced ultrasound uses microbubble contrast agents to better demonstrate neovascularity and increased vascular density associated with malignancy.

If the ultrasound is being done to guide biopsy, the preferred probe is a biplane. It must contain an internal bioptic channel or attached biopsy needle guide, which corresponds to the biopsy track demonstrated on the screen.
