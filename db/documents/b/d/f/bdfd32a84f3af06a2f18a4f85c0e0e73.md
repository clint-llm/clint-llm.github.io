Although dermoscopy is an excellent tool for triage, it needs to be combined with the macro clinical picture and histopathology to be conclusive. The role of the dermatopathologist is vital in this regard. From what used to a clinicopathological correlation, we are moving towards a clinical-dermoscopic-pathological correlation.

As far as levels of evidence are concerned, a recently published Cochrane meta-analysis sums it up aptly-although evidence-based is limited, the conclusion is that when specialists use dermoscopy, it is a better tool for the diagnosis of melanoma as compared to simple visual examination. Also, dermoscopy is more effective when interpreted with the actual patient, rather than with a dermoscopy image.

Dermoscopy should not be considered as an 'ancillary' or 'optional' tool now, at least for a dermatologist.

Dermoscopy is not only for dermatologists, rather the skill should be acquired and customized by other specialists too, especially general practitioners/family physicians, pediatricians, and dermatosurgeons. Pediatricians in particular must get acquainted with dermoscopy as the non-invasive and visually engaging property of dermoscopy and its images make pediatricians' interaction with an anxious child much more convenient.

The use of dermoscopy by general physicians is very low. The impact of subspecialization and dermatoscopy use on the accuracy of melanoma diagnosis among primary care doctors in Australia.
