The placing of a drain or catheter percutaneously under imaging guidance is an increasingly utilized procedure in medicine. Interventional radiologists and similarly trained providers are the most common adopters of this procedure. Regularly, the development of an abscess, no matter the location in the body, requires drainage. This condition can be complicated, requiring further intervention when a provider cannot perform a simple incision and drainage. Previously a more invasive open surgical procedure was in practice. Percutaneous drainage can bridge the gap between non-invasive and surgical intervention with minimally invasive, image-guided drainage.

Depending upon the preference and comfort level of the provider and location of the abscess, drainage catheter placement can be performed under ultrasound or computed tomography guidance.

Abscess formation can be life-threatening if not treated in a timely manner and may lead to sepsis from the hematogenous spread of infection.
