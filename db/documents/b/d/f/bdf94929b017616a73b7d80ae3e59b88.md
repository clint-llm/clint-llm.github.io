These tumors, along with other pancreatic endocrine tumors, appear to originate from endodermal pluripotent cells. Gastrinomas can be either sporadic (75% to 80%) or associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1) syndrome, an autosomal dominant inherited disorder (20% to 30%). MEN1 results from germline mutations in the tumor suppressor MEN1 gene located on chromosome 11q13. Researchers have proposed that the tumors arise in susceptible patients as a result of multiple independent second-hit mutations in the MEN1 gene.
