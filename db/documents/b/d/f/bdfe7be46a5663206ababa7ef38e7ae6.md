Echolalia, a form of imitation, is a useful component of language acquisition. Echolalia is common in toddlers as they learn to speak. Echolalia becomes less and less prominent as language skills develop. A disorder may be suspected if automatic speech imitation persists or reemerges after the age of three.

Marge Blanc, a clinical speech-language pathologist, proposed the six stages of natural language development for childhood autism.

- Stage 1: Unmitigated echolalia or the use of whole language gestalts. For example, “Let’s get out of here,” “Want some more?”, “Are you okay?”

- Stage 2: Mitigated echolalia or altering the gestalts into syntactic units and recombining the units. For example, “Want out of here.”

- Stage 3: Isolation of single words, mix, and match of single words, generating two-word phrases. For example, “Get more,” “Want out.”

- Stage 4: Generation of a first simple sentence. For example, “I get out.”

- Stage 5: Generation of complex sentences with grammar. For example, “I want to get out.”

- Stage 6: Generation of more complex sentences with advanced grammar. For example, “How long do you want to play outside?”

Several tools have been studied for quantifying the repeats in children with echolalia.
