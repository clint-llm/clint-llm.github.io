Inborn errors of metabolism are inherited disorders caused by mutations in genes coding for proteins that function in metabolism. Most are inherited as autosomal recessive. Rarely,Â they are autosomal dominant and X-linked. Environmental, epigenetic, and microbiome factors and additional genes are potential modifying etiologic factors in those with inborn errors of metabolism.
