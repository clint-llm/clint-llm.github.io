Initial workup typically starts with a radiograph to evaluate for fracture and assess for ulnar variance. The next step will often be to get an MRI with or without an arthrogram. Recent data suggest MR arthrogram is minimally better but arguably not worth doing instead of MRI given the increased discomfort and cost associated with MRA.

Determining if the lunotriquetral ligament is intact or torn is crucial to guide treatment options; this can be via radiograph by looking for a volar tilt of the scaphoid and lunate. Alternatively, an arthrogram showing communication of contrast or direct visualization of the tear are other ways to diagnose lunotriquetral ligament tears.

One study of 85 patients with distal radius fractures treated surgically found that 53% of the patients also had a TFCC lesion diagnosed by arthroscopy. However, they found no correlation between TFCC lesion and any specific parameter on x-ray. Therefore, the initial radiograph of a distal radius fracture is not predictive of TFCC injury.
