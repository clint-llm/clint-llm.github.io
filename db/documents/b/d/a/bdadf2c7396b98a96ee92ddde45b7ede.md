**Prevention of Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy**

**mTOR inhibitors**such as everolimus and sirolimus have been shown to prevent or slow the progression of cardiac allograft vasculopathy given their anti-proliferative properties. However, adverse effects, such as renal impairment and impaired wound healing, may limit their use.

**Statin therapy**has been shown to reduce the incidence of CAV post-transplant. In addition, these patients have a high incidence of hyperlipidemia, which is also benefitted by statin therapy.

**Treatment of CAV**

Short-term augmentation of immunosuppressive therapy with mTOR inhibitors may halt progression or cause regression of CAV;Â however, more data are required to substantiate this.

If the extent of CAV is limited, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty may be used as a palliative option to treat discrete lesions; however, restenosis is a complication. In such cases, there may be a role for directional coronary atherectomy.
