All physicians including nurse practitioners should be aware of keloids. Any healthcare provider doing surgery, administering injections or looking after trauma patients, must educate the patient on keloids. These skin lesions are extremely difficult to treat. Despite the wide number of treatment, none works consistently or reliably. Giving patients false hopes is another major problem when it comes to keloid treatment. Many of the treatments can in fact make the keloid scar look worse. If one has no idea what to do, the best advice is to leave the keloid alone.
