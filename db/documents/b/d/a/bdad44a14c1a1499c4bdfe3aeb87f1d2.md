Diphtheria initially can present with vague upper respiratory tract symptoms like fever, sore throat, dysphagia, and headache. These nonspecific signs and symptoms tend to have a long list of differentials and frequently pose a diagnostic dilemma. Thus, during history taking, travel history, and vaccination status of the patient can be of importance which will help the health care providers to narrow down the differential diagnosis. The appearance of a pseudomembrane is a strong pointer to diphtheria. While the pediatrician or the provider is almost always involved in the care of patients with diphtheria, it is essential to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that include an otorhinolaryngologist and a dermatologist.

Involving infectious disease experts in the case is equally important. The nurses are also vital members of the interprofessional group, as they will monitor the patient's vital signs. The radiologist and pathologist also play a crucial role in helping the provider arrive at a correct diagnosis.Â Preventive medicine specialists can significantly minimize the outbreaks of diphtheria by spreading awareness through vaccination programs. Cardiologists and neurologist's involvement early in the case can help to manage the complication if seen in the disease's course. Public health experts and international organizations must be notified and made aware of any suspected outbreaks.

The outcome of diphtheria depends on early diagnosis and treatment. A well-formed health care team can help to achieve this goal and prevent any morbidity and mortality associated with the diseases. However, to improve outcomes, prompt consultation with an interprofessional group of specialists is recommended.
