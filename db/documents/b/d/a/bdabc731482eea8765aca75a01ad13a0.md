**Reactions to Expect**

Reactions of grieving family members often differ. Some common emotional reactions observed during times of grief are feelings of numbness, sadness, anger, hopelessness, irritability, denial, guilt, fear, and anxiety. Some common cognitive reactions are difficulty concentrating, confusion, difficulty making decisions, and disbelief.

If you choose to touch a grieving family member, the shoulders are the most appropriate location.
