**Fracture Types**

Type 1: Non-operative treatment is in a cylinder cast or knee immobilizer in a position of comfort (either about 20 degrees of flexion or full extension). Consider drainage of hemarthrosis for symptomatic relief. Keep the knee immobilized for 6 to 12 weeks (once radiographic union) and then transition to weight-bearing and range of motion.

Hemarthrosis drainage can also be considered in cases where closed reduction will be performed to assist in reduction.

Type 2 and 3: Treatment is controversial. There is increasing popularity for reduction and internal fixation. Arthroscopic excision of the fracture fragment is also a possible consideration. Consideration for non-operative management can be used for type 2 fractures when a successful closed reduction is performed. If displacement is still present after closed reduction, this can cause issues with obtaining full extension due to impingement in the femoral notch, and operative management should be pursued. In fractures where there is any intra-articular extension, surgical intervention should be considered.

Type 3 and 4: Historically, open reduction and internal fixation of type 3 and 4 fractures were performed through a knee arthrotomy. Due to advances in knee arthroscopy, many recommend arthroscopic reduction and internal fixation of these fracture types. Some combine arthroscopy with arthrotomy to first characterize concomitant intra-articular soft tissue injuries and then perform an arthrotomy to perform internal fixation of the fracture. Performing the entire procedure arthroscopically can be technically challenging, but leads to less soft tissue damage. Arthroscopic fixation is usually by screw or suture after fracture hematoma debridement. Any interposed soft tissue is removed or debrided. Due to the age of the patient population involved, the surgeon must be careful not to disrupt the tibial physis.

**Surgical Fixation Techniques**

Suture fixation: The benefit of using suture fixation for fracture fixation is there is no need for future hardware removal; however, the technique is technically difficult. First, the tibial tunnel at the ACL footprint is made. Next, the ACL is addressed. There are various ways to perform the technique and a wide variety of devices on the market. Using synthetic absorbable monofilament suture or braided, non-absorbable, monofilament, surgical, single stitch versus a whipstitch is put into the ACL. Absorbable sutures are preferred due to the theoretical tethering of the physis with permanent suture. Metalic sutures can also be used and removed outpatient once there is evidence of radiographic fracture healing in the office. After a stitch is placed through the ACL, the ends of the suture are pulled through the tibial tunnel, and the knee is extended while applying tension to reduce the fragment. The suture is then tied over the bony bridge. Some surgeons use a bone-tendon-bone fixation device to hold temporary fixation to hold reduction prior to tensioning.

Screw Fixation: There are two options with screw fixation: it can be placed either anterograde or retrograde. Cannulated screws are more popular for fixation due to the ease of correct placement. There has been a trend toward suture fixation due to the risk of hardware irritation and the possible need for repeat surgery for screw removal. If screws are not placed deep enough, they can cause issues with impingement or damage the articular cartilage. With screw fixation, there is also a concern for growth disturbance when crossing the tibial physis. The size of the fractured piece also limits screw fixation.

-Anterograde fixation: First, reduce the fracture. Next, flex the knee to 90 degrees, and, using the anteromedial portal, insert the guidewire superoanterior to inferoposterior. Last, place a cannulated screw over the guidewire to fixate the fracture.

-Retrograde fixation: Considered to be less invasive. The fragment must be greater than 15 mm in size to obtain a good purchase. The guidewire should be inserted through the anterior tibial cortex and directed toward tibial eminence. The cannulated screw should be placed over the guidewire, and the fracture fixated.

Comparing the two techniques for fixation, screws provide a more rigid fixation; however, using 3 No.2 multi-strand, long-chain ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene sutures has a higher load to failure than cannulated screw fixation. Studies looking at cyclic loading of constructs comparing screw fixation versus suture fixation have shown that suture fixation has greater strength.
