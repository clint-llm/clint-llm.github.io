**CD**

Celiac disease occurs primarily in Northern European ancestry between 10 and 40 years of age. The reported prevalence has been increasing gradually with improved methods of diagnosis and is now estimated to be 1:70 to 1:300. Screening could result in the recognition and treatment of unrecognized nutritional deficiency states, resolution of mild symptoms, and a potential reduction in the risk for malignancy. However, these benefits require compliance of asymptomatic patients with a difficult dietary regimen, which can reduce the quality of life.

**Gluten Ataxia**

Gluten ataxia happensÂ slowly in the fifth or sixth decade of life.

**DH**

The incidence of DH, in general, is decreasing, and this is presumably because of a higher rate of detection and treatment of CD cases. It is uncommon in children and peaks in the fourth and fifth decades of life. Men are more affected than women.
