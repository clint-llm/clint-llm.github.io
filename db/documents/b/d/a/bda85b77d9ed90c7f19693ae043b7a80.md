Patients with ciguatera poisoning initially present to the emergency department. However, because of the lack of a rapid diagnostic test, clinical acumen is required to make the diagnosis. The poisoning is best managed by a team that includes the emergency department physician, infectious disease expert, internist, primary care provider, nurse practitioner, and specialty trained nurses.

The treatment of ciguatera poisoning is supportive care. There is no specific antidote for the toxin. If intravenous (IV) fluid resuscitation is not sufficient, then IV vasopressor infusion may be added. There is evidence that calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine and verapamil are useful in treating some symptoms like headaches. In rare cases, patients may experience respiratory failure and should be managed by traditional rapid sequence intubation. Symptomatic bradycardia is treated with intravenous atropine. Toxicology pharmacists can be involved in the care and provide teaching to patients and their families. Nurses monitor patient status and provide updates to the team.

After recovery, the patient must be warned not to eat fish or related seafood as the symptoms may recur. The outlook for most patients is excellent.
