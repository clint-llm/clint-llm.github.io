In patients with UGH Syndrome, intraocular pressure needs to be reduced using topical and systemic medications. Antiglaucoma medications and corticosteroids are used to lower intraocular pressure and control the anterior segment inflammation.

Inflammation needs to be controlled with the use of topical steroids. The dosage and the type of steroid preparation are selected based upon the diffusion across the cornea and potency of the preparation.

Miotics (including pilocarpine) should be avoided as they increase the mechanical chaffing of the iris. In sulcus placed PCIOLs causing reverse pupillary block leading to UGH Syndrome, laser peripheral iridotomy may help.

Specific treatment may be offered in patients where the cause is localized. In patients with Express shunts, localized iris chaffing might be managed with laser iridoplasty. Rarely, if an iris blood vessel is found to be the source of bleeding, an argon/ neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd YAG) laser can be used to stop the bleed. Special concern is necessary for myopic, vitrectomised patients presenting with the signs and symptoms of UGH syndrome. Those with raised intraocular pressure due to the concavity of iris or reverse pupillary block may be treated with peripheral laser iridotomy only.

Intraocular lens exchange, explant, repositioning, or amputation of IOL haptic should be performed if the inflammation is not controlled medically and the vision is reduced. Intraocular lens exchange is the definitive treatment of UGH Syndrome where there is no other pathology responsible for the signs and symptoms of the patient. Also, inflammation is not controlled with medical management only.

Suturing the haptics of in-the-bag IOL to the iris in an eye with pseudophacodonesis may successfully resolve the associated UGH syndrome.
