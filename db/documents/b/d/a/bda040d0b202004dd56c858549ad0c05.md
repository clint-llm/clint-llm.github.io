Embryologically, the face develops from five swellings derived from the first and second pharyngeal arches called facial prominences that appear in the fourth week of development. These include the frontonasal prominence and the paired mandibular and maxillary prominences. Around the fourth week of embryonic development, an area of thickened ectoderm arises on each side of the frontonasal prominence called the olfactory placodes. The olfactory placodes continue to increase in size until the sixth week when the center of each placode invaginates to form the nasal pits. The nasal pits eventually give rise to the olfactory epithelium, from which the olfactory nerves originate, and divide into a medial and lateral nasal process. Subsequent formation of the nose, philtrum, and primary palate follows.
