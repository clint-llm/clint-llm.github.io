Within the last few decades, the benefits of beta-2 agonists on the overall effect against mortality and morbidity have been a widely debated topic of discussion. While LABAs have been proven to improve pulmonary function, provide symptomatic relief, and improve quality of life,Â data suggests that the chronic use of LABAs as a monotherapy approach has led to an overall increase in severe asthma incidences up to hospitalization, intubation, or even mortality.

Current literature continues to support the safety of dual therapy versus monotherapy. In 2017, the FDA approved the safety of dual therapy in asthmatic patients while warning against the use of monotherapy of LABAs. The Global Initiative for COPD and National Asthma Education and Prevention, as well as many other guidelines which are in agreement regarding dual therapy to treat asthma uncontrolled with SABA. Despite the support, it is still unclear whether dual therapy can provide complete protection against the risk of asthma exacerbations historically correlated with single LABA treatment.

The topic of SABA overuse in previously clinically stable COPD patients is a point of discussion as studies have demonstrated without conclusive evidence a worsening of disease severity in this setting. An increase in airway hyperreactivity seems to occur with frequent, consistent usage of SABAs, which potentially lead to paradoxical airway narrowing.
