The majority of simple, acute cases of prepatellar bursitis should be managed by an interprofessional team, and the majority cared for in the outpatient setting. This team may include clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists. Lab personnel also play a role in the diagnosis of these patients. The presence of septic bursitis, severe sepsis, or septic shock is likely to require inpatient therapies and possibly infectious disease consultation, dependent on the microbial pathology. Referral to an orthopedic surgeon may be required when surgical excision of the bursa is being considered. [Level 5]
