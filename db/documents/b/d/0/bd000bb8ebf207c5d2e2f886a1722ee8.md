Antibody deficiency disorders may present soon after birth with recurrent infections. Normal individuals have 5 classes of immunoglobulins and several immunoglobulin subclasses. Antibody deficiency disorders can occur due to several different etiologies. One potential etiology is the absence of an enzyme central to B-cell development, rendering the immature B-cell unable to mature into an antibody-producing B-cell. Another possible cause is improper signaling from T lymphocytes to B lymphocytes. This activity examines when an antibody deficiency disorder should be considered on differential diagnosis and how to evaluate it properly. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of antibody deficiency disorder.
- Describe the pathophysiology of antibody deficiency disorder.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for antibody deficiency disorder.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with antibody deficiency disorder.
