Eclampsia is a uniquely pregnancy-related disorder that manifests as a new onset of generalized tonic colonic seizures. It typically occurs after 20 weeks of concluded gestation, although it may occur sooner with plural gestations or molar pregnancies, and may additionally occur in the 6-week postpartum window. It represents the severe end of the preeclampsia spectrum. Preeclampsia spectrum includes symptoms of the central nervous system (CNS), for example, severe headaches or vision changes, and may involve hepatic abnormalities (such as elevated liver transaminases with right upper quadrant/epigastric discomfort), elevated blood pressures, and also may include thrombocytopenia, renal abnormalities, and pulmonary edema. In developed countries, resultant maternal mortality may be as high as 1.8%, and in developing countries, it may be as high as 14%.
