The most common findings on histopathology **[Figure 1 (D)]**are hyperkeratosis, hypergranulosis, mild acanthosis, collagen homogenization and alterations in the elastic fibers of the dermis, which are fewer and fragmented (elastorrhexis).

It is noteworthy that elastorrhexis involving the dermis down to the reticular dermis level is a unique and archetypical pathological feature of acrokeratoelastoidosis, which also differentiates it from acral focal hyperkeratosis, a very close clinical differential. In the latter, histological alterations are limited to the epidermis in the form of epidermal hyperkeratosis with elastorrhexis of the reticular dermis typically absent.

Electron microscopy shows disaggregation of elastic fibers with microfibrillar fragmentation.

Special stains for elastin (and collagen) such as VVG, Weigert, and oOrcein demonstrate the changes in elastic fibers (elastorrhexis) better **[Figure 1(E)]**than the routine hematoxylin-eosin stain.
