GLUT4 exists in skeletal muscle cells, adipocytes, and cardiomyocytes.  It is principally responsible for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into muscle and adipose cells.  Approximately 80% of glucose gets transported into muscle cells. GLUT4’s glucose-transport system can be upregulated to meet elevated transport demands, such as during times of elevated blood glucose during a carbohydrate-containing meal, or during exercise when skeletal muscles have increased metabolic demand.
