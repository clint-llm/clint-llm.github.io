While the United States reports only about 350 culture-confirmed cases of typhoid fever and fewer than 100 paratyphi A cases each year since 2008, enteric fever remains an important cause of illness worldwide. Approximately 215,000 deaths result from over 26 million cases of typhoid fever and 5 million cases of paratyphoid infection each year worldwide. Salmonella typhi is more common than Salmonella paratyphi, and Salmonella paratyphi A is more prevalent than Salmonella paratyphi B infections. The number of new cases of typhoid fever has been increasing worldwide due to rapid increases in population, pollution, and shortages of pure drinking water. Still, death rates have decreased due to extensive research, changes in treatment modalities, and the invention of new drugs despite growing multidrug-resistance. In the era of routine antibiotics, classic presentations are not always seen. In the United States, splenomegaly and rose spots may be seen in only 10% and 1.5% of the cases, respectively.

Up to 4% of patients with typhoid fever go on to become chronic carriers.  These patients remain asymptomatic after their acute treatment, but they may excrete Salmonella for up to 1 year in their stool, or less frequently their urine.S. typhi chronic carriage.
