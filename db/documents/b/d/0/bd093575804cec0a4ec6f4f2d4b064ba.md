Untreated tonsillar cancer will result in gradual growth and invasion of local structures. Invasion of the lateral pterygoid muscle, pterygoid plates, lateral nasopharynx, skull base and encasement around the carotid is suggestive of unresectable T4b disease in p16 negative cancers. Moreover, invasion of the skull base and vertebral tissues can interfere with emerging nerves, resulting in Horner's syndrome and palsies of the brachial plexus and phrenic nerve. Encasement of the carotid artery can cause a life-threatening carotid blow-out.

The management options of tonsil cancer can also carry significant complications. TORS can result in significant pain and dysphagia postoperatively, particularly in advanced disease. Radiotherapy frequently causes mucositis, xerostomia, and skin reactions, which can also have a significant impact on swallowing.
