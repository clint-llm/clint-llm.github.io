Mastering the skill of endotracheal intubation to secure an airway plays a critical role in many settings such as pre-hospital environments, emergency rooms, critical care units, and peri-operative medicine. In a rapidly deteriorating, critically ill patient, success rests on adequate preparation, experience, and anticipated difficulty associated with airway, clinical condition, and intubation. Rapid sequence intubation involves the simultaneous rapid administration of a person with paralysis and an induction agent to create optimal conditions to provide rapid control of the airway with the placement of an endotracheal tube. This activity describes the mode of action of various agents used in the intubation process, including mechanisms of action, pharmacology, adverse event profiles, eligible patient populations, monitoring, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of conditions where medications to facilitate emergent intubation offers an advantage.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the mechanisms of action of the various intubating agents
- Outline the criteria for using medications to assist in the intubation process
- Review the administration of the various intubation medications.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes and treatment efficacy for patients receiving medications to facilitate intubation.
