During gastrulation of the human fetus, a trilaminar embryonic disk forms, containing three distinct germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm, ectoderm) along with a notochord, which is adjacent to the neural tube.

Each sclerotome then divides into a cranial area of loosely packed cells and a caudal area of densely packed cells, between which the intervertebral disk forms. This intervertebral disk separates sclerotomes at different levels and forces the cranial cells of one sclerotome to fuse with the caudal cells of the adjacent somite, thus giving rise to a complete vertebral body. Simultaneously, cells surrounding the neural tube will begin forming vertebral arches to form a protective canal for the future spinal cord. These arches create pedicles, laminae, spinous processes, transverse processes, and articular processes, which ultimately fuse with the developing vertebral bodies, giving rise to the bony spine. Typically during the eighth week of gestation, the sacral and coccygeal vertebrae appear.
