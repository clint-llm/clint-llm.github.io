Awake and alert patients should be briefed on the procedure. Obtunded, intubated, or heavily sedated patients should have a gross eye evaluation for signs and symptoms of globe rupture or hyphema. If there is evidence of globe rupture, including visible conjunctival or scleral defect, severe chemosis, 360-degree conjunctival hemorrhage, hypotony, or total hyphema, the procedure should be aborted to avoid further herniation of intraocular contents, and an ophthalmologist should be consulted.

It can be beneficial to instruct awake patients to "look ahead" with a closed eye or to examine the eye orientation in obtunded patients before the procedure to orient the ultrasound beam in the transverse plane and avoid oblique slices of the optic nerve. Some practitioners will apply petroleum jelly or ophthalmic ointment to the eyes to avoid air trapping before applying a clear plastic adhesive dressing. Ultrasound gel should be applied liberally to the adhesive before scanning.

The patient's position should be dictated by comfort and ease of examination but will typically be done in the supine to 30 degrees "head up" position. Although theoretical concerns may exist for changes in ICP and ocular nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) relative to patient position and ventilator settings, these changes do not appear to manifest in in-vivo models.
