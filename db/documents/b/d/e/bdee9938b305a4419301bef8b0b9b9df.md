Candidates for cochlear implants are determined medically, by the FDA, and by insurance qualifications.

General indications

- Sensorineural hearing loss (prelingual or postlingual)

- Greater than 6 months of age

- Cochlear and cranial nerve VIII must be present with relatively preserved anatomy

- Bilateral or single-sided deafness

- Auditory neuropathy

- Reliability to follow up with audiology and otolaryngology team

- Able to undergo general anesthesia and surgical procedure

Insurance qualifications:

- Bilateral sensorineural hearing loss moderate to profound over 18 years of age (failed benefit from hearing aids)

- Bilateral sensorineural hearing loss severe to profound in patients from 2 to 18 years of age (failed benefit from alternative hearing amplification)

- Bilateral sensorineural hearing loss profound in children under 2 years of age (failed benefit from alternative hearing amplification)

- Minimum age of 12 months (younger if there is a concern for cochlear ossification which is a complication after  meningitis)

- Adult open sentence scores with speech recognition less than 50% ear to be implanted, below 60 % in the contralateral ear (with amplification used)

- Pediatric Multisyllabic Lexical Neighborhood Test below 30% with a lack of auditory progress

- HINT Audiometric battery less than 50% in the implanted ear, less than 60% in the best-aided ear (scores depending on the manufacturer)

- MLNT audiometric battery less than 20 to 30 % (scores depending on the manufacturer)

-  Hybrid system - (this device aids patients with high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss) 

- Patients with profound high-frequency hearing loss and preserved low-frequency hearing thresholds range from 0 to 60 dB at 125 to 500 Hz
- A severe to profound middle- to high-frequency hearing loss as defined by a threshold average of greater than 75 dB at 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz
- The consonant-nucleus-consonant word recognition score criteria are 10% to 60% in the ear to be implanted and up to 80% in the contralateral ear

- Reliability to follow up with otolaryngology and audiology to perform auditory rehabilitation
