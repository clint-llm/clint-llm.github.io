The evaluation of patients with venous thrombosis differs from that of suspected arterial thrombosis. This section will focus briefly on the workup for suspected venous thromboembolism (VTE).

When patients present to the emergency department with signs and symptoms suggestive of possible venous thrombosis (see previous section H&P findings), a well-validated scale known as the modified Wells' criteria is applied to help guide further diagnostic studies. For patients with high Wells score, a serum D-dimer should be checked. The D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product that is present in the blood after fibrinolysis. Its elevation is very sensitive (though less specific) to detect venous thrombosis. It is important to note that a D-dimer could also be elevated in other patients such as pregnant and post-surgical patients, or those with underlying malignancy. However, it aids clinicians in deciding whether to pursue further diagnostic imaging. A negative D-dimer result helps to rule out a clot and avoid unnecessary imaging studies or anticoagulation initiation. The pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (PERC) is also occasionally applied to help decide whether the patient has developed an acute pulmonary embolism (PE), though not applicable for DVT. The modified Wells score can also be used if physicians suspect an acute DVT. When there is a high pretest probability for PE or DVT, imaging studies should be completed immediately without regard to D-dimer levels. For pulmonary embolism, the recommended imaging studies are CT angiography and ventilation/perfusion imaging (V/Q scan).  The V/Q scan is sometimes preferred over CTPA to avoid radiation exposure or intravenous contrast in those with underlying renal impairment.

Determining whether a blood clot classifies as provoked (most common) vs. unprovoked, and whether it is the first episode vs. subsequent are critical aspects of the initial evaluation that can guide further workup and treatment. Clinicians should take a careful personal and family history to document any thrombosis history or pregnancy morbidity. In carefully selected patients suspected of having an underlying hereditary thrombophilia, a targeted hypercoagulable workup may be indicated.  Such testing may include checking the amount of protein C and S, antithrombin III, or mutational testing for factor V Leiden or Prothrombin gene mutation. Acquired thrombophilia testing may also be indicated, such as antiphospholipid antibody testing. In general, a full hypercoagulable workup is rarely necessary and strongly discouraged on initial presentation in the absence of subspecialty evaluation with a hematologist; this is especially true in the acute setting, as many factors can affect the accuracy of test results (e.g., acute inflammation or consumption of coagulation factors due to acute thrombosis can lead to falsely low levels of some coagulation factors). Anticoagulation therapy can also interfere with the interpretation of test results in the acute setting (e.g., heparin can affect the interpretation of Antithrombin III). For antiphospholipid antibody testing, many medications (including several anticoagulants), as well as underlying connective tissue diseases such as SLE, can affect the testing result and interpretation of the lupus anticoagulant. When antiphospholipid antibody testing is indicated, the recommendation is that the tests be repeated 12 weeks apart. As such, clinicians should reserve such hypercoagulable testing to carefully selected patients (e.g., young patients with unprovoked thrombosis or in those with confirmed or strong family history thrombophilia). This testing is often performed in the outpatient setting after the acute phase of the thrombosis has resolved and under the guidance of a hematologist consultant.

Malignancy can be an underlying provoking factor for thrombosis (both venous and arterial). In general, it is not recommended for patients to have an extensive malignancy workup in the absence of any clinical factors to suggest underlying malignancy as the provoking cause. Age-appropriate cancer screening is recommended for all patients. In carefully selected patients, especially in those over the age of 50 with seemingly unprovoked thrombosis, in whom malignancy is a possibility, further evaluation to search for occult malignancy as the culprit may be indicated.
