The diagnosis and management of cor pulmonale are by an interprofessional team that consists of a cardiologist, internist, radiologist, pulmonologist and intensivist. The treatment is aimed primarily at treating the underlying condition; the aim is improving oxygenation and right ventricular (RV) function by increasing RV contractility and decreasing pulmonary vasoconstriction. The outlook for patients with cor pulmonale is dependent on the primary condition, which if not controlled, leads to a poor outcome. Most of the patients who do recover have a long protracted course marked by the relapse of symptoms. The quality of life for most patients is poor.
