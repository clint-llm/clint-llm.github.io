The processes that lead to brain death are in order of frequency: cardiopulmonary arrest, traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intracerebral hemorrhage.

For extracranial causes of brain death, in patients who present with cardiopulmonary arrest, 8.9% of those initially resuscitated will progress to brain death, and in those presenting with traumatic brain injury, 2.8% to 6.1% will die of brain death. For intracranial etiologies of brain death, in patients presenting with a subarachnoid hemorrhage, 8.5% to 10.7% will progress to brain death; and in those presenting with intracerebral hemorrhage, 6.1% to 9.6% will succumb to brain death.

By definition, brain death carries 100% mortality.
