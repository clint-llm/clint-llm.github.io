The prognosis of this disease has significantly improved over the past few years thanks to the developments of tools and noninvasive testament, which, when performed antenatally, will prompt early recognition and treatment.

- Combined data from several studies that included cases managed by fetal transfusion reported fetal survival of 94% and 74% for nonhydropic and hydropic fetuses respectively.

- In a large series of over 300,000 pregnancies, those newborns at risk of HDFN due to alloantibodies other than anti-Rh(D) were more likely to have icterus than those not at risk (25% versus 10%) and to be treated with phototherapy (17% versus 5%).
