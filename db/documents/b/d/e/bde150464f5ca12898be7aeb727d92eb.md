The genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve enters the inguinal canal via the deep inguinal ring. In males, the genital branch supplies the scrotal skin and cremaster. In females, the genital branch is accompanied by the round ligament of the uterus and supplies sensation to the labia majora and mons pubis.

The femoral branch of the genitofemoral nerve travels beneath the inguinal ligament in the lateral muscular compartment, where the femoral nerve courses through into the leg. The femoral branchÂ enters the cribriform fascia of the greater saphenous vein opening and supplies the skin of the anterior, upper, and medial aspects of the thigh.
