Assessment of cilia incarnata requires the taking of a careful history and biomicroscopic examination with a magnification of at least X 15 to be able to see the offending lash or lashes and the changes on the tarsal conjunctiva, limbus, and cornea. Application of a fluorescein stain is often useful. However, no other special tests are needed.
