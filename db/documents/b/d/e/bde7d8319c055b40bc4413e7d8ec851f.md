Total laryngectomy represents a well-codified ablative surgical procedure. Expertise and knowledge from an interprofessional healthcare team will likely require input from a head and neck surgeon, a pulmonologist, an oncologist, a radiologist, a radiotherapist, and a pathologist. In addition, the team must consider the biological behavior of laryngeal cancer and the anticipated responses to different therapies.

Additional support from speech and swallowing therapists, respiratory therapists, nutritionists, psychiatrists, and expert nursingÂ staff is essential in the treatment program. Interprofessional dialogue is critical in the management of laryngeal cancer.
