In the United States, the annual incidence of bacterial meningitis is approximately 1.38 cases/100,000 population with a case fatality rate of 14.3%.

The highest incidence of meningitis worldwide is in an area of sub-Saharan Africa dubbed “the meningitis belt” stretching from Ethiopia to Senegal.

Most common bacterial causes of meningitis in the United States are:

- Streptococcus pneumoniae (incidence in 2010: 0.3/100,000)

- group B Streptococcus

- Neisseria meningitidis (incidence in 2010: 0.123/100,000)

- Haemophilus influenzae (incidence in 2010: 0.058/100,000)

- 
Listeria monocytogenes

Consider less common bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus in patients with recent surgery, central lines, and trauma. Mycobacterium tuberculosis should be considered in immunocompromised hosts. Borrelia burgdorferi in patients with travel to Lyme endemic areas. Treponema pallidum in HIV/AIDS and individuals with multiple sexual partners. Escherichia coli is an important pathogen in the neonatal period.

The most common viral agents of meningitis are non-polio enteroviruses (group b coxsackievirus and echovirus). Other viral causes: mumps, Parechovirus, Herpesviruses (including Epstein Barr virus, Herpes simplex virus, and Varicella-zoster virus), measles, influenza, and arboviruses (West Nile, La Crosse, Powassan, Jamestown Canyon)

Fungal meningitis typically is associated with an immunocompromised host (HIV/AIDS, chronic corticosteroid therapy, and patients with cancer).

Fungi causing meningitis include:

- 
Cryptococcus neoformans

- 
Coccidioides immitis

- 
Aspergillus

- 
Candida

- Mucormycosis (more common in patients with diabetes mellitus and transplant recipients; direct extension of sinus infection)
