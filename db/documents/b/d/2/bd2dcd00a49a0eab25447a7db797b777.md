Brain metastases are a common complication of cancer and the most common type of brain tumor. Anywhere from 10% to 26% of patients who die from their cancer will develop brain metastases. While few cancers that metastasize to the brain can be cured using conventional therapies, long-term survival and palliation are possible with minimal adverse effects to patients. This activity reviews the presentation of brain metastases and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of brain metastases.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with brain metastases.
- Summarize the treatment options for brain metastases.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by brain metastases.
