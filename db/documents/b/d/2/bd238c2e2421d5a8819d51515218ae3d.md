Noonan syndrome remains a clinical diagnosis. Molecular genetic testing can be done to confirm the diagnosis. Upon diagnosis of Noonan syndrome, various organ systems should be evaluated. Along with a complete physical and neurological exam, the following should be considered:

- Cardiac evaluation, including echocardiography and electrocardiograph

- Ophthalmologic evaluation

- Audiologic evaluation

- Renal ultrasound

- Coagulation profile for coagulopathies

- Development assessment.

- Imaging of chest and back for skeletal abnormalities
