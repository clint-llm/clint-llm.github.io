Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a rare endocrine tumor syndrome with high penetrance. This syndrome is also known as Wermer syndrome. It primarily causes neoplasia of the parathyroid glands, the anterior pituitary gland, and the neuroendocrine tissue of gastro-entero-pancreatic organ systems. Hyperparathyroidism is the most common manifestation and occurs in 90% of cases. Similarly, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors occur in 60% of cases, while pituitary adenomas occur in 40% of cases. The affected patient, however, may also develop less common endocrine and non-endocrine tumors such as carcinoid tumors of the thymus, bronchus, or stomach, adrenocortical tumors, cutaneous tumors, central nervous system (CNS) tumors, leiomyomas, lipomas, collagenomas, and angiofibromas. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of MEN Type 1 and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**

- Describe the comprehensive family history and complete physical examination utilized to evaluate patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1).
- Summarize the laboratory tests and imaging studies used to evaluate patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1).
- Outline the management of patients affected by multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1).
