In the recovery period following facial nerve injury, the regenerating salivary nerve fibers undergo synkinesis or are misdirected to ultimately innervate the lacrimal gland instead of the submandibular gland. As shown in the figure below, the regenerating nerves are directed toward the lacrimal gland via the greater superficial petrosal nerve (GSPN). The result is that any stimuli, such as the smell or taste of food, instead of causing salivation, excites the lacrimal gland to produce ipsilateral tearing.

Another theory put forth by Spiers et al. is a congenital abnormality. The finding supported this that few patients with crocodile tears syndrome also had underlying lateral rectus palsy or co-existing with Duane retraction syndrome. It was suspected that the lesion was in the pons adjacent to the abducens nerve.
