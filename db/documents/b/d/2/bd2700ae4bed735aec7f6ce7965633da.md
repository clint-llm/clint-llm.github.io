This activity describes osteomalacia and its respective causes, clinical presentation, evaluation, and management.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the physiology of vitamin D metabolism and associated pathology.
- Identify populations at risk for developing osteomalacia.
- Review presenting symptoms and musculoskeletal manifestations of osteomalacia.
