Sinus node dysfunction is a disease of older adults, although it can occur at any age. The mean age of a patient with sinus node dysfunction is 68 years. Sinus node dysfunction develops in one of every 600 cardiac patients of 65 years of age or older. Males and females are equally affected. Sinus node dysfunction accounted for more than 50% of the pacemaker implantations in the United States in the 1990s
