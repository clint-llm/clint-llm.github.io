Angioma serpiginosum (AS) is a rare, naevoid skin disorder with benign vascular proliferation characterized by non-purpuric violaceous to red punctate lesions on an erythematous base.

The classical pinpoint puncta are caused by either congenital hyperplasia or ectasia of pre-existing superficial dermal capillaries. Hutchinson first described angioma serpiginosum in 1889 as a peculiar form of serpiginous angioma and later coined as “infective” nevoid disease. Radcliffe-Crocker proposed the term "angioma serpiginosum" in 1893.
