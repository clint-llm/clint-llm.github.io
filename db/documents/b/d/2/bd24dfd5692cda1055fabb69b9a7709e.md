Epispadias lies on the milder end of the spectrum of anomalies in the BEEC complex. Therefore, the morbidity in these children is significantly less compared to those with classical bladder exstrophy and cloacal exstrophy. Although not having urinary continence majorly affects the quality of life, parents must realize that these children are completely healthy and achieve milestones according to their age. The continence rates after surgery are variable, ranging from 50%-85%. Better continence rates are noticed when the reconstruction is performed by skilled surgeons.
