According to the latest ATS/ERJ guidelines from 2020 for acute respiratory failure, NPPV carries a strong recommendation for the following in the setting of acute respiratory failure (ARF):

- BPAP for acute or acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis secondary to COPD exacerbation where pH </= 7.35

- BPAP is the prevention of endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation in a patient that is not immediately deteriorating

- BPAP or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for cardiogenic pulmonary edema

ATS/ERJ guidelines carry a conditional recommendation for the following in the setting of ARF:

- Early NIV for immunocompromised patients with ARF

- Post-operative ARF

- As palliation to dyspneic patients in the setting of terminal cancer or other terminal conditions

- Chest trauma patients with ARF

- Prevention of post-extubation respiratory failure in high-risk patients

In addition, NPPV has been effective in treating various chronic respiratory diseases. These diseases include chronic stable COPD with hypercapnia, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, respiratory failure secondary to neuromuscular disease, and restrictive thoracic disorders.
