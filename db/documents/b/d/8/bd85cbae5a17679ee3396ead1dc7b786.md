A kidney biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis but is not required to begin treatment or continue therapy if a biopsy is not feasible. When performed, biopsy provides important information regarding the activity and chronicity of renal involvement that may guide therapy. Percutaneous kidney biopsy is the recommended procedure to establish the diagnosis of Goodpasture syndrome. Kidney biopsy is preferable over lung biopsy as it provides a much higher yield, but lung biopsy may be performed where renal biopsy is contraindicated for any reason.

The biopsy tissue should be sent for analysis under light microscopy, electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence. Light microscopy shows nonspecific findings of a proliferative or necrotizing glomerulopathy with cellular crescents (as shown in the image). The crescents become fibrotic over time leading to the development of frank glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis.

Immunofluorescence stains are more specific and diagnostic. These exhibit bright linear deposits of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and complement (C3) on the glomerular basement membrane.

Serologic testing for ELISA assay for circulating anti-GBM antibodies should be done immediately on suspicion of the disease. Specifically, it is essential that the alpha3 NC1 domain area of collagen 4 be used as the target in this assay as false positives may be seen in less specific testing.

- Urinalysis is characteristic and usually demonstrates low-grade proteinuria, gross or microscopic hematuria, and RBC casts.

- A complete blood count may reveal anemia secondary to intrapulmonary hemorrhages, and leukocytosis is generally present.

- Renal function tests may be deranged secondary to renal dysfunction.

- A chest radiograph shows patchy parenchymal opacifications, which are usually bilateral and bibasilar. The apices and costophrenic angles are generally spared.

- Pulmonary function tests show elevated diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) secondary to binding of carbon monoxide to intra-alveolar hemoglobin.
