Clozapine is contraindicated in patients with serious hypersensitivity reactions to clozapine or any component of the formulation.

FDA states the following Black Box warnings:

- Neutropenia (due to the risk of agranulocytosis)

- Orthostatic hypotension

- Seizures

- Myocarditis

- Dementia (risk of a cardiovascular event)

Drugs that may inhibit cytochrome CYP1A2 leading to increased levels of clozapine include but are not limited to antifungals, oral contraceptives, fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, caffeine disulfiram. Drugs that may induce CYP1A2 include but are not limited to omeprazole, rifampicin, tobacco, phenytoin, and phenobarbital. Other drugs that induce (carbamazepine and rifampicin) and inhibit (cimetidine and erythromycin, among others) CYP3A4 may also affect clozapine drug levels.

Tobacco may affect clozapine metabolism through CYP1A2; therefore, it is important to understand the blood levels and efficacy of clozapine when a patient smokes or when they abruptly stop.
