Congenital malformations of the uterus are the consequence of an anomaly in combination, canalization, and resorption of the septum during the development of Mullerian ducts. Buttram and Gibbons initially classified Mullerian duct anomalies depending on the degree of failure of Mullerian duct development in 1979. This classification was received and revised by the American Society of Reproductive Medicine in 1988, and they classified Mullerian duct anomalies into seven classes.

- Class I- Agenesis/hypoplasia

- Class II- Unicornuate uterus, IIa with a rudimentary communicating horn; IIb with a rudimentary non-communicating horn; II c with a rudimentary horn without a cavity: II d without a rudimentary horn

- Class III- Didelphys uterus

- Class IV- Bicornuate uterus( IV a is complete, IV b is partial)

- Class V- Septate uterus

- Class VI- Arcuate uterus

- Class VII- Diethylstilbestrol-related anomalies.

American Society of Reproductive Medicine further reorganized the classification in 2016 and included arcuate uterus and healthy uterus in a single class.

A bicornuate uterus is a result of a partial fusion of Mullerian ducts resulting in a heart-shaped uterus instead of a pear shape. It is further segregated into two types depending upon the partition of the cervix:

- BicornuateÂ unicollis

- Bicornuate bicollis
