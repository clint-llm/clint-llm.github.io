Vitamin E is quite common in diet and is found in spinach, avocado, seeds, vegetable oil, almonds. It is also present in breast milk.

A patient who consumes vitamin E in their diet has, on average, a level of circulating alpha-tocopherol of approximately 20 micromol/L. Patients that have additional vitamin E supplementation have levels of 30 micromol/L or greater.Â There is no data to support any detrimental effects occurring from the dietary intake of vitamin E rich foods without exogenous supplementation.

Vitamin E deficiency is rare and is characterized by the development of progressively worsening peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, and hyporeflexia. It may develop in patients who have difficulty absorbing fat, such as cystic fibrosis, Crohn disease, and chronic pancreatitis. In these cases, vitamin E supplementation may be needed.
