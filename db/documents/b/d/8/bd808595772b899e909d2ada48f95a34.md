Heavy metals are elements found in nature that accumulate in the environment mostly due to anthropogenic activities. Humans are exposed to them by occupational exposure or consuming foods that contain these elements. These substances can cause toxic effects that affect health and well-being. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of heavy metal toxicity and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for this condition in individual patients and communities at large.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiologies of heavy metal toxicity.
- Describe the clinical features that are useful in the evaluation of heavy metal toxicity.
- Outline the management options available for heavy metal toxicity.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for individuals and communities affected by heavy metal toxicity.
