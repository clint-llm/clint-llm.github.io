Felodipine ER with once-daily administration is a convenient-to-use anti-hypertensive medication. Healthcare personnel should be aware of the indications and adverse effects of felodipine. The clinicians need to obtain an appropriate medication history to look for drug interactions since felodipine is metabolized by CYP 3A4. The healthcare personnel, including pharmacists, should educate the patients regarding medication adherence and regular blood pressure monitoring. If patients develop symptomatic hypotension,  discontinue the medicine immediately, and the patient should present to the emergency department.

Clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs) will decide the dose of felodipine when appropriate. The pharmacist should verify that all dosing suits the clinical scenario and report any discrepancies. The pharmacy should also perform medication reconciliation since, as discussed, felodipine can have significant drug-drug interactions. Nursing will be in charge of administration for inpatients, monitoring the patient on subsequent outpatient visits, monitoring for adverse reactions, medication compliance, and therapy effectiveness, and reporting any adverse findings to the healthcare team.

Felodipine therapy requires an interprofessional team approach, including clinicians(MD, DO, NP, PA), specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating to achieve optimal patient results. [Level 5]
