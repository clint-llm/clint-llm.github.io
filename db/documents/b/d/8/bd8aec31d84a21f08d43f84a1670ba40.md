Quinidine is one of the oldest drugs known for managing arrhythmias and still has utility in managing early repolarization syndrome, Brugada syndrome, idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, and certain infections such as Plasmodium falciparum malaria. An interprofessional team approach is necessary amongst physicians, nurses, cardiologists, rheumatologists, and pharmacists to detect and manage drug toxicity, which can be fatal at times. The cardiology team is involved as quinidine is used as an antiarrhythmic/proarrhythmic agent, rheumatologists are involved as it is known to cause a lupus-like syndrome, infectious disease specialists are involved when it is used in severe malaria. Nurses should ensure proper drug administration and adverse effect monitoring, and pharmacists should verify correct drug dosing. When initiating therapy with quinidine,  dose adjustment may be required in neonates, the elderly, patients with CHF, hepatic or renal dysfunction, patients who are on other drugs such as digoxin, and the ones known to prolong the QT interval. While patient hospitalization is indicated, cardiologists and intensivists provide inpatient consults, ICU care, and monitoring.  All responsibilities demonstrate an interprofessional healthcare team approach is necessary for effective and safe therapy with quinidine.
