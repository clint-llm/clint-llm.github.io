Several differentials require exclusion while considering this diagnosis. As the common pathology in almost all patients with analgesic nephropathy is papillary necrosis, other common conditions can mimic this as well. These conditions include diabetes mellitus associated nephropathy, sickle cell disease with a renal crisis, obstructive uropathy, pyelonephritis, tuberculosis of the renal tract, alcohol use induced nephropathy, systemic vasculitis, and renal vein thrombosis.

Other infections have also been implicated as a cause of nephropathy, especially leptospirosis.
