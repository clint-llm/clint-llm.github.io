If the patient is able to exercise, exercise may be the preferred route to decrease disease symptoms and/or future risk compared to alternative pharmaceuticals that may exacerbate symptoms. An open and communicative relationship between the physician, healthcare team, and the patient must be present in order to suggest the addition of exercise to the patient's lifestyle in order to decrease obesity and improve negative side effects.
