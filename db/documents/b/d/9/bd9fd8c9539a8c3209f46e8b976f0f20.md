Contracted socket, one of the most dreaded complications of anophthalmos, refers to shrinkage of orbital tissue accompanied by a reduction in the orbital volume along with a decrease in the forniceal depth. It eventually results in an inability to sustain a prosthesis. Not only is it aesthetically unpleasant to the patient, but it also results in significant functional as well as psychosocial disability.
