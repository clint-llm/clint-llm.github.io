The antiarrhythmic medications have typically been categorized according to the Vaughan-Williams (VW) classification system. The system classifies the medications according to the primary mechanism of action (although several agents retain properties from multiple classes). The VW classification is traditionally broken down into four main categories, with some references adding a fifth. Revised Vaughan-Williams (VW) classification provides insight into the newly developed antiarrhythmic drugs. This activity covers the antiarrhythmic medications and reviews the indications, contraindications, activity, adverse drug reactions, toxicity, management, monitoring parameters, and significant interactions as needed by the interprofessional health team to manage conditions for which these agents are indicated.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the main classes of antiarrhythmic medications, and give an example from each.
- Outline the indications for each class of antiarrhythmic drugs.
- Summarize the general mechanism of action of antiarrhythmic medications.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance appropriate clinical outcomes with antiarrhythmic therapy to treat cardiac arrhythmias and drive the optimal outcomes.
