Approximately 95% of congential chest wall anomalies are attributed to pectus deformities, with pectus excavatum being the most common.  A depression of the anterior chest wall results in a "funnel chest".  While the defect involves the third to seventh costocartilages or ribs, the most severe aspect of the deformity occurs in the area of the xiphisternum. (Figure 1).  Although the deformity may be symmetrical, it is more commonly asymmetrical and may involve other aspects of the thorax. A pectus defomity may be appreciated in an infant at birth or develop it later during childhood.
