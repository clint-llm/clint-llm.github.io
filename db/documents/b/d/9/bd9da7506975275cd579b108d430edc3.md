Many gynecological exams include the presence of a chaperone. Male providers almost always have a female chaperone present and female providers frequently feel comfortable without one. It is recommended that a patient be asked whether she would prefer to have a chaperone present and her request be obliged when preferred. When possible, it is good practice to have a chaperone present both for the patient's and provider's security, although there is little evidence suggesting that the presence of a chaperone reduces litigation.
