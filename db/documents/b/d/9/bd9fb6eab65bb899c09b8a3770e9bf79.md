The normal red reflex of the human eye is due to the retro-illumination of normal choroidal vasculature reflecting through the retina, vitreous, lens, pupil, and cornea. Any interference in these structures would give an altered red reflex or leukocoria. Some of the common causes of leukocoria include:

- Retinoblastoma

- Coats disease

- Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)

- Persistent fetal vasculature (PFV)

- Ocular toxocariasis and toxoplasmosis

- Astrocytic hamartoma

- Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR)

- Vitreous hemorrhage

- Retinochoroidal coloboma,

- Endogenous endophthalmitis

- Incontinentia pigmenti (Bloch-Sulzberger syndrome)

- Retinal detachment

- Pediatric uveitis

- Medullated retinal nerve fibers (MRNF)

- Medulloepithelioma

- TORCH (Toxoplasmosis, Other agents, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes simplex syndrome)
