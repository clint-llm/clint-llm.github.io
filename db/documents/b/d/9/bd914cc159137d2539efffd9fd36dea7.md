The pathophysiology of Menetrier disease is not fully understood. It is thought that an increase in the signaling of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is the effect of increased production of TGF-alpha, leads to the proliferation of epithelial cells of the mucosa. TGF-alpha is a ligand that activates the EGFR and stimulates the growth of epithelial cells. Excess epithelial cells produce abundant mucus. Under the effect of TGF-alpha, there is decreased acid production. The decrease in acid is due to a direct impact on the parietal cells and indirectly via stimulation of somatostatin release. Hypersecretion of mucus leads to malabsorption of nutrients, electrolytes, and vitamins in the small bowel. Malabsorption of essential nutrients is manifested as the clinical syndrome of protein-losing gastropathy.
