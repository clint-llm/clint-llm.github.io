Elemental mercury is primarily absorbed by inhalation. There is minimal absorption through ingestion, and it does cross the blood-brain barrier where it can deposit. Elemental mercury is more volatile as it is heated and is readily absorbed when it is aerosolized by vacuuming. Pulmonary, central nervous system (CNS), and renal toxicity are common with elemental mercury. The gastrointestinal tract primarily absorbs inorganic mercury salts, and secondarily they are absorbed through intact skin. The salts mainly cause renal and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Organic mercury is also primarily absorbed by the GI tract and secondarily through intact skin. Â Organic mercury toxicity typically leads to neurologic symptoms which are characteristically delayed.
