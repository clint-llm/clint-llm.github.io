Overview: The adductor canal houses the superficial femoral artery and the femoral vein.

The course of the Superficial Femoral Artery:

- Proximal to the adductor canal, the common femoral artery gives off a branch called the deep femoral artery (also called the deep artery of the thigh or the deep femoris artery) and continues distally as the superficial femoral artery. The superficial femoral artery travels from the femoral triangle (FT) into the adductor canal. From the adductor canal, as the superficial femoral artery passes distally through the adductor hiatus of the adductor magnus muscle, and is renamed the popliteal artery.

The course of Femoral Vein:

- As the popliteal vein ascends through the adductor hiatus, it becomes the femoral vein. As the femoral vein continues to ascend, it receives multiple minor tributaries. It eventually joins with the deep femoral vein and the great saphenous vein to become the common femoral vein. As a clarification, some sources use the name “superficial femoral vein” instead of “femoral vein.” This name is a misnomer as the vein is not superficial but is a source of confusion as it runs along with the superficial femoral artery.
