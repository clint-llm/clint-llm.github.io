**Current Strategies for Delivery of Drugs Across the BBB**

As it is the tightest endothelium in the body, the BBB represents the main impediment to drug delivery to the brain. It has been estimated that greater than 90% of all small-molecule drugs and close to 100% of all larger therapeutics cannot overcome the BBB.

Generally, only lipophilic (lipid soluble), positively-charged molecules with a low molecular weight (less than 400 to 600 Da) can cross the BBB. Several transport routes have been established to allow for the movement of molecules across the BBB.

- Diffusion - allows for movement of water and small ions (Na, K, Cl)

- Membrane transport - allows for movement of:

- Small lipophilic molecules (O2, CO2)
- Anesthetics, barbiturates
- Ethanol
- Nicotine
- Caffeine

- Efflux pumps - facilitate movement of P-glycoprotein, BRCP, and MRP 1,2,4, and 5

- Receptor-mediated transcytosis - facilitates the movement of insulin, leptin, IgG, transferrin, and TNF-alpha

- Adsorptive-mediated transcytosis - allows for the movement of albumin and histones

- Carrier-mediated transport - allows for movement of glucose, creatine, lactate, pyruvate, and large neutral amino acids

Ongoing research focuses on developing new strategies and techniques for drugs to effectively cross the BBB and deliver therapeutic products in the CNS. These techniques can be classified into invasive and non-invasive or miscellaneous techniques.

**Invasive Techniques**

- Intra-cerebro-ventricular and intrathecal infusions or injections of therapeutic proteins directly into the CSF

- Transient disruption of the BBB via focused ultrasound, noxious agents, or hyperosmotic solutions to shrink the endothelial cells of the brain by breaking down TJs, allowing various molecules to pass into the cerebral tissue. Limitations of these methods include patient dissatisfaction and compromise to the integrity and physiologic functions of the BBB, leading to the accumulation of unwanted blood products and neurotoxic agents, ultimately causing injury to the CNS

**Non-Invasive or Miscellaneous Techniques**

- Enhanced transcellular transport

- Intranasal delivery facilitates direct transport into the CSF, permitted by the presence of neural pathways connecting the nasal mucosa and the brain

- Use of transport/carrier systems

- Nanoparticle-based technologies, including lipid- and polymer-based nanoparticles that allow a controlled release of their cargo by protecting loaded drugs from being metabolized

- Chemically transforming water-soluble molecules into lipid-soluble molecules capable of crossing the BBB by adding lipid or functional groups to the polar ends of drug molecules

- Monoclonal antibody fusion proteins re-engineer the biologic drug as an IgG fusion protein, making brain penetration possible

- Inhibition of efflux transporters that impede drug delivery

- Chimeric peptides covalently couple an otherwise non-transportable drug to a BBB-transportable peptide vector (e.g., cationized albumin, insulin, transferrin, etc.) by a disulfide bond, allowing for endocytosis of the chimeric peptide by the capillary endothelial cells through receptor-mediated transcytosis

- Genetically engineered proteins cross the BBB via endogenous receptor-mediated transport processes (the Trojan-horse approach)
