HLHS is commonly diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound. Neonates with HLHS are usually born at term, with birthweights in the normal range for gestation. A heart murmur is often not present.

Universal pulse oximetry screening is endorsed and recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).

A newborn with undiagnosed HLHS will often present with symptoms of low cardiac output: poor perfusion, tachycardia, acidosis, hypotension, and weak pulses.
