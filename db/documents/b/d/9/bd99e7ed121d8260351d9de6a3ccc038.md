The pathogenesis of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis differs slightly, given which of the three variants is being discussed.

**PFIC1**

PFIC1, as mentioned prior, occurs due to mutations within the ATP8B1 gene. This protein, which is located on various canalicular membranes, cholangiocytes, and the small intestine, is involved in a variety of functions, which is why a spectrum of phenotypes exists amongst these mutations. From its most benign form known as benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 to the most severe phenotype PFIC1, the condition results in various degrees of cholestasis among the patients it affects. ATP8B1, the gene responsible for producing a protein known as FIC1, is responsible for maintaining the aminophospholipid plasma membrane. Various theories exist in terms of exactly why patients with PFIC1 develop signs and symptoms of cholestasis. One being that the imbalanced distribution of lipids within the membranes provides a protective role. Other theories include that these mutations directly affect the secretion of bile acids into the intestines, hence explaining why it has been demonstrated previously that patients with PFIC1 have reduced levels of bile acid in their intestinal secretions. Furthermore, there is an additional nuclear receptor, commonly referred to as the bile acid receptor (BAR) or farnesoid receptor (FXR), that seems to be downregulated in patients with known PFIC1, resulting in further dysregulation of bile secreting mechanisms. Lastly, it has been discovered that the ATP8B1 gene is most highly expressed within the small bowel and that defects within the gene result in abnormal bile salt enterohepatic cycling.  There is still much research that needs to be performed to fully understand the variability in presentation amongst patients that exist on this disease spectrum. However, from our current understanding, these appear to be associated with the severity of genetic alterations that are present at the DNA level.

**PFIC2**

PFIC2, caused by mutations within the ABCB11 gene and located on chromosome 2, encodes for a bile salt export pump (BSEP). Just as it sounds, this protein is responsible for the export of bile salts into the bilious fluid. This defect has a two-fold effect in that is prevents adequate bile salt concentration within the bile and causes a buildup of bile salts within hepatocytes. This results in overload within the hepatocellular system leading to eventual destruction and architectural damage within the liver. As discussed previously, there exists a continuum of genotypic and phenotypic appearances amongst this variant, however, no documented relationship has been established. Literature, however, demonstrates that depending on the type of mutation, whether that be an insertion, deletion, missense, or splicing, the downstream effects tend to reflect the severity and whether there is a complete failure of production of these export proteins versus decreased expression and/or reduced function.

**PFIC3**

PFIC3 occurs due to a defective ABCB4 gene located on chromosome 7. This gene encodes for a translocator protein involved in phosphatidylcholine excretion. It is thought that these patients have prolonged exposure to hydrophobic bile salts since there is a lack of phospholipids, resulting in hepatocellular damage. The majority of these defective genes result in a shortened protein. A study performed in 50 patients known to have PFIC3 demonstrated that about a third of the tested patients had no detected MDR3 P-glycoproteins within the liver, likely related to rapid destruction of the prematurely formed protein from an early stop codon within the genetic sequence. Newer studies are now discovering that these MDR3 defects, similar to PFIC1 and 2, reflect a spectrum upon which this variant falls upon and may even be related to other conditions such as adult idiopathic cirrhosis, drug-induced cholestasis, and transient neonatal cholestasis.
