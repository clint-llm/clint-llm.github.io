The incidence of anal canal cancer has steadily increased over the past several years, particularly among women. Currently, anal cancer constitutes 0.5% of all cancer diagnoses in the United States. In 2018, estimates were that there were 8580 cases per year in the US (5620 in women and 2960 in men) and 1160 deaths per year in the US (680 in women and 480 in men). Anal cancer is primarily a disease of older adults, with an average age in the early 60s. However, in HIV-positive patients, there is an earlier onset of disease.
