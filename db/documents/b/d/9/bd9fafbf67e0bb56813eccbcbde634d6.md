Kaposi varicelliform eruption was initially assumed to be secondary to a fungal infection. However, the finding of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in the histological examination suggested a viral origin.

The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of viral reactivation in Kaposi varicelliform eruption remain incompletely understood. It is held that defective skin barrier acting in conjunction with immune deficiencies seems to lead to the development of the disease. Both cell-mediated and humoral immunity dysfunction are implicated. In addition, the Th-2 cytokine environment found in atopic dermatitis seems of crucial importance.

A number of recent studies suggest a genetic contribution to the pathogenesis of Kaposi varicelliform eruption.
