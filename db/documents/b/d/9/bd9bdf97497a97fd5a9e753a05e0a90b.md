Clinical assessment should describe the ulcer area, depth, edges, wound base, signs of infection, and peripheral skin changes.

Table 1. Ankle-brachial pressure index

**Ankle-brachial pressure index**

**Arterial circulation**

**Compression treatment**

> 1-1.3

Normal

Apply compression

= 0.8-1.0

Mild peripheral disease

Apply compression with caution

â‰¤ 0.8-0.6

Significant arterial disease

Use modified compression with caution and refer to a vascular specialist

< 0.5

Critical ischemia

Do not compress and urgently refer to a vascular specialist

Color-flow duplex ultrasound is another inexpensive, non-invasive, and highly informative diagnostic test, particularly useful for superficial vein assessment.
