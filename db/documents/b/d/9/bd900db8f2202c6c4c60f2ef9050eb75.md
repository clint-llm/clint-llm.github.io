Adult acquired flatfoot (AAFD), formerly described as posterior tibial tendon dysfunction (PTTD), is a debilitating condition with complex pathology defined by the collapse of the medial longitudinal arch of the foot with continued progressive deformity of the foot and ankle. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of acquired flatfoot deformity and highlights the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the stages of acquired flatfoot deformity. 
- Describe the epidemiology of acquired flatfoot deformity.
- Review the treatments available for the acquired flatfoot deformity.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to benefit patients with acquired flatfoot deformity.
