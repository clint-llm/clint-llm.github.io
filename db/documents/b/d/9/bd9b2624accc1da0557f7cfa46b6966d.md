The splanchnic nerve divides into various sections. These divisions can prove helpful during treatments and procedures for different aspects. For instance, when treating chronic upper abdominal pain, clinicians can target the greater thoracic splanchnic nerves. During surgery, evidence has shown that clinicians can manage the pain by targeting the greater thoracic splanchnic nerves if the patient's complaints are from pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer.

In patients who suffer from flank pain on the left side, pain control is attainable by transecting the left greater thoracic splanchnic nerves. Because bowel movement is under the control of multiple branches, there is a possibility to lose bowel control at any iatrogenic error during the procedure of transection of these nerves.
