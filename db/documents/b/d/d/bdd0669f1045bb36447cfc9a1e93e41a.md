Cardiac rehabilitation is comprised of comprehensive long-term and short-term goals. The long term goals focus on medical evaluation, cardiovascular risk assessment, health education, lifestyle modification, regular exercise motivation, counseling, and behavioral therapy. These goals alter the natural history of cardiac disease associated with VPCs and stabilize and reverse the progression of LV dysfunction and reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death. The short term goals consist of controlling the cardiac symptoms, limiting the physiological and psychological effects of cardiac illness, improving functional capacity, and boosting the vocational and psychosocial status.

Cardiac rehabilitation improves the patients' outcome by improving the quality of life, increasing the patient's perception of physical development and motivation, altering risk factors, adjusting the interpersonal roles, and potentially advancing at work.
