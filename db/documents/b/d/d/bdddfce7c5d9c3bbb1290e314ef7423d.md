POCT testing devices are classified based on the testing modality and the test size.

The most recent iterations of these devices feature cartridges that enable multiple tests, including whole blood analysis for cardiac markers, blood gases, and various hematologic and endocrine analytes. On the larger end of this spectrum, there are larger benchtop POCT units that require dedicated space near a patient to qualify as POC.

Many of these benchtop POCT units are equipped with multiple testing types and modalities, allowing for a wide range of diagnostic tests to be performed within a single device. Common examples of tests performed on benchtop POCT units include hemoglobin A1c, C-reactive protein (CRP), and general chemistry analytes. The demand for smaller and more precise benchtop POCT devices has been a significant catalyst for innovation in reducing the size of these instruments. Advancements in technology and engineering have enabled the development of compact and highly accurate benchtop POCT units.

**Testing Strips and Lateral-flow Testing**

POCT encompasses a wide range of testing modalities tailored to specific applications. The most basic POCT takes advantage of an interaction between an analyte and a substance, usually impregnated or contained, so that a sample can be added or mixed in a controlled manner.

A more complex approach to POCT is lateral-flow testing. This type of diagnostic testing utilizes a layer of supporting material, such as porous paper of cellulose fiber filters or woven meshes. The supporting material contains capillary beds to whisk fluid samples to location(s) on the support material with substances that react with measured analytes in the sample. A well-known example is the at-home pregnancy test, which commonly utilizes an immunoassay to detect the presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, specifically beta-hCG) in urine.

Urine is exposed to one end of the supporting material in the test device; capillary beds then move the urine through the supporting material to specific sites that react with beta-hCG. This configuration commonly has 2 lines of reactive material, one that serves as the control and another that indicates a binary yes or no indication. The test is positive if both lines (also known as stripes) appear or change color and negative if only the control line is visible. Failure of the control line to appear indicates an invalid or faulty test, which could result from a manufacturing defect, damage, or expired test.

In many instances, POCTs that utilize simple test strips or lateral-flow testing provide qualitative or semiquantitative results and do not provide precise information regarding the specific concentration of the measured analyte.

**Immunoassays**

POCT testing that utilizes immunoassays relies on antibodies to bind to a specific target when the concentration exceeds a certain threshold.

Deciding between using a testing platform versus an individual test or even utilizing an array of individual tests depends on the workflow and throughput required. Higher sample volume can often be accommodated more effectively using a POCT testing platform. However, the suitability of a specific platform depends on the testing type and the platform's capabilities.

One subset of immunoassays is the direct assay, which provides a straightforward method for detecting an analyte. In a direct immunoassay, the analyte of interest is directly bound by an antibody that specifically recognizes and binds to it. This binding event is then detected, typically through fluorescence, by an optical sensor. The fluorescence signal indicates the presence and quantity of the analyte in the sample.

In situations where a direct assay is not feasible, competitive immunoassays can be employed. These assays utilize the principle of competitive binding between a measurable, secondary analyte and the target analyte. As the test antibodies bind to more of the primary analyte, the level of bound, measurable analyte decreases due to competitive binding; this allows for the determination of the primary analyte's concentration. Unlike simple test strip-based POCT, immunoassay POCT provides quantitative information for specific analytes.

**Antigen-based Testing**

POCT, which involves the detection of known antigens or antibodies specific to a particular disease or disease state, has been widely employed as a common practice in healthcare.Streptococcus, mononucleosis, and influenza A and B. These tests utilize immunoassays that bind specific antigens or antibodies. Immunosay-based POCT offers a fast turnaround time (TAT) but may have lower sensitivities and specificities compared to traditional laboratory and molecular testing methods.

**Molecular POCT**

The demand for molecular POCT with high sensitivity and specificity and a relatively short turnaround time (although longer than antigen-based testing) spurred its development.

There are various forms of this testing, including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and isothermal amplification methods such as nicking endonuclease amplification reaction (NEAR) and transcription-mediated amplification (TMA).

It is important to note that while molecular POCTs often have higher sensitivities and specificities compared to antigen-based POCTs, this is not always the case. Additionally, the increased sensitivity and specificity provided by this POCT modality may not always be clinically beneficial, as the detection of an analyte does not necessarily correlate with a specific disease state or the need for treatment (eg, the presence of a small amount of Clostridium difficile in a patient's stool does not always indicate the need for treatment of a C difficile infection.
