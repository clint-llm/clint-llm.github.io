Graft collapse and fragmentation have been reported in about 25% of patients at 12 years follow up.

Symptoms of failure are persistent pain, joint tenderness, and effusion. Early signs associated with allograft failure are X-ray follow up demonstrating sclerosis, osteophytes, subchondral cysts, and joint space obliteration.

There are 12 to 18% of patients undergoing revision or arthroplasty procedures following osteochondral allograft transplantation.

Immunological reactions are uncommon because allografts are immunologically inert. The thick extracellular matrix of hyaline cartilage prevents graftâ€™s chondrocytes from exposition to host fluids. Osteochondral allografts are ideally suited for transplantation, matching is based on ABO blood type, and no anti-immunogenic drugs are required.

Disease transmission is an uncommon complication since donor microbiologic, and serologic testings were established around 1998.

Infection is a serious complication that occurs in 1.8% of patients and must always be ruled out when persistent pain, swelling, and edema appears. In such cases, surgical debridement, copious irrigation, and graft removal are often necessary.
