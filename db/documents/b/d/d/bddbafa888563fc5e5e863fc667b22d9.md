**Coronary Artery or Aortic Injury**

- Dissection

- Rupture

**Bleeding**

- Usually, at the access site, groin (femoral approach) or wrist (radial approach). It could be internal or external.

**Infection**

- Local: involving the infection of the access site.

- Systemic: bacteremiaÂ after percutaneous coronary intervention.

**Renal Failure**

- The contrast used in angiograms can worsen renal function, especially in patients with prior renal dysfunction.

**Stroke**

- From blood clots generated during the procedure.

**Myocardial Infarction**

- secondary to dissection or thrombosis. Thrombosis could be within the stent or distal to PCI from plaque debris.

**Complication Rate Increased**

- Age greater than 65 years

- Female gender

- Renal dysfunction

- Diabetes

- Systolic heart disease

- Extensive coronary artery disease

- Low BMI patients (higher inpatient bleeding complications)
