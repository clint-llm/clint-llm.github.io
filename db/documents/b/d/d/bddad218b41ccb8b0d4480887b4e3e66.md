Once consumed, the agent is metabolized hepatically by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, specifically the CYP3A4 enzyme, and possesses a terminal half-life of 6Â to 9 hours. Although moderate to severe hepatic impairment do not require dosing adjustments, patients with underlying severe renal impairments characterized as CrCl less than 30 mL/min requires dosage adjustment. The agent is eliminated primarily by the kidneys and excreted in urine (58%) and feces (39%). Subjects with a CrCl greater than or equal to 30 mL/minute do not require dosing adjustments.

The use of apremilast in sequence with potent CYP450 inducers (rifampin, phenytoin, phenobarbital) is not recommended as drug-drug reactions may occur further, causing alterations in drug plasma concentration. No clinically significant drug interactions were reported with CYP450 inhibitors (ketoconazole, methotrexate)e).
