Sporotrichosis has an incubation period of several days to 3 months after exposure. Infections can be divided into several syndromes including cutaneous, pulmonary, and disseminated. Cutaneous syndrome arises from minor trauma of the fungus into the skin, which is most common in rose gardeners. The initial lesions are erythematous papulonodular lesions that may be smooth or verrucous and involve lymphatic channels.

Pulmonary sporotrichosis symptoms include a cough, low-grade fever, or weight loss. Risk factors include middle-aged men who have chronic pulmonary issues, abuse alcohol or have a history of steroid use, diabetes mellitus, sarcoidosis, and immunocompromised state.

Disseminated infections typically occur in immunocompromised patients. Widespread visceral dissemination occurs with lung abscess, liver and spleen involvement, and fungemia with spread to the esophagus, colon, bone marrow, and lymph nodes.
