Complications of portal vein occlusion include:

**Portal Hypertension**

This can present in multiple forms, including ascites, variceal hemorrhage, or hypersplenism.

**Mesenteric Infarction**

Usually seen in acute portal vein thrombosis, leading to blockage of blood flow from the mesenteries.

**Worsening Hepatic Function**

In patients with cirrhosis, portal vein obstruction can lead to worsening liver function.

**Acute Pylephlebitis**

Septic portal vein thrombosis can occur if there is a concurrent abdominal focus of infection (appendicitis, diverticulitis, etc.)
