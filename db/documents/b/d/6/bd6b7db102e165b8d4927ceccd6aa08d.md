Complications from USGIVs are similar to those for any PIV. However, the USGIVs are often placed in deeper vessels. This deeper placement can make the findings of a failed IV or complication subtle and difficult to appreciate. An arterial puncture, infiltration, contact with adjacent nerves, and thrombosis are all possibleÂ complications. When learning the procedure, it is helpful to practice on superficial veins without a nearby artery to try and minimize complications.
