Once radiographic findings suggest central airway obstruction, bronchoscopy should be performed to visualize the airway directly. Once the obstruction is noted, the degree of obstruction or length and diameter of the stricture must be noted.

The technique for insertion of a metallic stent in trachea: Metallic stents are usually preferred for tracheobronchial pathology. The most common way of insertion involves general anesthesia, rigid bronchoscopy, and direct endoscopic visualization, as this process helps in accurate and rapid placement of the stent. Before performing stenting using rigid bronchoscopy, an inspection of the airway with flexible bronchoscopy is performed. The narrowed airway is sometimes dilated for easy delivery of the stent. The stent delivery device can be used directly or passed over a guidewire. The scope is withdrawn proximally to confirm the appropriate placement of the stent.

If a stent is placed using flexible bronchoscopy, airway lumen is maximized using balloon dilation or debulking of the tumor, and a stent delivery device is passed over a guidewire, which is then verified bronchoscopically or sometimes fluoroscopy is used.
