Unlike the classic paralytic medications that function by blocking postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors, dantrolene acts intracellularly in skeletal muscle to lessen the excitation-contraction coupling interaction between actin and myosin within the individual sarcomere. This function occurs by antagonizing ryanodine receptors within the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which inhibits the release of calcium ions vital to the contraction process.

By decreasing the amount of calcium within each sarcomere, calcium cannot bind to the troponin on actin filaments; this prevents the uncovering of the myosin-binding site on the actin, preventing the actin and myosin cross-bridging from occurring, thus decreasing the contractibility and energy expenditure of the muscle cells.

Dantrolene is metabolized in the liver at least in part by the CYP450 enzyme system and is excreted in the urine. It has a half-life of between 4 and 8 hours.
