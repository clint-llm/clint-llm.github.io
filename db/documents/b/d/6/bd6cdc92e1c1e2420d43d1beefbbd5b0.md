A lacune is generally identified on autopsy as a fluid-filled cavity that marks the healed stage of small infarcted brain tissue. There are three types of lacunes, as described per histopathology. Type 1 is classified as an ischemic infarct, type 2 is a small hemorrhage, and type 3 includes dilated perivascular space.

Atherosclerosis of small cerebral arteries originating from the brain's base is involved in subcortical ischemia and lacunar syndromes.

On autopsy, Miller Fisher observed specific pathological changes in lacunar infarcts. It showed a characteristic histopathological finding of segmental arterial disorganization, fibrinoid degeneration, and lipohyalinosis (hyaline wall thickening).

Lipohyalinosis is described as microangiopathy with loss of normal arterial architecture with mural foam cells and fibrinoid necrotic changes in the vessel wall.

Histologically, microatheroma is very much like a large-vessel atheromatous plaque. It involves the subintimal deposition of lipids, a proliferation of fibroblasts and smooth muscles, and lipid-laden macrophages.

Hyaline atherosclerosis of small cerebral vessels is a common finding in patients with lacunar infarcts.
