Atomoxetine is a selective, presynaptic, norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor known as a NET inhibitor. Atomoxetine is the R(-) isomer. The R(-) isomer is an approximately nine times more potent norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor than the S(+) isomer.

**Pharmacokinetics**

**Absorption**: Atomoxetine is well-absorbed after oral administration and is minimally affected by food. Administration of atomoxetine capsules with a standard high-fat meal in adults did not affect the extent of oral absorption of atomoxetine (AUC) but reduced absorption rate, resulting in a 37% lower Cmax, and delayed Tmax by 3 hours. Specific studies regarding the intestinal permeability of atomoxetine are not available; however, two studies on the bioavailability of atomoxetine determined that in extensive metabolizers, the bioavailability of atomoxetine was 63%, and in poor metabolizers, the bioavailability was 94%. The differences in bioavailability were attributed to differences in first-pass metabolism in the liver rather than differences in intestinal absorption. Another study comparing the bioavailability of atomoxetine capsules versus solution found no differences in bioavailability between the two. Another study looking at the absorption of atomoxetine found no differences across a range of gastrointestinal pH levels, implying that concurrent use of antacids and proton pump inhibitors should not be cause for concern when administering atomoxetine.

**Distribution**: At therapeutic concentrations, 98% of atomoxetine in plasma is bound to protein, primarily albumin. The volume of distribution(Vd) is 0.85 L/kg implying that atomoxetine distributes primarily into total body water. The volume of distribution is similar across the patient weight range after normalizing for body weight. Researchers studied the CNS pharmacokinetics of atomoxetine in rats. The penetration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is crucial in the pharmacokinetics of atomoxetine, as the CNS is the site of action for atomoxetine. The brain extracellular fluid (ECF) ratio to atomoxetine plasma concentrations suggests that movement across the BBB is primarily via diffusion rather than an active transport mechanism.

**Metabolism**: Atomoxetine is metabolized predominantly through the CYP2D6 enzymatic pathway. Coadministration of atomoxetine capsules with potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, or quinidine, results in a marked increase in atomoxetine plasma exposure, and dosing adjustment may be necessary. The main oxidative metabolite is 4-hydroxyatomoxetine. 4-Hydroxyatomoxetine is equipotent to atomoxetine as an inhibitor of the norepinephrine transporter but has lower plasma concentrations. Approximately 7% of Caucasians and less than 1% of Asians are poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 and this polymorphism results in altered atomoxetine pharmacokinetics. Oral bioavailability can alter, e.g., 63% in extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 and 94% in poor metabolizers. The estimated half-life can alter, e.g., 5.2 hours in extensive metabolizers and 21.6 hours in poor metabolizers.

**Excretion:**The primary metabolite of atomoxetine, 4-hydroxy atomoxetine, is biologically equipotent to atomoxetine. The half-life of atomoxetine is approximately 5 hours and may reach up to 24 hours in poor metabolizers. The active metabolite of atomoxetine has a half-life of 6 to 8 hours and may reach up to 40 hours in poor metabolizers. Atomoxetine is excreted primarily through the urine (83%) and feces (17%).
