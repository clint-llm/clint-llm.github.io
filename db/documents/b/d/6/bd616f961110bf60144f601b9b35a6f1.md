Argyria is an acquired condition caused by the exposure to or ingestion of silver, and it presents with the insidious onset of gray or blue mucocutaneous discoloration. The word argyria is derived from the ancient Greek word for silver, argyros. Argyria can cause localized or generalized skin pigmentation, depending on the form of silver exposure. Silver, in its elemental form, is a precious, white transition metal. It exhibits the highest electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and reflectivity of all the metals, giving it a wide array of uses.

Silver has a diverse role in society, from jewelry to filtration devices. Silver coins can be found in various economies as a financial currency. Interestingly, the phrase "born with a silver spoon in his mouth" refers to health instead of wealth. Silver spoons, as well as silver pacifiers, were once believed to prevent childhood illnesses.
