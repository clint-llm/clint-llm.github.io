The conduction system of the baroreceptors divides into two groups. Large, myelinated A-fibers are responsible for the dynamic changes for second to second monitoring and maintenance of blood pressure and heart rate, which is accomplished by myelinated fibers having more rapid transmission via jumping of synapses for the continuation of action potentials. Smaller, unmyelinated type C-fibers offer a tonic, basal control of blood pressure and heart rate. Should the blood pressure drop, the aortic baroreceptor firing rate will decrease due to less arterial wall strain. The decreased firing rate will propagate to the nucleus tractus solitarius, and changes to the bodyâ€™s vascular resistance, heart rate, and cardiac contractility will occur.
