Treatment in the 1950s, during the initial eradication of T. pertenue and yaws, began with penicillin aluminum monostearate. Benzathine penicillin subsequently supplanted this as it was found to have prolonged treponemicidal levels and convenient dosing. Treatment dosing was determined by age with 600,000 units for age younger than 6 years old, 1.2 million units for children 6 to 14 years,

Prolonged oral penicillin and tetracyclines may be effective; however, azithromycin 30 mg/kg became the primary alternative after it was shown to be non-inferior when compared to penicillins maintaining a 96% cure rate at 6 months.

Resistance to macrolides is a concern, however, as T. pallidum is notoriously resistant, and concerns about the similar organism of yaws have been discussed.
