Patients typically present with pain in the medial aspect of the elbow that is worse with activities, specifically gripping, throwing, and forearm flexion/pronation. Symptoms are normally relieved with rest. The pain most often develops gradually but can be acute in onset when due to trauma or injury.

Depending on the acuity of pain onset, there may be signs of swelling or erythema on inspection of the elbow. However, most chronic cases of medial epicondylitis have limited visible signs on inspection. Tenderness to palpation is generally most notable about 5 to 10 mm distal to the medial epicondyle at the insertion of the flexor-pronator mass.
