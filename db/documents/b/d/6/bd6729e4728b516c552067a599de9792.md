**Subacute Combined Degeneration**

Subacute combined degeneration is a dangerous neurological complication of blind loop syndrome. As stated above, excessive intestinal overgrowth limits the capacity of cobalamin absorption. Over time, prolonged B12 deficiency leads to demyelination of the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway. This condition presents with paresthesia, ataxia, and a loss of positional sense. Left untreated, it may result in severe symptoms like spasticity or paraplegia.

**Osteomalacia**

Osteomalacia is another reported sequela of blind loop syndrome. In this pathology, prolonged vitamin D deficiency from fat malabsorption results in bone demineralization. Symptoms can manifest as aching bone pain, arthralgias, or proximal muscle weakness. Recognizing and treating this disease is critical to preventing insufficiency fractures.

**Retroperitoneal Hemorrhage**

Retroperitoneal hemorrhage is a rare but potentially life-threatening surgical sequela of blind loop syndrome. Physiologically, fat malabsorption depletes vitamin K stores. This deficit stunts the production of prothrombin, resulting in a hypocoagulable state. During surgery,Â patients can develop uncontrolled intraoperative bleeding and eventual hemorrhagic shock. Considering this complication before surgical intervention is crucial, as the mortality rate is about 18%.
