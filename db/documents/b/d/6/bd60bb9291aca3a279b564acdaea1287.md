Keeping in sight the clinical manifestations, it is essential to carry out a thorough physical examination, blood tests and imaging to look for the cause of the sign and symptoms.

Diagnostic evaluation is dependent both on laboratory and imaging tests, which includes:

**Blood Tests**

Serum levels of certain enzymes and proteins that help monitor the liver disease or damage otherwise known as liver function tests which includes; Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, as well as biliary tract excreted products as bile salts, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP).

**Imaging**

Abnormal liver function tests are not specific to biliary tract carcinoma as it is present in a wide range of diseases involving the liver. Therefore, imaging plays a vital role in the diagnosis, staging and management of the patients having cholestatic pattern on the initial laboratory tests.

Ultrasonography and CT scan remains the initial imaging modality performed in patients with symptoms of biliary tract obstruction to determine the anatomy and location of the tumor. Direct bile duct visualization is often necessary, which is carried out with an invasive procedure called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or a non-invasive magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). Endoscopic ultrasonography (USG) can also be performed during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) allows both diagnostic and therapeutic interventions like taking of a biopsy sample and stent placement, respectively. For tissue diagnosis, a biopsy sample is taken while performing endoscopic ultrasonography via fine-needle aspiration, or a percutaneous biopsy could be performed.

The two most common tumor markers that differentiate cholangiocarcinoma from other gastrointestinal tumors and are positive in both extrahepatic and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma are CK7 and CK19.
