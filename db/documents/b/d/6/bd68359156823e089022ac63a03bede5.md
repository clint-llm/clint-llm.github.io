There are no consensus indications for neurolysis as targeted nerve destruction can apply to a variety of pain conditions. However, appropriate patient selection is important before interventional pain treatment. Generally, an interventional approach is taken after conservative options fail. In addition to obtaining a thorough history, physical exam, and complete diagnostic laboratory workup, a recent radiological evaluation is often necessary to identify the cause of the pain and to prevent complications associated with the interventional neurolytic technique. A psychological assessment is frequently performed to determine if the patient is suitable for intervention, especially if a neuromodulatory approach is taken.

Celiac plexus neurolytic blocks are frequently performed for visceral pain originating from upper abdominal malignancy, especially pancreatic cancer.
