Given the involvement of multiple organ systems, as detailed above, pheochromocytoma is a complex condition that requires close multidisciplinary coordination to ensure that the patients receive appropriate care. Timely communication between endocrinologists, surgeons, oncologists, obstetricians, cardiologists, palliative care, and primary care physicians is imperative and cannot be overemphasized.

This is especially important when patients require surgical or obstetric interventions. Adequate support from allied health professionals (pharmacists, nursing, and social workers) and working as part of an interprofessional team is also essential to optimize care delivery and improve patient outcomes.
