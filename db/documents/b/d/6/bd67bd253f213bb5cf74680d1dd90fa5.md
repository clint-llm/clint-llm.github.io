The prognosis of LS endocarditis requires further study, and there continues to be a need for additional research to better define prognosis. From clinical observations, the prognosis of LS is considered poor.  Patients may develop recurrent thromboembolic events, cognitive disability, and death.

Prognosis — The prognosis of NBTE has not undergone formal evaluation. However, clinical experience and data from retrospective studies suggest that the prognosis is grim despite anticoagulation due to the strong association between NBTE and advanced malignancy. Similarly, in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), one six-year longitudinal cross-sectional study reported poor outcomes due to recurrent stroke (25 percent), cognitive disability (24 percent), and death (9 percent). The long-term outcome for most patients with malignancy-associated NBTE is poor because it is typically associated with disseminated and incurable malignancies

Prognosis is probably dependent on the underlying disease activity of systemic lupus erythematosus and associated renal and myocardial dysfunction.
