Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) is a rare autosomal dominant condition. It occurs as a result of mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor gene (CASR) that lead to decreased receptor activity. Patients typically have mild hypercalcemia, hypocalciuria, hypermagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia. Parathyroid hormone is normal or mildly elevated. This activity reviews how to properly evaluate for familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and further steps that should be taken when this condition is present. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the population in which familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia typically occurs. 
- Outline a patient presentation consistent with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia.
- Review the potential complications associated with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia.
- Explain modalities to optimize care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to enhance outcomes for patients affected by familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia.
