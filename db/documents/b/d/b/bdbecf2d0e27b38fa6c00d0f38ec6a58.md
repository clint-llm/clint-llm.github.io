PHP type 1a results when there is a loss of function mutation in GNAS, PRKAR1A, PDE4D, or PDE3A.GNAS coding region have been identified as causes of PHP 1a.

In addition to PTH resistance, PHP type 1a infrequently exhibits blunted response to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) resulting in primary hypothyroidism, primary hypogonadism, and short stature, depending on the affected gene.

The inheritance of GNAS mutation is fairly complex due to paternal genetic imprinting. Individuals who acquire the mutant GNAS allele from their father will only have the phenotypic expression of AHO (termed pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism) and do not have PTH resistance. Individuals who inherit the mutant allele from their mother express both AHO and multi-hormone resistance.

PHP type 1b results from abnormal methylation of GNAS regulatory elements. The abnormal methylation leads to subnormal production of Gs alpha protein expression and a blunted response to PTH.
