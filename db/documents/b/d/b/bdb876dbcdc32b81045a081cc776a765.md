Owing to the rarity of this genodermatoses, two issues are potentially problematic. Firstly, non-dermatologists' awareness about this condition is very low and needs to be enhanced. This CME activity is a humble attempt towards that. Secondly, the treatment-related evidence for acrokeratoelastoidosis is limited to anecdotal reports only. Since controlled trials seem impractical because of the condition's rarity, small-to-large case series with a single intervention should be the way forward.
