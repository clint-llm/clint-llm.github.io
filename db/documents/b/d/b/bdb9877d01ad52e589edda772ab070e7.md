NMDA receptors are integral to the development of the brain. They help in the maturation of various glutamatergic synapses. Knockout studies of different NMDA receptor subunits have demonstrated neurologic deficits in animal models, such as failure to develop orientation selectivity in the visual cortex. NMDA receptors are involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and thus impact the lifelong development of the brain. Much research remains to elucidate the precise mechanisms of the NMDA receptor on brain development.
