Cardiac troponins are the standard, first-line blood test used to diagnose acute MI. However, cardiac troponins may be elevated in cases unrelated to cardiac ischemia. Elevated levels of cardiac troponins can occur due to open-heart surgery, post percutaneous coronary intervention, acute pulmonary embolism, end-stage renal disease, pericarditis, myocarditis, Stanford A aortic dissection, acute or chronic heart failure, strenuous exercise, cardiotoxic chemotherapy, radiofrequency catheter ablation of arrhythmias, cardioversion of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, defibrillation for ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia, amyloidosis, cardiac contusion from blunt chest wall trauma, sepsis, and rhabdomyolysis.

The diagnosis of myocardial infarction requires that cardiac troponin levels must be above the 99 percentile upper reference limit for the assay in use and that there is clinical evidence of myocardial ischemia. Thus an elevated cardiac troponin level in the blood without clinical evidence of myocardial ischemia (e.g., symptoms of acute MI, ECG abnormalities, wall motion abnormalities) should prompt a search for other underlying conditions.
