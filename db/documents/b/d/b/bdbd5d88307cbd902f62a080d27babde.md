Aside from complications incurred by the contraindicated use of NPWT, the most common complications associated with NPWT are pain, bleeding, infection, and foam retention, which, in turn, can cause an infection. A common mechanical complication is unsuccessful therapy delivery due to loss of suction. This can be due to several possible causes. The most frequent cause is an inadequate seal around the wound dressing, whereby the transparent adhesive sealant tape has either been misapplied or has come off due to poor contact with the underlying skin. This should be remedied as soon as possible to avoid any delay in the delivery of therapy. Other causes can be the incorrect placement of the suction drain tube, loss of battery power, blockage of the suction drain tube, or a full NPWT suction device.

Other complications can include a hypersensitivity reaction to the dressing materials, further damage to the wound through negative pressure erosion or necrosis, and intra-operative complications, such as damage to surrounding nerves, blood vessels, and soft tissue. If skin breakdown occurs or there is localized pain around the site of the negative pressure, topical emollient therapy can be used, or an alternative non-adherent dressing can be applied under the transparent adhesive sealant tape to reduce skin tension. If any discoloration or duskiness of the wound bed or wound edges are identified, then suction should initially be reduced. If this persists or worsens, then the device should be switched off.

It is also important to remain vigilant for dehydration secondary to extracellular fluid loss through the NPWT suction drain. Intravenous maintenance fluid should be considered to mitigate this risk.
