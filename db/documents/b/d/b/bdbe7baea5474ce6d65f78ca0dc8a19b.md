# Introduction

Hyperparathyroidism is a condition mainly due to adenomas of the parathyroid that are overactive. Most cases of hyperparathyroidism go unnoticed because they are clinically silent. When symptomatic, the patient usually requires a referral to an otolaryngologist that will decide if surgery or medical intervention would better benefit the patient. If surgery is the option chosen, the patient will undergo imaging and a parathyroidectomy. Imaging is used to locate the parathyroid glands since these structures are notorious for being ectopically placed along a median line. If the clinical signs of hyperparathyroidism continue post-operatively, these serve as clues to the head and neck surgeon that there may be remaining tissue in the parathyroid, a parathyroid ectopically placed, or supernumerary parathyroids. Positive labs for continued primary hyperparathyroidism include hypercalcemia and high levels of PTH.

# Structure and Function

The parathyroid glands are typically located posterior to the thyroid glands, but anterior relative to the rest of the neck. These glands primarily function as the regulators of calcium homeostasis. If there is normal anatomy, the inferior parathyroid glands are located at the lower poles of the thyroid gland, while the superior parathyroid glands are present near the upper poles.

# Embryology

The upper parathyroid glands descend from the fourth pharyngeal pouch within the thyroid, while the lower parathyroid glands travel with the thymus in the third pharyngeal pouch.

# Blood Supply and Lymphatics

Inferior parathyroid adenomas are hypervascular and receive most of their blood supply from inferior thyroidal artery branches, while superior parathyroid adenomas receive their blood supply from the superior or inferior thyroidal artery branches. The ectopic parathyroid glands located in the mediastinum receive their vascular supply from the internal thoracic artery, specifically the thymic branch.

# Nerves

Recurrent laryngeal nerve injuries are the most feared complication of parathyroid and thyroid operations due to the subsequent rise in postoperative morbidity. Some other symptoms of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury include vocal cord paresis or palsy, dyspnea, and deglutition.

# Muscles

In some rare cases, ectopic parathyroid adenomas are present in the sternohyoid muscles.

# Physiologic Variants

Another identified cause of primary hyperparathyroidism is an autosomal dominant condition known as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). The usual treatment of MEN1 in the context of primary hyperparathyroidism is surgical removal, but this is complicated when the parathyroid gland is ectopic. Ectopic parathyroid glands are more common in MEN1 patients than sporadically hyper-parathyroid patients.

# Surgical Considerations

The upper parathyroid glands are found above the inferior thyroid artery, at the cervical level of the cricoid cartilage, and posterolaterally to the recurrent laryngeal nerve.

# Clinical Significance

Today, the majority of ectopic parathyroid glands are relatively silent without clinical manifestations. Because of this, surgery is not usually a recommendation unless the patient has symptoms. Guidelines for surgery include adjusted calcium over 0.25 mmol/L above the reference range, urine calcium greater than 10 mmol/ 24 hours, more than 30% reduction in creatinine clearance, less than -2.5 bone density T-score, and being less than 50 years old. Active ectopic parathyroid gland complications include namely hypercalcemia, which results in an increased fracture rate (more commonly in females), kidney stone disease, hypertension, cardiac valve calcification, and neurological symptoms (such as weakness, anxiety, and depression). For those patients that do not meet surgery guidelines, medications can be used and include hormone replacement therapy (specifically in post-menopausal women to decrease fracture rates) and calcimimetics that inhibit the release of PTH by binding to calcium receptors and dominating the negative feedback loop.

# Other Issues

Usual imaging for parathyroid glands includes ultrasound and CT. Ectopic parathyroid glands are not readily visible with ultrasound, so technetium-sestamibi CT scanning may be a diagnostic option which has high sensitivity and specificity for parathyroid adenomas.

Ectopic parathyroid management requires close collaboration with an interdisciplinary team that includes the family physician, specialists, nursing staff, and pharmacists; this interprofessional team approach best leads to optimal patient management and clinical results. [Level V]
