Landau-Kleffner syndrome patients develop less frequent seizures, and severe regression of language development(auditory agnosia) rather than more global regression noted with ESES. EEG pattern in Landau-Kleffner syndrome is typically unilateral or lateralized.

Children with benign pediatric focal epileptic syndromes- benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes and late-onset childhood occipital epilepsy (Gastaut type)- can present with relatively easy to control seizures and milder neuropsychological deficits. EEG of these patients shows potentiation of the epileptiform activities during sleep but much less prominent compared with near-continuous spike-wave abnormalities of ESES.

During acute stages of ESES, children may experience intractable atonic and absence seizures, closely mimicking Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. However, contrary to LGS, these patients do not have tonic seizures.
