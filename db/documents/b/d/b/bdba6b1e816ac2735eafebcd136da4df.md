All patients should have a comprehensive cardiac history and physical examination. An electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac imaging to identify left ventricular hypertrophy should be performed in all patients.

- ECG: the most sensitive diagnostic test. Findings include localized or widespread repolarization changes, prominentÂ Q waves in the inferior (II, III, and aVF) and lateral leads (I, aVL, and V4-V6), left atrial or biatrial enlargement, left axis deviation, deeply inverted T waves. The combination of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with right atrial enlargement is strongly suggestive of HCM.

- Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE): Demonstrates cardiac morphology, systolic and diastolic function, the presence and severity of any LVOT gradient, and the degree of mitral regurgitation.

- Ambulatory ECG monitoring: Should be performed for 24 to 48 hours in all patients diagnosed with HCM for risk assessment of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death.

- Exercise stress testing: For risk stratification and assessment of LV outflow tract (LVOT) gradient. Exercise stress is the preferred method.

Some patients may also require the following:

- Cardiac catheterization: Determines cardiac hemodynamic, the degree of left ventricular outflow obstruction, and anatomy of the coronary vessels.

- Electrophysiological studies: Determine the origin of the arrhythmias.
