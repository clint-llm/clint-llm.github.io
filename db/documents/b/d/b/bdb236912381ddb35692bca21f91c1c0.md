There are two contraindications for HSG: pregnancy and an active pelvic infection. Ideally, performing HSG during the early follicular phase is an effective measure to avoid this issue. Additionally, the endometrial lining is thin, and this can aid image interpretation.

Additionally, a contraindication to the procedure can be associated with the media contrast used. Allergies to iodine need to be addressed with the patient. Furthermore, if the patient has a history of thyroid disease, the procedure should be discussed with her endocrinologist. Using iodine can lead to a Wolff-Chaikoff effect (presumed reduction in thyroid hormone levels) or exacerbate thyrotoxicosis in patients with a known history of Grave’s disease.

A history of pelvic inflammatory disease is not a direct contraindication for a hysterosalpingogram. Postprocedure infection may occur in 1.4% to 3.4% of cases. Antibiotics may reduce this risk. If dilated fallopian tubes are discovered during the procedure (risk of up to 11%), an appropriate antibiotic such as doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for five days is commonly recommended in this setting.

Patients with a history of pelvic infection can also be started on doxycycline before the procedure and continued if dilated fallopian tubes are noted. Otherwise, in patients with no history of pelvic infection and without evidence of dilated fallopian tubes, antibiotics are not required, per ACOG Practice Bulletin 131.
