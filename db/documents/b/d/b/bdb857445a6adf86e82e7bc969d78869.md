Patients with pes anserine bursitis may be seen in all practice settings, from outpatient offices, urgent care centers, and emergency departments. Referral to a specialist is not often necessary unless the patient has another underlying condition that may be causing this syndrome or if there is unrelenting discomfort despite supportive measures.

Most data on diagnosis and treatment of pes anserine is derived from case series, relying heavily on expert opinions for direction and care goals. An interprofessional team approach involving clinicians, nurses, and physical therapists, all working collaboratively and engaging in open communication, will result in the best outcomes. [LevelÂ 5]
