Pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland is not a common lesion. However, the majority of patients present to the primary care provider with complaints of a painless mass on the side of the face. Thus, primary care providers and nurse practitioners should have some idea about the differential diagnosis of such lesions and make appropriate referrals. The ideal treatment for pleomorphic adenomas is surgical excision. Even though the lesion is benign, there is a reported recurrence rate of 7-15%. All patients who undergo excision of this lesion need to be informed about the potential for facial nerve injury, which can occur if the tumor is in close proximity of the nerve. If the facial nerve is injured, the patient must be taught an eye care program and how to use lubricating drops to prevent keratopathy. A referral to an ophthalmologist is highly recommended. Depending on the severity of nerve injury, it may take months or years to fully recover eyelid function.
