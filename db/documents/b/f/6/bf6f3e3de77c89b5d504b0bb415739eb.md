**(Note: Specific contraindications as yet remain undetermined)**

**Pregnancy and Lactation**

Fab products have been designated pregnancy category C by the FDA. This rating indicates that it should be used with caution and only if the benefit justifies the risks imposed on the fetus. It is not known if fab products can cause harm to the fetus or affect future reproductive ability. Due to a lack of human and animal studies, no clear data on their safety exists. Therefore, digoxin immune fab should only be administered in pregnancy only if needed.

**Nursing Mothers**

Although not a contraindication, its excretion into milk is unknown, many studies have revealed that drugs are actively secretable into milk. Caution is necessary when administering a nursing mother digoxin immune fab. However, the risk appears to be small because the immune fab fragments in ingested milk would undergo digestion in the infant's stomach. However, risk in infants cannot be ruled out.

**Ovine Protein Hypersensitivity**

Digoxin immune fab is a sheep-derived protein. The immunoglobulin fractions are isolated from the serum of immunized sheep. In certain individuals, animal antibodies facilitate the formation of immune complexes. The adverse events include anaphylaxis, delayed allergic reactions, and a possible febrile response. Prior exposure/therapy with ovine fab is another potential risk factor for developing acute allergic reactions related to Fab product administration. The Fab product is devoid of the antigenic determining Fc portion, and this feature makes it less immunogenic and, therefore, less capable of mounting a fatal immune response. Due to its monovalence, it is also unlikely to form extended antigen-antibody immune complexes.

**Hypersensitivity to Papaya Extracts and Bromelain**

Clinicians should not administer digoxin immune fab to patients with allergies to papain, chymopapain, and bromelain. Papain targets the isolated immunoglobulin fractions and cleaves them into Fab and Fc fragments. Trace amounts of activated or inactivated papain may still be present in the final product. Other allergens such as dust mite and latex have a certain homology to antigenic structures in papain.Â Such cases may also carry a risk of being allergic to papain.
