In randomized controlled trials, there are two treatment options currently considered the standard of care in Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). These include either intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or plasma exchange. IVIG is thought to act by its immune-modulating action; however, the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. IVIG is given 2 grams/kilogram divided over 5 days. [Evidence level 1]

Overall, most patients with GBS do well, with up to 85% of patients achieving independent ambulation with recovery; however, there is a significant proportion of patients (20%) with morbidity. [Evidence level 3] Further studies of plasma exchange followed by IVIG and IVIG concurrent with steroids have not shown significant improvement. [Evidence level 1]
