Complications of Poland syndrome patients are not commonly heard of as most patients are asymptomatic. The young children who present with few musculoskeletal dysfunctions are corrected at such an early age that they are usually not considered a true complication.

Surgical treatment options for Poland syndrome come with their own expected surgical complications. Autologous fat transfer can sometimes postoperatively get complicated with fat necrosis that can get corrected after surgical drainage. Another long-term complication from fat grafting is liponecrotic cysts formation, which has benign characteristics on breast imaging.
