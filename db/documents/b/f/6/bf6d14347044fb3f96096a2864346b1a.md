Patients with classic clinical manifestations of MEN2 are evaluated for two main reasons:

- To screen for other associated common tumors to decrease overall morbidity and mortality

- To screen for genetic mutation so that other family members should be tested and provided adequate prophylactic medical and surgical care such as prophylactic thyroidectomy

As the most common presentation of both MEN2A and MEN2B is MTC, any patient presenting with a cold, solitary nodule and cervical lymphadenopathy must be evaluated further for the possibility of MTC. The clinical presentation of sporadic MTC is the same as genetic MTC except the latter appears early in life. For this reason, the patient should be biopsied by fine-needle aspiration (FNA) to identify MTC and genotyping should be done for underlying potential RET mutations in the patient as well as first-degree family members.

In an asymptomatic patient identified with high serum calcitonin level or genetic testing (tested for positive family history), MTC is often identified in a preneoplastic state such as neoplastic C-cell hyperplasia. The presence of C-cell hyperplasia is defined based upon microscopy criteria: an increased number of diffusely scattered C-cells (greater than or equal to 7 per thyroid follicle), distribution of C-cells beyond the normal anatomical location, or the follicles completely surrounded by C-cells. Neoplastic C-cell hyperplasia is differentiated from reactive or secondary C-cell hyperplasia as the nests of C cells appear to extend beyond the basement membrane to infiltrate and destroy thyroid follicles.

It is less likely for pheochromocytoma to precede MTC in MEN2. Any patient with the diagnosed pheochromocytoma must be evaluated further for associated tumors by appropriate biochemical and radiological screening and RET genotyping.

The presence of primary hyperthyroidism alone does not indicate for further testing as their is less than 20% association with MEN2A and no association with MEN2B.

**Genetic Testing**

The genetic testing for RET proto-oncogene is employed to diagnose and identify a specific type of mutation present in an index patient ( the first affected member of the family) such as high-risk, moderate-risk or low-risk mutations. The type of mutations not only determine the expressivity and penetrance of the disease but also spares the effort to test for all the possible mutations in all the family members and determine when to start the screening process for associated tumors and when to do the prophylactic surgery.

For an index patient with suspected MEN2A, evaluation begins with testing for the most common mutated codons in exons 10 and 11, and if negative, we move on to look for other common mutations in descending order. The risk of MTC is low if no germline mutation is found. In this case, sequencing the entire RET coding region to identify a RET mutation is an option.

The same is done for the index patient with MEN2B phenotype. The patient is initially tested for common mutations like a mutation in RET codon M918T in exon 16, and if negative, for the A883F mutation in exon 15. These two mutations are responsible for more than 95% of cases of MEN 2B. If no mutations are identified, the entire RET coding region should be sequenced.

Although, it is rare that patients with classic MEN2A and MEN2B phenotype have no identifiable RET mutation, the presence of at least two of the classical features of MEN2A (MTC, pheochromocytoma, primary hyperparathyroidism) or the presence of  majority of clinical features of MEN2B (MTC, pheochromocytoma, mucosal neuromas, Marfanoid habitus, intestinal ganglioneuromas, myelinated corneal nerves) are enough to make a clinical diagnosis.

Other cases in which genetic testing can be considered:

- First-degree relatives of a patient with proven germline RET mutation

- Parents whose infants or young children have the clinical characteristics of MEN 2B

- Patients with CLA

- Families whose infants or young children have Hirschsprung disease

Only a small blood sample is required for RET genotyping; therefore, it can be performed at or soon after birth. At the latest, genotyping should be done before time so that prophylactic thyroidectomy could be performed in the event of a positive result.

**Biochemical and Radiological Testing**

Once the RET genotyping is positive in index patients or an asymptomatic patient with positive family history, biochemical and radiological screening for other tumors is started as described below.

**Medullary Thyroid Cancer**

Children with certain RET mutations can develop clinically apparent MTC at an early age. The goal for screening in patients with known RET mutations but without clinically apparent disease is to perform a prophylactic thyroidectomy before MTC develops or when it is still confined to the thyroid gland.

For children tested positive for high-risk mutations, monitoring starts at three years of age, and for children with moderate risk mutations, monitoring starts at five years of age. Testing includes the following:

- An annual physical examination

- Neck ultrasound

- Serum calcitonin concentration

Serum calcitonin concentration correlates with the size of the tumor but those with small tumors or neoplastic C-cell hyperplasia, serum calcitonin levels may be normal, and specific stimulation tests like calcium or pentagastrin infusion can be used to confirm the diagnosis. The detection of a serum calcitonin level (basal or stimulated) above the upper limit of normal is an indication for surgery.

**Pheochromocytoma**

The risk of developing pheochromocytoma is also variable depending upon genotype. Due to screening programs, pheochromocytomas may be diagnosed at a young age and before symptoms are present.

For children in the high-risk categories, annual screening for pheochromocytoma should begin by age 11 years. For children in the moderate-risk category, annual screening starts at 16 years of age. Screening tests include plasma fractionated metanephrines or 24-hour urinary metanephrines and normetanephrine. If biochemical results are positive, the next step is adrenal imaging with CT or MRI. If initial imaging is unable to identify the unilateral versus bilateral disease, adrenal venous sampling can be done.

**Hyperparathyroidism**

Hyperparathyroidism (only associated with MEN2A) is often mild and asymptomatic. The mean age at diagnosis was 33 years according to one study. Annual biochemical screening starts at the age of 11 years for high-risk patients and by the age of 16 for moderate risk patients. The test of choice for screening is serum calcium corrected for albumin levels. If elevated, serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) is measured, and the diagnosis is established with high or inappropriately high levels of serum PTH in the presence of hypercalcemia.
