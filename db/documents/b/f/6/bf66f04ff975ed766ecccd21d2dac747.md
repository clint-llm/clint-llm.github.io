There are recent updates to the current management of opioid withdrawal syndrome. In May 2018, the FDA approved lofexidine hydrochloride, the first non-opioid for managing opioid withdrawal syndrome. It received FDA approval in 2018. Lofexidine hydrochloride is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist indicated for the acute discontinuation of opioids. It works by binding to receptors on adrenergic neurons, which reduces and sympathetic tone and decreases norepinephrine release (NE).

Currently, there are many ongoing trials in preclinical and clinical stages to understand better and manage opioid addiction and withdrawal syndromes. In the preclinical stages, there is a possibility of developing a vaccine against opioid addiction, which can block opioid effects and could provide a better alternative to currently available treatment options. There are also many other active studies evaluating various other pharmacological targets to manage opioid withdrawal syndrome better.
