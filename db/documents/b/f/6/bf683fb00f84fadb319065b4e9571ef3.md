Differential diagnoses to consider include:

- Exotropia (XT): Exotropia is a form of strabismus in which either eye misaligns outward. Tropias, including XT, are clinically diagnosed by performing a unilateral cover (or cover-uncover) test, whereas phorias are determined using the alternating cover (or cross cover) test. During a unilateral cover test, the examiner covers one of the patient's eyes while observing the uncovered eye. A deviation of the uncovered eye indicates a tropia. The movement will be inward in the case of exotropia.

- Basic exophoria: When both distance and near are measured as exophoric, the diagnosis is basic exophoria. In the case of CI, the near phoria is greater than the distance.

- Acquired exotropia

- Diplopia

-  Dorsal midbrain syndrome

- Internuclear ophthalmoplegia

- Myasthenia gravis

- Oculomotor nerve palsy

- Thyroid eye disease
