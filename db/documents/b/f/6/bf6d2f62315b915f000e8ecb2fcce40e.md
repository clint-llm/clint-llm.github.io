Complications of interlaminar epidural injections may be related to needle placement, infection, or medications administered. Regarding placement, advancement too far ventrally may result in the dural puncture or spinal cord trauma. Patients may experience a vasovagal reaction, headache, singultus, transient blindness, nausea, vomiting, or dizziness. Infectious complications include epidural abscess, meningitis, or osteomyelitis. Steroid preparations should be non-particulate to avoid complications associated with vascular occlusion, including spinal cord infarction.
