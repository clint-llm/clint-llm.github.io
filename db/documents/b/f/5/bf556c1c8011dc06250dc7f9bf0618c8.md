The dentate nucleus is the most lateral deep cerebellar nucleus and is rich in iron. The cerebellar vermis and roof of the fourth ventricle are adjacent to the dentate nucleus. A sagittal section through the dentate nucleus shows its serrated appearance.

The dentate nucleus regulates fine-control of voluntary movements, cognition, language, and sensory functions.

The dentate nucleus has two parts

- The dorsal (motor) domain: This has connections with cortical motor areas regulating motor functions

- The ventral (non-motor) domain: This has links with the cortical association areas controlling cognitive functions
