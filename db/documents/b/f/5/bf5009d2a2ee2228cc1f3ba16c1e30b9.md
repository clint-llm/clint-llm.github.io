In otherwise healthy individuals, LBBB does not confer any specific or additional risk.  Mortality hazard ratio (HR) for LBBB is only 1.3 of normal. However, in patients with new onset, LBBB mortality HR is greater than 10-times normal.

Patients with LBBB are restricted from piloting aircraft in both the United States and the United Kingdom. This is due to LBBB being a possible pre-cursor to complete atrioventricular block. Such association is supported by epidemiologic data and patients presenting with syncope or pre-syncope in the setting of LBBB should undergo testing with ECG and Holter monitor.
