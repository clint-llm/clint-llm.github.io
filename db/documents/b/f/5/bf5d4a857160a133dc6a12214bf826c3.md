Biofeedback is a technique to augment the normal sensory feedback and allow better control of body functions that are usually considered involuntary. The general mechanism starts by measuring a body parameter, either physiologic or biomechanical, which then gets transformed into a visual, auditory, or haptic signal. The individual learns to change the signal by controlling the body parameter. Positive feedback changes embed the actions into memory, allowing for an increased degree of control over a previously involuntary function. This activity outlines the method behind biofeedback techniques and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients who undergo biofeedback training.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the basic components of the biofeedback system and give useful examples for each component.
- Describe conditions where biofeedback may be a beneficial addition to treatment.
- Review the limitations of current evidence about biofeedback.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients receiving biofeedback.
