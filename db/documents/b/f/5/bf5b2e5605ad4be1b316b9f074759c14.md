Definitive diagnosis is based in the culture, where one must demonstrate the dimorphism of the fungus. Diagnosis of cutaneous sporotrichosis can be made through direct examination of the specimen such as tissue biopsy or pus from lesions, while sputum culture aids in diagnosing pulmonary sporotrichosis. Diagnosis of disseminated sporotrichosis can be made from urine, blood, and synovial fluid analysis. Observation of yeast cells with potassium hydroxide might show the characteristic cigar-shaped buds or asteroid bodies. Other methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing, antibody detection, and the sporotrichin skin test have been employed with no strong standardization in testing.
