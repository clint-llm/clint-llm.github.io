The etiologic factors leading to sinus node dysfunction can be classified into two categories: intrinsic pathology to the sinus node itself, typically results from fibrosis of the nodal tissue and external causes that affect the SA node function.

While the most common intrinsic factor leading to sinus node dysfunction is age-related degeneration of the SA node

Several external causes that can affect the pacing function of the SA node. These can occur in conditions where there is abnormally increased vagal tone such as carotid sinus hypersensitivity, vasovagal syncope, and autonomic dysfunction. Furthermore, metabolic derangements such as hypothyroidism, hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypoxia, and hypothermia can lead to depression of the pacing function of the SA node. Obstructive sleep apnea may cause bradycardia by profound hypoxia during episodes of apnea. Increased intracranial pressure (Cushing’s reflex) also causes bradycardia. Several pharmacologic and toxic substances can produce a similar effect on the SA node; these include class I to IV antiarrhythmic medications, digoxin, lithium and sympatholytic medications.
