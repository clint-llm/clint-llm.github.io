The differential diagnoses include:

- Trauma - The UGH syndrome might be confused with blunt trauma to the eye in patients with hyphema and anterior segment inflammation. History is important to distinguish between the two.

- Inflammatory glaucomas- Rubeosis iridis may be present. A history of surgery may or may not be there.

- Hyphematous conditions - Vascular abnormalities, iris tufts, varices causing bleed may be confused with UGH syndrome. Herpes zoster and herpes simplex uveitis may be associated with hyphema.

- Retinal vascular occlusions (especially central retinal venous occlusion) should be ruled out in cases with iris new vessels and neovascular glaucoma.

- Coagulation disorders and sickle cell disease should be excluded in cases with UGH syndrome.

- Uveitis - Usually, uveitis can be controlled well by using corticosteroids and cycloplegics. In inflammation due to UGH syndrome, patients' signs and symptoms persist even after using topical corticosteroids and cycloplegics.

- Retinoblastoma - Few cases may present as hyphema in the late stages.

- Chronic postoperative endophthalmitis - It needs to be differentiated as the patient presents with similar complaints. Initially, there is relief in the symptoms using topical or systemic corticosteroids.
