**Epidural Hematoma**

Epidural hematomas are present in approximately 2% of head injury patients and account for 5% to 15% of fatal head injuries. Approximately 85% to 95% of epidural hematomas have an overlying skull fracture.

**Subdural Hematoma**

The incidence of subdural hematoma is estimated to be between 5% to 25% of patients with a significant head injury.  There is an annual incidence of one to five cases per 100,000 population per year with a male to female ratio of 2:1. The incidence of subdural hematomas increases throughout life.

**Subarachnoid Hemorrhage**

Subarachnoid hemorrhage accounts for approximately 5% of all strokes and has an incidence of approximately two to 25 per 100,000 person-years for those over the age of 35. The incidence trends up slowly as patients age and may be very slightly more frequent in females than males (1.15:1 for the female to male ratio).

**Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage**

Intraparenchymal hemorrhage accounts for 10% to 20% of all strokes.  Intraparenchymal hemorrhage incidence increases for those aged 55 and older with an increasing incidence as age increases. There is some controversy regarding gender differences, but there may be a slight male predominance.
