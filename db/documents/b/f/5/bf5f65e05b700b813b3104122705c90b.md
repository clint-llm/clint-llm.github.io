Diagnostic testing to rule out other causes for a patientâ€™s presentation may be necessary as decompression sickness can mimic many possible disease processes. For instance, in the hypoxic patient following a flight, the need to evaluate for other possible cardiac and pulmonary pathology may be warranted or an in a patient with a neurologic presentation, radiographic imaging of the brain may be indicated. The lack of a definitive diagnosis should not delay treatment and oxygen therapy should be immediately applied if decompression sickness.
