Orbital atherectomy (OA) is an adjunctive therapy used for lesion preparation of calcified plaque before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and peripheral percutaneous endovascular interventions. The goal of lesion preparation with OA is to modify calcified plaque, which changes the lesion compliance and allows for the adequate balloon and stent expansion in segments with heavily calcified lesions.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) has a significant impact on overall health and continues to grow in prevalence in the United States. Data from the American Heart Association states that greater than 15.5 million people over age 20 have significant CAD.

CAC is believed to be both gender and age-dependent. The prevalence of CAC in individuals over age 70 has been estimated to be greater than 90% in men and 67% in women.

As CAD prevalence increases, the incidence of CAC follows a similar trend. Previous studies have shown that those patients with severe CAC have more complex and worse outcomes when undergoing percutaneous intervention (PCI) than patients with low CAC.

To help decrease complication rates and improve stent deployment in patients with severe CAC, utilization of OA can be of significant benefit for vessel preparation and stent placement. In this manuscript, we provide a review of OA and the available devices, techniques, indications, complications, contraindications, and clinical trial outcomes based on the most recent data.
