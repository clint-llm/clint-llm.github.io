The treatment of gingival disease and periodontitis involves a graded approach, always beginning with a professional dental cleaning. A critical part of the dental cleaning involves patient education by the dentist on the importance of maintaining healthy oral hygiene and instruction on how to improve their oral hygiene routine effectively. The most important aspect of treating gingival disease is reversing any modifiable risk factors. This intervention includes phase1 of the treatment, followed by phase 4, which is maintenance therapy.

However, in cases that are refractory to non-pharmacological treatment, antibiotics should be considered. Initial antibiotic therapy should begin with topical chlorhexidine gluconate, which is an antimicrobial compound administered as a mouthwash. Treatment with systemic antibiotics is rare and should only be a consideration when other treatment methods fail. Systemic antimicrobial agents approved for use include tetracyclines, penicillins, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, and cephalosporins. Finally, gingival surgery to clean a periodontal pocket or correct gingival recession may be required if there has been significant anatomical disease destruction.
