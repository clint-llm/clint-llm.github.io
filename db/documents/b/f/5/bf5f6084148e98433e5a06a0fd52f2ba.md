A precipitated withdrawal from opiates, whether caused by naloxone in the pre-hospital or emergency department setting or by naloxone or naltrexone during a medically supervised withdrawal treatment, can lead to hospital admission or even require intensive care. There are rare, isolated reports of stress-induced cardiomyopathy and organic delusional disorder.

During a medically supervised withdrawal, often great care is taken in increasing the naltrexone dose gradually over a period of 3-7 days resulting in opiate “washout.” This naltrexone-accelerated withdrawal has high complication rates and almost certainly requires the addition of an alpha-2 agonist (like clonidine and lofexidine, which requires less concern for hypotensive effects.) and comfort medications such as benzodiazepines, antiemetics, and muscle relaxers.
