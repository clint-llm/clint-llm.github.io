The primary treatment goal of rapid eye movement behavior disorder is to reduce the risk of injury to the patient and bed partners. The change in routine sleep habits may prove challenging for the patient and their bed partners. Their risk for injury, however, needs to be emphasized. Patients and sleeping partners should be educated on the following:

- Mitigating fall risk by lowering the bed closer to the floor

- Safe-guarding any firearms, knives, and other weapons

- Cushioning or padding the floor or sharp furniture surfaces.

- Placing patients in restraining clothes or sleeping bags

- Separating the sleeping partner from the patient to reduce the risk of injury

The preferred pharmacological treatment of RBD is melatonin. Melatonin is an endogenous hormone secreted from the pineal gland associated with circadian rhythm, and its secretion is influenced by light exposure. Although the mechanism of action is unclear, 3 to 12 mg of melatonin at bedtime is recommended and appears effective in reducing RBD symptoms.

Clonazepam is an effective treatment for RBD and has been considered for a long time as first-line pharmacological therapy.

Other second-line therapies

Other non-pharmacologic treatments under investigation include Plasma exchange

Treating comorbid obstructive sleep apnea with continuous positive airway pressure may decrease the frequency and severity of RBD symptoms. Medication reconciliation is necessary to identify medications prone to inducing loss of REM atonia. Management should be discussed with ordering providers and the patient that may require discontinuation, reduction of dose, or earlier medication intake.
