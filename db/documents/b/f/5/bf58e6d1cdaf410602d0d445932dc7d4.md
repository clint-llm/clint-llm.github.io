Patients with rheumatic heart disease are best managed by an interprofessional team. Primary care clinicians who have patients with a known diagnosis of rheumatic fever should maintain and stress the importance of strict follow-up with the patients. To prevent rheumatic heart disease, patients should undergo close monitoring with complete history and physicals and transthoracic echocardiography. Patients should be referred to cardiology if they start developing a new murmur, signs, and symptoms of heart failure, arrhythmia, or evidence of valvular disease on transthoracic echocardiography. Surgery is often required when the mitral and/or aortic valve is severely damaged.
