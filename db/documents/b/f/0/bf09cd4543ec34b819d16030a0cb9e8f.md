On initial presentation, pregnancy can be confirmed through beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-HCG) testing of the urine and/or blood. This hormone is comprised of dissimilar alpha and beta subunits that are both required for biological activity.

While both testing types are highly sensitive and specific, the result from a single test should not be used as definitive evidence of pregnancy or lack thereof.

It is important to note that an elevated beta-HCG level is not definitive of a normal or viable pregnancy. Conditions that result in elevated beta-HCG levels must be considered, including ectopic and heterotopic pregnancy; miscarriage; and the presence of abnormal germ cell, placental, and embryonal tissues. Evaluation of pregnancy may include serial beta-HCG titers, pelvic ultrasonography, and culdocentesis, although the latter has fallen out of favor due to poor test characteristics. Approximate doubling of beta-HCG hormone levels in 48 hours is reassuring of a viable pregnancy in the early first trimester.

Consideration should be given to collecting swabs of vaginal fluid in patients reporting vaginal discharge, burning, and or pain. This is especially important in pregnancy as sexually transmitted infections can pose risks to the fetus and complicate pregnancy.
