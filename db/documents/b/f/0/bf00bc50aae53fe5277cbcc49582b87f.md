As part of the induction process, mechanical dilation with a Foley catheter, a double-balloon catheter, or laminaria can be done. A Foley catheter is passed through the external and the internal cervical os. The balloon is then inflated, between 30 milliliters (mL) to 80 mL with normal saline, and the balloon exerts pressure on the internal os to help with cervical dilation.

For cervical ripening with misoprostol, there is a range of doses and routes of administration, such as orally, vaginally, or sublingually. Doses of misoprostol range from 25 micrograms (mcg) to 50 mcg.

Further pharmacological methods include syntocinon, administered intravenously in varying dosing regimens.
