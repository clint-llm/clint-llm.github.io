For non-waived tests, laboratory regulations require, at the minimum, analysis of at least two levels of control materials once every 24 hours.

The laboratory must participate in the external quality control or proficiency testing (PT) program because it is a regulatory requirement published by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) regulations.

Quality assurance procedures should be implemented within the laboratory for the reliable and reproducible performance of troponin assays, particularly at low concentrations, to avoid reporting falsely positive results. In addition to regularly monitoring manufacturers’ quality controls, daily measurement of a negative control sample and a low-level control with a troponin concentration close to the 20% CV level (in-house or manufactured if available) can detect assay drift or deterioration of assay performance.

Consider all specimens, control materials, and calibrator materials as potentially infectious. Exercise the usual precautions required for handling all laboratory reagents. Disposal of all waste material should be in accordance with local guidelines.

The new standard for the highly sensitive cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assay is defined as the ability to detect cTn concentrations precisely with a coefficient of variation, <10 % at or the below the 99th percentile URL and measurable in >50% of normal healthy individuals.
