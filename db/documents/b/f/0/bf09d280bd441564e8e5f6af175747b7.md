The goals of treating any UCL injury are mitigation and eventual relief of pain, avoidance of instability, and prevention of osteoarthritis.

Treatment strategy based on the classification of the injury:

- Type 1: Minimally displaced/partial UCL tears usually heal with immobilization alone

- Type 2: UCL tears that are displaced less than 3 mm can be healed with immobilization alone

- Type 3: UCL tears that are displaced more than 3 mm will usually fail immobilization and most patients with require surgery

- Type 4: Stener lesion will require surgery in all cases

Non-surgical therapy is effective for type 1,2 and some 3 lesions. The thumb is immobilized in thumb spica for 4 weeks.

Chronic UCL injuries are difficult to repair. If the patient has moderate to severe arthritis, arthrodesis of the MCP joint is an option. If arthritis is not present, then ligament reconstruction of tendon advancement are options.
