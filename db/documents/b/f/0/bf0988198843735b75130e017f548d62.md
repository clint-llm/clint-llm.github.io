Patients enter the hospital environment with a variety of risk factors that place them at risk for the development of atelectasis.  Among these risk factors is a history of cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, particularly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disease, kidney failure, cancer, and autoimmune disorders.  In addition, tobacco use, obesity, traumatic injury, advanced age, and recent respiratory illness are also risks.

Incentive spirometry has been a mainstay of nursing postoperative atelectasis prevention.  Recent studies have indicated that incentive spirometry alone may not be sufficient to prevent untoward outcomes in postoperative patients.  Evidence indicates that the use of deep breathing, adequate pain relief, directed cough, and early patient mobilization are also necessary to increase lung volumes
