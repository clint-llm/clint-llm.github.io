Complications of CVID are sometimes the clinical presentation onset of CVID patients. However, early-diagnosed and early-treated patients can develop complications in the future, which could shorten their life expectancy.

The most frequent complications are associated with pulmonary disease. Therefore most patients with respiratory symptoms must be initially evaluated through HRCT.

Pulmonary complications by descending order of frequency are

- Bronchiectasis (approximately 20% of patients)

- Bronchospasm

- Obstructive and restrictive pulmonary disease

- Granulomas

The overall risk for developing cancer is estimated to range from 4% to 25%, and estimates of the incidence of malignancy are at around 10%, with a higher risk in adult-diagnosed CVID.

- Non-Hodgkin lymphoma: mostly with an extranodal origin (patients could have a lifetime risk of possibly 2% to 8%), and more likely in females over 30 years.

- Gastric carcinoma: associated with Helicobacter pylori infection and gastritis (incidence of less than 1%). Diagnosed in individuals younger than the overall gastric cancer population. Generally, it consists of a moderately to poorly differentiated intestinal-type adenocarcinoma with a high count of intra-tumoral lymphocytes.
