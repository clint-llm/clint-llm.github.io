Patients with vision changes typically have their first encounter with the nurse practitioner, general physician, pediatrician or internist. In each case, it is essential to refer the patient to an ophthalmologist for definitive work up. The role of the primary care providers is to emphasize to the patient the need to stop smoking, maintain healthy body weight, eat a healthy diet and wear sunglasses when going out.

Retinopathy, irrepsective of its underlying cause, is best managed by an interprofessional team combining physicians (both GP and ophthalmologist), and specilaty trained ophthlmology nursing, communicating with the patient and other health team members to bring about optimal patient care and results.
