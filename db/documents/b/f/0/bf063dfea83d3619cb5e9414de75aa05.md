Didanosine contraindications include concomitant use with the following drugs:

**Ribavirin**

- This contraindication is due to increased mitochondrial toxicity observed in patients with co-administration of didanosine and treatment of ribavirin, which led to severe metabolic acidosis syndrome.

**Stavudine**

- Didanosine co-administration has shown correlations with hepatoxicity, metabolic acidosis, and peripheral neuropathy.

**Allopurinol**

- Co-administration increased systemic exposure to didanosine by up to 300%.

Didanosine is also contraindicated in pregnancy as use has shown correlations with the development of transplacental oncogenicity in children exposed to the drug in-utero.
