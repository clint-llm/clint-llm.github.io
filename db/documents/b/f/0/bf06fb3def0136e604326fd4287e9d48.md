Cystic fibrosis is a progressive autosomal recessive disorder that involves multiple organ systems. To develop cystic fibrosis, a child must inherit one copy of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene mutation from each parent. Caucasians have a higher risk of carrying a mutation of the CFTR gene. The life expectancy of individuals with cystic fibrosis has dramatically improved in the last decade and continues to increase with improved treatment protocols. CFLD (cystic fibrosis-associated liver disease) is now the third leading cause of death, only behind pulmonary and transplant-related complications. Cystic fibrosis-associated liver disease accounts for 5% of deaths in patients with CF. Risk factors for the development of CFD include male sex, meconium ileus, and severe phenotype CF. Until recently, most patients with CFLD presented in childhood; however, recent studies show the second wave of this chronic liver disease become evident in adulthood, the etiology of which remains unclear. Currently, there is no consensus methodology for the diagnosis of CFLD, particularly given its variable presentation and patchy nature of the disease. Annual screening for CFLD is recommended for early identification to help prevent or delay its complications to reduce morbidity and mortality. Early identification of progressive CFLD allows monitoring for portal hypertension and prompt management of its complications. LT should be considered in patients with progressive hepatic failure characterized by portal hypertension-related complications, progressive hypoalbuminemia and coagulopathy, severe malnutrition, worsening pulmonary function, and declining quality of life.
