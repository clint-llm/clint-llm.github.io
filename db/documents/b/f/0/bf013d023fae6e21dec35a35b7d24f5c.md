Bivalirudin is an inhibitor of thrombin, an essential factor within the coagulation cascade crucial to thrombus formation. Thrombin serves to cleave fibrinogen into fibrin. Subsequently, fibrin monomers then covert factor XIII to factor XIIIa, allowing for stabilization of the thrombus. Additionally, fibrin activates factor V and factor VIII, further promoting thrombin and platelet activation.

Bivalirudin specifically inhibits thrombin by binding both to the catalytic site and the anion-binding exosite on thrombin within thrombi and the circulation. This action is in contrast to glycosaminoglycans anticoagulants—such medications, including unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin. Heparins' action is to indirectly inhibit thrombin by serving as an enzyme that catalyzes anti-thrombin, a serine protease inhibitor that forms a covalent bond with thrombin.
