An underlying disease or surgical event usually causes intestinal fistula formation.

**Surgical Procedure**

Surgical complication is the most common cause of intestinal fistula formation.

**Diverticular Disease**

Complex diverticular disease is a common cause of fistula connecting to an intra-abdominal organ like the bladder.

**Crohn's Disease
**

Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, especially Crohn's disease, are a well-known cause of intestinal fistulization.

**Malignancy
**

Cancer of intestine or adjacent organs is a known cause of fistulization to and from the intestine.

**Radiation**

Radiation causes long-term chronic inflammation with poor healing and repair processes.

**Non-Surgical Injuries and Foreign Bodies
**

Injuries in trauma or by a foreign body can result in non-healing abnormal connection with the intestine.

There is a number of causes that are abbreviated in the mnemonic "FRIENDS" (foreign body, radiation, inflammation, epithelization, neoplasm, distal obstruction, short fistula). These are known causes of non-healing fistula. Epithelization of the fistula lining prevent its healing, but does not by itself create a fistula. Similarly distal (to the fistula site) intestinal obstruction or short fistula. Failure of an intestinal fistula to heal after appropriate treatment raises the suspicion for these causes and mandates further investigation.
