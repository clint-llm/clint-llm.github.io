TM perforations have multiple origins such as a complication of infection (acute otitis media or otitis externa secondary to Aspergillus niger), barotrauma from explosions, scuba diving, or air travel, sudden negative pressure, head trauma, noise trauma, insertion of objects into the ear, or iatrogenic from attempting foreign body or cerumen removal. With acute otitis media (AOM), the risk of spontaneous perforation increases with recurrent episodes of AOM and AOM caused by non-typeable Hemophilus influenzae.
