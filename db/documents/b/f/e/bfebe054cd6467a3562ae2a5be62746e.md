A skin biopsy usually has no contraindications. If there is an allergy to local anesthetics, infection, or tattoo that may lead to challenges, the clinician should take appropriate precautions.

The pre-biopsy evaluation includes a review of bleeding disorders, anticoagulative medication use, and bleeding history. Such factors do not usually preclude skin biopsy.
