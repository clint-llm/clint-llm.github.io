A below-knee amputation (BKA), or below-the-knee amputation, is a transtibial amputation that involves removing the foot, ankle joint, distal tibia, fibula, and corresponding soft tissue structures. Lower extremity amputation serves as a life-saving procedure. Lower limb ischemia, peripheral arterial disease, and diabetes are considered the major causality of limb amputations in more than 50% of cases. Trauma is the next leading cause of lower-extremity amputations. In general, below-knee amputations are associated with better functional outcomes than above-knee amputations. This activity describes the indications and techniques for performing below-knee amputations and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the preoperative and postoperative management of the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for below-knee amputation.
- Implement guideline-concordant postoperative care for a patient who has undergone a below-knee amputation.
- Apply best practices to reduce the complications associated with below-knee amputations.
- Collaborate with the interprofessional team to facilitate safe outcomes for patients requiring below-knee amputations.
