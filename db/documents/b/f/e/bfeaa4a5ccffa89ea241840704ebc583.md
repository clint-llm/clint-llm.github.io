**Peripheral Arterial Disease**

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality.

Though using the ABI to screen for PAD could be helpful, assessment of the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial artery pulses during the vascular physical exam may prove more efficient. One study found that in patients with the presence of both pedal pulses and the absence of femoral bruits on physical exam, the specificity of predicting a normal ABI (above 0.9) was 98.3%.

ABI = Dorsalis Pedis or Posterior Tibial Systolic Pressure/Brachial Systolic Pressure

**Physical Exam: Pedal Pulse Assessment**

During the physical exam, pulse palpation of the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries is important for evaluating peripheral arterial disease (as mentioned above).
