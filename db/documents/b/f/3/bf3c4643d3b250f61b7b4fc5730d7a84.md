As per the manufacturer's labeling, patients on chronic nitrofurantoin should be monitored regularly for changes in renal function due to the increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. It is also essential to closely observe the pulmonary function of patients on long-term nitrofurantoin therapy. Also, clinicians should periodically obtain liver function tests as hepatotoxicity may be asymptomatic in some cases.
