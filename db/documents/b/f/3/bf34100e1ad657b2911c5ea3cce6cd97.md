The gold standard for diagnosing giant cell arteritis is a temporal artery biopsy. Due to a relatively low negative predictive value, however, a negative biopsy result does not definitively rule out the diagnosis. Currently, patients are considered to have the diagnosis of temporal arteritis if three of the following five clinical features are present:

- Age ≥50 years at the onset of symptoms

- New headache

- Temporal artery abnormalities, such as tenderness of the superficial artery or decreased palpability of its pulse

- ESR ≥50 mm/hr

- Abnormal TAB, demonstrating vasculitis, a predominance of mononuclear cell infiltration or granulomatous inflammation, or multinucleated giant cells
