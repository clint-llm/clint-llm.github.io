Fetuses of pregnant rats had embryo-fetal toxicity and cardiac teratogenic effects when treated at exposures 1 to 3 times the human exposures at the maximum recommended human dose. No adequate studies of ivabradine in pregnant women provide information on the drug's possible risk to the mother or fetus. Contraception is recommended in female patients taking ivabradine.
