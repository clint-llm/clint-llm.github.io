IgE mediated sensitization is responsible for the pathogenesis of dust mite allergy. This a Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction in which the CD4 + and T helper cells stimulate the B cells to produce IgE antibodies specific to the antigen, which is the house dust mite allergen. The IgE binds onto the FceRI receptors on mast cells and blood basophil cells. The mast cells and basophil cells now get sensitized to the allergen-specific IgE antibodies. On subsequent exposure to the same allergens, there is crosslinking of the bound IgE sensitized cells, leading to their degranulation. The inflammatory mediators are released, causing the clinical manifestation of the dust mite allergy. Sensitizations to the dust mite allergens occur quite early in life and lead to a progression from allergic rhinitis to asthma. This is known as the allergic march.

When the house dust mite fecal pellets are inhaled, they contact the airway epithelium and become hydrated and discharge their allergenic contents onto a mucosal barrier. For interaction with dendritic antigen-presenting cells, potential allergens must cross this protective epithelium. The tight junctions are the route for their entry. The allergens, predominantly, Der p 1 disrupt these tight junctions by either of the following two processes:

- Proteolytic cleavage of protease-sensitive receptors on the epithelial barrier of respiratory epithelium cells, leading to access of allergens to the antigen-presenting cells, mainly the dendritic cells. The dendritic cells give these allergens to the T helper-2 cells, which respond by the release of cytokines, mainly granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-5 (IL-5), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) that attract the inflammatory cells to the airway. The T helper 2 cells activate the B cells to produce IgE, which are produced in large numbers in subsequent allergen exposure. When the individual is exposed to house dust mite allergen again, the allergens bind to the IgE, and the IgE binds to the mast cells and basophils, causing their degranulation and causes the release of histamine and leukotrienes, from bronchial epithelial cells, mast cells, and basophils. The proteases also lead to changes in the concentration of intracellular calcium and increased expression of Interleukin-6 mRNA.

- Activation of transduction signaling pathways that lead to the release of chemokines.

Two major groups of allergens from mites of the genus Dermatophagoides have been identified.

- Group I. These allergens are glycoproteins that demonstrate both structural homology and cross-reactivity. An example of this group of allergen is Der p 1.

- Group II. These show a closer homology and cross-reactivity.

The common house dust mites and their allergens are listed as follows:

- Der p 1, house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus allergens

- Der p 2, house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus allergens

- Der p 23, house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus allergens

- Der f 1, house dust mite Dermatophagoides farinae allergens

- Der f 2, house dust mite Dermatophagoides farinae allergens

Der p 1, being the major cause of dust mite allergy, is responsible for triggering the IgE binding levels of 80 to 90 percent. It targets CD23 and CD25, which cleaves these receptors from the surface of the active B and T cells, respectively, triggering the further release of IgE.

Asthma usually develops as a result of combined environmental and genetic factors. Dust mite allergy leads to the development of atopic asthma, which is a predisposition to the development of hypersensitivity Type 1 reactions.

House dust mite allergy plays a role in the development or exacerbation of atopic dermatitis. The house dust mite allergens activate the pattern activation receptors that include toll-like receptor 1, toll-like receptor 6, and toll-like receptor 9 and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2. This leads to a release of innate proallergic cytokines, namely interleukin-25 and interleukin-33, in epidermal keratinocytes, causing the activation of the innate immune system in the keratinocytes.
