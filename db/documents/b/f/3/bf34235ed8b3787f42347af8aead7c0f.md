Allergic interstitial nephritis can be definitively diagnosed by renal biopsy. Light microscopic evaluation typically reveals interstitial infiltrates with T-lymphocytes and monocytes, and possibly eosinophils, neutrophils, and plasma cells. Tubulitis, with inflammatory infiltration of the tubular basement membrane, often is noted. Prolonged exposure to an offending drug may result in interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, which portends a worse prognosis.
