Cadmium blood concentrations have limited use other than for confirmation in acute exposure: history, physical exam, and symptoms guide diagnosis.  In chronic exposure, urinary cadmium is the test of choice to determine total body cadmium burden.  Anyone at high risk for chronic cadmium exposure should have routine urinary protein testing (beta-2-microglobulin).
