Finger dislocation evaluation, management, and treatment are complex. Orthopedic and hand surgeon consultation and close follow-up are critical to decreasing the likelihood of the many complications associated with this injury. Since finger dislocation most commonly occurs in athletes, the discussion for return to play is also complex and requires communication between the orthopedic specialist, hand surgeon, and player. An orthopedic nurse can assist in the care, answer patient questions, assist during any procedural interventions, serve as a bridge between therapists and the clinician, and monitor progress toward healing. Physical and/or occupational therapy may be in order, with the therapist providing and charting updates, so the entire team is aware of the current patient status. Specialists and nurses collaborating as an interprofessional team can enhance outcomes in diagnosing and managing finger dislocations. [Level 5]
