Fructose promotes the uptake and storage of glucose in the liver. Fructose also helps to speed up the oxidation of carbohydrate stores after a meal.

Fructose provides the majority of the energy required for the mobility of spermatozoa. Seminal vesicles are responsible for the secretion of fructose. However, some people experience azoospermia as a result of a blockage in the duct of seminal vesicles. In such individuals, semen analyzes for fructose concentration. Depending on whether fructose is present, the block will be above the seminal vesicular duct, and if it is absent, the block will be below the seminal vesicles.

Fructose may play a vital role in the maturation of preadipocytes, allowing them to store more fat.

Fructose may benefit individuals engaged in strenuous physical activity by sustaining hepatic gluconeogenesis and providing additional energy to contract skeletal muscle in the form of lactate.
