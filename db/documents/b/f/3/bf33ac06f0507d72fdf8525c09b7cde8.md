The tetanus toxoid is an FDA-approved vaccination given alone or in conjunction with other vaccines. It is protective against effects from a gram-positive bacillus, Clostridium tetani.  This bacteria produces a neurotoxin called tetanospasmin, which blocks the release of an inhibitory neurotransmitter and leads to unopposed muscle contractions and spasms.

The World Health Organization recommends receiving the primary series of tetanus vaccinations during adolescence. Due to the requirement for primary immunization, an absorbed form containing multiple antigens is usually utilized.

Furthermore, tetanus toxoid can be used alone if needed in particular circumstances. It is highly effective when used prophylactically in cases when dealing with wound care and management. The Tdap booster vaccination should also be considered in patients with any wound injury who have had less than three tetanus toxoid doses, received their last dose more than ten years ago, or if their immunization history is unknown.
