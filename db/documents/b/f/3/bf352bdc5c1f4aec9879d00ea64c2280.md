A heart has numerous pacemaker sites within its conduction system, which are independently able to keep the heart beating. And the rate of a heartbeat depends upon the pacemaker site, and as we go down its conduction system, the rate of spontaneous depolarization at pacemaker sites decreases.

Pacemaker sites and their depolarization rates are listed below:

- Sinoatrial node: 60 to 100 beats per minute

- Atria: less than 60 beats per minute

- Atrioventricular node: 40 to 60 beats per minute

- Ventricles: 20 to 40 beats per minute
