The cause of appendicitis likely stems from obstruction of the appendiceal opening or lumen. This results in inflammation, localized ischemia, perforation, and the development of a contained abscess or perforation with resultant peritonitis. This obstruction may be caused by lymphoid hyperplasia, infections (parasitic), fecaliths (stone-like structure made of hardened feces), or benign or malignant tumors. When an obstruction is the cause of appendicitis, it leads to an increase in pressure, resulting in small vessel occlusion and lymphatic stasis. Once obstructed, the appendix fills with mucus and becomes distended, leading to ischemia and necrosis. Bacterial overgrowth then occurs in the obstructed appendix, with aerobic organisms predominating in early appendicitis and mixed aerobes and anaerobes later in the course. Common organisms include Escherichia coli, Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides, and Pseudomonas. Once significant inflammation and necrosis occur, the appendix is at risk of perforation, leading to a localized abscess and sometimes frank peritonitis.
