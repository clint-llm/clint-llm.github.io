Patients who undergo mastoidectomy for acute mastoiditis may avoid complications of mastoiditis and will benefit from a faster clearance of the infection compared to antibiotics alone. Patients who undergo mastoidectomy for chronic diseases, such as infection or cholesteatoma, experience relief from chronic ear drainage and irritation. They, more often than not, will experience some improvement in hearing. They also avoid complications of chronic disease such as extemporal spread, especially toward the brain.
