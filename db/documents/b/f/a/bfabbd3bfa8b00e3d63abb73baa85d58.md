Conjunctivochalasis (CCh) is an underdiagnosed and common condition characterized by loose, redundant, and non-edematous conjunctival folds typically located in the inferior bulbar conjunctiva. The term, which comes from the Greek “chalasis,” meaning to slacken, was first used by Hughes in 1942. CCh can cause a spectrum of symptoms, ranging from mild discomfort in the mild stages to tear outflow obstruction in the moderate stages and exposure keratopathy with subsequent visual loss in the severe stages.
