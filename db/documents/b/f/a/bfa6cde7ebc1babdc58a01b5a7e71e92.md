Lower eyelid blepharoplasty patients usually present with certain cosmetic complaints such as wrinkled skin or puffiness in the eyelid. Surgeons should address these complaints by performing a physical examination to assess the patient's motives, expectations, and age-related changes that need to be addressed by surgery. First of all, surgeons should ask about patients' motives for surgery and make sure that it is their own decision and not forced by someone else, e.g., a partner or a friend. It is also crucial to address the patient's expectations. Surgery should be deferred in any patient with unrealistic expectations. Body dysmorphic disorders are another contraindication of surgery. Moreover, patients should be asked about a history of dry eyes. A Schirmer test can be done if needed to quantify the degree of dryness. Visual acuity should be checked preoperatively, and eye movement in all field gazes should be documented.  Patients should also be tested for Bell's phenomenon.

Focus examination should include assessing the lower eyelid skin, orbicularis oculi muscle, tarsoligamentous laxity, herniated fat compartments, conjunctiva, eye shape, canthal tilt, eye prominence, and malar area. At the end of the examination, surgeons should decide which patient would benefit from non-surgical rejuvenation, lower blepharoplasty with or without canthal supports, or would need both lower blepharoplasty and mid-facelift. The surgical decision should be discussed with the patient in detail, including the recovery period and possible complications to obtain informed consent.

**Skin Assessment**

Dermatochalasis, which is excess skin, muscle, and fat, is the most common indication for surgery. Skin wrinkles can be either dynamic or static. Dynamic wrinkles appear only when smiling, and they can be addressed by botulinum toxin injection.

On the other hand, static wrinkles are always present and not related to smile. They need special care with either dermal filler, laser, or chemical peels. Dark eye circles resulting from a shadow of the convexity of the prolapsed fat will improve by blepharoplasty. However, dark circles related to actual skin pigmentation will remain after surgery. This can be addressed postoperatively by intense pulsed light (IPL) skin lightening and hydroquinone treatment.

Co-existing skin lesions such as xanthelasma can only be excised if lying within the area of skin excision. Patients should be informed that any lesions away from the surgical skin excision site cannot be removed during lower blepharoplasty. It is better to be done in another surgical procedure later. Associated eyelid diseases such as blepharitis should be identified and discussed with the patient. In the case of active inflammation, surgery should be postponed till it subsides.

**Orbicularis Oculi Muscle**

Fullness in the lower lid may be a sign of hypertrophied orbicularis oculi muscle rather than a prolapsed fat pad. This is more common in Asian patients, and it is usually evident as an excessive bunching beneath eyelashes when the patient smiles or squints. Resection of a part of the orbicularis oculi, preserving the pretarsal muscle, may be needed to address this problem.

**Tarsoligamentous Laxity**

Trasoliganemtous laxity can predispose scleral show, corneal exposure, and in some cases, ectropion. It can be assessed by a snapback test in which the patient's lower lid is pulled downward to determine the lid's elasticity. If the lid does not reposition immediately against the globe once the lid is released, it is a sign of tarsoligamentous laxity. It can also be evaluated by the lid distraction test in which the lower eyelid is gently pulled forward and away from the eye. A distraction of more than 6mm is a sign of significant tarsoligamentous laxity. Canthal support is needed in all cases of tarsoligamentous laxity.

**Herniated Fat Compartments**

The lower lid has three post-septal fat compartments named nasal, central, and temporal fat compartments. It is important to determine which fat compartment is more prominent and to document it with preoperative photography. Standard photography should be obtained in the form of 5 views with the patient in a seated position and an upright posture with no facial animation. Then, close-up views of the eyes should be done while closed, open at rest, in an upward gaze, and a lateral gaze**.******The most commonly overlooked fat pad is the nasal pad. Orbital fat can be either excised or redraped over the inferior orbital rim after the release of the orbitomalar ligament to create a space for fat repositioning. Over resection of the orbital fat can lead to hollowness in the lower orbit that is usually difficult to correct.

**Conjunctiva**

Patients with loose conjunctiva (conjunctivochalasis) should be informed that they are at a higher risk of the common postoperative conjunctival edema and should be counseled about the possible need for plication or resection of the loose conjunctiva if needed.

**Eye Shape and Canthal Tilt**

Most patients have a positive canthal tilt (lateral canthus is 2 mm superior to the medial canthus), which can be reversed by age. The patient should be asked to describe how they see their eye shape and its relationship to the lateral canthus. A review of an old photo is always helpful. The decision of correction of the canthal tilt should be discussed with the patient preoperatively.

**Eye Prominence**

Measurement of eye proptosis is important to determine the need for lateral canthal support. A Hertel exophthalmometer can be used. An eye position of 15 to 18 mm from the lateral orbital rim is considered within the normal range. A deep-seated eye is defined as less than 15 mm from the lateral orbital rim. A modified technique of canthopexy is needed in deep-seated eye patients by the placement of the sutures at the level of the inferior pupil deep within the orbit. On the other hand, a prominent eye protrudes more than 18mm from the lateral orbital rim. These patients are at a high risk of lower lid malposition, scleral show, and ectropion postoperatively. In mild cases, placement of the lateral canthus deeper in the lateral orbital wall at the level of the superior pupil may be sufficient. While in severe cases, the excessive elevation of the lateral canthus is not advisable as it may impair eye closure.

**Malar Prominence**

Patients with prominent eyes and recessed malar prominence (negative vector) are at a higher risk of lower lid malposition. Canthal support is needed in all these patients. On the other hand, patients with prominent malar bone (positive vector) tend to have deep-seated eyes and narrow palpebral fissures postoperatively. These patients are at a higher risk of anterior malposition of the lower eyelid away from the globe. This can be addressed by the deep placement of lateral canthopexy sutures. Midface aging can be seen in the form of tear trough malar festoon or deepening of the nasolabial fold. A commonly seen problem, a tear trough is a midface crease that begins at the medial canthus and travels obliquely above the nasolabial fold. It is an early sign of aging, and it can also be seen earlier in patients with familial tendencies. It can be addressed by redraping the orbital fat over the inferior orbital rim after releasing the orbitomalar ligament.
