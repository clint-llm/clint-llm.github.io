Increased levels of galactose-1-phosphate due to blockage of the typical metabolic pathway are suspected to lead to alternative metabolism and direct tissue damage. Elevated levels of galactitol (galactose reduced to its sugar alcohol form) have been found in the urine of patients with galactosemia as well as tissues with evidence of damage in galactosemia. Galactose may also be oxidized to galactonate which may be a less toxic metabolite compared to accumulated galactitol.
