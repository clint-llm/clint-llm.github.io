Patients should know there is no cure for Behçet syndrome, and symptoms can be controlled significantly with the prescribed drugs. As some drugs may be teratogenic, patients should discuss planning pregnancy before starting treatment. Patients should be explained the variety of symptoms they may experience and encouraged to seek immediate medical attention in case any of these symptoms appear so that their medications may be switched if needed.
