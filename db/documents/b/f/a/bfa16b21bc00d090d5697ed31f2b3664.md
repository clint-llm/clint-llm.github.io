DNA repeat expansions are the underlying pathology in about 20 to 30 neurodegenerative and neuromuscular disorders in humans.

There are many different types of SCA, but we will focus on Type 1 as an example. Spinocerebellar ataxia Type 1 is an autosomal dominant disorder that involves a CAG repeat in the ataxin (ATXN1) gene on chromosome 6.

Huntington disease is an autosomal dominant disorder that involves a CAG repeat in the huntingtin (HTT) gene on chromosome 4.

Fragile X syndrome is an X-linked dominant disorder that involves a CGG repeat in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene on the X chromosome.

There are a few different types of myotonic dystrophy, but we will again focus just on type 1 as an example. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is an autosomal dominant disorder that involves a CTG repeat in the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene on chromosome 19.

Friedrich ataxia is an autosomal recessive disorder involving a GAA repeat in the frataxin (FXN) gene on chromosome 9.
