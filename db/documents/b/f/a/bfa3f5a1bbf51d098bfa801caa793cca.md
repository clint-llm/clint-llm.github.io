Regional anesthesia for abdominal wall procedures can be performed using a variety of peripheral nerve blocks. These blocks are typically ultrasound (US) guided and involves injecting a local anesthetic (LA) solution into interfascial planes. US-guided transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block implicates the injection of LA in between the transversus abdominis (TA) and internal oblique (IO) muscles. The TAP block can also be targeted using anatomical landmarks at the level of the Petit triangle. This interfascial plane contains the intercostal, subcostal, iliohypogastric, and ilioinguinal nerves. These nerves give sensation to the anterior and lateral abdominal wall as well as the parietal peritoneum, providing only somatic and not visceral analgesia.

The TAP block can be for postoperative analgesia management in open and laparoscopic abdominal surgeries as well as inpatient and outpatient surgical procedures.

The TAP block has become one of the most common truncal blocks performed for postoperative analgesia after abdominal surgeries. This activity reviews the anatomy of the abdominal wall, history of the TAP block, classification, approaches, techniques, and complications for this block. It also highlights the indications, contraindications, clinical significance, and equipment to perform this block in a safe manner.
