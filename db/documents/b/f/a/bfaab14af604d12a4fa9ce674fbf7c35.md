The peroneal (fibular), posterior tibial, and anterior tibial arteries are the three named arteries supplying the foot. The DPA is a continuation of the anterior tibial artery after it crosses the ankle joint. It runs over the dorsum of the foot, across the tarsal bones, and then dives inferiorly between the first dorsal interosseous muscle heading towards the plantar aspect of the foot. The DPA divides into a small arcuate artery and a larger deep plantar artery which branches to dorsal metatarsal arteries and terminates as small dorsal digital arteries. Two other branches of the DPA include the medial and lateral tarsal arteries.

Deep and superficial veins drain the lower extremity. The deep veins drain into the tibial veins in the calf muscles, and the superficial veins drain into the great saphenous vein and small saphenous veins. The lymphatic drainage of the leg and foot enters the popliteal lymph nodes, and subsequently the superficial and deep inguinal lymph nodes.
