The common carotid artery arises from the aortic arch (left) or the brachiocephalic trunk (right). It divides into internal and external carotid arteries. The internal carotid artery provides blood to the brain while the external carotid artery provides blood to the face, scalp and the neck. The internal and external carotid arteries form collaterals at several locations. This is helpful for the maintenance of blood flow through collateral circulation in case either artery becomes occluded. The aortic arch can be divided into three anatomic types. To simplify, an imaginary horizontal line is drawn through the top of the aortic arch, and imaginary parallel lines marking the origins of the great vessels coming off the arch are drawn for comparison. For a type 1 arch, all great vessels originate close to the imaginary horizontal line drawn through the top of the aortic arch. If the origins of all great vessels fall within the second parallel line, this is considered a type 2 aortic arch. For a type 3 aortic arch, the origins of all great vessels fall within the third parallel line. The angulation, as related to the type of aortic arch, has important implications for CAS.
