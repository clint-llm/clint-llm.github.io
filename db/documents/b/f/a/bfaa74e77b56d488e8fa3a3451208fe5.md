Heart failure readmissions account for a majority of national healthcare expenditures. Support programs are operating nationwide to minimize the number of CHF-related hospitalizations and thereby reduce the economic strain. These programs utilize a collaborative approach with many integrated disciplines and providers. Some inpatient strategies include guideline-based care, discharge support by nurses, patient education, medication reconciliation by the pharmacist, and early post-discharge follow-up. A board-certified cardiology pharmacist can assist clinicians in selecting medications for blood pressure control and other factors where medication can provide ancillary benefits. Cardiology-specialized nurses are also valuable members of the interprofessional team, coordinating activities between various specialists and other clinicians and providing patient counseling. Promising outpatient strategies include interprofessional team engagement in HF clinics and disease management programs that make in-person contact with patients and provide individualized education.

Cardiomegaly and HF require an interprofessional team approach that includes physicians and specialists, specialty-trained nurses, pharmacists, and therapists, all working collaboratively to bring about optimal therapeutic choices that lead to the best possible patient outcomes. This interprofessional approach requires open communication between all members of the care team and accurate, updated documentation to be effective. [Level 5]
