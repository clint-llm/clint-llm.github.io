The subclavian artery serves as the major blood supply to the upper extremities. It also supplies parts of the head, neck, and thorax. One of the thoracic branches of the subclavian artery is the thyrocervical trunk (TCT).

The thyrocervical trunk is an important vascular supply, as it yields arteries to numerous structures such as organs of the neck, muscles, and the brachial plexus. All this occurs in the tight space of the neck. Therefore, the thyrocervical trunk and its branches have an intricate interplay with the other structures found in their vicinity, which leads to several considerations of surgical and practical relevance. This review aims to confer a thorough understanding of this structureâ€™s anatomy along with shedding light on clinical applications.
