Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is an aggressive type of childhood cancer that forms in the brainstem. They are very rare and almost always occur in the pediatric population. To avoid the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition, DPIG must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.
- Review the appropriate process for the evaluation of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.
- Outline the management options available for diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma and improve outcomes.
