Any rapid atrial rhythm, including atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, or atrial flutter, can be sensed by the atrial lead and then result in ventricular pacing at the upper rate limit. This is distinguished from classic PMT by examining the underlying rhythm on the intracardiac electrograms.

Electromagnetic interferences and myopotentials from chest wall muscles can also be sensed by the pacemaker and cause pacing at the upper rate limit.

In pacemakers with rate response function, the sensor may be oversensitive or the slope of response too steep, which may result in increased pacing rates in response to low-level activities or even physiologic events.
