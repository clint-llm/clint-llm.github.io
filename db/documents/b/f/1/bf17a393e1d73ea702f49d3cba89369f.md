There can be several non-vasculitic disorders associated with unilateral or bilateral vision loss. In the elderly population, atherosclerosis and thromboembolism have to be considered. Infections such as bacterial endocarditis, tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus can mimic symptoms and laboratory findings of GCA. Malignancies such as lymphoma and myeloma can be associated with constitutional symptoms, arthralgia, and elevated acute phase reactants. Other vasculitis disorders, especially ANCA-associated vasculitis, can be differentiated by the absence of fibrinoid necrosis on temporal artery biopsy and lack of serological markers in GCA. Finally, amyloidosis shall be considered as it can also cause jaw claudication, and congo-red staining of the biopsy can help diagnose amyloidosis.
