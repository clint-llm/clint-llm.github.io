Ectopia lentis is a familial or acquired displacement of crystalline lens which requires an interprofessional approach for meticulous management. The ophthalmologist, pediatrician, cardiologist, orthopedics, rheumatologist, microbiologist, and pathologist play a key role in managing these cases. The nursing team also plays a crucial role in the operating room and outpatient counseling regarding the long-term visual outcome and prognosis of ectopia lentis. They also emphasize the need for a meticulous follow-up and regular post-operative medications. The pharmacist plays a vital role in arranging the post-operative topical and systemic medications. Hence, an interprofessional, multidisciplinary team approach is warranted to achieve a perfect visual outcome in ectopia lentis cases.
