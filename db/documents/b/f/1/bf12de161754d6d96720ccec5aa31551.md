Understanding the anatomy of the upper extremity is the most important thing in a surgical setting. Operating safely, with the knowledge of what plane you are in and the neurovascular structures you are working near, will minimize complications during the operation and ultimately improve patient satisfaction and survival. Also, in regards to muscle and tendonÂ repair, knowing the origins and insertions of various muscles allows the surgeon to identify the area in which one is working. Regarding anesthesia in the surgical setting, the knowledge of nerves and the structures they surround allows for better success in peripheral nerve blocks during surgery.
