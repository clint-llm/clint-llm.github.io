Developing chronic back pain is one of the main complications of LDH. Furthermore, inadequate treatment can lead to lasting irreversible nerve damage andÂ neuropathic pain in patients with severe nerve root compression. Complications associated with surgical interventions or epidural steroid injections are listed below.

Epidural steroid injections:

- Nerve injury

- Dural puncture, resulting in positional headache

- Infection

- Epidural abscess

- Epidural hematoma

- Paralysis (very rare)

Surgical intervention:

- Worsening of functional status

- Dural tear

- Postoperative infection

- Nerve root injury

- Recurrent disc herniation

- Great vessels (aorta and vena cava) injury, secondary to perforation of the anterior longitudinal ligament

- Epidural fibrosis
