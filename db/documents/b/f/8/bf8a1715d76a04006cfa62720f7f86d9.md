The clinical significance of identifying Bacteroides fragilis in cultures varies considerably based on the type of specimen collected. For example, if Bacteroides fragilis were identified in a swab from a diabetic foot ulcer or a decubitus ulcer, it would not have any clinical implications as the ulcers are usually colonized with a high bacterial load of mixed aerobic and anaerobic growth. On the other hand, if B. fragilis were identified in an aspirate from an intraabdominal fluid collection, then it signifies intrabdominal infection that should have management with targeted antimicrobial therapy along with source control of the infection.Â Bacteroides fragilis infections should merit consideration in patients with recent surgical intervention (especially abdominal surgery), trauma, and malignancy.
