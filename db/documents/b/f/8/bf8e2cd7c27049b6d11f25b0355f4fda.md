Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is a mitochondrial diseaseÂ primarily affecting the nervous system and muscles. MELAS presents in children or young adults as recurrent episodes of encephalopathy, myopathy, headache, and focal neurological deficits. The condition is relentlessly progressive, resulting in neurological impairment by adolescence or early adulthood.
