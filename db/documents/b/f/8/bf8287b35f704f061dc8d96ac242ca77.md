The onset of the disease may be acute or insidious. The acute onset is usually after exposure to a very large concentration of bagasse dust. In other cases, symptoms start to appear about four months to 12 years after exposure to the dust.

Physical examination of patients with bagassosis reveals crepitations, which are generally basal but could be generalized in severe cases.

Acute illness in the background of chronic bagassosis is usually severe and often presents with respiratory distress needing ventilation assistance.

The diagnosis is clinical and based on a positive occupational history, characteristic clinical features, and chest X-ray findings, and after the exclusion of other possible conditions.
