The most common way to identify cervical dysplasia starts with a Pap smear. Most Pap smears are now liquid-based cytology that will identify normal and abnormal cellularity. Molecular testing for the high-risk HPV subtypes types can be performed from the liquid samples if indicated. The Pap smear is a screening test, and based on the abnormality of the screening test, the next step in evaluation may be colposcopy. During this procedure, the cervix is examined with a microscope, and 5% acetic acid is applied to the cervix to identify abnormal areas. The dysplastic areas will turn an aceto-white color. Sometimes Lugol solution may be utilized if one is unable to see abnormalities with acetic acid; this will result in a non-staining area. A biopsy of any abnormal areas is sent to the pathologist who identifies any evidence of cervical dysplasia.
