At the beginning of week 4, before the formation of choroid plexus, the neural tube is found with CSF; this suggests extra-choroidal sources of CSF during embryonic development.

The choroid plexus became visible at around week 6 (about day 40), the arachnoid granulations did not form until the third trimester and up until around the 20th month of life.

Congenital hydrocephalus develops during intrauterine life, common developmental defects implicated are aqueductal stenosis and neural tube defects.
