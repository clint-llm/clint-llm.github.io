The initial evaluation of suspected postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome should focus on excluding primary cardiovascular etiologies such as structural heart defects or tachyarrhythmias, underlying systemic causes including endocrine dysfunction, establishing chronicity of autonomic complaints, medication review, and assessing associated co-morbidities including gastrointestinal, neurological, and psychiatric signs and symptoms.

In addition to a complete history and physical, basic labs and a thorough cardiac evaluation (electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, Holter monitor) should be initiated. The predominance of specific states such as physical deconditioning, gastrointestinal, urologic, and hyperadrenergic symptoms may necessitate additional testing including VO2 max exercise testing, thyroid function panel and autoimmune studies, plasma, and urinary metanephrines, and specialist consultation.

An active stand test consists of having the patient lying supine for 10 minutes with measurement of supine baseline blood pressure and heart rate; the patient then stands and with re-measurement of BP and HR at timed intervals (1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes).
