Germ cell tumors are cancers that arise from the reproductive cells of the testis or ovaries. Germ cell tumors can arise along the track of the migration of primordial germ cells. Mediastinal non-seminomatous cancers encompass a group of germ cell cancers that affect men. Their presentation can be vague, and diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion. Management involves meticulous coordination of care with different specialties. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of mediastinal nonseminomas and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of mediastinal non-seminomas.
- Explain the diagnostic workup for a mediastinal nonseminoma.
- Review the treatment and management options available for mediastinal nonseminomas.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving outcomes in patients with mediastinal nonseminomas.
