The exact pathogenetic mechanisms for the development of coronary artery anomalies (CAAs) are not well understood. Extensive embryological research has been done and has provided us with some clues into the formation of coronary anomalies. Coronary artery development is an intricate process that is dependent on many factors. These factors include the formation of coronary sinuses on the embryologic bulbus cordis that later becomes the aorta, formation of cardiac sinusoids, the formation of coronary arteries in the epicardial atrioventricular and interventricular grooves that eventually meet up with the coronary buds, and the matching of the coronary arteries to their sinuses of origin.
