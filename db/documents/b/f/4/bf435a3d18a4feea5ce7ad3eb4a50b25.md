Physiologic variants have been found in individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders and those exposed to early childhood stressors. In depressed patients, decreased activity within the PFC has been revealed by near-infrared spectroscopy and messenger RNA assays which showed down-regulation of glutamate transporter genes. Functional MRI studies have shown patients with schizophrenia have reduced long-interval cortical inhibition and hypoactivity. The PFC also can be severely malformed or reduced in volume as a result of the developmental disorder holoprosencephaly.
