Patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma, Waldenstr√∂m macroglobulinemia, MGUS, or other systemic gammopathies should be referred for ophthalmological evaluation, in addition to hematology/oncology. Systemic treatment should not be delayed in patients with high immunoglobulin levels, as the cornea and other ocular tissues are at risk for permanent and progressive damage. Providers seeing patients with loss of visual acuity and symptoms suspicious for occult malignancy should consider screening for systemic gammopathy, as ocular dysfunction may be among the first presenting symptoms.
