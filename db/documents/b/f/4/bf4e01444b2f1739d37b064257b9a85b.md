Retained root fragments are not uncommon within the general population. Dentists and surgeons who routinely extract teeth often have a well-developed approach to removing retained roots to maintain clinical efficiency in the event of tooth fractures during surgery. Before this article, a formal review of root extraction techniques had yet to be published. As dentistry continues to evolve, general dentists are surgically extracting teeth and performing other dentoalveolar surgeries at a never-before-seen rate. As most dentists and dental specialists are aware, removing teeth can be a humbling endeavor, requiring the surgeon's consistent capability to convert to a surgical extraction, if necessary. Retained roots can add time and increase stress levels for the patient and the surgical provider. To minimize harm and promote favorable patient outcomes, the exodontist should have the knowledge base, skill level, and confidence to employ the latest surgical techniques.
