Acute CCl4 toxicity is a life-threatening condition that may involve multiple organ dysfunction such as the liver, lungs, and kidneys. If not treated promptly, it can lead to very high mortality. Because of high mortality, it is best managed by an interprofessional team that consists of toxicologists, hepatologists, pulmonologists, nephrologists, hematologists, cardiologists, pharmacists, and critical care nurses. The pharmacist should assist with medicinal reconciliation and appropriate dosing. After initiating treatment, the patient needs careful monitoring.
