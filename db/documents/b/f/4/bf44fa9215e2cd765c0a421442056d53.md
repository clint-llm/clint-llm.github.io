Although the etiology of EED is unknown, circulating immune complexes, with repeated deposition, associated inflammation, and partial healing are thought to represent the underlying pathogenesis. Immune complex deposition results in complement activation, neutrophilic infiltration, and the release of destructive enzymes. This results in fibrin deposition in and around small dermal vessels during the later stages of the disease.

EED has been described in association with a number of systemic diseases. It is frequently found with hematologic disorders, such as IgA monoclonal gammopathy, myelodysplasia, myeloproliferative disorders, paraproteinemia, and hairy cell leukemia. Infections from group B streptococci, HIV, syphilis, and viral hepatitis are commonly associated with EED as well as autoimmune conditions, such as celiac disease, Crohn disease, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. In the study performed by Katz et al., two of five patients with EED demonstrated a prevalence of recurrent bacterial infections that were usually Streptococcal in nature. They also demonstrated increased C1q binding in three of five patients, a finding suggestive of the presence of circulating immune complexes.
