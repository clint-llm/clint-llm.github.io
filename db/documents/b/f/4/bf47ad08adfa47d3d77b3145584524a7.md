Almost two-thirds of the American population is involved in some form of organized sport, and it is estimated that one and a half to four million concussions occur due to sport each year in the United States. Â It has been estimated that approximately 17% of people with a repetitive concussion or mild TBI develop CTE. As of a review of pathologically confirmed cases of CTE in 2009, 90% were found in athletes, 85% of those athletes were boxers, and 11% were football players. However, the understanding of the epidemiology of CTE continues to evolve as more postmortem data become available.
