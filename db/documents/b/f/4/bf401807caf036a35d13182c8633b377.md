The major complication associated with internal anal sphincterotomy is anal incontinence. Up to 50% of patients experience transient incontinence, varying from the inability to control gas to loss of formed stool resulting in soiling. However, anal incontinence will resolve in the majority of patients.  In a meta-analysis of 22 retrospective and prospective studies, 4512 patients were followed for more than 2 years after a lateral internal sphincterotomy for the chronic anal fissure. In this study, the overall continence disturbance rate was 14%. The rate for major incontinence, defined as involuntary loss of feces, was less than 2%. Some experts have advocated limiting the sphincterotomy to the length of the fissure, which has shown to reduce the risk of incontinence. However, this is associated with an increased risk for non-healing fissure or recurrence of fissures. Other minor complications of internal anal sphincterotomy include infection, bleeding, and fistula development.
