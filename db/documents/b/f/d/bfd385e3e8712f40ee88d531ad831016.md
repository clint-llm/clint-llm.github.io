Approximately 60% of the medial epicondyle fractures in pediatric patients are associated with elbow dislocation.

Ulnar nerve involvement was prevalent in 9.6% of acute pediatric medial epicondyle fractures based on studies from large systematic reviews. Findings of ulnar neuropraxia included loss of sensation over the right radial aspect of the ring finger and the entire small finger after trauma. Patients with ulnar nerve palsy require surgical intervention with ulnar nerve decompression.
