The initial diagnostic step is the identification of clinical features and a demonstration of elevated very-long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) in blood during newborn screening. Genetic testing makes the diagnosis of PEX genes. The next step in evaluation is biochemical testing looking for elevated levels of VLCFA, phytanic and/or pristanic acid, pipecolic acid, bile acid intermediates, and reduced levels of plasmalogen in red blood cells.
