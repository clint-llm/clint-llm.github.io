# Introduction

The styloid process is a cylindrical, slender, needle-like projection of varying lengths averaging 2 to 3 cm. The styloid process projects from the inferior part of the petrous temporal bone and offers attachment to the stylohyoid ligament and the stylohyoid, stylopharyngeus, and styloglossus muscles. Through these structures, the styloid process facilitates the movement of the tongue, pharynx, larynx, hyoid bone, and mandible. Significant vessels and nerves surround the styloid process. The internal jugular vein, internal carotid artery, and glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX), vagus nerve (CN X), and accessory nerve (CN XI) lie medial to the styloid process. The occipital artery and hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) run along its lateral side. Originating as a part of Reichert's cartilage forming from the second pharyngeal arch, it undergoes endochondral ossification in the late stages of pregnancy through the first decade of life. The structure shows variations in length, angulation, and other morphological features between individuals. Although these physiological differences are often found incidentally, some patients might develop a constellation of symptoms known as Eagle syndrome. The symptomatology of Eagle syndrome occurs secondary to irritation and/or compression of surrounding structures from an abnormal styloid process.

# Structure and Function

The cylindrical and needle-like structure has a thickness that gradually tapers, forming the apex of the styloid process. The length of the process varies between individuals with an average length of 2 to 3 cm.

# Embryology

The styloid process originates as a part of Reichert's cartilage, which forms from the second pharyngeal arch during embryological development

The styloid process undergoes endochondral ossification that begins at the final stages of pregnancy and is carried on over the first 8 years of life. However, the pattern of ossification and time to completely ossify has been shown to vary greatly.

# Blood Supply and Lymphatics

Several important vessels lie in the vicinity of the styloid process. Vessels that are located on the medial aspect of the styloid process are the internal jugular vein and the internal carotid artery as well as its branches, the lingual artery, facial artery, superficial temporal artery, and the maxillary artery. Along the lateral border of the styloid process, the external carotid artery and one of its branches, the occipital artery, are found.

# Nerves

The styloid process is surrounded by various nerves. On the medial aspect, particularly surrounding the internal jugular vein, one will find the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX), the vagus nerve (CN X), and the accessory nerve (CN XI). Lateral to the styloid process is the facial nerve (CN VII) and the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII). The facial nerve exits the skull from the stylomastoid foramen, which is directly posterior to the styloid process; however, it passes lateral to the process as it pierces through the parotid gland prior to splitting into its subsequent branches.

# Muscles

The styloid process gives origin to three muscles, the styloglossus, stylohyoid, and stylopharyngeus. The styloglossus receives innervation from CN XII, attaches to the apex of the tongue, and draws up the sides of the tongue to form a conduit that facilitates swallowing.

# Physiologic Variants

The length of the styloid process is not consistent across all individuals, with studies reporting average lengths anywhere from 1.52 cm to 8 cm.

The ossification and fusion of the styloid process also show variance. As mentioned previously, the stylohyal part might unite with the tympanohyal after puberty. If the stylohyal part successfully fuses with the tympanohyal part and the stylohyal aspect ossifies, it results in a long styloid process. However, if the stylohyal part fails to ossify, it results in a short styloid process.

Multiple theories have been proposed as the etiology responsible for the variance in ossification and elongation of the styloid process. The first theory is the "theory of reactive hyperplasia," which proposes that the styloid process reacts and proliferates after pharyngeal trauma, causing elongation. The second theory is the "theory of reactive metaplasia," which is similar to the first theory in trauma being the triggering factor. However, the second theory suggests that the stylohyoid ligament is the structure responsible for the abnormal ossification as it undergoes metaplasia and partial ossification. The third theory is the "theory of anatomic variance," which suggests that the ossification of the styloid process and the stylohyoid ligament is a normal process representing an anatomical variation resulting in the elongation of the styloid process. An additional and fourth theory that the elongated styloid process is due to retained embryologic tissue from Reichert's cartilage.

# Surgical Considerations

The styloid process serves an important function as an anatomical divider of the parapharyngel space (PPS). The division into distinct compartments is provided by the tensor-vascular-styloid fascia.tensor veli palatini muscle. The PPS is divided into the prestyloid (anterolateral) and retrostyloid (posteromedial) compartments to facilitate the differential diagnoses of PPS lesions. The prestyloid compartment contains fat, a portion of the retromandibular parotid gland, and lymph nodes. The retrostyloid region contains the internal carotid artery, internal jugular vein, CN IX-XII, a segment of the sympathetic chain, and lymph nodes.

# Clinical Significance

**Clinical Presentation**

As mentioned previously, approximately 4% of the general population have an elongated styloid process. Although the majority of these individuals are asymptomatic, a small percentage of those with an elongated styloid process show symptoms and can present with one of two types of Eagle syndrome.

The second type of Eagle syndrome is known as stylocarotid artery syndrome, which occurs when the styloid process impinges upon the internal or external carotid artery and the nerve plexus accompanying them. It presents as pharyngeal pain, eye pain, or parietal cephalgia, resembling a migraine or a cluster headache. Compression of the internal carotid artery might present with symptoms of internal carotid vascular insufficiency such as weakness, visual changes, or syncope exacerbated with head movement. The elongated styloid process might also pose the risk of carotid artery dissection leading to a transient ischemic attack or stroke.

Studies analyzing the possible correlation of styloid process length and severity of symptoms have so far been inconclusive.

**Diagnosis**

Diagnosis of Eagle syndrome depends on the patient's clinical presentation, radiological investigation, and lidocaine infiltration test.

**Management**

Management of Eagle syndrome can be conservative or surgical, depending on severity. However, initial conservative management is recommended.
