The management of TBI is interprofessional because many organ systems can be affected by brain injury.

TBI in general and mTBI, in particular, are heterogeneous pathological processes. Although post-concussion syndrome and personality changes are frequently presenting symptoms, research remains to be done on the unremarkable neuroimaging results in TBI, the life experiences of young TBI patients with co-morbid symptoms that persist well into adulthood, and the characteristics of families that contribute to function or dysfunction following a TBI. Many therapeutic trials were questioned, including hormonal therapy with progesterone in the first few hours that aimed to augment myelin regeneration and neural recovery, but results were not encouraging. Interestingly enough, there are still many questions that demand answers. These are prognosis, permanency of symptoms, best acute and long-term treatment strategies, and whether literature in sports-related TBI can be used as a guide. Imaging and therapeutic intervention research are still underway in hopes of delivering better outcomes.

Treatment of psychiatric symptoms following concussion/mTBI should be based on individual factors and the nature and severity of symptom presentation. It may include physiotherapy, psychotherapeutic, and pharmacological treatment modalities. Gait problems may require physical therapy, and loss of fine motor skills may require occupational therapy. A mental health nurse should follow the patients as many develop mood and behavior changes. Caregiver education is vital and one should not set unrealistic expectations.

The prognosis of patients with TBI depends on the initial GCS and neurological deficits at presentation. Those patients with a GCS less than 12 usually have a long recovery, and many continue to have residual neuro-psychiatric deficits.
