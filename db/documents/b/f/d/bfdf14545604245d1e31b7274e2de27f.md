The most common complication of atrial flutter is the increased risk of embolic stroke and disability related to this event.

Hemodynamically instability is also possible especially in patients with a rapid ventricular response.

Chronicity and poor control of atrial flutter can generate tachycardia induce cardiomyopathy and also can produce hard to control heart failure.

The complications secondary to the use of antiarrhythmic drugs are related to the type of drug and underlying mechanism of the drug.

Atrial flutter ablation complications also depend on the side of the origin of the atrial flutter. Right-sided atrial flutter is related to fewer complication rates than left-sided atrial flutter ablation, and this is due to the need for creating a transeptal communication during the procedure to reach the left atrium foci of arrhythmia and perform the ablation. The transseptal puncture produces transient communication between the left and right chambers of the heart. There is also increasing the risk of embolic strokes with left-sided atrial flutter ablation when compared with right side procedures.
