Several conditions may mimic brain death. These include:

- Locked-in syndrome

- Hypothermia

- Drug intoxication

- Guillan-Barre syndrome

- Delayed paralytic clearance

The clinicians should perform a clinical evaluation to ensure these conditions are not present and must be done before diagnosing brain death. It is essential to differentiate the difference between coma and brain death. When the AAN guidelines are followed, there have been no misdiagnoses of brain death reported in the literature; of the reported misdiagnoses, at least one violation of the AAN guidelines was identified.
