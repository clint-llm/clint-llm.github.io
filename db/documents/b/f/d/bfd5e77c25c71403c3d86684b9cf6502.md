Patients experiencing severe adverse effects of 5-FU treatment can be administered the drug uridine triacetate within four days of 5-FU treatment. Uridine triacetate is a pyrimidine analog composed of uridine triacetate. The mechanism of toxicity reversal is due to the high concentrations of uridine delivered by uridine triacetate that competes with 5-FU metabolites for binding sites in the body. Uridine triacetate is administered orally, but it is unknown whetherÂ it is safe or efficacious after four days following 5-FU administration.
