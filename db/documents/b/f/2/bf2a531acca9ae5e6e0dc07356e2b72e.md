Treatment and management of neurocysticercosis require a team-based healthcare approach. NCC will often require neurology and infectious disease consultation but depending on the location of the lesions may also incorporate neurosurgery evaluation. NCC can present in any patient population and can sometimes mimic preeclampsia in pregnant women. There have been several case studies of pregnant women with NCC presenting with seizures or headaches.
