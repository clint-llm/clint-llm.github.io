As with many secondary causes of hypertension, pheochromocytomas appear to be underdiagnosed. An autopsy study identified undiagnosed pheochromocytomas in 0.05% of the autopsies.

In a single-center study of 4180 patients from Brooklyn, pheochromocytoma was found in 0.2% of patients with hypertension. The study calculated an average annual incidence rate of 0.5 per 100,000 person-years.
