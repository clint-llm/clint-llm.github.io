The wall of the aorta consists of 3 layers known as the tunica adventitia, tunica media, and tunica intima. The innermost layer, the tunica intima, is lined by a single layer of endothelial cells and bound by the internal elastic lamina. The middle layer, the tunica media, is composed of smooth muscle cells, collagen, elastin, and fibroblasts. These components control vasodilation and vasoconstriction by way ofÂ signals from the autonomic nervous system. Elastin fibers in the media of the aorta provide tensile strength and the ability to withstand the pulsatile nature of the circulation. The outermost layer, the adventitia, is a thin layer containing connective tissue, fibroblasts, and the vasa vasorum.
