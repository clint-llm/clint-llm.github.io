Patients with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation experience worse breast cancer-specific survival when compared to BRCA-negative patients. BRCA1 carriers have a worse overall survival than BRCA2 patients

Studies do show that women who carry BRCA mutations are more likely to develop secondary cancer - either in the same breast or the contralateral breast. For these women, prophylactic bilateral mastectomy is recommended. More important, studies show that women who do undergo surgery are less likely to die from breast cancer compared to women who were treated with unilateral mastectomy.
