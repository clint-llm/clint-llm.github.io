Enlargement of the heart, both in the form of dilatation or hypertrophy, leads to a spectrum of clinical heart failure syndrome, with a prevalence of nearly 5.8 million people in the United States. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) represents more than half of these cases. The incidence of heart failure increases with age, male gender, and African American race. About half of the people diagnosed with heart failure die within five years of diagnosis.

In adults, dilated cardiomyopathy is more prevalent in men than in women. In the pediatric population, the annual incidence is 0.57 cases per 100,000 per year (higher in boys than girls, in Blacks than Whites, and in babies less than one year than in children). Two-thirds of children have idiopathic disease.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a global disease, with cases in over 50 countries on all continents affecting both sexes and of several ethnic and racial origins.
