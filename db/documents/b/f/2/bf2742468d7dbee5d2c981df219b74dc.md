There is a peroneal vein in the posterior lateral aspect of the lower leg that has a course similar to the peroneal artery.  The peroneal vein drains into the popliteal vein.  The superficial veins of the lateral leg drain into the small saphenous vein.  The deep veins of the lateral leg drain into the posterior tibial vein.

Superficial lymphatics provide lymphatic drainage to the lateral compartment of the lower leg.
