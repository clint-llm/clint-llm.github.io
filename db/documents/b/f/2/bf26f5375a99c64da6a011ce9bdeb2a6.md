The patella is the largest sesamoid bone in the human body. The posterior aspect of the patella contains a thick cartilage layer, which is the thickest cartilage in the body. A vertical ridge separates the medial and lateral facets of the articular surface and articulates with the femoral trochlea. The patella protects the anterior aspect of the knee joint, serves as the insertion for the quadriceps tendon, and functions as a fulcrum to maximize the efficiency of the extensor mechanism. Fractures of the patella account for approximately 1% of all fractures. They occur more commonly in males. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of fractures of the patella and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Recall the most common mechanisms of injury for patellar fractures.
- Summarize the diagnostic approach for an evaluation and assessment of a patient presenting with a potential patellar fracture, including any indicated imaging studies.
- Summarize the treatment and management strategies available for patellar fractures, based on the specific fracture type and severity.
- Discuss the importance of interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to aid in prompt diagnosis of patellar fracture and improving outcomes in patients diagnosed with the condition.
