In August 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) presented data at the National STD Prevention Conference that showed sexually transmitted infections (STIs) continue to rise at alarming rates. There were nearly 2.3 million cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis diagnosed in the USA in 2017, surpassing the previous record set in 2016 by more than 200000 cases, and marking the fourth consecutive year of steep increases in such diagnoses. Chlamydia remained the most commonly reported condition at the CDC. With the rise in transmission of STIs, rare diseases once considered eradicated have resurfaced. Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is one such example.

Lymphogranuloma venereum is a sexually transmitted infectious disease caused by the L1, L2, and L3 serovars of the bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis. First described in 1833 by Wallace, the infection was initially thought to be climatic in origin and identified as “tropical bubo.” It was not until 1912 when Rost concluded that the disease was venereal in origin.
