Tirzepatide is a synthetic peptide; and a dual gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. It is composed of 39 amino acids and is an analog of the gastric inhibitory polypeptide. Functionally, it stimulates insulin release from the pancreas and leads to a reduction of hyperglycemia. In addition, Tirzepatide also increases the levels of adiponectin. Its dual agonism ability leads to a more significant reduction of hyperglycemia than GLP-1 agonist agents alone and lowers the user's appetite.

**Pharmacokinetics**

**Absorption:**Tirzepatide has a bioavailability of approximately 80%. The time it takes to reach peak serum levels can range from 8 to 72 hours.

**Distribution:**The mean apparent steady-state volume of distribution(Vd) of tirzepatide is approximately 10.3 L. Tirzepatide is highly bound to plasma albumin (99%).

**Metabolism:**Once injected, the peptide structure undergoes proteolytic cleavage. In addition, the C20 fatty diacid composition undergoes beta-oxidation and amide hydrolysis.

**Excretion:**Tirzepatide has a half-life of 5 days, allowing once-weekly dosing, and is cleared in urine and feces in the form of metabolites.
