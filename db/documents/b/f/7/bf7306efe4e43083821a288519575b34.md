Myofascial trigger points are focal "knots" located in a taut band of skeletal muscle first described by Dr. Janet Travell in 1942. Trigger points may be formed after acute trauma or by repeated micro-trauma, leading to stress on muscle fibers. Trigger point injections are a therapeutic modality to treat myofascial trigger points, especially in symptomatic patients, and have been demonstrated effectiveness to inactivate trigger points. Treating pain with a multimodal approach is paramount in providing safe and effective results for patients. Trigger point injections can be wonderful adjunctive or primary therapy, alongside muscle relaxants, and other medications aimed at decreasing pain in the musculoskeletal system.

**Objectives:**
- Describe how to diagnose trigger points.
- Identify indications for trigger point injections. 

- Outline the technique to perform trigger point injections. 
- Summarize how an interprofessional team can work together to provide trigger point injections as an alternative treatment in patients suffering from musculoskeletal pain.
