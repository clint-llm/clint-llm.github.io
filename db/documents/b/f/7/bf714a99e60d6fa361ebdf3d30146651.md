Acute coronaryÂ syndrome comprises a spectrum of obstructive coronary artery disease that most commonly arises from plaque rupture and/or erosion, leaving the vulnerable lipid-rich core exposed to the circulation, resulting in activation of platelets and the coagulation cascade leading to acute thrombotic occlusion. There are three major subtypes of ACS: Unstable Angina, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Each of these subtypes represents a different stage in the spectrum of the disease. Plaque erosion with subendocardial ischemia represents the majority of cases of unstable angina and NSTEMI. In contrast, plaque rupture and complete thrombotic occlusion, of an epicardial coronary, with associated transmural infarction, is characteristic of STEMI.
