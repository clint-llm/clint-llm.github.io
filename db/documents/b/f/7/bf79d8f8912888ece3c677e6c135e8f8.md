Adverse effects from opioid anesthesia correlate with the adverse events of opioids in general. The most frequently experienced adverse effects of intravenous opioid anesthetic include hypotension exacerbation, respiratory depression/apnea, bradycardia, somnolence, urinary retention, and constipation. Other potential adverse effects include increased intracranial pressure secondary to hypercapnia, rigidity, delayed emergence, delirium, postoperative nausea and vomiting, pruritis, ileus, and the potential for the development of opioid-induced hyperalgesia or development of abuse/misuse habitsâ€”the risk of adverse effects increases as the population age increases or comorbidities of the patient increases. The risk of adverse effects of opioid use is reducible through dose reduction, opioid-sparing, or newer multimodal analgesia approaches.
