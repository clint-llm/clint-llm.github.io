As described in the seminal article from 1986 by Ohman, et al., staging is described in four categories. While this is largely used for academic purposes only, it can help clinicians categorize severity and response to treatment:.

- "Type I: Small rhagades limited to the corner of the mouth, adjacent skin slightly involved

- Type II: Lesion with ragged border more extensive in length and depth than Type I lesion

- Type III: Lesion consisting of several rhagades radiating from the corner of the mouth into the adjacent skin

- Type IV: Lesion presenting no rhagades, but erythema of skin contagious to the vermilion border"
