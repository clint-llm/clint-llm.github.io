Pneumothorax is a principal diagnosis for emergency medical services (EMS) providers to identify, which is a potentially life-threatening condition. It is commonly associated with complaints such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and trauma. The condition spans all age groups, and EMS providers should, therefore, maintain a high index of suspicion for pneumothorax for any patient with a sudden onset of acute respiratory distress and ipsilateral chest pain. This activity reviews the treatment of pneumothorax and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for a chest tube in a patient with a pneumothorax.
- Describe the clinical presentation of a patient with pneumothorax.
- Review the treatment options for a pneumothorax.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for managing pneumothorax and improving outcomes.
