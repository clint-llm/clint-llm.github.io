The composition of the polysaccharide capsule of Hib is of polyribosyl ribitol phosphate (PRP), which like other polysaccharide capsules, acts as an antigen that does not recruit T-cells. Therefore, the polysaccharide form of the vaccine is not immunogenic before the age of 2 years old because only small numbers of antibodies form via the T-cell independent immune process. The conjugate form of the vaccine is made by covalently attaching the PRP capsule to a protein, which will recruit T-cells and lead to the formation of sufficient numbers of anti-PRP antibodies.

Research has shown that the use of the Hib vaccine in combination with the acellular pertussis vaccine, as is the case in diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis adsorbed, inactivated poliovirus, and Haemophilus b conjugate (tetanus toxoid conjugate) vaccine (DTaP-IPV/Hib) has been shown to decrease the immunogenicity and possibly contribute to the Hib vaccine failures.
