Broca aphasia often has a devastating effect on the ability of individuals to carry out their normal activities. It affects the patient's ability to communicate and often leads to loss of productivity and vocation and can also lead to social isolation.

Currently, there is no standard treatment for Broca aphasia. Treatments should be tailored to each patient's needs. Speech and language therapy is the mainstay of care for patients with aphasia. It is essential to provide aphasic patients a means to communicate their wants and needs, so these may be addressed. Often this is done by providing a board with various objects so that the patient can point to the object that they want. Involvement of a speech therapist, neuropsychologist, and neurologist in the development of a care plan for the patient with Broca aphasia is very helpful in obtaining a good outcome.  One innovative treatment option for patients with Broca aphasia is melodic intonation. Melodic intonation relies on the fact that musical ability is often spared in Broca aphasia. Thus, the speech therapist encourages the patient with poor speech production to try to express their words with musical tones. This approach has shown promise in clinical trials.

Medical treatment of aphasia is currently under investigation in clinical trials. Drug therapies have included catecholaminergic agents (bromocriptine, levodopa, amantadine, dexamphetamine), piracetam and related compounds, acetylcholine esterase inhibitors, and neurotrophic factors. Previous studies have been small, and further studies are needed to determine the efficacy of these pharmacological agents. Also, transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct stimulation trials for aphasia are currently underway.

When the cause of Broca aphasia is a stroke, recovery of language function peaks within two to six months, after which time further progress is limited. However, patients should be encouraged to work on speech production, because cases of improvement have been seen long after a stroke. There are commercial software products available that claim to improve language function, but for the most part, these have not been rigorously tested in randomized clinical trials.

It is important to address issues of post-stroke depression and post-stroke cognitive impairment, as well as disorders of executive function, awareness, neglect, and hemiparesis during the rehabilitation process to optimize the outcome for an individual patient. Family and social support are extremely important to keep patients with language deficits engaged in social and leisure activities which can greatly influence the aphasic patient’s quality of life.
