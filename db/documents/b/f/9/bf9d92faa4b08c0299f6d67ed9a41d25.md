Several classifications have been proposed based on either the etiology or the morphological appearance of the double orifice mitral valve (DOMV). For instance, congenital anomalies of the native valve account for the vast majority of cases however when mitral annular calcifications affect the second scallop of the anterior leaflet as well as the second scallop of the posterior leaflet, and the mitral valve orifice may split into two, resulting in an acquired form of DOMV.
