The arterial supply to the fallopian tube arises from anastomoses between the ovarian and tubal branches of the ovarian artery and ascending branches of the uterine artery. On each side, the ovarian arteries branch off the abdominal aorta inferior to the origin of the renal arteries. The uterine arteries stem from the internal iliac arteries, and the ascending branches travel superiorly towards the uterine horns while its descending branches travel inferiorly towards the superior vagina. The ovarian arteries supply the lateral fallopian tube, while the ascending branches of the uterine artery supply the medial fallopian tube; however, anastomoses between the two generally ensures that compromise of either will not cause ischemia of any portion of the tube.

The venous drainage goes to the tubal branches of the uterine and ovarian veins, in a similar configuration as the arterial supply. The inferior vena cava (IVC) receives the drainage from the right ovarian vein, while the left renal vein receives the drainage from the left ovarian vein.  The uterine veins drain into the internal iliac veins, which drain into the IVC.

Lymph drainage of the fallopian tubes is similar to that of the ovaries. Lymph flows from the fallopian tubes to both the para-aortic (lumbar) lymph nodes and the pelvic lymph nodes.
