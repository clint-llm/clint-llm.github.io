The most important population that would benefit from teaching related to chromium deficiency includes patients that are on chronic total parenteral nutrition. These patients, along with those with concomitant risk factors such as short bowel syndrome, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, burns, or trauma, should be considered in a reevaluation of their total parenteral nutrition formula if they develop signs of chromium deficiency.

Notably, there is enhanced absorption of chromium in the presence of zinc and iron deficiency.

The association between low chromium levels, impaired glucose tolerance, and unfavorable lipid profiles has been described, but a causal association has not yet been determined.

There is little evidence supporting the supplementation of chromium in individuals who are not deficient in chromium. In 2010, the American Diabetes Association announced in their diabetes guidelines that since chromium supplementation has not definitively shown benefits in the literature, they cannot recommend its regular supplementation. Patients with diabetes mellitus with no other risk factors or signs and symptoms of chromium deficiency should be treated with guideline-directed management.
