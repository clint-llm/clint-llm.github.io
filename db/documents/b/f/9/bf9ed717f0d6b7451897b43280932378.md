Patients take ixazomib by mouth; based on the drug approval study, it should be taken weekly on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle.

It is also important to keep in mind that ixazomib should be given with dexamethasone and lenalidomide, which have their specific dosing schedules within a cycle. Both ixazomib and dexamethasone are given on days 1, 8, and 15; hence it is important to separate them since ixazomib should not be taken with food, whereas dexamethasone should be.

Ixazomib should be taken either two hours after eating or one hour after eating, with a full glass of water. The drug should be taken on the same day and hour of the week, and if a dose is missed, it should only be replaced if there are more than or equal to 72 hours till the next dose.
