The primary contraindication to administration is hypersensitivity to atracurium besylate or any component of the formulation. Multiple-dose vials contain benzyl alcohol as a preservative; hypersensitivity to benzyl alcohol is a contraindication to administration. Documented cross-reactivity to neuromuscular blockade drugs is limited, but atracurium should be used with extreme caution in patients with previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents.
