On plain chest radiographs, pericardial cysts may simulate pericardial fat or ventricular aneurysm. Differential diagnoses would also include diaphragmatic tumors, such as teratoma, which one would expect to see both solid and cystic components. Lymphangioma can also be a consideration, which would appear multilocular or multicystic.

Morgagni hernia and eventration of the diaphragm could be additional considerations. Bronchial cysts are also possible, but one would expect to see bronchial epithelium lining the cyst on histology. Localized pericardial effusion is an additional differential in which one would expect to see fluid between the pericardium layers. Additionally, a plethora of different types of congenital cysts can be considered, such as esophageal duplication cyst or neurenteric cysts, but their typical location can sometimes differentiate these.
