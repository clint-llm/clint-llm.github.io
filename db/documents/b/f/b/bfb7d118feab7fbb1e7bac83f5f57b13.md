Lung torsion is a life-threatening pathology that occurs when the lung or a pulmonary lobe rotates causing vascular and airway obstruction. This is a rare pathology that occurs when there is a disturbance in the thoracic cavity. To avoid high mortality, this must be diagnosed in a timely manner. With immediate management, the affected lung or pulmonary lobe can be salvaged. Overall, however, lung torsion has a poor prognosis due to misdiagnosis and delay in treatment. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of lung torsion and highlights the management of patients with lung torsion, to help the interprofessional team maintain a high index of suspicion for this disease in the appropriate clinical setting and improve patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of lung torsion.
- Review the evaluation of lung torsion.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for lung torsion.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance lung torsion and improve outcomes.
