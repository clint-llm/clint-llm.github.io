Rectal prolapse is ideallyÂ managed by an interprofessional team that involves a pediatrician, gastroenterologist, pediatric surgeon, and a pediatric nurse. All children with rectal prolapse should undergo testing for cystic fibrosis. While awaiting surgery, parents should be taught how to reduce the rectal prolapse.

Coordination of care for rectal prolapse requires a highly organized interprofessional team. For diagnosis and conservative management, physicians, nurses, and families must work together for effective treatment and maintenance at home. If these treatments are effectively communicated and orchestrated, the patient will ultimately have a better outcome. If surgery is indicated for prolapse, coordination is also needed between physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other members of the healthcare team. The importance of communication, patient-centered care, and professionalism cannot be understated when working with pediatric populations.
