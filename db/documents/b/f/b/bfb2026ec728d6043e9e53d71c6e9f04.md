Primary polycythemia vera (PV) must demonstrate increased production in all three cell lines to make the diagnosis. Increased red blood cell mass alone is not enough for diagnosis because other conditions such as chronic hypoxia and erythropoietin-secreting tumors can lead to polycythemia. Secondary polycythemia (from hypoxia or smoking) is much more common than primary PV and must be ruled out before the diagnosis of primary PV can be made.

Differential diagnoses to consider include:

- Essential thrombocythemia

- Chronic myelogenous leukemia

- Agnogenic myeloid metaplasia

- Chronic myelogenous leukemia

- Primary myelofibrosis

- Secondary polycythemia
