A transvaginal ultrasound offers an invaluable avenue for imaging the female pelvic anatomy. It augments transabdominal ultrasound for a more complete evaluation of the ovaries, adnexa, uterus, cervix, and surrounding pelvic regions. Typically, an ultrasound technician will conduct the scanning and take images of the normal structures, with more dedicated images or cine clips obtained of aberrant anatomy, pathologic processes, or pregnancy. The images are read by a radiologist, guiding the treatment by an interprofessional team.

- Review the purpose of the transvaginal ultrasound.
