Chlorpromazine is a member of the typical antipsychotic or neuroleptic drug class, also known as first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs). Its precise mechanism of action is unknown, but it is believed to produce its antipsychotic effect by the post-synaptic blockade at the D2 receptors in the mesolimbic pathway. However, the blocking of D2 receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway is responsible for its extrapyramidal side effects.

The antiemetic effect of chlorpromazine stems from the combined blockade of histamine H1, dopamine D2, and muscarinic M1 receptors in the vomiting center.

Chlorpromazine is extensively metabolized by the liver (CYP450 enzymes A12 and 2D6; it is a CYP3A4 substrate.) It also undergoes metabolism in the kidney and GI tract. It is excreted in the urine, bile, and feces. It has a half-life of between 23 and 37 hours for the parent drug, and its active metabolite has a half-life of 10 to 40 hours.
