Intensive treatment of Patau syndrome is controversial due to the universally poor prognosis of patients despite treatment.

At delivery, infants diagnosed with Patau syndrome may need post-delivery oxygenation and ventilation; this may require intubation or tracheostomy due to facial defects. Patients with cardiac defects may require cardiac surgery to repair common cardiac abnormalities. Other surgeries may be indicated for common defects including herniorrhaphy, cleft lip repair, feeding tube placement, or corrective orthopedic surgeries.

Additional treatments may be performed including specialized dietary feeds, seizure prophylaxis, prophylactic antibiotics for urinary tract infections, and the use of hearing aids.

Despite aggressive management, median survival only extends to 733 days in the most recent cohorts of patients.
