The correct diagnosis and management of ischemic optic neuropathies are essential to ensure that all potential risk factors are modified in order to decrease the chance of a patient developing this condition in the fellow eye. The possible associations like diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, when present, should be managed by the interprofessional team, including endocrinologists and general physicians. The team can also include optometrists, neurologists, and ophthalmologists. The nurses participate in patient education and follow up, informing the ophthalmologist of any new issues.
