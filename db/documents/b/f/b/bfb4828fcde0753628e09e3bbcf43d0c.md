An individual may experience an electrical injury at home such as shock from a small appliance, extension cord, or wall outlet, which is very rarely associated with any significant trauma or complications. Children may experience a low-voltage injury without associated loss of consciousness or arrest by biting or chewing on an electrical cord. Adults mayÂ receive similar injuries while working on home or office appliances or circuits. Low-voltage electrical current can result in severe injury, much like high-voltage current, depending on the length of exposure (e.g., if there is prolonged muscle tetany), the size of the individual, and cross-sectional area in contact with the electrical source.

At least half of all electrocutions encountered in an occupational setting occur as a result of contact with power lines, and about a quarter as a result of electrical machines or tools.
