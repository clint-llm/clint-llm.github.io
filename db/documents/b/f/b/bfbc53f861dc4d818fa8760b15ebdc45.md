The blood supply to the ileocolic artery is the superior mesenteric artery. The superior mesenteric artery is the second major branch of the abdominal aorta just distal to the celiac trunk. The celiac trunk is the vascular supply to the stomach, proximal small bowel, liver, spleen, and pancreas. The inferior mesenteric artery is aÂ branch of the abdominal aorta serving as the vascular supply to the hindgut. The lymphatics associated with the ileocolic artery are the lymph nodes located within the mesentery of the viscus organs: the mesoileum, the mesocecum, the mesoappendix, and the mesocolon.
