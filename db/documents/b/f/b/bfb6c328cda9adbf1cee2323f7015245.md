Traditionally, superficial thrombophlebitis was a clinical diagnosis. However, with the increased realization of association with concomitant DVT or PE, compressive ultrasonography is recommended.

D-dimer testing is of limited utility in detecting SVT. It is variably elevated in SVT and cannot be used to distinguish isolated SVT from DVT.

Experts debate whether patients who present with extensive superficial thrombophlebitis without an apparent inciting reason should have an evaluation for thrombophilia, given that hypercoagulability is associated with SVT. However, to date, there have been no conclusive studies identifying causation between hypercoagulability and SVT.

As previously mentioned, migratory thrombophlebitis warrants evaluation for visceral neoplasm.Â Patients older than 40 years with their first episode of thrombophlebitis should also be evaluated for underlying neoplasm.

To help establish the pretest probability for the presence of DVT in patients with SVT, the Internal Carotid Artery Occlusion (ICARO) Study Group has outlined the following five variables:

- Active malignancy (1.5 points)

- Limb edema (1.5 points)

- Age of fifty years or more (1 point)

- A ropelike sign (-1 point)

- Unprovoked SVT (-1 point)

The ICARO Study Group suggested this scoring system to help when assessing such patients for coexisting DVT:

- Low probability (less than zero points): 1.1% likelihood

- Intermediate probability (score of 0 to 1): 12.0% likelihood

- High probability (scored 1.5 or more points): 32.3% likelihood

However, a more recent study using this scoring system does not support its validity.
