Various modifications have been reported for the improvement of the Coombs test, including the use of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and the antiglobulin gel test (AGT).

The AGT is routinely used to screen human sera for anti-human RBC antibodies. The procedure is as follows:

- Use a gel microtube (it contains anti-IgG)

- Add 25 microliters of serum to the microtube

- Add 50 microliters of low ionic strength solution (LISS) - suspended red blood cells at a 0.8% concentration to the reaction chamber of the microtube

- Incubate at 37 degrees Celcius for 15 minutes

- Spin for 10 minutes in a centrifuge at approximately 70 x g

- After centrifugation, the positive reaction gets graded from 0 to 4+

- Negative reactions have RBC pellets on the bottom of the microtube with no agglutination

- One + reaction is indicated by erythrocyte agglutination at the lower half of the gel column

- Two + reaction has erythrocytes dispersed throughout the microtube

- Three + reaction contains erythrocytes displayed in the upper half of the gel column

- A four + reaction is indicated by a solid band of erythrocyte on the top of the microtube chamber
