Weight-loss dietary supplements are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Unlike over-the-counter and prescription medications, the FDA does not classify dietary supplements as drugs. Therefore, these supplements do not require FDA approval before marketing, and the manufacturer determines the product's safety and efficacy. However, the FDA does not allow supplements containing pharmaceutical ingredients or those that claim to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent disease.

When evaluating the evidence for dietary weight-loss supplements, additional data are needed to more clearly understand the efficacy, dosing, and safety of each ingredient. Human studies are limited, and data are often extracted from animal and laboratory research. Most human trials are small and of questionable quality, limiting interpretation. Many supplements marketed for weight loss contain multiple ingredients, making it impossible to isolate each ingredient's effect. Studies often use different formulations, combinations of ingredients, and variable dosages, all of which complicate the analysis of the supplement's safety and efficacy.
