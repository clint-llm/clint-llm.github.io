No serious complications are known for the I-123 exam, aside from the factors that may decrease the sensitivity of the I-123 uptake scan or the contraindications of exposing a pregnancy or newborn to radiation through the placenta or breastfeeding. Because iodide freely passes through the placenta and is concentrated and excreted by lactating breast, I-123 administration is relatively contraindicated in pregnant patients and nursing mothers. In order for the radiotracer to be administered and absorbed, the patient must be able to tolerate orally ingesting the I-123 capsule or liquid.

To avoid errors, routine nuclear medicine quality control of the uptake probe, including sensitivity and energy spectrum, constancy, background, peaking, energy resolution, efficiency, and minimum detectable activity, should be performed and documented. Other error sources include incorrect positioning of patient or phantom or patient background (which should be mid-thigh, not near urinary bladder), substernal thyroid gland, contamination of phantom, malabsorption of the dose, high background activity, recent iodinated contrast administration, and patient radioactivity from another radiopharmaceutical. Renal failure can elevate RAIU, while illness such as euthyroid sick syndrome can reduce RAIU.
