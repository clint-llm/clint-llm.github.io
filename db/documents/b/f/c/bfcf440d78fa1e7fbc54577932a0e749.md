Geriatric care and management of a patient with cognitive impairment is an interprofessional effort. While it is essential to recognize that different specialties focus on different problems, maximum benefit is achieved when multiple assessments are synthesized into a coherent plan.

Coordination and clear communication must be established with physicians, nurses, healthcare agencies, pharmacists, and others who are involved in the patient care. Safety planning and assessment of the living situation can be performed by involving a social worker.

Using a common centralized electronic record system between specialties to organize appointments and medications is important to prevent adverse outcomes and helps maintain adherence.
