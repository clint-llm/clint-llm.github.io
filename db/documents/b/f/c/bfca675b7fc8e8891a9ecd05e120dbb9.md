Polydactyly is primarily thought to be a failure in digit control during development.

SHH is vital to digit number and type development.

Glioma-associated oncogene homolog 3 (Gli3) is an SHH antagonist, which has been shown in a group of people with Greig cephalopolysyndactyly to have a missense mutation in Gli3. This missense mutation can lead to an upregulation of SHH, which can contribute to polydactyly due to disrupted definition of the radial-ulnar axis.
