Although transesophageal ultrasound was first reported in the 1970s, the advent of phased array transducers and flexible transesophageal probes in the early 1980s enabled improved visualization of cardiac structures.

The Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists (SCA) and the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) published a first set of guidelines for the performance of a comprehensive intraoperative TEE exam in 1999. The aim of these guidelines was to define a standard examination for the purposes of training, consistency, storage, and quality. These guidelines contain a set of twenty TEE views that were primarily designed for intraoperative use although they have been widely adopted outside of the operating room.

Many practicing physicians that utilize TEE become certified in its use by the National Board of Echocardiography. This requires passing a test and the completion of several other requirements including a certain number of personally performed TEE exams.
