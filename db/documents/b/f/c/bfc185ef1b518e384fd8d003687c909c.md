Nephrocalcinosis, a term first coined in 1934 by Fuller Albright, refers to augmented calcium content within the kidney which can be in the form of calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate. However, there have been suggestions that the definition of nephrocalcinosis should be limited to calcium phosphate deposition only and deposition of calcium oxalate should carry the name oxalosis. This activity reviews the cause and presentation of nephrocalcinosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of nephrocalcinosis.
- Review the investigation of a patient with nephrocalcinosis..
- Outline the treatment and management options available for nephrocalcinosis.
- Describe some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with nephrocalcinosis.
