Differential diagnoses should enlist conditions that could mimic encephalopathy or encephalitis. These include:

- Primary or secondary CNS infections caused by bacteria, including mycobacteria/atypical organisms/viruses/prion/ fungus or parasites

- Hypoxemic & septic encephalopathies

- Non-infectious causes for encephalitis (for example, autoimmune or paraneoplastic encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis)

- Metabolic causes, including hepatic /uremic encephalopathies, Wernicke encephalopathy, mitochondrial encephalopathies, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia or hypernatremia, hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia

- Drugs/toxins including alcohol & heavy metals, cerebrovascular accident, primary or secondary brain tumor, seizure disorders, vasculitis, neurosyphilis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Behcet disease, and trauma

The differential diagnoses of viral encephalitis must include arboviral infections,Â such as West Nile and St Louis encephalitides, Eastern & Western equine encephalitides, and California and Japanese encephalitides. Other etiologies include herpes viruses (EBV, CMV, VZV, HHV 6 & 7) and also miscellaneous causes like mumps, enterovirus, dengue, adenovirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis due to hypermutated measles virus & progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy caused by JC virus.
