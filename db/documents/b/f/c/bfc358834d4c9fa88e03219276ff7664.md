Complications are typically associated with invasive techniques and the use of contrast material. Although rarely seen with the use of gadolinium, the theoretical risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, especially in patients with poor kidney function, remains a concern.Â Both CCTA and coronary angiography with catheterization must be done with caution in patients with severely reduced renal function, given the use of contrast, and both imaging techniques involve radiation exposure. Despite cardiac catheterization being the gold standard imaging modality in the evaluation of coronary artery disease, risks include bleeding, infection, retroperitoneal hemorrhage, dysrhythmias, pseudoaneurysms, coronary artery dissection, tamponade, pneumothorax, and death.
