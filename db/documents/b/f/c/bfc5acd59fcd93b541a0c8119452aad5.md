The procedure is performed in the operating room, under general anesthesia or adequate sedation. The patient is placed either in a prone or lithotomy position depending on the anticipated tract and its source anterior or posterior in the anus. The surgeons will require an anal retractor set. For the Seton, a vessel loop, heavy nylon suture, or rubber band can be utilized. To locate the tract, the surgeon will need an anal probe such as a lacrimal duct probe and possibly a small 10 cc syringe with some hydrogen peroxide with an angiocatheter on it to inject into the fistula tract. The surgeon may use a local analgesia injection at the end of the case to help with postoperative pain control. The perineal dressing to aid with the management of post-surgical drainage will be applied at the end of the case.
