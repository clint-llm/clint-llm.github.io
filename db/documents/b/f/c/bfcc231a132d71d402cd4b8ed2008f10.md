In the context of Mohs micrographic surgery, the responsibility for implementing appropriate antibiotics lies with the Mohs surgeon, but the support of an interprofessional team is crucial for optimal patient care. Nurses and medical assistants play a critical role by ensuring updated allergy information, making recommendations to clinicians based on their observations, and educating patients on medication administration. Pharmacists, on the other hand, contribute by preventing adverse drug interactions, suggesting alternative medications, counseling patients on proper administration, and providing antibiotic coverage information to the surgeon, thereby improving antibiotic effectiveness and helping to prevent antibiotic resistance.

While randomized controlled trials evaluating community pharmacist services in preventing adverse drug effects have shown mixed results, it is important to acknowledge that all members of the interprofessional healthcare team have a vital role in ensuring the appropriate and safe use of antibiotics in the context of Mohs micrographic surgery. Collaborative efforts among team members contribute to optimal patient outcomes.
