When caring for patients with dementia (PWD), it is important to feel comfortable assessing the patient’s fitness to drive. Patients with dementia have a two to eight times increased risk of motor vehicle accidents compared to similarly aged drivers without dementia, yet many are never counseled on driving safety.

Driving safety assessment is a sensitive discussion that is often delayed or forgone altogether because of physician reluctance, patient refusal, or caretaker preference. Physicians often do not get formal training on how to conduct these conversations and seldom know that they are qualified to make this assessment. Driving is integral to a patient’s independence, so discussions of driving fitness may be met with emotional resistance, and patients may not recognize or admit their deficits.

The true extent of driving impairment may be minimized by caretakers who either do not want to admit the progression of their loved one’s disease or do not want to take on additional driving responsibilities.
