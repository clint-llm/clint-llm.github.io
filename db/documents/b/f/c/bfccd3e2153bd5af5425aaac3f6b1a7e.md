The preprocedural preparations include:

- Getting informed consent from the patient or the designated health care proxy.

- Obtaining and reviewing appropriate diagnostic studies, including imaging and laboratory analyses (e.g., complete blood count and PT/INR).

- Platelet count should be at least 50,000/µL.
- The international normalized ratio (INR) should be <1.5.
- Patients should have a serum hemoglobin level greater than 9.0 g/dL, particularly in high-risk cases.

- In some cases, the administration of intravenous antibiotics before the procedure may be warranted. If sensitivities are not available, then a broad-spectrum antibiotic can be used based on the area to be treated and common pathogens that affect that area.
