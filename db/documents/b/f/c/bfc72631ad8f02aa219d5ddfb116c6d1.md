Healthcare system improvement depends on the ability of a system as a whole to accurately identify critical information from which to create policies and procedures, which then must be translated into initiatives that result in improved patient care and outcomes.  Effective implementation requires the development of interventions that align with improvement goals.

According to the Society for Simulation In Healthcare (SSIH), this functional approach to systems integration incorporates a multi-dimensional evaluation of quality outcomes such as "efficiency, effectiveness, safety, patient-centered in this, and equity." This process involves the utilization of simulation, instructional, and assessment strategies that are "consistent, planned, collaborative, integrated and interactive" while assuring that they incorporate "systems engineering and risk management principles."  Success is achieved through accomplishment of the following goals: optimal bedside clinical care, patient safety enhancement, and improved metrics across the healthcare system.
