There are many epidemiologic features to consider when evaluating patients for potential etiologic agents of encephalitis. Exposure history, including place of residence, recent travel, insect contact, animal contact, occupation, recreational activities, and diet, can help guide initial diagnostic testing. Additional factors such as age, vaccination history, immune status, and seasonal variation can also help narrow one’s differential. See table 1 for vectors and geographical distribution associated with each virus.
