Cycloplegics are considered the standard of care for certain clinical scenarios like pediatric age group, constant or intermittent esotropia, pseudo myopia, latent hyperopia, accommodation insufficiency, accommodation fatigue, or accommodation spasm. Cycloplegic refraction is also recommended in patients with amblyopia or underlying strabismus.

The American Optometric Association (AOA) guidelines also recommend cycloplegic examination of pre-schoolers for screening ocular conditions like significant refractive errors, anisometropia, strabismus, or amblyopia. The underlying clinical conditions leading to decreased vision can potentially threaten long-term sequelae. Thus, it is essential to evaluate the children at a young age to allow timely diagnoses and treatment.

Retinoscopy is performed in dim room illumination. The patient should be seated at a Â distance of 1 meter from the examiner. The retinoscope light is thrown into the patient's eye, and the patient is asked to look at the retinoscopic light. This is in contrast to dry retinoscopy, where the patient is asked to look at a distant point to allow relaxation of accommodation. The red reflex is noted through a hole in the retinoscope mirror in the patient's pupillary area. The retinoscope is moved in the horizontal and vertical meridian while observing the retinoscopic reflex.

The important inferences made from the movement of retinoscopic reflex depend on the distance and mirror used. For the setting of the plane mirror used at 1 meter, the interpretations are as follows:

- No movement of red reflex indicates myopia of 1 diopter (D)

- The movement of red reflex along the direction of the retinoscope indicates either emmetropia or hypermetropia, or myopia of less than 1 D

- The movement of the red reflex against the direction of the retinoscope implies myopia of more than 1 D.
