Throughout the natural course of pregnancy, the cervix remains long, thick and firm until the late third trimester when it slowly begins to soften, dilate and efface to eventually allow the passage of a fetus. The inability of a cervix to maintain its integrity prior to that time can result in miscarriage or preterm birth. When this occurs in the absence of clinical signs or symptoms of labor, it is referred to as cervical insufficiency or incompetence. In the past, nonsurgical approaches such as activity restriction and pelvic rest have been suggested, though their use has not proven effective and should be discouraged.
