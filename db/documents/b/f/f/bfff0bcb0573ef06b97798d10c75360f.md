Important entities to consider when evaluating EV lesions are verruca-associated lesions, any lesion with hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis, seborrheic keratosis, actinic keratosis, squamous cell carcinoma, among others. Importantly, in the case of EV, the lesions will present in multiples and at a young age (as early as infancy for inherited EV) or with a history of immunosuppression; whereas, other lesions on the differential would usually present as solitary lesions or at a later age.
