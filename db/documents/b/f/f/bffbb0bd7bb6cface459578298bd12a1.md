Herpetic gingivostomatitis is a manifestation of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and is characterized by high-grade fever and painful oral lesions. While herpetic gingivostomatitis is the most common cause of gingivostomatitis in children before the age of 5, it can also occur in adults. The condition is characterized by a prodrome of fever followed by an eruption of painful, ulcerative lesions of the gingiva and mucosa, and often, yellow, perioral, vesicular lesions. HSV-1 is usually spread from direct contact or via droplets of oral secretions or lesions from an asymptomatic or symptomatic individual. Once a patient is infected with the herpes simplex virus, the infection can recur in the form of herpes labialis with intermittent re-activation occurring throughout life. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of herpes gingivostomatitis and emphasizes the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of herpes gingivostomatitis.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with herpes gingivostomatitis.
- Outline the management options available for herpes gingivostomatitis.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of herpes gingivostomatitis and improve outcomes.
