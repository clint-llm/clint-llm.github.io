The American Heart Association (AHA) identified several key principles, or processes, that improve survival of out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).  These principles are described as "links" in the "OHCA chain of survival."  The first three links in the OHCA chain of survival are early recognition and activation of the emergency response system, providing early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and rapid defibrillation. Survival and subsequent neurologic recovery following an OHCA are dependent on multiple factors. Per review of OCHA literature, predictors of survival include

- Witnessed arrest

- Availability of bystander CPR

- Having a shockable initial rhythm (ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation)

There is an association between a patient achieving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in the field and improved neurologic outcome. The location of a patient’s cardiac arrest is an important factor in their survival. Over seventy percent of OHCAs occur in a private residence, and unfortunately, less than ten percent survive to hospital discharge. Approximately 20% of OHCAs occur in public places.

The placement and use of automated external defibrillators (AED) in public locations with an emergency response plan in place have been shown to double a patient’s odds of survival from cardiac arrest.
