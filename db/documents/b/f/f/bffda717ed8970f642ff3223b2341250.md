Traction alopecia is a common occurrence in Afro-Caribbean hairstyles which involves tight braids. Problems typically start in childhood, where they may initially be reversible. TA is “biphasic” with early disease nonscarring and reversible, whereas chronic disease is scarring and permanent. Population data from South Africa demonstrates it occurs in both children and adults. In this population, TA is ubiquitous in females with up to one-third (31.7%) of adult women showing hair changes. In children of age between, six to 15, the prevalence of this disease ranged from 8.6% to 21.7%. In a study, among African American girls aged 5.4 to 14.3 years, 18% showed signs of TA. The prevalence is also higher in African schoolgirls than boys (17.1% versus 0%) and is higher in females as compared with males (31.7% versus 2.3%, respectively); with affected men more likely to wear cornrows and dreadlocks. The youngest reported case of traction alopecia is a child of eight months of age. Although it is seen in school-aged children, the prevalence increases with age and is highest among adult women.
