A solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) is a single lung nodule measuring less than 3 cm. Even though most cases are benign, it is essential to determine the underlying cause because lung cancer is the leading cause of oncological death in the U.S. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of an SPN and highlights the interprofessional team's role in evaluating and treating patients with this finding.

**Objectives:**
- Review the diagnostic criteria for a solitary pulmonary nodule.
- Summarize the different ways in which a patient may present with a solitary pulmonary nodule. 
- Outline the various methods of managing a solitary pulmonary nodule.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of a solitary pulmonary nodule and improve outcomes.
