Rickettsia akari, an intracellular, gram-negative pathogen, is the etiologic agent of rickettsialpox, which is transmitted by the house mouse mite. Rickettsialpox presents with a triad of a vesicular rash, fever, and eschar. This is a self-limited disease, but the use of antibiotics can shorten the duration of systemic symptoms. This activity describes the pathophysiology, presentation, diagnosis, and management of rickettsialpox and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of Rickettsia akari.
- Review the presentation of Rickettsia akari.
- Describe the treatment and management options available for Rickettsia akari.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team members to promptly detect and treat this condition, which will improve outcomes for patients affected by rickettsialpox.
