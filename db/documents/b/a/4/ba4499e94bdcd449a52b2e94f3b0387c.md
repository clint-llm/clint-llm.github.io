Velopharyngeal dysfunction may result from incomplete closure of the velopharyngeal sphincter, which controls the airflow into the nasal cavity during speech and prevents nasal regurgitation during swallowing. VPD can occur secondary to structural deficits, neurological disorders, faulty learning, or as a syndromic finding.

- **Structural:**The velopharyngeal sphincter may fail to obtain a seal secondary to a cleft palate (overt or submucosal), congenital short soft palate, nasopharyngeal disproportion, poor sphincter mobility from tonsillar hypertrophy, or scarring from prior surgery.

- **Neuromuscular:**Neurologic or musculoskeletal injury may result in incompetent closure of an anatomically-sound velopharyngeal sphincter. Causes include head trauma, stroke, cerebral palsy, myopathy, muscular dystrophy, neuropathy, or progressive degeneration of the pharyngeal plexus secondary to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, Mobius syndrome, or Trisomy 21 syndrome.

- **Developmental/faulty learning:**Poor pronunciation, articulation, or dialectical influences can be learned and emulated by children and masquerade as VPD. VPD may also arise from compensatory mechanisms after cleft palate repair. This includes greater use of nasal sounds (n, m, ng), glides (w, j), voiceless stops (p, t, k), voiceless fricatives (f, s), facial grimacing, and fewer plosives.

- **Pediatric syndromes:**VPD may exist as an associated symptom for many syndromes including Trisomy 21, Klippel-Feil, epidermal nevus syndrome, Turner syndrome, and VATER.
