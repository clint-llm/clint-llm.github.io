Histologically, sialoliths are composed of varying ratios of organic and inorganic materials within an inner core. The inner core is considered the initial sialolith, which subsequently enlarges from the deposition of additional organic and inorganic material, forming the outer lamellae (layers). Inorganic materials include hydroxyapatite, whitlockite, and octacalcium phosphate, with hydroxyapatite being the most prevalent. The exact ratios of inorganic material found within a sialolith depend on the chemical environment in which it forms. Organic materials found within sialoliths include glycoproteins, cellular debris, bacteria, and mucopolysaccharides.Streptococcus genus.
