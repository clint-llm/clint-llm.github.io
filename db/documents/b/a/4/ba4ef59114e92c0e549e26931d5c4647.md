The etiology of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis is not well studied. However, EPS isÂ most commonly seen in patients on long-term peritoneal dialysis diagnosed with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). During peritoneal dialysis, the dialysate typically contains glucose or glucose degradation products which can induce inflammation in the peritoneum. This inflammation can increase endothelial permeability and fibrinogenesis, causing further damage to the peritoneum and leading to fibrin deposition.

Multiple fibrin depositions can form a dense fibro-collagenous capsule around parts of the small bowel, which can cause not only acute bowel obstruction but also malnutrition. A gross image of this clinical presentation can also be seen below. Risk factors in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) include duration of PD, cessation of PD, renal transplantation, peritonitis, young age, low pH, high glucose within dialysate, ultrafiltration failure, and exposure to chlorhexidine.

Also, there are causes of EPS that are not directly related to peritoneal dialysis. Associations include autoimmune diseases, sarcoidosis, peritoneal and intra-abdominal malignancies, chronic peritoneal ascites, intraperitoneal chemotherapy, specific dialysate fluids such as acetate or bioincompatible dialysate, abdominal surgery, endometriosis, intraperitoneal infection (particularly Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis and fungal species), calcineurin inhibitors, and beta-blockers administration.

Renal transplantation shows an increased risk of developing encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis, most commonly seen shortly after the transplantation. It is theorized that this could be due to the profibrotic effects and immunosuppressive medication such as calcineurin inhibitors. It could also possibly be due to the acute cessation of peritoneal dialysis.
