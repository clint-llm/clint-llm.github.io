Ebstein anomaly displays a spectrum of clinical manifestations with variable age at presentation. Most cases present in infancy or childhood but a significant percentage of patients present in adulthood.

The most common physical finding in neonates and infants is cyanosis, present in about 50%.

Studies suggest that slightly over half of adult patients with Ebstein anomaly experience palpitations, with tachyarrhythmias being the first presenting clinical manifestation in almost 40% of those newly diagnosed with Ebstein anomaly.

Sudden cardiac death due to ventricular arrhythmias has been reported with an 8.6% 50-year cumulative incidence from birth.
