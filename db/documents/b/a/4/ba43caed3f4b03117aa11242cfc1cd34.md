The management of PMR is best done by an interprofessional team approach. Patients with polymyalgia rheumatica usually receive an initial evaluation by primary care clinicians. A low threshold for suspicion, timely referral to rheumatology, and excluding giant cell arteritis are important aspects in the initial care of these patients. PMR has a long list of differentials and mimickers and diagnosis may be even more challenging if the patient already has one of those as a coexisting condition. Essential aspects of long-term management are the need for frequent follow-up, vigilance in detecting developing GCA, and the management of relapse or refractory disease. Strong coordination and communication within the interprofessional team are essential for good outcomes.
