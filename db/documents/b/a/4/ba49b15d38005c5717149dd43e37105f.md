# Continuing Education Activity

Lu 177 dotatate therapy is a treatment modality used to manage and treat neuroendocrine tumor patients. This activity reviews the indications, action, and contraindications for Lu 177 dotatate therapy as a valuable agent in the management of neuroendocrine or carcinoid tumors. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors pertinent for members of the interprofessional, multidisciplinary teams involved in managing patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors.

**Objectives:**
- Identify disease-state information about neuroendocrine tumors and carcinoid syndrome.
- Outline the use of Lu 177 dotatate therapy to improve overall survival and progression-free survival in adults with unresectable, advanced, or well or moderately-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors.
- Review the clinical information on the safety and efficacy of Lu 177 dotatate therapy for treating neuroendocrine tumors in adults.
- Summarize the treatment modalities for carcinoid syndrome adult patients.

# Indications

Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies characterized by various presentations associated with indolent biological behavior. These tumors arise from neuroendocrine cells that are distributed in several areas of the body. This review will discuss the disease state information on gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and treatment updates, focussing on lutetium (LU 177 dotatate therapy or peptide receptor radioligand therapy [PRRT]). Secondarily material has also been presented concerning the application of LU177 in NET of the prostate gland.

Neuroendocrine tumors account for less than 1% of all malignancies and comprise a diverse family arising throughout the endocrine system, including the GI tract, bronchi, thymus, and adrenal glands. The most common locations are gastrointestinal [carcinoid] and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. These are classified based on the degree of differentiation into well, moderately, or poorly differentiated tumors. Well-differentiated NETs arising within the digestive system are referred to as carcinoids. Gastrointestinal (GINETS) and pancreatic NETs (PNETs) may have similar characteristics by histology but has variable clinical behavior and biology.

Pancreatic NETs have a relatively worse prognosis than GINETs and respond differently to therapies, with most agents demonstrating relatively higher responses with PNETs than those with GINETs.

Patients with the symptomatic disease will be treated initially with somatostatin analogs that are highly effective in controlling the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome and also control tumor growth. The treatment decisions are based on the patient's clinical presentation with hormonal symptoms and the type of treatment received before the progression. All NET patients need staging evaluation with dotatate gallium-68 imaging to assess the somatostatin receptors.

Cu-64 is a PET isotope similar to gallium-68 that can be produced in quantities to meet the clinical needs of imaging centers without the supply shortages of nuclear generator-based PET isotopes. Cu -64-DOTATATE has advantages over Ga-68-dotatate in detecting significantly more NET lesions than Ga-68-dotatate. The shelf life of Cu-64 is over 24 hours, and the scanning window of at least 3 hours makes Cu-64-dotatate logistically more favorable to use in the outpatient clinical setting.

A subset of patients with clinical or radiological progression after somatostatin analogs are managed with debulking palliative surgery, liver-directed interventions such as chemoembolization, or systemic radiolabeled somatostatin analogs such as  Luthathera (Lu177-dotatate).[

Lu177-dotatate has efficacy in treating NET in other non-endocrine organs, such as the prostate.

# Mechanism of Action

Lu-177 dotatate therapy is a form of endo-radiotherapy that combines a radionuclide with a peptide that specifically binds to peptide receptors. The high affinity to these SSTRs causes internalization of the receptor–peptide complex by endocytosis. These peptide receptors (somatostatin receptors) are expressed to a high concentration on tumor cells as assessed by gallium-68 pet scans.

The FDA approved it in 2018 to treat somatostatin receptor (SSTR) positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Most NETs show relatively high expression levels of SSTRs, which allows imaging and therapy using radiolabeled somatostatin analogs. Lutetium 177 is a commonly used radionucleotide for targeted radiation therapy. The combination of radionucleotide lutetium 177 with somatostatin analog dotatate delivers ionizing radiation targeting tumor cells that express somatostatin receptors causing radiation-induced double-stranded DNA breaks leading to apoptosis. This action is more specific for somatostatin receptor-positive lesions.

Based on recent clinical studies, this treatment yielded a response rate of up to 30%, with over 33% having symptomatic treatment. However, long-term effects include renal dysfunction, pancytopenia, and myelodysplastic syndrome. This treatment is indicated commonly for well-differentiated tumors where somatostatin receptor expression is relatively high. Lu-dotatate is the treatment of choice for well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors and especially those who progress despite using long-acting somatostatin analogs. This treatment is favored over monitoring or administering targeted therapies such as everolimus or sunitinib.

Lu-177-dotatate is administered as an intravenous infusion in an outpatient setting. The recommended dose is  7.4 GBq (200 mCi) every eight weeks for four doses. Dose adjustments may be needed based on patients' renal and hematological parameters. Long-acting somatostatin analogs will be discontinued for at least four weeks before initiating this therapy. However, short-acting octreotide is prescribed as needed for symptom control. After the therapy, long-acting somatostatin analogs are continued every four weeks until the disease progresses.

The global phase III NETTER-1 trial is the most compelling evidence of clinical benefit for Lu-177 (Lu-dotatate) in midgut GINETs. In this study, 229 patients with inoperable, somatostatin-receptor-positive midgut NETs who experienced progressive disease on standard doses of long-acting octreotide were randomly assigned to four doses of Lu-dotatate every eight weeks (116 patients) or long-acting octreotide 60 mg administered intramuscularly every 28 days (113).

The estimated PFS rate at month 20 was significantly higher, with Lu-dotatate (65.2 versus 10.8 percent) reaching statistical significance. Among patients evaluable for radiographic response, Lu-dotatate showed a significantly higher objective response rate (18 versus 3 percent) compared to octreotide. The treatment-related serious adverse events (SAE) are more common with Lu-dotatate (9 versus 1 percent). The most common adverse event in the Lu-Dotatate was nausea, possibly due to the amino acid infusions administered during therapy for renal protection. Lu-Dotatate is associated with hematologic toxicities due to irradiation of the bone marrow. The Netter-1 study reported mild degrees of thrombocytopenia (25 percent), lymphopenia (18 percent, t), anemia (14 percent), and leukopenia (10 percent) that occurred four to six weeks after each infusion and resolved within eight weeks.

This treatment also has an impact on the quality of life. A study concluded that the time to deterioration in the quality of life was significantly longer with Lu-Dotatate compared with h octreotide in several domains, including global health status, physical functioning, role functioning, fatigue, pain, diarrhea, disease-related worries, and body image. The differences were clinically significant in global health status (median time to deterioration in the quality of life was 28.8 versus 6.1 months) and physical functioning (25.2 versus 11.5 months).

Long-term outcomes in a later analysis, five years after the last patient, were randomized (median follow-up of 76 months in both groups).

Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was reported with this treatment. Based on this data from the NETTER-1 trial, Lu-dotatate was approved to treat somatostatin-receptor-positive gastroenteropancreatic NETs in adults. The recommended dose is 7.4 GBq (200 millicuries), with an intravenous infusion every eight weeks for four doses. There are no definitive selection criteria for Lu-dotatate. The European Society guidelines suggested Lu-dotatate therapy for an inoperable metastatic grade 1 and 2 well-differentiated NET with sufficient tumor uptake on diagnostic somatostatin receptor-based imaging and with adequate renal and bone marrow reserve.

# Administration

The most common adverse effect associated with Lu-dotatate therapy is nausea. The incidence is up to 60%, associated with the amino acid infusions administered along with the treatment for renal protective effects. Beyond the administration day, the incidence of nausea has been substantially low. Hematological toxicities, including thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, anemia, or leukopenia, were reported in the range of 10 to 25%. They are expected to occur after four weeks of infusion, which can last an average of 8 weeks.

There are risks associated with radiation risks that need close monitoring and counseling. Following each treatment, low radiation activity levels occur due to the ongoing decay of radionucleotide disintegration. After the day of the treatment, the amount of radiation released is not harmful to surrounding individuals. This limited radiation could trigger alarms at international airports.

The most severe long-term toxicity associated with PRRT, with a median incidence of one year after completion of PRRT, is a therapy-related myeloid neoplasm, such as myelodysplastic syndrome, acute leukemia, or myeloproliferative neoplasms. The incidence was approximately 0.5 to 2%.

The definitive patient-related risk factors that could potentially place them at higher risk of developing therapy-related neoplasms are unknown. However, advanced age and bone metastasis are the potential risk factors that need further confirmation.

Therefore the patients at high risk for developing myeloid neoplasms require close monitoring with complete blood counts for at least the first two years after Lu dotatate therapy. Renal dysfunction of up to 20% secondary to glomerular damage by radiation was with PRRT.

The limitations of Lu-dotatate at present also include the complexity of administration. The Lu dotatate infusion is currently administered in the nuclear medicine department and needs thorough communication with medical oncology.

# Adverse Effects

PRRT is associated with improved clinical outcomes, including overall survival and progression-free survival. It is also related to improving clinical symptoms and quality of life. PRRT enhances the quality of life parameters such as global health status, physical functioning, and other symptoms such as fatigue, diarrhea, and body image. The median time for quality of life deterioration is significantly higher with PRRT, with a difference of over 22 months.

A long-term retrospective study on  468 advanced NET patients who underwent at least two cycles of Lu-177 PRRT showed improved quality of life and biochemical markers substantially in most patients. With a median follow-up of 46 months, most of these patients achieved excellent disease control. The overall survival at seven years was close to 80%.

Lu-177-PRRT was reported as a safe therapeutic option in heavily pre-treated somatostatin receptor-positive bronchial NET patients with comparable efficacy and safety profile to other systemic treatment options. A retrospective analysis of 25 bronchial NET patients showed a median PFS  of 17 months and an OS of 42 months.

# Contraindications

There are a few limitations to Lu-dotatate therapy. The treatment is quite expensive and complex in terms of administration. Ongoing clinical trials are comparing Lu-dotatate therapy with other targeted systemic treatments. Also, this is available at tertiary centers, and that would be limited its widespread availability. The optimal selection of the candidates has been challenging.

# Monitoring

A multidisciplinary team provides an integrated approach for treatment decisions to achieve the best clinical outcomes—interventional radiology, medical oncology, and surgical oncology of the critical stakeholders for individualized patient-centered treatment decisions. Randomized clinical trials with a head-to-head comparison with other treatment options, such as targeted therapies, are now unavailable. Therefore, no data suggests an optimal sequence of treatment strategies for treating metastatic neuroendocrine tumors. Therefore eligible patients are encouraged to enroll in open clinical trials.

# Toxicity

PRRT involves complex clinical and navigational patient needs and thorough inter-departmental communication for preparing a patient for each therapy. A nurse navigator is vital in providing a cohesive solution to address the multifaceted operational requirements associated with PRRT. The navigator offers critical ambulatory support to each patient throughout the treatment journey by delivering multi-disciplinary coordination and patient education, monitoring treatment-related adverse effects, and following radiation safety protocols.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

An interprofessional team provides an integrated approach for treatment decisions in NET to achieve the best clinical outcomes. Given the newness of this agent, all clinicians, specialists, nurses, and pharmacists (particularly nuclear medicine specialty pharmacists) on the case need to remain updated on the latest clinical trials and share their findings with the rest of the team so that everyone has the latest clinical data from which to operate.

Therapies such as Lu 177 hold promise in treating this otherwise doleful clinical situation. Where possible, patients should be encouraged to enter clinical trials. Their service benefits future patients.
