Patients diagnosed with fungal endophthalmitis should be counseled on the importance of medication adherence and the consequences of inadequate treatment. The discomfort of intravitreal injections and the cost of antifungal agents, especially voriconazole, are among the patient factors that inhibit treatment compliance. Patients should be made aware that early and aggressive treatment of fungal endophthalmitis can lead to better outcomes. Otherwise, ocular fungal infections will persist and lead to worsening outcomes.
