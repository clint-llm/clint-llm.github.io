Lactose intolerance is a clinical syndrome that manifests with characteristic signs and symptoms upon consuming food substances containing lactose, a disaccharide. Normally upon lactose consumption, it is hydrolyzed into glucose and galactose by the lactase enzyme, which is found in the small intestinal brush border.

Lactase deficiency is the commonest type of disaccharidase deficiency. Enzyme levels are at the peak shortly after birth and decline after that, despite continued lactose intake. Among the animal world, nonhuman mammals generally lose their ability to digest lactose into its components as they reach adulthood. Certain populations of the human species, such as those of South American, Asian, and African descent, tend to develop lactase deficiency. On the contrary, people of northern Europe origin or northwestern India usually retain the ability to digest lactose into adulthood.

Lactose intolerance presents with abdominal bloating and pain, loose stools, nausea, flatulence, and borborygmi.
