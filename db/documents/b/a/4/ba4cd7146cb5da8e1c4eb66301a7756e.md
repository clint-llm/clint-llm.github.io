The prognosis for necrotizing enterocolitis depends on the severity of the condition at the time it is recognized and treatment is started. The overall mortality ranges from 10% to 50%. However, for infants with advanced necrotizing enterocolitis, including the full-thickness destruction of the intestinal wall which leads to perforation and peritonitis, mortality approaches 100%.
