Plasma glucose estimation is prescribed in different clinical and physiological scenarios. Screening and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose tolerance, fasting hyperglycemia, etc., are based on the plasma glucose level of random, fasting, or 2 hours post-prandial blood specimen. A glucose tolerance test is also done to diagnose and confirm the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM). Diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) can be made based on plasma glucose levels at different specific time intervals after the glucose load. Random plasma glucose (RBG) is frequently prescribed in the emergency department and intensive care units while handling critically ill patients.
