Otoacoustic emissions (OAE) are sounds generated from the cochlea transmitted across the middle ear to the external ear canal, where they can be recorded.

The production of sound from the cochlea is due to the cochlear amplifier and builds upon the traveling wave theory developed by Georg von Bekesy in the 1940s.

In 1978, David Kemp recorded sounds from the external ear canal that were entirely cochlear in origin and contained more energy than the initial stimulus.

In humans, the cochlear amplifier allows us to develop sensitive detection and frequency resolution to distinguish the critical nuances of speech. The cochlear amplifier is lost in patients with sensorineural hearing loss, whichÂ manifests as poor speech discrimination.
