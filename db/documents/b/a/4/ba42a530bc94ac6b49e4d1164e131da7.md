The ophthalmic artery, which branches off the internal carotid artery, supplies the majority of the bloody supply to the orbit and extraocular muscles. The superior oblique muscle gets its vascular supply from the lateral muscular branch of the ophthalmic artery, which also gives blood to the lateral and superior rectus muscles as well as the levator palpebrae superioris muscle. The ophthalmic artery also branches into the medial muscular branch, which supplies blood to the remaining extraocular muscles.

Venous drainage of the superior oblique muscle is similar to the remaining extraocular muscles. Deoxygenated blood from the muscles first reaches the four vortex veins arising from the posterior aspect of the eye then empties into the superior and inferior orbital veins. The orbital veins, also known as the ophthalmic veins, then drain into the cavernous sinus.
