**Important Considerations in the Differential Diagnosis for Adult SD**

**Scalp**

- Psoriasis - usually nonpruritic and tends to affect the occipital and frontal regions, whereas SD tends to affect the vertex and parietal regions

- Eczema (contact) -due to the use of different shampoo and hair dye

- Darier’s disease - yellowish-brown clusters of rough dome-shaped papules in Seborrheic distribution; acanthosis

**Face**

- Psoriasis - rarely occurs in isolation; pitted nails

- Lupus erythematosus (LE) – discoid LE is associated with skin atrophy and scarring alopecia

- Rosacea – look for erythema and telangiectasia; it may cause Meibomianitis, along the posterior lid line

- Acne vulgaris – look for comedones, which are its hallmark

- Staphylococcal blepharitis (anterior lash line)

- Eczema (contact) - eyelids commonly involved (irritant - dry, scaly; or allergic - swollen, vesicular)

- Darier’s disease- Nail changes

**Trunk**

- Psoriasis - sharply-defined red plaques with a loose, silvery lamella scale

- Pityriasis rosea - herald spot; collarette scale; Christmas tree distribution

- Pityriasis versicolor - not symmetrical; hypo/hyperpigmentation

- Subacute lupus erythematosus - photosensitive distribution

- Eczema (nummular) - intense pruritus

- Tinea corporis - raised leading edges and central clearing; uncommon in infants

- Erythema annulare centrifugum - recurrent polycyclic lesions that slowly expand and disappear

- Darier disease - Greasy wart-like papules and plaques

- Grover disease (transient acantholytic dermatosis) - acanthosis

- Drug reaction - drug history (neuroleptic; immunosuppressant; PUVA; lithium)

- Parapsoriasis - elderly; very slow growing; resistant to treatment

- Pemphigus foliaceus - fragile, painful blisters - Nikolsky sign is positive

- Secondary syphilis - lesions on the palms and soles; a history of chancre

**Intertriginous Areas**

- Psoriasis (inverse) - sharply-defined border

- Dermatitis (Contact) - itchy; vesicular

- Tinea cruris - advancing border; very uncommon in infants

- Erythrasma - coral-red fluorescence under Wood Lamp

- Candidiasis - satellite lesions; obesity; a history of immunodeficiency

- Hailey-Hailey disease (familial benign pemphigus) - acanthosis

**Important Considerations in the Differential Diagnosis for ISD**

**Cradle Cap**

- Tinea capitis - (look for broken hairs or “black dots”); very uncommon in adults

- Impetigo - yellow, honey-colored crusting

**Diaper Region**

- Irritant contact dermatitis – tends to spare the skin folds

- Candidiasis – either secondary or from colonization with fecal yeast; look for satellite lesions

- Infantile psoriasis – sharply-defined red plaques with silver scale

- Histiocytosis X (Langerhans cell histiocytosis) – tends to be confined to the skin folds with a purpuric rash on the body

- Acrodermatitis enteropathica – look for periorificial involvement and check zinc levels
