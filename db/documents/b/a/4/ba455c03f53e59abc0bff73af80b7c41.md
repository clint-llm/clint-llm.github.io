A photographic scale has been in use for staging alopecia in African-American women. The central scalp alopecia scale used for African-American women helps assess the severity of the hair loss in central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia. It is graded on a scale of 0 to 5. The grade 0 suggests normal hair density and grade 5 suggestive of severe alopecia.
