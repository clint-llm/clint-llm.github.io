The facet joint (zygapophyseal joints) are located throughout the spine and vary in size and shape depending on the vertebral level.****It is estimated that the joint space has a capacity of 1Â to 2 mL.

The facet joint has many functions, including limiting excessive motion, distributing the axial load, and preventing displacement from forward and rotational movements of the intervertebral joint**.**Facet joint innervation comes from the medial branch of the posterior ramus of the spinal nerve. With each facet joint, sensory information is provided through dual innervation from the spinal nerve at the same level and one level above.

It is estimated that facet joint pain is the source of pain in up to 67% of patients with neck pain, 48% of patients with thoracic pain, and up to 45% of patients with low back pain.****

Nociceptive nerve fibers, autonomic nerve fibers, substance p nerve fibers, and inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins and cytokines have all been implicated in playing a role in facet joint pain. Amongst the different types of facet joint pain etiologies, degenerative osteoarthritis is the most common cause. Other causes of facet joint pain include degenerative spondylolisthesis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and septic arthritis.
