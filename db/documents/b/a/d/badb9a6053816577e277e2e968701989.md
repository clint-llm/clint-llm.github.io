The most common complications of radiation for keloid treatment, with occurrences around 30%, are erythema and pigment related changes (hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation). Acute complications, which can arise during radiation or seven to ten days after treatment, are related to the total dose of radiation given. These can manifest as erythema, edema, desquamation, ulceration, or necrosis. Late complications can occur weeks to months after treatment and are related to the dose of radiation given per session. These include pigmentary changes (hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation), alopecia, atrophy, and telangiectasis. Although seen in less than 1% of cases, infection and wound dehiscence are also possible complications of keloid treatment. Use of an emollient and steroid ointment after radiation treatment can help reduce the risk of side effects.
