**Glycogenesis**

Glycogenesis or glycogen synthesis is a multi-step process that begins with converting glucose to glucose-6-phosphate via hexokinase or the liver isoform of hexokinase known as glucokinase. This process is an essential step as the addition of a phosphate group traps glucose within the cell.Â  G6P subsequently converts to glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) via phosphoglucomutase. G1P converts to UDP glucose via glucose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase, which requires UTP as an additional substrate.

However, before glycogen synthase works, it requires a glycogen primer. Glycogenin synthesizes this initial primer for glycogen synthase. Briefly, glycogenin acts by attaching a UDP-glucose molecule at its 1C position to a hydroxyl group on a tyrosine residue, which causes UDP to exit, and the primer subsequently grows to 10 to 20 glucose residues long.

**Glycogenolysis**

Glycogenolysis or glycogen breakdown primarily requires glycogen phosphorylase and debranching enzyme. Glycogen phosphorylase involves the entry of phosphate (Pi) and PLP (Pyridoxal Phosphate), a cofactor derived from Vitamin B6.
