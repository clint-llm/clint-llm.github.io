Trigeminal neuralgia affects 4 to 13 per 100000 people annually. Women are affected more compared to men. The male-to-female prevalence ratio ranges from 1 to 1.5 to 1 to 1.7. Most cases occur after age 50; some cases are seen in the second and third decades and are very rarely seen in children.

The development of trigeminal neuralgia in a young person should raise suspicion of multiple sclerosis. The prevalence of TN in patients with multiple sclerosis is between 1 and 6.3%. It is also reported that patients with hypertension have a slightly higher incidence of TN compared to the general population.
