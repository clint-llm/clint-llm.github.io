The onset of pain symptoms may vary from days to years after having a stroke. Most frequently, the symptoms start within the first six months but can develop after ten years of infarction. The prevalence of alterations in stimulus perception after stroke is variable, ranging from 11% to 85% of patients with strokes, and the prevalence of having central post-stroke pain is 8% to 46% (based on retrospective studies). Some studies have shown that central post-stroke pain is more prevalent in patients with lateral medullary syndrome (Wallenberg syndrome), and 25% of those can occur within six months. Central post-stroke pain after lateral medullary infarction may occur sub-acutely with the average period of 4 weeks (range 1 to 24 weeks). There is the difficulty in assessing the incidence of central post-stroke pain due to confounding the effect of other causes of chronic pain in patients with stroke, for example, shoulder pain, painful shoulder spasticity, primary headaches like a tension-type headache, or various musculoskeletal pains particularly affecting knees and hips. The incidence and duration of central post-stroke pain are not related to gender or age of the patient nor the side of the lesion.
