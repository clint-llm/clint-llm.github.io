Babesiosis is a parasitic infection caused by protozoa of the genus Babesia. Babesia species have been subdivided into four categories, known as clades. Babesia microti is the most prevalent and well-described species and is classified as a Clade 1 organism. Babesiosis is typically acquired by bites from ticks carrying the protozoa. As the parasite infects erythrocytes (red blood cells), the infection can be acquired through blood transfusion and therefore can occur in persons who have not traveled to endemic areas. Transplacental transmission has also been reported.

Babesia typically infects the red blood cells and may appear oval or pear-shaped. The ring form and the peripheral location in the red blood cell often cause misinterpretation of the smear for plasmodium falciparum. However, unlike plasmodium hemolysis is rare in babesiosis. However, the increased aggregation and rigidity of the RBC often leads to the development of acute respiratory distress and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. The fragmentation of the red blood cells can also lead to blockage of the capillaries in many other organs. The spleen is responsible for trapping the damaged red cells and can become enlarged. Patients without a spleen tend to have a more severe course of the disease.

The tick that transmits Babesia, the Ixodes tick, is the same vector that also transmits B.Burgdorferi.
