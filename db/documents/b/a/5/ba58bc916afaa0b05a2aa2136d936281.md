Adenoiditis is often seen clinically as a component of rhinosinusitis or pharyngitis. Because of this, healthcare providers often follow clinical management guidelines for rhinosinusitis and pharyngitis when approaching adenoiditis treatment.

**Medical Management**

**Observation**

If the clinician believes the cause of adenoiditis is the common cold or other common viral infection, they should refrain from using antibiotics. Typically, uncomplicated upper respiratory viral infections will resolve within five to seven days.

**Antibiotic Treatment**

If symptoms continue or clinical presentation is suggestive of bacterial etiology, such as a high fever or purulent discharge from the nose or throat, the first-line management is antibiotics covering the most common pathogens. Amoxicillin is a commonly used first-line agent due to its good coverage and minimal side-effect profile. Alternatively, cefdinir or cefuroxime may be used, particularly if the patient has not responded to amoxicillin. If the patient has a penicillin allergy, alternatives include clarithromycin or azithromycin. Effective antibiotic treatment should improve symptoms in 48 to 72 hours. Treatment duration should be ten days, as treating for a shorter duration yields significant relapse rates and breeds antibiotic resistance. If the condition fails to improve after a course of amoxicillin or other first-line agents, amoxicillin-clavulanate should be prescribed to eliminate potential beta-lactamase-producing organisms.

**Allergy Treatment**

If the adenoiditis is believed to be secondary to environmental allergies, the patient can be given a trial of nasal steroid sprays, oral steroids, oral antihistamines, or some combination thereof to see if this produces any relief in symptoms. If this is effective, the patient may benefit from formal allergy testing followed by immune-modulating therapy to provide definitive relief. Saline sprays and nasal rinses may also play a role in these cases.

**Reflux Treatment**

If the adenoiditis is believed to be secondary to LPR/GERD, treatment of this condition using lifestyle and diet modification and elevation of the head of the bed with or without the use of H2 blockers or proton-pump inhibitors may provide sufficient relief of symptoms.

**Surgical Management**

**Adenoidectomy**

In the absence of symptomatic improvement after treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate or if the patient has multiple episodes of adenoiditis requiring antibiotic treatment, referral to an otolaryngologist is warranted for further evaluation and potential surgical intervention. Depending on the circumstances, surgical procedures may include adenoidectomy with or without tonsillectomy, myringotomy with tympanostomy tube placement, or endoscopic sinus surgery. If the patient meets the Paradise criteria for tonsillectomy, most otolaryngologists will remove the adenoids at the same time to remove another possible source of recurrent infections.
