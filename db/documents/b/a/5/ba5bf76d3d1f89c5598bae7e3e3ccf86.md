WALANT hand surgery enhances patient safety by eliminating the risks associated with sedation and tourniquet. Its minimalistic approach makes it ideal in an ambulatory setting, minimizing healthcare disparities through better healthcare access. Patients living far from the hospital or in a healthcare-poor region can have access to surgical care. Other benefits include decreased patient cost, less time spent out of work, and less time waiting to schedule surgery.

In times of the COVID-19 epidemic, WALANT provides an opportunity for patients to receive surgical care without taking up valuable OR time for emergent cases. Additionally, it decreases exposure between patients, hospital, and staff as it can be performed outside the operating room.
