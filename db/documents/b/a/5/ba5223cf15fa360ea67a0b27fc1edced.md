Drug-induced liver injury is an uncommon but important form of liver disease. When evaluating a patient for liver disease, drug-induced liver injury must always be considered as a possible cause of liver disease as it can be severe and even fatal. It can present in a pattern similar to acute hepatitis, biliary obstruction, chronic hepatitis, acute liver disease or fatty liver disease. Drug-induced liver injury is usually reversible, and the first step in its management is discontinuing the drug. However, drug-induced liver injury is a challenging form of liver disease because of the ever increasing number of drugs used in medical care. Hundreds of drugs have been implicated as the cause. Many of the herbal supplements, dietary supplements and other over the counter medications are often underreported. A lot of research in this field is being undertaken, and there is scope for more.
