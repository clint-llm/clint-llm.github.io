Understanding what a lens is first requires understanding what light is. Light is electromagnetic radiation that exhibits properties of both waves and particles.

A given object is visualized when light rays travel from a principal light source (the sun, light bulbs in a room, etc.), bounce off the atoms on that object’s surface, and eventually travel into the human eye. The cornea and lens focus the light rays onto the retina, which contains a dense grid of photoreceptor cells that detect these light rays.

For the purpose of understanding lenses, one must understand that in a well-lit setting, light rays bounce off of objects (as small as a single atom) in all directions. Of all these nearly infinite light rays, those which come in contact with a lens will have their direction of travel bent or “refracted.” This will ultimately lead to the ability to recreate images of objects. Pictures are made when images are recreated on film or on a grid of photoreceptors. Vision results when images are recreated on the retina in the back of the eye. Lenses make all of this possible.
