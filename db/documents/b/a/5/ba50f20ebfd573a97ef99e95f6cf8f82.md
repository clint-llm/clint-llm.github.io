Yolk sac tumors are rare tumors that can occur in both genders and may be found in the ovary, testes, and other body parts. Yolk sac tumors are commonly observed in young children.

**Yolk Sac Tumors in Males**

Yolk sac tumors of the testis have a bimodal age distribution, young children under the age of 3, and post-pubertal adults.

In children, the yolk sac tumor is the most common testicular neoplasm. It makes up about 30% of the germ cell tumors in this age group, with a median age of diagnosis at 18 months. Usually, children have pure yolk sac tumors, and their prognosis is good. In adults, yolk sac tumors typically present mixed germ cell tumors and present in the second to third decades of life.

**Yolk Sac Tumors in Females**

Yolk sac tumors are uncommon neoplasms in the ovary, and they account for 15% of all ovarian germ cell tumors; they present in early life and rarely after the age of 40. The median age of diagnosis is 19 years, and 40% of patients are diagnosed in the prepubertal period. About 60% of ovarian yolk sac tumors present in a pure form, while 40% present with mixed germ cell tumors.
