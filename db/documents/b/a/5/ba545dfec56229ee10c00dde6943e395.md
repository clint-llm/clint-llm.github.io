There is a broad range of differential diagnoses for ADH considering the variation in presentation and the variety of symptoms associated with it. Before imaging, a diaphragmatic hernia is unlikely to be high up the differential list for causation of the patient's symptoms, except perhaps in cases associated with trauma. After imaging, an alternative diagnosis that should merit consideration isÂ metastasis, particularly with small defects.
