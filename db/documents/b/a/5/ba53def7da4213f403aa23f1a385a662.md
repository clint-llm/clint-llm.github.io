Based upon the SMFM Guideline on Twin-Twin Transfusion Syndrome, an ultrasound at 10 to 13 weeks evaluating viability, chorionicity, crown-rump length, and nuchal translucency is recommended for women with twin gestation. Future development of TTTS is associated with the crown-rump length and nuchal translucency abnormalities. Additional ultrasound findings that are associated with TTTS include velamentous umbilical cord insertion and intertwin membrane folding. Once MCDA twin gestation is established, it is recommended that women return for ultrasound scanning every two to four weeks to monitor for development of TTTS, which typically develops in the second trimester and is usually seen between 16 and 26 weeks.

At 16 weeks, it is recommended to begin performing an ultrasound to assess MVP in each amniotic sac as well as fetal bladders with repeat scans every two weeks until delivery. This frequency of scanning is recommended due to the variability in progression to TTTS. Delivery timing differs depending upon individual characteristics of each pregnancy complicated by TTTS, including stage and intervention effects; thus, taking these characteristics in mind, SMFM recommends delivery timing around 34 to 37 weeks if possible. To promote fetal lung maturation, SMFM also recommends considering steroids between gestational ages of 24 to 34 weeks, especially due to the higher risk of preterm birth in this population.

Limited data demonstrate the benefit of utilizing doppler studies of the umbilical artery as a screening tool for TTTS, but the SMFM states it can be used when a discrepancy in size and/or fluid is noted. Doppler studies of the umbilical artery, umbilical vein, and ductus venosus in each twin help establish staging once TTTS is diagnosed. SMFM also recommends fetal echocardiography in MCDA twin gestations due to the increased risk of congenital heart disease in this population, especially in gestations with TTTS, which negatively affects the recipient twin’s heart. Due to the increased risk of preterm labor and miscarriage in both twin gestations and TTTS, in addition to shortened cervix occurring in about 6% to 7% of pregnancies complicated by TTTS, evaluating the cervix length has also been recommended.
