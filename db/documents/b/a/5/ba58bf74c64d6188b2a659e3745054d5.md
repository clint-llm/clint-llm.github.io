Patient education on medical compliance, clinical follow-up, and wound care is essential, especially in patients who required stent placement,Â biliary diversion, choledochoduodenostomy, or a Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy. Patients should be educated intensively on discharge and referred to wound care nursing if needed to prevent secondary infections and their associated complications.
