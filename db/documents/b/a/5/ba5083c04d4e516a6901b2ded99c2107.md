Brow ptosis is a common presenting complaint in aging patients; it can affect patients' quality of life because of its cosmetic impact and visual field obstruction. Brow ptosis is the descent of the eyebrow from its normal anatomical position down to a point at which its appearance is cosmetically displeasing, or visual field deficits develop as a result of excess soft tissue pushing downwards on the eyelid. An understanding of periorbital anatomy and the aging process is vital to properly care for these patients. This activity reviews the etiology, epidemiology, and pathophysiology of brow ptosis and explains the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of brow ptosis.
- Outline a thorough history/physical examination for periorbital aging.
- Explain the management options available for brow ptosis.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients with brow ptosis.
