Eisenmenger syndrome is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a cardiologist, pulmonologist, cardiac surgeon, internist, thoracic surgeon, and intensivist. There are many causes of the disorder and the key is to treat the primary disorder. Once Eisenmenger syndrome develops, the prognosis is poor. Heart and lung transplant is an option but the lack of donors is a problem. Medications to dilate the pulmonary vasculature are not reliable or consistent in their efficacy. Most patients are dead within 12 to 24 months after the diagnosis is made.
