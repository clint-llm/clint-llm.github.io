Tracheal abnormalities requiring reconstruction are rare but can affect patients of all ages. Tracheal stenosis makes up 1% of all laryngotracheal stenoses, but mortality can range from 20 to 30% and reach as high as 70% when present within the first month of life. Tracheal anomalies are typically divided into two categories: congenital and acquired. Congenital lesions are present at birth and frequently present in conjunction with other abnormalities. Concomitant cardiopulmonary abnormalities are present in up to 50% of patients. This activity outlines the approach to the diagnosis and management of tracheal stenosis. Throughout the activity, the role of the multidisciplinary team will be highlighted in both evaluation and management of patients requiring tracheal reconstruction.

**Objectives:**
- Review the complex nature of tracheal abnormalities.
- Describe the relevant anatomy pertinent to tracheal surgery. 
- Outline a stepwise approach for managing tracheal stenosis.
- Summarize the approaches to tracheal reconstruction and how to manage complications.
