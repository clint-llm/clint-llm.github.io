**PSA Testing**

PSA is a serine protease enzyme produced by the columnar epithelial cells of the prostatic ducts and acini.

There are multiple causes for an elevated PSA which have nothing to do with cancer, including prostate disease, trauma, inflammation, prostatitis, urogenital procedures, biopsies, prostatic enlargement, etc. Some physicians will recommend a two to six-week course of prostate-specific antibiotics (usually a quinolone, doxycycline, or sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim) to attempt to lower the PSA if due to prostatitis or low-grade inflammation and avoid further investigations for possible prostate cancer; however, this practice is controversial and not generally recommended as a number of studies have failed to show a significant benefit to this approach.

Elevated Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) levels (usually greater than 4 ng/ml) in the blood are how 80% of prostate cancers initially present, even though elevated PSA levels alone correctly identify prostate cancer only about 25% to 30% of the time. At least two abnormal PSA levels or the presence of a palpable nodule on a digital rectal examination (DRE) are required to justify further investigation or a biopsy.

In 2012, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended not performing routine prostate cancer screening using PSA testing, giving it a grade D recommendation. This was based on the early results of two large trials that suggested too much overdetection and overtreatment of low-risk prostate cancer compared with too little benefit. This was bitterly contested by many groups and individuals who pointed out the many significant procedural and statistical errors in the studies, the immaturity of the data, the numerous studies that consistently showed a 50% cancer-specific long-term survival advantage in screened populations, and the terrible consequences if their conclusions turned out to be incorrect.

The value of PSA screenings remains somewhat controversial due to concerns about possible continuing overtreatment of low-risk cancers, overdiagnosis, complications from "unnecessary biopsies," the presumed "limited" actual survival benefit from early diagnosis and treatment, and the true value of definitive therapy intended to cure.

In an attempt to improve on standard PSA testing alone, many alternative pre-biopsy screening tests are now available:

Free and Total PSA:****The percentage of free PSA in the blood can be a useful indicator of malignancy. A free PSA percentage is considered valid if the total PSA is between 4 and 10 ng/ml. The free PSA percentage is calculated by multiplying the free PSA level by 100 and dividing it by the total PSA value.

The actual risk estimates will vary by age group, but as a general guide:

- If the free PSA percentage is more than 25%, the cancer risk is less than 10%.

- If the free PSA percentage is less than 10%, the cancer risk is about 50%.

PSA Density is the total PSA divided by the prostatic volume as determined by MRI or ultrasound (US). The formula for the volume of the prostate is prostate volume = width x height x length x pi/6. For most clinical purposes, Pi/6 can be estimated as 0.52 to make the calculations easier. The PSA density is intended to minimize the effect of benign prostatic enlargement. In general, if the PSA density is greater than 0.15, it is considered suggestive of malignancy.

PSA Velocity compares serial and annual PSA serum levels. An annual PSA increase of greater than 0.75 ng/ml or greater than 25% suggests a potential cancer of the prostate (total PSA 4 to 10 ng/ml). If the total PSA is 2.6 to 4 ng/ml, an annual increase of 0.35 ng/ml would be considered suspicious.

**Post-PSA Pre-Biopsy Prostate Cancer Bioassay Risk Stratification Tests**

A number of newer tests have been FDA-approved and introduced to help risk-stratify patients with persistently elevated PSA levels up to 10 mg/ml. The original intention was to eliminate unnecessary biopsies in patients at low risk for prostate cancer. Both blood and urine sample tests are available. Most include several different laboratory tests bundled together to provide a single risk score or estimate. Some require a digital prostate massage prior to specimen collection, and several need significant clinical patient information, which is used in a proprietary algorithm to arrive at their conclusion. Risk stratification bioassay testing is valid, approved, and certified only for PSA levels at or below 10 ng/ml. Patients with a PSA level greater than 10 ng/ml will generally go directly to a biopsy with or without a preliminary MRI. Bioassay risk stratification testing may be justified in selected patients with PSA levels greater than 10 ng/ml who are otherwise reluctant to undergo a biopsy and require further confirmation of their relative risk.

Some tests may have included patients in their testing cohorts that should have been excluded due to PSA levels outside the optimal range, prior biopsies, previous or continuing prostate treatments, or other forms of possible selection bias.

These tests should not be used in patients who would not benefit from the results. Patients with obvious suspicious, hard prostatic nodules or suspected metastatic disease and those with persistent PSA levels over 10 ng/ml would not need this type of testing. Like PSA testing, patients 75 years and older and those with less than a 10-year life expectancy are generally not eligible for bioassay testing as they are unlikely to benefit.

Since they were designed and intended to exclude patients at low risk from further testing and biopsies, the most significant statistic for their use is the "negative predictive value" score. A negative predictive value is defined as the number of test subjects found to be truly negative if their test scores were negative. Generally, a negative predictive value of 90% or more is considered valid and useful for cancer detection, and all FDA-approved, commercially available tests in this category meet that standard. The list of available tests is rapidly expanding, with several more expected to be released commercially soon.

In comparing the various tests, some of the questions to ask and variables to consider in selecting a bioassay risk stratification test include the following:

- Can the test be used for patients on active surveillance? If not, is the testing company doing or considering a study to evaluate its use in these patients?

- Can the test be repeated later if the PSA changes? If so, what degree of change in the PSA would warrant a repeat test?

- Does the test need a blood or a urine sample?

- Does the test include or require a PSA level to be valid and reportable?

- How clear is the final test report? How easy is it to understand?

- How much staff time is needed to obtain and process the test sample, including paperwork?

- How much variability is there in the test results?

- How reliable is the test?

- How many ongoing studies and research is being done for further validation and utility of the test?

- How was the original negative predictive value score obtained?

- Is clinical patient data needed to run the risk stratification algorithm?

- Is clinical patient data needed to obtain a result?

- Is home testing available?

- Is the test available in your area?

- Is the test designed to assess the risk of any prostate cancer or just Gleason pattern 4 and higher?

- Is the test listed as recommended in the NCCN or AUA guidelines?

- Is the test result valid independently without the need to provide any clinical patient data?

- Is the test result valid independently without the need to provide any PSA information?

- Is there a patient version of the test report?

- What about insurance coverage and patient cost? Does the company offer an indigent patient program?

- What is actually being measured? Genetic material (RNA), PSA, PCA3, or other biomarkers?

- What is the average turnaround time?

- What is the expected percentage of "unreportable" test results that will require the patient to repeat the test?

- Will the test results affect patient care or treatment? (If not, then the test may be unnecessary.)

In general, predictive bioassay testing that includes clinical variables (SelectMDx and "4K") has sometimes been considered more reliable than those tests which do not (PHI, "EPI" exosome, and PCA3).

It's been suggested that a superior test would be totally independent of any bias from the medical history, family history, or even the PSA level, allowing such information to be considered by each clinician using their own clinical judgment. Many clinicians prefer those tests which are totally independent of the PSA level and do not require significant patient clinical data yet still offer statistically equivalent and valid results (negative predictive value, etc.), leaving them free to interpret the test report using knowledge of the patient's clinical history and PSA results. A preferred test would be one that the patient could perform at home, is based on genetics, requires minimal staff time to arrange and administer, does not require a prostatic massage, produces few "unreportable" errors that force patients to repeat the process, and still provide over 90% negative predictive value for Gleason pattern 4 disease since lower grade disease is not generally treated.

**Risk Stratification Bioassay Tests**

"ExoDx Prostate Intelliscore (EPI)" or "Exosome Test" uses PCA3 and urinary TMPRSS2:ERG to detect clinically significant prostate cancer. The test analyzes exosomal RNA for three biomarkers known to be expressed in the urine of men with high-grade prostate cancer. A proprietary algorithm is then used to assign a risk score that predicts the presence of high-grade (Gleason Score = 7 or higher, or any Gleason Grade Pattern 4 or 5) prostate cancer. Unlike other urine-based tests for prostate cancer, no digital rectal examination or prostatic massage is required, and a kit for home use kit is available, making testing much more convenient for patients. The overall negative predictive value is 91.3%, with a sensitivity rating of 91.9%.

The "4K" Test measures serum total PSA, free PSA, intact PSA, and human kallikrein antigen 2. It includes clinical DRE results as well as information from any prior biopsies. These results are compared to a very large, age-matched database, and a percentage risk of "significant" prostate cancer is calculated. Clinically significant prostate cancer is usually defined as Gleason 3+4=7 or higher disease. A risk analysis of 10% or more would typically suggest proceeding with a biopsy.  Interestingly, the "4K" test has not been shown to be any better than PSA testing alone when used for tracking active surveillance patients.

MyProstate Score(MPS) is a predictive algorithm developed at the University of Michigan. It includes PSA, PCA3, and urine TMPRSS2:ERG (a genetic fusion found in about 50% of all prostate cancers). One negative is that it requires a prostate massage prior to obtaining an initial urinary stream sample. Future upgrades are under development that would eliminate the need for a prostate massage. Initial reports were uncertain about the MyProstateScore outperforming PCA3 alone, but later validation studies reported sensitivity for Gleason Grade Group 2 or higher disease is 97% with a 98% negative predictive value which is very competitive.

Prostate Cancer Antigen 3 (PCA3) is an RNA-based genetic test performed from a urine sample, usually obtained immediately after a prostatic massage. PCA3 is a long, non-coding RNA molecule that is overexpressed exclusively in prostatic malignancies. It is upregulated 66-fold in prostate cancers. If PCA3 is elevated, it suggests the presence of prostate cancer. It is more reliable than PSA as it is independent of prostate volume. PCA3 is best used to determine the need for a repeat biopsy after initial negative histology. Serial PCA3 testing may also help monitor patients with low-grade prostate cancers on active surveillance.

The Prostate Health Index (PHI) is a blood test that includes free PSA, total PSA, and the [-2] proPSA isoform of free PSA. A formula combines these test results mathematically to give the PHI score. This PHI score appears to be superior to PSA, free and total PSA, and PCA3 in predicting the presence of prostate cancer.

"SelectMDx" is a urine-based test that measures the urinary mRNA levels of the HOXC6 and DLX1 biomarkers following a prostatic digital rectal exam. Measurements are done utilizing reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction technology. Other clinical information such as age, PSA density, family history, prior biopsy results, and digital rectal examination findings are included in the risk stratification analysis and algorithm. Results are reported very straight-forwardly as either:

- Low risk: Very low risk of Gleason 7 or higher disease, where a biopsy may safely be reasonably avoided. The negative predictive value is 99.6% for Gleason 8 or higher disease and 98% for Gleason 7 or higher.

- Increased risk: A biopsy should be considered due to the increased likelihood of finding clinically significant disease.

**Prostate Imaging**

Ultrasound and MRI are the primary imaging modalities used for initial prostate cancer detection and diagnosis.

- During prostate biopsies, transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) can sometimes see a potentially "suspicious hypoechoic area," but ultrasound alone is not a reliable diagnostic test for prostatic malignancy. TRUS is best used for directing the needle for prostate biopsies.

- Prostate MRI has much better soft tissue resolution than ultrasound and can identify areas in the gland that are genuinely "suspicious" with a high degree of accuracy and reliability (positive predictive value greater than 90%).

- In Europe, a positive MRI finding is sometimes sufficient to diagnose prostate cancer without necessarily requiring histological confirmation.

- Prostate MRI is also used for surgical planning in men considering radical prostatectomy and improved biopsies instead of saturation biopsies when cancer is strongly suspected despite a negative initial TRUS-guided biopsy.

- MRI of the prostate may also have a role in active surveillance as an alternative to periodic or repeated biopsies.

Prostatic MRI is becoming a standard imaging modality for diagnosing prostate cancer. It can identify and grade suspicious prostate nodules to help with staging and localization, check for extracapsular extension, evaluate the seminal vesicles for possible tumor involvement, and determine enlargement of regional lymph nodes that might indicate early metastatic disease.

**Prostate Imaging, Reporting, and Data System (PIRADS)**

Unlike CT or x-rays, MRI imaging typically shows denser tissue as dark areas. Standard MRI imaging of the prostate usually requires a 3 Tesla (3T) MRI machine and optimally uses intravenous (IV) contrast, although non-contrast (bi-parametric) MRI tests are quicker, cheaper, and still quite useful. IV contrast will demonstrate early vascular entry (faster inflow) and quicker washout from cancerous lesions or nodules compared to normal prostatic tissue. The use of a flexible, phased array coil that is shaped and worn like a pair of shorts has been designed to further improve prostate MRI imaging by moving the antenna as close as physically possible to the prostate. This modified MRI antenna ("Procure" prostate MRI coil) significantly improves prostate imaging, especially from 1.5 Tesla MRI units, is compatible with most MRI machine manufacturers, and is commercially available. An endorectal coil will also provide improved imaging but is often quite uncomfortable for patients, especially during a lengthy MRI session.

Various MRI tissue characteristics ultimately determine the relative cancer risk, which is documented in the final report as a PIRADS score. A PIRADS score of 1 or 2 is highly unlikely to be cancer. A PIRADS score of 4 or 5 is highly suspicious for clinically significant disease (Gleason 3+4=7 and higher). PIRADS 3 is equivocal. Histological confirmation with a biopsy is recommended for all PIRADS 3, 4, and 5 lesions.

PIRADS 3 lesions usually demonstrate benign histology on biopsy, but low-grade prostate cancer is possible and cannot reliably exclude intermediate or high-grade pathology. About 20% (17% to 25%) of all PIRADS 3 patients biopsied will show intermediate or high-grade prostate cancer pathology.

Recent studies of PIRADS 3 lesions have identified several clinical risk factors clearly associated with significant, higher-grade disease (Gleason score 3+4=7 and higher).

**Risk Factors Identified for PIRADS 3 Lesions**

- Age 70 or older

- Smaller prostate volume (less than 36 cc)

- Presence of a palpable nodule on digital rectal examination

- The size of the lesion or nodule is greater than 0.5 cm

The studies reported that 100% of the PIRADS 3 patients with all the above risk factors positive showed clinically significant disease, and 0% if they had no risk factors.  Incorporating these and other risk factors and genomic analysis testing into a workable clinical algorithm for patients with PIRADS 3 lesions would greatly improve our ability to identify those with aggressive, clinically significant disease while safely avoiding uncomfortable and unnecessary biopsies in the rest. Equivocal cases may benefit from risk stratification bioassay testing.

**MRI Use for Men with Elevated PSA Levels**

Controversial issues include doing an MRI on all men with elevated PSA levels, avoiding biopsies on PIRADS 3 lesions, and possibly avoiding biopsies on all men with negative MRI readings. None of these suggested policies are currently recommended. For example, 20% of PIRADS 3 lesions will show clinically significant (Gleason 4) disease on biopsy, which is considered too high a number to miss.  The degree of variability in image interpretation makes it difficult to be confident in MRI reports alone. Even at experienced centers of excellence for MRI, the negative predictive value (NPV) has been reported as low as 72% to 76%, meaning that a negative MRI report will miss about one in four high-grade prostate cancers.

For this reason, it has been suggested that a bioassay marker be used for additional confirmatory testing in patients with elevated PSA levels who are not proceeding to a prostatic biopsy based on negative MRI findings. Similarly, before starting patients with low-risk disease on long-term active surveillance, a confirmatory genomic biomarker test can help identify individuals at higher risk before any clinical disease progression. 
The addition of a bioassay risk stratification prostate cancer biomarker to a prostatic MRI can help more reliably eliminate unnecessary biopsies, particularly in equivocal situations such as selected PIRADS 3 individuals.

When an MRI identifies a suspicious area, there are several ways to target or highlight the lesion for improved biopsies:

- Cognitive Recognition means that with an understanding of the anatomical location of the suspicious lesion, the urologist can use standard TRUS imaging and target the expected geographic area of the suspicious lesion even without being able to see it directly.

- MRI-TRUS Fusion guidance is now commercially available. This allows the suspicious lesion highlighted on the MRI to be electronically superimposed and merged with the TRUS image, providing a clear visual target for ultrasound-guided biopsies. The equipment currently costs about $150,000, but there is no added reimbursement beyond standard TRUS-guided biopsies at present, which has delayed the widespread implementation of this technology despite its proven benefits.

- Direct MRI Image Guidance for prostate biopsies can be done but generally is not preferred. It is costly, ties up the MRI machine for a lengthy period, needs to be coordinated with the urologist who performs the procedure, and requires special biopsy equipment that can be used during MRI imaging.

A recent meta-analysis concluded that the single most useful predictive factor of not finding significant prostate cancer in men with negative MRI studies (other than a specific biomarker or bioassay test) was a PSA density of less than 0.15 ng/ml.

**Which Should be Done First: Risk Stratification Bioassays or Prostatic MRI?**

There is no general consensus among urologists about this issue. To some degree, this depends on the availability of testing and the relative cost. There are two basic approaches, and both require that patients have a PSA level of less than 10 ng/ml. (Patients with consistent PSA levels >10 should generally go directly to an MRI and a biopsy.) It comes down to a question of what use the clinician wishes to make of the testing: minimize unnecessary biopsies as much as possible or maximize cancer detection.

The "Minimize Unnecessary Biopsies" Approach for Low-Risk Patients: The intention and primary goal of this approach is to minimize as many "unnecessary" prostate biopsies as possible. The bioassay test is done first. If it's negative, no further testing or imaging is necessary, and routine surveillance is resumed. If the bioassay is positive, perform an MRI and proceed with the appropriate prostate biopsy. About 25% of patients will have low or negative values on their bioassay risk analysis, so a biopsy can safely be avoided in these individuals. This approach is best suited for lower-risk patients, PSA <7, men who do not want a biopsy, or where the primary focus is to safely avoid as many prostate biopsies as possible. Overall, this approach can safely avoid about 25% to 33% of biopsies. Some reports have indicated that the maximal implementation of this approach can avoid up to 55% of all prostate biopsies. The bioassay test becomes the primary screening tool in low-risk patients with PSA elevations to determine if a biopsy can safely be omitted.

The "Maximize Cancer Detection" Approach for High-Risk Patients: The main focus is to avoid missing significant cancer, so the MRI is done first. If the MRI is positive (PIRADS 3, 4, or 5), the patient proceeds immediately to a Fusion guided biopsy. A bioassay test can be performed subsequently if the MRI is negative to determine if a TRUS-guided biopsy should still be done. The bioassay test is used here as confirmation of a negative MRI result. For low-risk patients with equivocal findings on MRI (PiRADS 3), performing a bioassay risk stratification test is not unreasonable to help determine the need for a prostate biopsy. For high-risk patients where a biopsy is likely to be done regardless of the MRI or bioassay results, only the MRI should be performed to identify suspicious intraprostatic targets for a fusion-directed biopsy.

Rather than adopt either methodology exclusively, a reasonable approach would be to perform the MRI initially in higher-risk individuals but start with the bioassay risk stratification test first in lower-risk patients where a negative finding would result in continued observation only.

**High-resolution micro-ultrasonography**of the prostate utilizes new specialized ultrasound technology to improve imaging and help detect cancer. High-frequency (29 MHz) micro-ultrasound transducers provide three times the spatial resolution of standard ultrasound.

However, there are a few issues. Performing the prostatic biopsy at the same time as the diagnostic imaging means there is less time for patient discussion and outside review of the findings before the biopsy is done. There is also no time for interdisciplinary evaluations and analysis, such as between urologists and radiologists, for equivocal, difficult, or complex cases.

**Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scanning in Prostate Cancer**

CT scans have many limitations in examining patients for recurrence. They are notoriously poor at detecting prostate cancer metastases or recurrences in patients with low PSA levels. PET scans combine a tissue marker with a radioactive, positron-emitting isotope. The radioligand is administered to the patient, and the tissue marker binds to the target malignancy. The radio-isotope releases positrons that can be identified by nuclear scan imaging. This image can be superimposed on a CT or MRI scan to clearly demonstrate the precise anatomic location of any positron-emitting target tissue, which would represent a metastasis or malignant recurrence. Compared to conventional radiological techniques (CT and MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) scans appear to be far more accurate, highly specific, and can be used to detect very small amounts of metastatic or recurrent malignant disease even at relatively low PSA levels. They are rapidly becoming the new diagnostic standard despite their higher cost.

PSMA PET/MRI scans appear to be diagnostically at least equivalent to PSMA PET/CT imaging, but there have been no head-to-head studies that would allow for a more definitive comparison.

The International Society of Urological Pathology has suggested that PSMA PET/CT could be used in all newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients with significant Gleason grade 4 or any Gleason grade 5 histology PSA >20 or clinical T3 or higher disease.

Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) is a membrane-bound metallopeptidase. It is overexpressed in 90% to 100% of all prostate cancer cells, making it a reliable tissue marker that can be used for tumor-specific imaging and targeted therapy.

There are literally thousands of articles and studies on PubMed covering PSMA. The overall sensitivity and specificity of PSMA-based scanning far exceed any other imaging modality available for prostate cancer detection, staging, or identification of recurrent disease, even with low PSA levels. This is largely due to the incredible overexpression of PSMA in prostate cancer cells (by 100 to 1,000 fold), which results in very high PSMA tracer uptake by prostatic malignancies.

Prostascint, which uses Indium 111 (In) capromab pendetide, is a relatively large compound that includes an antibody targeting an intracellular PSMA glycoprotein. It can only penetrate necrotic prostate cancer cells, as it relies on the loss of cellular phospholipid membrane integrity for intracellular transport.

[F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18-FDG) PET scans are designed to target rapidly growing cells like cancers that absorb glucose faster than normal tissues. F-18-FDG scans use a tagged glucose analog radiotracer molecule which becomes incorporated into malignant cells. The Fluorine-18 tracer ligand then makes the tissue visible on PET scans. F-18-FDG has been available since the late 1990s and has been widely used for various malignancies. However, its use in urology has been limited by its relatively high renal excretion, which hides many malignancies of the urinary tract and the relatively slow metabolic activity of prostate cancer. Higher grade, castration-resistant, and neuroendocrine prostate cancers, which are faster growing and incorporate more F-18 tagged glucose, will tend to show up better on F18-FDG PET scans.

C-11-Acetate is very similar to C-11-Choline, reviewed below. Acetate is quickly absorbed by cells and converted to acetyl-CoA, which is then used primarily for energy or fatty acid production. Malignant prostate cells tend to overproduce fatty acids, and increased fatty acid synthase activity has been associated with the aggressiveness of prostatic malignancies.

C-11-Choline was one of the first FDA-approved PET scans available to detect recurrent prostate cancer. Choline is an essential dietary and cellular nutrient. It supplies methyl groups required for numerous metabolic activities, such as the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin (required for cell membranes), and especially acetylcholine. It also is involved in cell membrane signaling, lipid metabolism, and modulating gene expression. Prostate cancer cells demonstrate a substantially increased uptake and concentration of choline compared to normal prostatic cells. Therefore, radioactive carbon-11 tagged choline molecules can detect high choline absorbing tissues such as metastatic prostate cancer when scanned for areas of focal radioactivity with a PET scan.

**The NCCN has Recommended the Following PET Scans for Prostate Cancer:**

F-18 Sodium Fluoride (F-18 NaF) is a radioactive tracer primarily used to detect skeletal metastases. Higher regional blood flow and bone turnover in malignant prostatic bony metastases cause increased focal radiotracer uptake. F-18 NaF is more sensitive than standard bone scans for identifying bony metastases but does not provide much additional information outside the skeleton.

Fluorine-18-fluciclovine (F-18 fluciclovine) is a radiolabeled amino acid analog of leucine that takes advantage of the upregulated amino acid transport in prostate cancer cells.

Fluorine-18 piflufolastat injection (F-18 piflufolastat, F-DCFPyL) is a fluorine-based molecule that targets PSMA. It is a small molecule that helps visualize PSMA-expressing lymph nodes, soft tissue, and bony metastases in PET imaging. It is able to detect 85% to 87% of prostate cancer metastases.

Gallium 68 (Ga) prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) 11 (Ga-68-PSMA-11) is a larger radiotracer molecule. It interacts directly with the extracellular active zone of PSMA and does not require cell death to be useful.

Both F-18 piflufolastat (F-DCFPyL) and Ga-68-PSMA are currently recommended by the NCCN for both initial prostate cancer staging and the evaluation of biochemical recurrences or disease progression. They have nearly identical sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values for the detection of metastases for initial staging, biochemical recurrences, and suspected disease progression. Studies have indicated that F-18 piflufolastat (F-DICFPyL) and Ga-68 PSMA enjoy a high detection sensitivity for metastases than C-11 choline or F-18 fluciclovine PET imaging, particularly at very low PSA levels, which is why they are currently preferred by the NCCN.

Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT scanning is currently the preferred imaging modality for identifying metastatic sites for targeted prostate cancer therapy and is the basis for an FDA-approved target-seeking selective radiotherapy (Lutetium 177 vipivotide tetraxetan) that is described later.

All of the above PET scans can be used in cases of equivocal bone scans. Ga-68 and F-18 piflufolastat would generally be preferred over the rest for this purpose, except for F-18 NaF, which is particularly well suited as a better alternative to traditional bone scans.

Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT, F-DCFPyl, and similar PSMA and non-PSMA-based PET scans, along with whole-body MRIs, are the new state-of-the-art imaging modalities that can replace the classic CT scan of the abdomen & pelvis as well as the traditional technetium 99 bone scan for the detection and staging of all future prostate cancers.

Other agents currently being investigated as radiotracers for prostate cancer PET scanning include:

- Experimentally, F-18 PSMA-1007 had superior sensitivity and specificity in detecting early biochemical recurrence than Ga-68-PSMA-11.

- Zirconium-89-PSMA-617 (Zr-89-PSMA-617), which is still investigational, has shown superiority in early testing compared to Ga-68-PSMA-11. This is primarily due to the much longer half-life of zirconium-89, which takes several days to decay. This allows for improved imaging, particularly in those prostate cancer patients, about 5% to 10%, who demonstrate relatively low PSMA expression. Animal studies and early human reports indicate superior detection in this group of patients and no inferiority compared to GA-68-PSMA-11 in the remainder.

- F-18 Rhodium PSMA-7.3 PET/MRI is currently undergoing trials at MD Anderson Cancer Center for early biochemical prostate cancer recurrence.

- Cu-64-PSMA performs similarly to F-18-PSMA scans in detecting prostate cancer, but it has a much longer half-life of 12.7 hours.

**Biopsy**

If cancer is suspected, a prostate biopsy is usually performed. This is almost always done with transrectal ultrasound guidance to make sure that all areas of the prostate are adequately sampled. The most commonly used pattern is to take two specimens from each of three areas (base, mid-gland, and apex) on both sides. This is called a 12-core sextant biopsy. The purpose is to better identify the extent and exact location of the tumor.

- A prostate biopsy gun uses a special hollow core needle that can be inserted into the prostate, then quickly advanced, opened, and closed in a fraction of a second to capture a short, thin prostatic tissue sample.

- Antibiotics should be used to prevent infectious complications, usually starting the day before the biopsy and continuing for three days (ciprofloxacin) or 1 to 2 hours before the biopsy. While fluoroquinolones have been the most commonly used antibiotics for prostate biopsy prophylaxis, rising resistance rates have suggested using alternative agents such as cefpodoxime, ceftriaxone, or gentamycin (5 mg/kg). Of these, oral cefpodoxime (200 mg to 400 mg) is commonly recommended as an oral cephalosporin-based antibiotic that avoids the need for parenteral administration, does not contribute to quinolone resistance, and has shown equivalent efficacy for prostate biopsy prophylaxis.

- Pre-biopsy rectal cultures are suggested to help optimize prophylactic antibiotic selection.

- A Fleets enema is recommended shortly before the biopsy to help clean the rectum.

- Consider using a transperineal approach in immunocompromised patients or those at high-risk for infection.

Prostatic imaging with MRI is becoming increasingly important, particularly in highly suspicious cases where the initial non-MRI guided biopsy was negative instead of "saturation" biopsies. Fusion-guided biopsies use the MRI image with the "suspicious" area highlighted as a target and superimpose it over the ultrasound image. The two images are matched, which allows the MRI target to be visible on the transrectal ultrasound so it can be biopsied. The rest of the biopsy procedure is the same.

**The Only Test that can Dependably and Conclusively Confirm a Cancer Diagnosis is Still a Histologically Positive Prostate Biopsy, Which Remains the Recommended Standard of Care.**

Histologically, prostate cancer is classified by its Gleason Score, which is based on its microscopic architecture and cellular arrangement rather than any specific characteristics of its individual cells. This is best described in the companion article on the Gleason Score for Prostate Cancer.

**Genomic (Somatic) Tumor Biomarkers (Post-Biopsy)**

Tissue samples can be analyzed for various genomic tumor markers. Several commercial genomic tests can now reliably estimate a patient's prognosis, tumor aggressiveness, and relative genetic risk from a single prostate cancer tissue sample. These genomic markers are probably best used for patients with low and intermediate-risk cancers (Gleason 3 + 3 = 6 and Gleason 3 + 4 = 7) to help with treatment selection, particularly for those patients who might be candidates for active surveillance or radical prostate surgery. The intention is to confirm that the patients who are eligible and select active surveillance also have low-risk genomic markers. They should be counseled accordingly if their genomic analysis shows a higher risk.

ConfirmMDx is a genomic marker test that uses DNA methylation analysis of cytosines to determine the relative risk of significant occult disease from a tissue sample in high-risk men with histologically negative biopsies, High-Grade PIN, or ASAP. ConfirmMDx estimates the likelihood of finding prostate cancer when the initial biopsy is negative. It is most useful when the initial prostate biopsies are negative in patients at high risk for occult prostate cancer. It has been shown to have a negative predictive value of 96% for detecting Gleason Grade 4 or 5 disease (Gleason sum 7 or higher).

The Decipher test evaluates tissue for the expression of 22 RNA biomarkers to calculate the probability of clinical metastasis within five years of definitive therapy. It also calculates the prostate cancer-specific mortality at ten years, the 5-year risk of developing metastases, and the chances of finding high-grade disease after radical prostatectomy. The test aims to help avoid overtreatment by reclassifying those men originally identified as high-risk who are unlikely to develop metastatic disease and might safely avoid salvage radiation therapy after radical prostatectomy surgery. It is most useful for higher-risk patients with localized disease who have already undergone radical prostatectomy and are potential candidates for salvage radiation and/or androgen deprivation therapy. Studies have demonstrated that 60% of the men considered high-risk after surgery were reclassified to a lower-risk category following a genomic classifier designed to predict the development of distant metastases after surgical treatment of their prostate cancer. Salvage radiation therapy was safely avoided in 50% of the high-risk patients tested, and 98.5% of those identified as low-risk by genomic testing did not develop metastases within five years of their radical prostatectomy procedures.

Oncotype Dx Prostate measures 17 gene expressions and is an automated immunofluorescence-based assay. It calculates the patient's chances of having organ-confined disease after radical prostatectomy surgery using genomic information from the biopsy specimen. Oncotype Dx looks at four specific areas of gene expression: the stromal response, androgen signaling, cellular proliferation, and organization. It has been shown to change treatment recommendations by 18%, primarily through a reduction in radiation therapy of 33% and a 10% increase in active surveillance.

The ProMark test is a protein-based assay looking at eight specific proteins involved in cell signaling, cellular proliferation, and stress response. This type of test will tend to identify the most aggressive cells in the tumor. It is intended to indicate the probability of non-organ confined disease after radical prostatectomy surgery and the likelihood of finding a Gleason Score equal to or greater than 4+3=7 in the post-operative specimen. The ProMark test estimates the probability of finding higher-risk or non-organ-confined disease after radical surgery. Like Oncotype Dx, it is most useful and optimized for patients with localized disease that is low-risk or favorable intermediate-risk histologically.

The Prolaris test was the first commercially available genomic tumor marker to evaluate prostate cancer aggressiveness.

**Clinical Summary of Commercially Available Tissue-based Prostate Cancer Biomarkers Useful for Risk Stratification in Men with Localized Disease:**

- High-risk factors for prostate cancer, but the initial biopsy is negative: ConfirmMDx

- Localized disease with low-risk histology considering active surveillance vs. definitive therapy: Prolaris

- Localized disease with low-risk histology considering radical prostatectomy: Oncotype Dx Prostate, ProMark, Decipher, or Prolaris

- Localized disease with higher risk factors or histology: Decipher or Prolaris

- Post-TURP with incidentally discovered prostate cancer: Prolaris

- Post-radical prostatectomy surgery: Decipher or Prolaris

- Post-radical prostatectomy surgery with positive margins or other high-risk factors: Decipher

- Post-radiation therapy: Prolaris

Research is ongoing into improved genomic analyses and clinically useful biomarkers. For example, one of the more promising biomarkers looks at the overexpression of regenerating liver-3 phosphatase (PRL-3), which has been associated with high-grade, aggressive prostate cancer.  The difference in nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of PRL-3 seems to be able to reliably distinguish intermediate-grade disease (Gleason 3+4=7) from the more aggressive, high-grade disease (Gleason 4+3=7 and higher). Digital analysis of PRL-3 immunostained tumor samples could potentially be a reliable indicator of high-grade prostate cancer and distinguish between intermediate and high-grade malignancies.

Other interesting markers include Post-Operative Therapy Outcomes Score (PORTOS), which is a panel specifically designed to predict response to external beam radiotherapy, and PAM50 subtyping, which seems to predict response to hormonal therapy PRL-3, PORTOS, PAM50, and many other similar experimental biomarkers are currently being investigated for their potential role in clinical decision-making in prostate cancer.
