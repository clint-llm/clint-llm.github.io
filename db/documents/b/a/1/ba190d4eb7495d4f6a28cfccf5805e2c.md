Many Americans in their lifetime will, at some point, experience the painful condition known as nephrolithiasis. This condition affects about 1 in 11 in the U.S.A.

Based on a cohort study, the average age of diagnosis for symptomatic nephrolithiasis is 44.8 years in men and 40.9 years in women. Interestingly enough, the geographic location appears to affect the prevalence of this condition. Based on a Cancer Prevention Study, both men and women had a higher prevalence of nephrolithiasis in the southernmost latitude compared to the northernmost latitude.
