Serum iron studies are useful to evaluate the status of iron homeostasis in the body. This panel of blood tests typically includes serum iron, transferrin, or total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), ferritin, and the percentage of transferrin saturation. A level of urinary excreted hepcidin can also be measured. A complete blood count (CBC) may be used to evaluate signs of anemia.

- Serum Iron: circulating iron with a normal range of 65 to 175 mcg/dL in males and 50 to 170 mcg/dL in females

- Ferritin: predominantly an intracellular iron storage molecule, serum ferritin directly correlates to total body iron stores - the normal range is 20 to 250 mcg/L in males and 10 to 120 mcg/L in females

- Transferrin or total iron-binding capacity: a measure of transferrin molecules available to bind iron - TIBC is an indirect measurement

- Transferrin saturation: a calculated measurement that reflects the amount of bound serum iron using the equation: serum iron divided by TIBC
