There is a broad variation in the therapeutic index of adrenergic drugs given a large number of medications. When prescribing beta-1 agonists, care should be taken to monitor hypertension as well as potential arrhythmias.

While prescribing alpha-2 agonists, patients should be monitored for bradycardia, hypotension, and potential substance abuse.

Recent research has also counseled caution when administering beta-2 agonists as patients should be monitored for paradoxical bronchospasm, blood pressure, heart rate, and central nervous system effects.

There are case reports of patients abusing clonidine alone or with benzodiazepines and opioid analgesics. Clonidine may extend the opioid-induced euphoria and decrease the opioid dose needed for euphoria.
