Shoulder pain is a common patient complaint encountered both by primary care physicians and orthopedic surgeons. Many shoulder structures can account for the clinical presentation of shoulder pain, and the diagnosis can be challenging. Clinicians often use a combination of physical examination, clinical history, and imaging to establish a diagnosis; however, sometimes, the diagnosis remains in question. An ultrasound-guided injection can aid in these cases providing clinical information and often therapeutic benefit. This activity reviews the indications, potential complications, and the method for performing an ultrasound-guided biceps tendon sheath injection.

**Objectives:**
- Review shoulder anatomy with a focus on the biceps tendon.
- Outline the clinical presentation of patients with biceps tendinosis or superior labral tear.
- Identify the indications for ultrasound-guided biceps injection.
- Summarize the procedure for ultrasound-guided biceps tendon injection.
