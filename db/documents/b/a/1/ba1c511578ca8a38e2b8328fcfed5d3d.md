Although only oral vancomycin and fidaxomicin have US Food and Drug Administration approval for treatment of C. difficile colitis, metronidazole has remained a first-line agent for four decades. Multiple studies document near the equivalent effect of metronidazole with vancomycin for the initial treatment of mild to moderate C. difficile colitis. Criteria for severe C. difficile colitis include: leukemoid reaction greater than 35,000/mm3, hypotension, admission to an intensive care unit, elevated serum lactate, and/or evidence of end-organ damage such as acute kidney injury or delirium; most manifestations of pseudomembranous colitis will signify severe disease. Because of superior cure rates for severe disease, administer oral vancomycin as first-line treatment ofÂ C. difficile colitis. With recurrent C. difficile colitis after oral vancomycin therapy, consider either fidaxomicin or rifaximin oral administration. For fulminant C. difficile pseudomembranous colitis refractory to pharmacological therapy or with complications such as megacolon or colonic perforation, surgical intervention may be warranted, including hemicolectomy. Recurrent C. difficile colitis commonly occurs following initial pharmacologic therapy; usually, the initial antibiotic therapy is reinstituted unless evidence exists of worsening disease severity. With three or more disease recurrences despite therapy with oral vancomycin, fecal microbiota transplant has shown benefit in small trials.
