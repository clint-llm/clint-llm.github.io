Thyroid hormone replacement is generally not needed in patients with euthyroid sick syndrome. Treatment and management of underlying medical illness is the main focus; however, periodic monitoring of thyroid function should be done while the patient is in the hospital. After discharge from the hospital, thyroid function abnormalities may persist for several weeks. In a clinically euthyroid patient, thyroid function tests should be repeated no earlier than six weeks after hospitalization to confirm either overt thyroid dysfunction when there is a persistent TSH abnormality or euthyroid sick syndrome when there is a normalization of the TSH and the T3 levels.

A recent study showed that in children undergoing cardiac surgery, using thyroid hormone preoperatively to prevent euthyroid sickÂ syndrome helped decrease some cardiac complications, especially those related to ischemia.
