The primary function of the gastrointestinal tract is to supply nutrients to our bodies via the processes of ingestion, motility, secretion, digestion, and absorption; this occurs through complex coordination of digestive processes that are regulated by intrinsic endocrine and nervous systems. Although the nervous system exerts influence on many digestive processes, the GI tract is the largest endocrine organ in the human body and produces numerous mediators that play an integral role in regulating functions of the GI tract.
