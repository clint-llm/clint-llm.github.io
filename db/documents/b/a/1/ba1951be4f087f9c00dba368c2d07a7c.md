Hyperhidrosis is a disorder of excessive sweating due to the overstimulation of cholinergic receptors on eccrine glands. This disorder is characterized by sweating beyond what the body uses for homeostatic temperature regulation.

Hyperhidrosis is classified as primary and secondary, and the management and treatment can significantly differ for each. The primary disease typically presents earlier in life with more localized symptoms. The secondary disease typically presents due to adverse effects of medications or systemic disorders, particularly neurologic.
