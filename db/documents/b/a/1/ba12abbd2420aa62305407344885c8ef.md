When using mannitol for medical purposes, it is given intravenously. Mannitol can be found in varying concentrations from 5% mannitol (5 gm mannitol dissolved in 100 mL of fluid) up to 25% mannitol (25 gm of mannitol dissolved in 100 mL of fluid). A commonly encountered solution is 20% mannitol (20 grams of mannitol dissolved in 100 mL of fluid).

- For increased intracranial pressure, dosages typically range from 0.25 g/kg to 2 g/kg administered intravenously over 30 to 60 minutes with effect within 5 to 10 minutes and lasting up to approximately 6 hours.

- For increased intraocular pressure, dosages typically range from 0.25 g/kg to 2 g/kg administered intravenously over 30 to 60 minutes with effect within 5 to 10 minutes and lasting up to approximately 6 hours.

- For prevention or treatment of oliguria, a test dose should be strongly considered of around 0.2 g/kg intravenous to ensure a response to urine output. The mannitol infusion can be adjusted to provide a urine flow rate of at least 30 mL/hour to 50 mL/hour in adults.

- For excretion of toxic materials, the clinician may consider a dose of 0.25 g/kg to 2 g/kg to observe its effects. If the patient receives more than 200 gm of mannitol without benefit, mannitol use should be discontinued.
