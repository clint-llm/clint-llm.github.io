Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in men and women and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States, with an estimated 134,490 new cases in 2016 and 49,190 deaths. Most colorectal cancers occur sporadically; however, inherited cancer syndromes or inherited mutations cause approximately 5% to 10% of cases. The most common hereditary form of hereditary colorectal cancer is Lynch syndrome, also known as Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer Syndrome (HNPCC). Identifying patients with Lynch syndrome is clinically important because the marked increase lifetime risk of colorectal cancer ranges up to 80% and lifetime risk of endometrial cancer ranges up to 60%. Furthermore, there is an increased risk for other primary cancers including gastric, ovarian, small bowel, urothelial (ureter, renal pelvis), biliary tract, pancreatic, brain cancers (glioblastoma), sebaceous gland adenomas, and keratoacanthomas.
