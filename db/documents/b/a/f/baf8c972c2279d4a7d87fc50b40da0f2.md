The single most important preventive measure is smoking cessation in all individuals. Patients should be advised about the clinical correlation of lung cancer with smoking at every clinician visit. Another important method of decreasing the morbidity and mortality associated with lung cancer is effective screening. AÂ low-dose helical computed tomography (LDCT) is indicated for high-risk individuals for primary prevention. Smokers between the ages of 66 to 80 years benefit more from screening than those aged 55 to 64 years.

Patients without a history of smoking do not benefit from lung cancer screening. Multiple other models incorporating clinical factors such as a history of lung disease, family history of lung cancer, and asbestos exposure have been developed. They can be applied to determine at-risk individuals who may benefit from screening. Current guidelines by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (2021) recommend an annual LDCT for patients aged 50 to 80 years who are at high risk of lung cancer due to their smoking history.
