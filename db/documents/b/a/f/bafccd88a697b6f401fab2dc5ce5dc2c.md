Tiotropium bromide and combination therapy of tiotropium bromide and olodaterol are not indicated for treatment and relief of acute bronchospasm.

**Tiotropium**Bromide****

Tiotropium bromide is contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to tiotropium, ipratropium, and atropine (due to the risk of anaphylaxis) and narrow-angle glaucoma. Powder tiotropium capsules contain milk protein and are contraindicated for use in patients with allergies to milk. Tiotropium has links to increased risk of heart attacks, stroke, and cardiovascular death. The use of tiotropium in pregnancy has not yet been shown to pose any risk due to maternal or fetal complications. The results of animal studies conducted on tiotropium use during the pregnancy of rats and rabbits resulted in no anatomical abnormalities in offspring. It should not be used as a rescue medicine for an acute attack. Tiotropium should be discontinued if paradoxical bronchospasm occurs.

****Tiotropium Bromide and Olodaterol Combination Therapy****

Tiotropium bromide and olodaterol combination therapy are contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to tiotropium, ipratropium, olodaterol, and atropine (due to the risk of anaphylaxis), and glaucoma. This medication is also contraindicated for the use of patients with asthma with a described US Boxed Warning for increasing the risk of asthma-related deaths. The literature lacks information on tiotropium bromide and olodaterol during human pregnancy and its use in animal reproductive studies, so it currently classifies as pregnancy risk category C.
