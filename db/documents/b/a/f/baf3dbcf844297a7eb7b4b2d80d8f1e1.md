Those with persistent and intractable hiccups may present to the emergency department, urgent care clinics, health clinics, or to their primary care physicians for evaluation. Providers in these settings may initiate treatment based on history and physical examination. A full history and physical should be obtained to rule out more serious underlying etiologies. Any area of concern should prompt consultation with the appropriate specialist. It is crucial for triage nurses and other healthcare providers to recognize that hiccups may seem insignificant, but the complaint deserves a detailed history and thorough examination.

Consultation and referrals are appropriate if there is an apparent or suspected underlying condition, and the patient is either not a candidate for outpatient therapy or has failed outpatient therapy. Patients who fail initial outpatient therapy and have no apparent cause may require referral to gastroenterology for endoscopy, and/or otolaryngology, neurology or pulmonology. In rare situations, intractable cases might need a referral to anesthesia for nerve block.

Hiccups are not an infrequent complaint among those with cancer in hospice care. As recurrent hiccups can be detrimental to the quality of life, it would be prudent for palliative care physicians and nurses to develop treatment regimens to address these complaints.
