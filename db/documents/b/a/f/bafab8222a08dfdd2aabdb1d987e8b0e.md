There is no way to differentiate between types of lymphocytes (B and T cells) under light microscopy; instead, flow cytometry (identifying surface markers) is used. Lymphocytes under a light microscope are about the size of a red blood cell, around 7 micrometers, though some variation is expected. These cells have large, dark-staining nuclei (taking up most of the cell) due to having a lot of condensed chromatin. There is often only a small amount of pale, blue cytoplasm notable in these cells.
