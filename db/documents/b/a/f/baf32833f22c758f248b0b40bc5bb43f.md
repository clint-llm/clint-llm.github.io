GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous center. GABA has particular binding sites available for ethanol, thus increasing the inhibition of the central nervous system when present. Chronic ethanol exposure to GABA creates constant inhibition or depressant effects on the brain. Ethanol also binds to glutamate, which is one of the excitatory amino acids in the central nervous system. When it binds to glutamate, it inhibits the excitation of the central nervous system, thus worsening the depression of the brain.
