When a drug is taken orally, it is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, distributed to the rest of the body, metabolized in the liver and other organs, and eliminated, mainly in the urine. These processes occur at different speeds for different drugs. Therefore, for the target analyte, be it the parent drug or metabolite, the first and subsequent detection times will differ for the various drugs. For example, for some drugs like amphetamines, the parent drug will be detected in urine; metabolites are detectable longer than the parent drug for most other drugs.

The primary target metabolites are 11-Nor-9-carboxy-delta-tetrahydrocannabinol (THCCOOH) for cannabis, benzoylecgonine for cocaine, and morphine for heroin. Drugs generally first appear in the urine one to two hours after intake. After a small drug dose, a drug can be detected in the urine for one to three days; after heavy, chronic use, amphetamines can be detectable for ten days, cannabinoids for three months, cocaine metabolites for three weeks, and heroin metabolites for 11 days.
