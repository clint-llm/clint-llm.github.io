Alopecia areata (AA) is a chronic, autoimmune disorder of non-scarring hair loss mediated by T-lymphocytes against the hair follicular unit. The most common form of disease manifests as smooth, discrete, round patches of hair loss and can be referred to as alopecia areata focalis (AF). Alopecia totalis (AT) is a more extensive subtype of AA characterized by complete loss of hair of the scalp. When there is a total loss of scalp and body hair, it is called alopecia universalis (AU). In comparison to focal AA, patients with AT have a poorer prognosis for hair regrowth and are more likely to have treatment failure.
