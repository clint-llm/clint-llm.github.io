Bronchial carcinoid tumors are a recurring issue in the medical field that is often overlooked due to its relatively nonspecific initial findings. It is greatly important that the pathophysiology of the disease is understood, and suspicions heightened for such a disease. Although surgical resection is the treatment of choice, it has already been proven that medical therapy has had a significant role in the disease course. Symptomatic relief and deterrence of disease progression will undoubtedly lead to improved patient outcomes, in particular to those patients who achieve earlier diagnosis. It is the ethical responsibility of the physician attending to the patient to provide the least invasive therapy when establishing treatment prior to recommending surgical resection. With an interprofessional approach throughout the disciplines of medicine, radiology, surgery, oncology, and pulmonology, there is no doubt that overall outcomes will continue to improve in the future.
