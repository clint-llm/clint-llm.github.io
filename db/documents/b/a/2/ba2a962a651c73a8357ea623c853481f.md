Lymphangiomas are rare in the United States. They represent 4% of all vascular tumors and approximately 25% of all benign pediatric vascular tumors. There is no racial or gender predilection. Lymphangiomas typically present at birth or in the first few years of life, while the acquired form of cutaneous lymphangioma circumscriptum often presents in adulthood.
