Colloid cysts are benign growths that are usually located either in the third ventricle or at or near the foramen of Monroe, which is found at the anterior aspect of the third ventricle of the brain. The cysts are comprised of epithelial lining filled with gelatinous material that commonly contains mucin, old blood, cholesterol, and ions. Colloid cysts can cause a variety of symptoms, including headaches, diplopia, memory problems, and vertigo. Rarely colloid cysts have been reported to cause sudden death. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of colloid cysts and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with these lesions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of colloid cysts.
- Describe the presentation of colloid cysts.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for colloid cysts.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the diagnosis and management of colloid cysts and improve outcomes.
