**Treatment**

**Non-operative -** Cast immobilization

Indication: Rare. Non-displaced fractures or in patients that are a very high surgical risk.

**Operative**

Open Reduction Internal Fixation

Indication: displaced fractures, including supracondylar, intercondylar and/or bicolumnar fractures. Generally, plate fixation involves anatomic reduction of articular surface and rigid fixation with two strong plates, usually at least 3.5 mm at a minimum.

Total Elbow Arthroplasty

Indication: Distal bicolumnar fractures in the elderly, low demand patient population. Total elbow arthroplasty has limited longevity due to aseptic loosening and should be reserved for elderly, sedentary patients that can comply with postoperative weight restrictions.

**Approaches**

Posterior approach utilizing one of the following techniques:

-  Triceps - Splitting

-  Triceps - Sparing

-  Olecranon Osteotomy

One thing that is paramount in the utilization of any one of these techniques is the need to identify the ulnar nerve. There is debate if there is more benefit in transposing the nerve versus performing an in situ decompression; however, visualizing the nerve and keeping it out of the field is essential.

Another detail that is critical no matter which approach is utilized is the need to identify the radial nerve if placing a plate that extends proximally on the humerus. The nerve can usually be found approximately 10 cm proximal to the medial edge of the olecranon fossa and 7.5 cm proximal to the lateral edge.

The lateral approach can be utilized in cases where an articular shear fracture of the capitellum, trochlea, or both need to be addressed.
