IgA nephropathy is the most common glomerulonephritis worldwide and can occur at any age. The peak age of onset is in the second and third decades. Review of cohort studies reports 0.2 to 2.9 per 100,000 annual incidence of IgA nephropathy. The disease is more common in Asia and Australia than in other parts of the world. This may be because some Asian countries enforce routine screening with urinalysis, prompting earlier diagnosis. Among the North American and Western European populations, there is 2:1 male to female ratio. IgA nephropathy is rare in all African populations throughout the world.
