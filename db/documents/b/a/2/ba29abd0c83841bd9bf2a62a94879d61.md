The exact etiology of seminoma remains undetermined. However, the following factors are associated with an increase in the risk of seminoma:

- **History of Cryptorchidism**: Risk of seminoma increases with the history of cryptorchidism. There is 10Â to 40 times higher risk in patients with an undescended testis, 10% of the patients with cryptorchidism develop germ cell tumor.

- **Environmental Exposure**: Exposure to chemical compounds like organochlorines, polychlorinated biphenyls, polyvinyl chlorides, phthalates, marijuana, and tobacco is associated with an increased risk of seminoma or other germ cell tumors.

- **Infections**: History of mumps viral infection is related to increased risk of germ cell tumors.

- **Others**: Other factors include trauma, maternal estrogen exposure, family history of testicular tumors, intersex syndromes (insensitive androgen syndrome and gonadal dysgenesis), and history of cancer in the contralateral testicle.

- **Genetics:**Genetic changes in the form of amplification and deletions are seen in 12p11.2-p12.1 chromosomal regions. Coffey and colleagues demonstrated that only seminomas contain activating mutations of the KIT gene.
