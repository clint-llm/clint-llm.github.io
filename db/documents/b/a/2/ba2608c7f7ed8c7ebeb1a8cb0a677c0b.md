Ulcerative colitis is a lifelong illness but the overall mortality is not greater than in the general population. However, mortality is increased in patients who develop shock and surgical complications. When the muscularis propria is involved it may damage the nerves resulting in dilatation, aperistalsis, and ischemia (toxic megacolon). Today, toxic megacolon is the most common cause of death in ulcerative colitis. At least 5% of patients develop colon cancer and this risk increases with the duration of the disease. Unlike Crohn disease, stricture formation is rare.
