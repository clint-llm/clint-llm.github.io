Any provider caring for a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome should be aware of the multitude of complications of the disease and potential preventative measures. Treatment and management of patients with EDS should use a multidisciplinary approach that focuses on preventing disease progression and subsequent complications as there is no cure for the disease. Specialists generally manage specific care within the field of which the patient has concerning pathology. For example, cardiovascular concerns will be monitored by a cardiologist; likewise, musculoskeletal pathology is monitored and treated by an orthopedist. Often, a geneticist or family medicine provider acts as the primary provider referring the patient to these specialists.

The underlying collagen abnormalities predispose the patient’s skin to poor wound healing and dehiscence.

With hypermobile joints comes the increased risk of joint subluxation and dislocation.

Cardiovascular screening should be done regularly to mitigate risk factors as best as possible. Hypertension, for example, increases strain on already fragile vasculature and increases the risk of complications over time and should be managed aggressively. Screening for structural abnormalities of the heart, such as aortic root and mitral valve abnormalities, should be conducted using echocardiography as these may require surgical intervention to avoid the complications of rupture or congestive heart failure, respectively.

Pregnant EDS patients should be followed and managed by Obstetricians trained in high-risk pregnancy. See “Complications” for further information.
