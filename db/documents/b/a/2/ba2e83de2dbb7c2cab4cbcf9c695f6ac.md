The side effects of cancer chemotherapy can be acute or prolonged, may need monitoring. In addition, it would require multi-disciplinary monitoring as specific patient populations may be at higher risk for complications.

Management of common side effects of chemotherapy:

- Infusion reactions, from hypersensitivity reactions: Management options include using pre-medications like diphenhydramine, methylprednisolone, epinephrine

- Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting: Treatment options include prochlorperazine, haloperidol, metoclopramide, lorazepam, dexamethasone, ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, palonosetron, dronabinol, aprepitant, fosaprepitant. Palonosetron has a longer half-life, better efficacy, and higher binding affinity than granisetron.

- Mucositis: Using magic mouthwash, avoidance commercial mouthwashes, and lemon glycerin swabs

- Fatigue: Interventions like exercise, optimizing sleep quality, and behavioral therapies such as relaxation can help fatigue.

- Chemotherapy-induced diarrhea: Using agents like loperamide, diphenoxylate, atropine, octreotide.

- Neurotoxicity: Using agents like vitamin B6, glutamine, gabapentin, pregabalin, carbamazepine, or tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline).

Toxic levels of 5FU can occur in patients with Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency or drug overdose. This can lead to cardiac dysfunction, colitis, neutropenia, and encephalopathy. Uridine triacetate is approved for the toxicity of these patients.
