Use of a Wood's lamp which is an ultraviolet light with a wavelength of 365 nm is helpful in diagnosis. The lamp does not accentuate the hypopigmentation of nevus anemicus but does accentuate the hypopigmentation and depigmentation seen in nevus depigmentosus and vitiligo, respectively. A skin biopsy may be performed, showing normal skin and thus ruling out other hypopigmented or depigmented lesions such as vitiligo. Electron microscopy of nevus anemicus shows normal findings, while nevus depigmentosus has a normal number of melanocytes but decreased melanization with melanosome aggregation in melanocytes. If tinea versicolor is suspected, potassium hydroxide (KOH) examination of lesional skin should be performed, which would show the characteristic "spaghetti and meatballs" appearance of Malassezia furfur hyphae and spores respectively.
