Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid (OCP) is a form of mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP) that features chronic, relapsing-remitting bilateral conjunctivitis. Ultimately, patients affected by this autoimmune disease will experience conjunctival cicatrization or scarring. If patients do not receive treatment or do not respond to treatment, they will develop corneal opacification and permanent vision loss. Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid is present in about 60 to 70 percent of patients with mucous membrane pemphigoid. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of ocular cicatricial pemphigoid and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected individuals.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of ocular cicatricial pemphigoid.
- Review the evaluation of ocular cicatricial pemphigoid. 
- Summarizee the current treatment options for ocular cicatricial pemphigoid.
- Explain a well-coordinated interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to patients affected by ocular cicatricial pemphigoid.
