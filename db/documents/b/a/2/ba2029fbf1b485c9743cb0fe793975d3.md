Subchorionic hemorrhage is bleeding beneath the chorion membranes that enclose the embryo in the uterus. It is thought to occur due to partial detachment of the chorion membranes from the wall of the uterus. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of subchorionic hemorrhage in pregnant patients and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition. Subchorionic hemorrhage and subchorionic hematoma are the most common cause of vaginal bleeding in patients who are 10 to 20 weeks gestational age and make up about 11% of cases.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the evaluation for a subchorionic hemorrhage.
- Review the complications for a subchorionic hemorrhage.
- Describe the typical imaging findings associated with subchorionic hemorrhage.

- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for pregnant patients with a subchorionic hemorrhage.
