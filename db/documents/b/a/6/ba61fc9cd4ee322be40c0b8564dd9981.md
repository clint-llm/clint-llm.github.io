SSc is associates with high mortality, and of all the collagen vascular disorders, systemic sclerosis has the highest case-specific mortality. The most common cause of mortality was the scleroderma renal crisis prior to the advent of ACE inhibitors. The use of ACE inhibitors and more awareness has decreased SRC-related mortality, and the most common cause of mortality now is pulmonary disease.

**Prognostic Factors and Associations in SSc**

- African American race: Develop disease early, develop more severe disease, interstitial lung disease, scleroderma renal crisis

- Late age of diagnosis: Pulmonary arterial hypertension, poor outcomes after scleroderma renal crisis

- DcSSc: Diffuse skin disease, large joint inflammatory arthritis, tendon friction rubs, joint contractures, distal bone osteolysis, scleroderma renal crisis, interstitial lung disease, pericardial effusion

- LcSSc: Limited skin disease, calcinosis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, hypothyroidism

- Multiple telangiectasias: Pulmonary arterial hypertension

- Pericardial effusion: Scleroderma renal crisis

- Tendon friction rubs: Scleroderma renal crisis, poor overall prognosis

- New-onset anemia: Scleroderma renal crisis

- Corticosteroid use: Scleroderma renal crisis

- Anti-centromere antibody: LcSSc, pulmonary arterial hypertension. Lower risk of interstitial lung disease.

- Anti-SCL-70 antibody: DcSSc, interstitial lung disease, cardiac involvement

- Anti-RNA polymerase III antibody: Rapidly progressing and aggressive diffuse skin involvement, poor cutaneous outcomes, scleroderma renal crisis, malignancies. Lower risk of interstitial lung disease and pulmonary hypertension
