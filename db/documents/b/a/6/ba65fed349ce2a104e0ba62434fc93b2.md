Pernio has generally been found to affect women more often than men. The most significant risk factor appears to be exposure to cold, damp climates, and pernio is often prevalent in areas without central heating such as many parts of the UK and northern Europe. Due to pernio's association with the cold and damp, the presentation can be found to be seasonal, with an increase in prevalence during the winter months and relapse occurring when the weather warms again in the spring.
