Knowledge of orbital anatomy is crucial to avoid damaging key structures within the orbit, particularly once the orbital fat pad has been exposed. The superior ophthalmic vein forms at the junction of the supraorbital (SPOV), angular, and supratrochlear veins within the superomedial orbit. It is consistently found approximately 6 mm above the superior sulcus of the eyelid nasally. Additionally, the SOV can be identified by following the SPOV into the orbit; the SPOV itself can be within the supraorbital notch when present.
