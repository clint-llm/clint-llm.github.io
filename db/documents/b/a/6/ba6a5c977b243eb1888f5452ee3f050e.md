Congenital lung diseases are rare but exceptionally distinct in their presentation ranging from large masses requiring immediate surgical intervention to small and asymptomatic lesions. The effects of congenital lung malformation can be critical; thus, a knowledge of the diagnosis and treatment of these abnormalities is essential. Lung development and anatomy are key fundamentals in consideration of these malformations and helps in the comprehension of the pathophysiology of each disease.

Congenital lobar emphysema (CLE) is a rare developmental malformation of the lung with a wide range of presentations, which poses a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma and associated with high morbidity and mortality. CLE is characterized by respiratory distress due to overexpansion of one or more pulmonary lobes of the histologically normal lung without the destruction of alveolar walls with compression of surrounding lung parenchyma; that is why it is also called congenital lung overinflation. There is air trapping in the lung during the expiratory phase of respiration due to deficient bronchial cartilage, which causes repeated episodes of respiratory distress. The affected lobe is essentially non-functional because of overdistention and air trapping. It is frequently recognized in newborns; however, a few cases do not get evident until adulthood. This disease is potentially reversible if diagnosed and treated on time.
