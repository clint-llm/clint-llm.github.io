Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a method of providing high temporal resolution of neurological activity of the brain. It is essential to know the benign and pathological variants of EEG to evaluate EEG accurately. Accurate recognition of benign variants in the EEG is crucial to avoid an errant diagnosis of epilepsy. The breach rhythm, also known as the breach effect, is a benign EEG pattern with an epileptiform morphology, caused by a skull abnormality. A focal skull defect, like after a craniotomy, can cause an increase in the amplitude of alpha, beta, and mu rhythms, leading to the breach effect. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of breach rhythm and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of breach rhythm.
- Describe the pathophysiology of breach rhythm.
- Summarize the evaluation of a patient with breach rhythm.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by breach rhythm.
