The autonomic nervous system is composed of many cells that perform a diverse set of functions. The sympathetic nervous system contains cell bodies that lie within the lateral gray column of the spinal cord running from T1 to L2. These neurons are known as preganglionic neurons and travel to ganglia, where they synapse and activate nicotinic receptors on postganglionic neurons using acetylcholine. The postganglionic neurons then travel to the target site and release norepinephrine to activate adrenergic receptors.

The parasympathetic nervous system is comprised of a cranial portion, consisting of cranial nerves III, VII, IX, and X and pelvic splanchnic nerves that exit from S2 to S4. The organization of the parasympathetic nerves is similar to the sympathetic nervous system, as preganglionic fibers synapse on postganglionic fibers, which then innervate target sites. A notable difference is that the preganglionic nerve fibers synapse on ganglia that are close to or embedded within their respective target sites, resulting in short postganglionic neurons.
