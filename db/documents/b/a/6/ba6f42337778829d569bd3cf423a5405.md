Physiologic variants of teres major are rare but have been reported, specifically at the insertion site. Teres major inserts on the medial lip of the intertubercular groove of the humerus, where the tendon fuses with the tendon of latissimus dorsi. Variations in where the tendons fuse, both proximally and distally, have been reported in the literature.

SurgeonsÂ must be aware of these variants as teres major is frequently used in tendon transfer procedures for rotator cuff repair.
