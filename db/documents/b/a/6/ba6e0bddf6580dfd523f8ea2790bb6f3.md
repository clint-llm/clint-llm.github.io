Leukocytosis is a relatively common phenomenon on a CBC with a variety of causes. The first step is to obtain a CBC with differential, which evaluates the different cell lines. A peripheral blood smear can be helpful and is appropriate in patients with unexplained leukocytosis. It can be particularly helpful to obtain a manual differential for the analysis of abnormal cells or if there is a question of the accuracy of the automated leukocyte differential.

When evaluating the peripheral smear under microscopy, the blood should be collected from a fresh lab draw that is anticoagulated or directly from a finger stick puncture. Preparing the slide involves a gradation of blood on the slide from thick to thin. The smear is air-dried and then a stain, such as May-Grunwald-Giemsa and Wright stains, which produces cells where the nuclei are blue, and the cytoplasm is pink. Under the microscope, the clinician will then begin the slide review on the feathered or thin edge of the smear, where the cells are just barely overlapping, and work into the thicker area of the smear, where the WBC's typically reside. High-power field viewing with an oil-immersion lens is necessary to examine leukocytes for abnormalities and inclusions.

Typical leukocytes of neutrophils, basophils, monocytes, eosinophils, and lymphocytes are expected to be seen in the appropriate percentages, as discussed in the Etiology section of this article. Immature granulocytes and precursors, such as blasts and myelocytes, and lymphoma cells are significantly abnormal findings.
