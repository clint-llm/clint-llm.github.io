Close monitoring of adverse events is necessary, in particular, in patients with polysubstance abuse. Patients taking disulfiram require monitoring for signs and symptoms of hepatitis, including fatigue, weakness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, malaise, and dark urine. Baseline and follow-up liver function tests should be monitored ten days to one month following initiation of disulfiram. Complete blood count and serum chemistries should also require routine monitoring.
