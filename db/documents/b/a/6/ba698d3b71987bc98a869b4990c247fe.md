The prognosis for recovery from chronic paroxysmal hemicrania (CPH) is excellent when patients are correctly diagnosed and treated with indomethacin. Intolerance or contraindications to indomethacin limit definitive treatment and may result in a more disabling headache course. Mortality or morbidities associated with CPH have not been reported. Pregnancy, menstruation, menopause, or birth control pills do not influence the course of CPH.
