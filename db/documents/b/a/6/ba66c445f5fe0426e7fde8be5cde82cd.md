Ataxia frequently leads to complex decision making due to the multiple causes and nonspecific signs and symptoms. History taking and examination are essential in finding the cause and determining the severity of the illness. Neurologists, nurses, pediatricians, internal medicine physicians, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, radiologists, and pharmacists form a vital team for patient care. Each of them has a set role in the treatment and management of patients with ataxia. The collaboration of the team with shared decision-making and communication improves patients outcome.

As there is no determined treatment for ataxia, patients must receive assistance in reducing their functional disability by providing medications for symptoms, counseling, support groups, and wheelchair assistance. Research is underway to improve treatment further and help improve the prognosis of patients.
