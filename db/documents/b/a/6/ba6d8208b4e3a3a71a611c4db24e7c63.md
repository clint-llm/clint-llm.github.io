The diagnosis of vitamin D toxicity relies on a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's medical history and clinical symptoms. Laboratory evaluation includes checking serum calcium (often >11 mg/dL), ionized calcium, phosphate levels, and parathyroid hormone (PTH), which often are suppressed due to a negative feedback loop.

In cases of vitamin D toxicity, serum levels of 25(OH)D concentration often exceed 150 ng/mL (375 nmol/L), accompanied by normal or elevated values of 1,25(OH)2D concentration.

The most common EKG finding is a shortened QT interval. Additionally, EGG may reveal a prolonged PR interval, a shortened ST segment, flattened T waves, and Osborn waves (J wave), indicated by a positive deflection at the J point in precordial leads.

Imaging studies are usually not required to diagnose vitamin D toxicity but can reveal incidental findings of chronic toxicity due to pathologic calcifications. Skeletal radiographs typically show periosteal calcifications. Abdomen and pelvic CT scans can reveal nephrolithiasis. In addition, other pathologic calcifications may be observed in the blood vessels, myocardium, lung, and skin. When a patient presents with significant alteration in mental status upon admission, it is advisable to perform a baseline brain CT scan to assess for possible intracranial pathologies or alternative causes.
