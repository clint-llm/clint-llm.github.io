Images are taken in various cuts along the short axis, vertical and horizontal long axes, and transaxial views. Pictures are taken with rest and during stress as described above. Areas with poor myocardium perfusion have less radiotracer uptake, whereas areas with adequate perfusion light up brightly on the images. The comparison of rest and stress images can help differentiate areas of viable, reversible areas of perfusion defects from those areas of non-reversible perfusion defects. This visualization helps in the decision regarding whether or not revascularization is needed.
