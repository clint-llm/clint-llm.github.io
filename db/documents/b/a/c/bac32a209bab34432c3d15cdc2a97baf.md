**History:**The hallmark presenting symptom of PH is shortness of breath on exertion; other nonspecific symptoms can include hemoptysis, fatigue, early exhaustion, palpitations, and syncope. As the disease progresses, symptoms of right-sided heart failure manifest, such as weight gain, edema, abdominal distention, and ascites.

Rare symptoms due to enlargement of the pulmonary artery (PA) can include chest pain on exertion (due to compression of the left main coronary artery), hoarseness of voice (caused by compression of left recurrent laryngeal nerve - Ortner Syndrome), wheezing, cough, lower respiratory tract infections, atelectasis (due to compression of bronchi).

Patients may have symptoms related to their underlying diseases, such as joint pains, skin rashes, cough, daytime somnolence, and a history of blood clots. A family history, sexual history, and travel history are extremely important when evaluating a patient with suspected PH.

**Physical:**An increased P2 (pulmonic) component of the second heart sound is usually the initial physical finding. As the disease progresses and right ventricular dysfunction ensues, jugular venous distention with a prominent "a" wave is seen with an eventual prominent "v" wave signifying tricuspid regurgitation. Murmurs of tricuspid and pulmonic regurgitation, as well as right-sided S3 or S4, may be heard. These are caused by elevated pulmonary pressures and eventually right ventricular (RV) failure. Ascites, abdominal distention, hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly, and dependent edema may be present. As RV failure progresses, dizziness, pallor, delayed capillary refill, and peripheral cyanosis may be seen, signifying a low cardiac output state.

Various other physical exam findings may be present in patients with CTD or chronic lung diseases, such as digital clubbing, telangiectasias, Raynaud's phenomenon, digital ulceration, symptoms related to gastroesophageal reflux, crackles/wheezing on lung auscultation, joint swelling/erythema.
