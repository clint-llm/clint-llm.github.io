Before the RTT criteria revisions and the discovery of MECP2, a staging system was implemented as a guide for clinicians to track the clinical course of RTT. It is important to note that the staging system does not predict life expectancy and should not be used for diagnostic purposes. Stage 1 begins around 6 to 18 months and involves developmental arrest. Some signs include limited eye contact, deceleration of head growth, non-specific hand-wringing and gross motor delays. Stage 2 onset is between the ages of 1 to 4 and consists of regression and rapid deterioration. Stage 2 is characterized by stereotypic hand movement (hand-wringing or washing), loss of speech, irritability and disturbed sleep. Stage 3 onset is between the ages of 2 to 10 is characterized by improvement in behavior, communication skills, and hand use. Stage 4 onset is after the age of 10 years and is characterized by dystonia, reduced mobility, and bradykinesia.
