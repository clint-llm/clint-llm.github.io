Mipomersen contraindications include:

- Patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh category B or C). Furthermore, mipomersen is also contraindicated in patients with elevated transaminase levels in the serum and/or active liver disease.

- Patients with pre-existing and known hypersensitivity allergic reactions to any therapeutic component.

Mipomersen therapy for patients already on intense lipid-decreasing therapy and demonstrating elevated cardiovascular risk has shown to be well-tolerated in phase 3 studies.
