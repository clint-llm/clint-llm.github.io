M cells function as sentries against intestinal toxins and/or pathogens, transporting them (trans-epithelial) to awaiting immune cells. M cells specialize in transcytosis (i.e., trans-epithelial transport). M cells uptake macromolecules (antigens, pathogens) from their apical surface (intestinal luminal surface) and transport these molecules, via vesicles, to the basolateral surface. This transport appears to be non-selective; however, some specialized adhesion and transport markers have been noted such as in the case of Vibrio uptake. There also are several basolateral invaginations which house macrophages and other immune cells. These immune cells process the presented molecules and deliver them further on to intestinal lymphoid follicles to initiate an immune response.

This function has been known to be exploited as a method to gain entry into the body past the intestinal epithelial barrier.
