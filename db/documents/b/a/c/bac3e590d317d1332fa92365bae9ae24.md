Like most pharyngitis, A. haemolyticum typically resolves within 7 to 10 days. In more severe and persistent cases, airway obstruction via membranous pharyngitis similar to diphtheria may be present. Complications have rarely been reported. Infections treated with appropriate antibiotics will lead to the resolution of symptoms.
