Anemia of renal disease is an independent risk factor for death. It has been shown to promote faster progression of left ventricular hypertrophy, peripheral oxygen demand, and worsening cardiac outcomes. More importantly, anemia of renal failure leads to depression, fatigue, stroke, reduced exercise tolerance, and an increased rate of re-admissions.

Long-term treatment with erythropoietin can cause hypertension, vasoconstriction, and seizures.
