Pediatric supracondylar fractures of the humerus can range from mild to severe injuries. Emergency care providers and nurses are involved in the initial assessment, triage, and management of children presenting with elbow injuries. Advanced nurse practitioners also play a crucial role in emergency care, especially in urgent care centers.

Emergency care staff play a crucial role in identifying the presence of associated neurovascular injuries and compartment syndrome following the child's arrival in the emergency department. This is very important as the neurovascular status of the limb can evolve while the child is awaiting review and treatment by an orthopedic surgeon. Besides, these patients are at risk of developing compartment syndrome, and urgent treatment is mandatory.

All members of theÂ interprofessional team play essential roles in the management of this patient group. These fractures can be very painful. The nursing staff is often involved in assessing patients' pain status and administering analgesia.
