The genetic mutation described causes polymerization of the Hemoglobin molecule that alters the erythrocyte shape and its ability to deform. There is increased adhesion of erythrocytes followed by the formation of heterocellular aggregates, which physically cause small vessel occlusion and resultant local hypoxia. This process triggers a vicious cycle of increased HbS formation, the release of inflammatory mediators and free radicals that contribute to reperfusion injury. Hemoglobin also binds to nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, and releases oxygen. Erythrocytes are more likely to sickle and become rigid in the presence of dehydration. This process is in large part caused by changes in cation homeostasis, specifically increased potassium and water efflux mediated by potassium-chloride cotransport and Gardos channels (calcium-dependent potassium channel). Other associated pathological events include increased neutrophil adhesiveness, nitric oxide binding, increased platelet activation, and hypercoagulability.
