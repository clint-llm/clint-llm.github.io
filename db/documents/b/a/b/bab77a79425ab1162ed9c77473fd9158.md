Vascular anatomy is always subject to anatomic variation, and the pulmonary arterial vasculature is no exception. Pulmonary artery variants are usually discovered as incidental findings on imaging.

A well-documented variant of pulmonary arterial anatomy is the aberrant left pulmonary artery,Â also known as the pulmonary sling. In this variation, the left pulmonary artery arises from the posterior aspect of the right pulmonary artery and passes superior to the right mainstem bronchus and between the esophagus and trachea.

Another variant is unilateral proximal artery interruption. Here the pulmonary artery, right more commonly than left, ends blindly as it enters the lung hilum, although the vasculature within the lung itself is patent. To compensate for the interrupted artery, the bronchial arteries supplying the affected lung will hypertrophy and participate in gas exchange. Transpleural arteries may also develop to further compensate for the decreased flow.

One more variant of pulmonary artery anatomy is the idiopathic dilatation of the pulmonary artery (IDPA). This diagnosis may or may not involve dilatation of the right and left pulmonary arteries and requires the exclusion of other causes of pulmonary artery distension or enlargement.

Anatomic variation of the segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries is much more common.
