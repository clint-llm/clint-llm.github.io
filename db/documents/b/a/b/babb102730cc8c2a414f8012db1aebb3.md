Due to the significant increase in prevalence and mortality of endometritis after cesarean deliveries, ACOG recommends prophylactic antibiotics before all cesarean deliveries. A recent Cochrane review showed a significant reduction in the risk of postpartum infections, including endometritis, when appropriate antibiotics were given.

The regimen recommended in the ACOG Practice Bulletin on prophylactic antibiotics in labor and delivery recommends giving a first-generation cephalosporin, such as cefazolin 1 g IV administered within 1 hour prior to skin incision. **in addition to**standard preoperative prophylaxis (i.e., cefazolin). The increased risk of postpartum infection should be discussed with patients prior to cesarean delivery as part of the informed consent process.

Outside of pregnancy, endometritis is best prevented with the appropriate use of barrier contraceptives to prevent the transmission of STIs. In addition, clinicians should use appropriate technique whenever they are performing invasive gynecologic procedures, such as IUD insertions.
