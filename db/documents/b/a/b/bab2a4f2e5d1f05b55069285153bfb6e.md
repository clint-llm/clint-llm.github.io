The cerebral venous system begins its development as primary meninx, which is undifferentiated mesenchyme, which gives rise to a convergence of several vessels hypothetically originate from the mesoderm and neural crest cells. The initial salient vessels that develop are the pro-otic and anterior cerebral veins, as well as, the vena capitis lateralis and medialis.

On the rostral end, the supra-optic anastomosis and the posterior rhombencephalic veins originate. The anterior cerebral vein gives rise to the transverse sinuses. The cavernous sinus develops from the vena capitis medialis and the pro-otic vein. The vena capitis lateralis is unique in that it regresses, while the sigmoid sinuses form by the supra-optic anastomosis and the posterior rhombencephalic vein. The internal jugular veins derive from anterior cardinal veins.
