Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine drug used for the acute treatment of panic disorder, epilepsy, and nonconvulsive status epilepticus. The drug also has many off-label indications, including restless leg syndrome, acute mania, insomnia, and tardive dyskinesia. Clonazepam is a long-acting and high-potency benzodiazepine; it behaves as a GABA-A receptor agonist. Benzodiazepines facilitate GABA-A action by increasing the frequency of chloride channel opening resulting in hyperpolarization of the neurons and reduced firing, thus producing calming effects on the brain by decreasing the excitability of neurons. Clonazepam also has serotonergic activity by increasing serotonin synthesis. This activity will highlight the indications, mechanism of action, administration, adverse event profile, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of clonazepam in the clinical settings pertinent for interprofessional team members in treating patients with panic and seizure disorders.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for using clonazepam therapy.
- Select patients who will benefit from clonazepam therapy.
- Coordinate the management of a patient with clonazepam toxicity. 
- Collaborate with the interprofessional team to monitor patients for clonazepam overdose and/or toxicity to improve outcomes and prevent the risk of developing severe side effects.
