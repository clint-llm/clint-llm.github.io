Treatment and recovery from shoulder impingement syndrome rely heavily on interprofessional healthcare interaction. This includes the primary clinician providing pain relief modalities such as NSAIDs or corticosteroid injections and providing education and referral for physiotherapy. Physiotherapy, as lead by a physical therapist, should involve office-based exercises in addition to a home exercise program. Communication between the physical therapist and primary care clinician should occur on a routine basis to guide further imaging and treatment. If the patient is a candidate for surgical intervention, the primary care clinician should refer to an orthopedic surgeon. Orthopedic nurses assist in assessment, provide patient education, and communicate changes in patient status to the orthopedist. [Level 5]
