Buccal fat pad reduction is generally considered a safe and relatively simple procedure. Complications related to bichectomy are rare but are clinically significant when they do occur. The buccal fat pad is closely positioned to multiple vessels, the facial nerve, and the parotid duct. Removal of the BFP can result in damage to these vital structures. Complication rates are between 8.45% and 18%. Complications may result in parotid duct injury, hematoma, trismus, neuromotor deficits, and infection.

A case presentation in The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery discussed two cases where complications were encountered after buccal fat pad removal. The first case report describes a patient who presented to the emergency dept five days post-operatively with facial asymmetry. The patient was initially admitted and treated for an infection. However, the patient re-presented with increasing pain and edema requiring further investigation. The patient was found to have an accumulation of saliva in her buccal mucosa from obstruction of the Stenson duct due to iatrogenic damage of the duct. The patient was admitted for an additional seven days. During admission, the patient received conservative therapy and multiple drainages of the right buccal mucosa. The patient re-established good salivary drainage and was discharged home.

The second case report describes a patient who presented hours after buccal fat pad removal with severe facial pain and edema. The patient was also found to have significant ecchymosis of the infra and periorbital regions. The patient's clinical presentation was due to active bleeding from the sphenopalatine artery, and compression and attempts to locate and ligate the vessel were unsuccessful. The patient was emergently transported to the operating room, where the interventional radiology team performed angiographic embolization. Severe bleeding due to vessel damage during buccal fat pad removal is a rare complication likely resulting from either a vessel traction injury or deep dissection of the oral space.

Knowledge of the buccal fat pad and its related vital structures are fundamental to mitigating complications associated with buccal fat pad reduction. Appropriate informed consent is critical as even when demonstrating sound surgical technique; complications can occur due to the intimate association of the buccal fat pad with vital structures.
