Hepatitis A is not life-threatening but in older people, it can be associated with adverse outcomes. Thus, the condition is usually managed by an interprofessional team that includes an infectious disease expert, emergency department physician, nurse specialist, primary care provider, and the internist.

There is no specific treatment for this infection. Supportive care helps recovery in most patients.

For people who travel to endemic areas, the primary care providers including the pharmacist, nurse practitioner and clinician should educate the patient about the hepatitis A Vaccine. In addition, the patient should maintain good personal hygiene, wash all fruits and vegetables, drink boiled water and avoid sexual encounters with strangers. Patients with HAV should follow strict enteric precaution at home and limit personal contact with other members of the family until the symptoms subside. Finally, the infectious disease nurse should educate male patients from abstaining from anal sex.

The prognosis for most patients with hepatitis A is excellent.
