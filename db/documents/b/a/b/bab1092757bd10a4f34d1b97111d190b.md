In 1855, Thomas Addison described the first case of adrenal insufficiency

**Precipitating Factors for Adrenal Crisis**

Acute adrenal crisis can be the first presentation of unknown adrenal insufficiency and can occur in up to 50% of patients with known adrenal insufficiency

- Infections- bacterial, viral (including COVID-19), mycobacteria, fungal, or parasitic 
- Gastrointestinal illness and flu-like illnesses are the most commonly observed precipitating factors for adrenal crisis

- Stressful situations-trauma, pregnancy, parturition, surgery, extreme hot and cold weather

- Significant emotional distress

- Strenuous physical activity

- Non-adherence to glucocorticoid replacement therapy

- Abrupt cessation of chronic glucocorticoid therapy

- Thyrotoxicosis (as it increases cortisol metabolism) or initiation of levothyroxine therapy in a previously untreated case of adrenal insufficiency

- Medications:

- Antiadrenal medications, mitotane, metyrapone, ketoconazole
- Anticancer medications: Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors
