In summary, the major teaching points are as follows:

1) The traditional assessment of procedural skill has through checklists, global rating scales, and final product analysis.

2) Errors act to provide feedback and identify specific areas that one’s mental model is not adequate. Error management training sees errors not just as negative feedback indicating failed performance, but rather as an impetus for active learning and exploration to further develop one’s mental model.

3) The two key elements of error management training based learning are that firstly learners are “given only minimal guidance and otherwise are encouraged to actively explore and experiment on their own”; and secondly “EMT creates a learning environment in which errors are likely to occur.”
