Amantadine was once widely prescribed for Parkinson disease and even influenza. However, there are many moreÂ effective drugs on the market, and the use of amantadine has declined. Nevertheless, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, or primary care providers who prescribe this agent should closely monitor the patient for adverse effects. Also, the patient's renal function and mental status require monitoring. Amantadine can increase the risk of depression and lower the threshold for seizures, so nurses should explicitly query and search for this information on patient intake. Irreversible changes in the liver can occur, and hence liver enzymes require monitoring at the same time. Pharmacists should examine the patient's medical record, look for drug interactions, verify dosing, and express any concerns to the prescriber. With an interprofessional team approach to healthcare, amantadine therapy can be most effective in those cases where it is still useful, and other agents can substitute for it with a collaborative assessment of the patient's needs and regimen.
