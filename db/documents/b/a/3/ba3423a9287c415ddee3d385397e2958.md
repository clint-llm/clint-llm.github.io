Preparation for the reduction of nasal fractures involves an informed consent discussion that details the options available to the patient, as well as the risks and the anticipated results. Most nasal fractures can be left to heal on their own, provided the patient understands that a long-term cosmetic deformity and nasal obstruction are liable to result. In the acute period, within about two weeks from the injury, most nasal fractures can be reduced in a closed fashion, but after this period, closed osteotomies or even a formal open rhinoplasty may be required for definitive management. The most common adverse outcome of nasal fracture reduction is dissatisfaction with the result, from a cosmetic or functional standpoint, or both. In the event of dissatisfaction, which occurs in up to 20% of patients, open septorhinoplasty performed at least 3 to 6 months after the closed reduction may be an option.
