ATLL: Differential diagnoses for ATLL center around other T cell malignancies and deciphering these can be challenging. ATLL can mimic cutaneous T cell lymphoma as cutaneous features, both macroscopically and histologically, are similar, and even immunohistochemical profiles in some cases are identical. Lymphomatous ATLL can produce lymphadenopathy morphologically similar to that of Hodgkin disease, and it may appear that Reed-Sternberg cells are present.

HAM/TSP: The main differential is multiple sclerosis, which can be difficult to exclude particularly a primary progressive form in a patient from an HTLV-1-endemic country. Identification of HTLV-1 within CSF is essential to securing a diagnosis of HAM/TSP. As described above, there are many neurological diseases that HTLV-1 appears toÂ have the ability to induce including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and conus medullaris syndrome; establishing a causative link in patients with concurrent neurological disease, and HTLV-1 infection is challenging.
