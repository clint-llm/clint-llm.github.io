The etiology of oral melanoacanthoma is yet to be determined, but it is mostly associated with a traumatic process that stimulates melanocyte activity.

Chronic trauma, or chemical irritants, stimulates melanocytes, which result in either oral pigmentation or a melanoacanthoma.

Regular contact with petroleum derivatives found in toothpaste and mouthwashes may act as an irritant agent. These derivates include sodium lauryl sulfate, phenolphthalein, nitrophenol, chlorophenol, phenylenediamine sulfate, amine fluorideco, and cocamidopropyl betaine. Hydrogen peroxide mouthwashes can also irritate the oral mucosa and cause melanoacanthoma.

Silver amalgam has also been described as an etiologic factor that may cause morphologic changes and pigmentation and dental restoration with other materials.

Bruxism, biting of the cheeks,Â poorly fitted removable prosthesis, implant surgery, and non-specific chronic trauma have been reported features anteceding the presentation of an oral melanoacanthoma.

Other etiologic factors include patients treated for chronic asthma and ferrous lactate chronic treatment for iron-deficiency anemia.
