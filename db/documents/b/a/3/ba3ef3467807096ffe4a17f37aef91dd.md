Lipodystrophies are conditions that share the common finding of a reduction in subcutaneous fat. There are multiple subtypes of lipodystrophy, which may be either congenital or acquired and vary in the distribution of fat loss. Although all are relatively rare in incidence, acquired variants have become more common due to adverse effects of certain medications and iatrogenic mechanisms. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of lipodystrophy and stresses the role of an interprofessional team approach to the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the history and physical exam findings typically seen in patients with lipodystrophy.
- Explain the cause of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-induced lipodystrophy.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with lipodystrophy.
- Summarize modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by lipodystrophy.
