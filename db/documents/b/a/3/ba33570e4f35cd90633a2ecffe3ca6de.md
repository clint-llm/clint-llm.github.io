It is essential to classify spinal TB disease into a complicated and uncomplicated disease, based on their presentation. While uncomplicated spinal TB is essentially a medical disease; complicated TB spine patients need surgical intervention in addition to chemotherapy.

**Chemotherapy**

The mainstay of treatment in spinal TB is chemotherapy (antitubercular treatment [ATT]). Tubercle bacilli may exist as intracellular or extracellular forms or as dormant or rapidly multiplying forms.

**Multidrug Resistance**

MDR-TB is defined as TB infection resistant to INH and rifampicin. Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) is defined as infection resistant to INH and rifampicin, along with resistance to a fluoroquinolone and at least one injectable second-line medication. Velayati et al. described the term "totally drug-resistant" TB, where the tubercular strain is resistant to all first- and second-line drugs.

**Surgical Management**

**Principles**

Traditionally, TB was treated by radical debridement through an anterior approach.

- Lack of response to chemotherapy

- Recurrent disease

- Severe neurological weakness

- Static or progressive neuro deficit despite a course of ATT

- Deformity

- Debilitating pain

- Instability

The objectives of surgical intervention include drainage of an abscess, debridement of infected tissues, stabilization of vertebrae and deformity correction. Tubercle bacilli do not produce any biofilm and therefore, tubercular infections are amenable to stabilization with implants. The surgical procedure typically involves debridement and fusion (instrumented or non-instrumented) through anterior, posterior or combined approaches.

**Anterior Approach**

As TB spine involves the anterior vertebral structures predominantly, debridement through anterior approach and fusion has been traditionally used to manage the diseased tissues directly. Nevertheless, the anterior approach has been reported to be associated with serious complications including graft-related complications (subsidence, slippage, fracture, absorption among others), approach-related complications (respiratory compromise) and even mortality. An ideal indication for anterior surgery includes patients without any posterior vertebral structure involvement, in other words, no panvertebral disease.

**Posterior Approach**

In modern spine surgery, posterior approaches are more preferred in TB spondylitis in view of the following reasons

- Ease and familiarity of the approach

- Availability of more robust pedicle screw system

- Less approach-related morbidity

- Ability to perform circumferential decompression through a transpedicular approach

- Ability to perform global reconstruction through transpedicular, transfacetal, costotransversectomy or extracavitary-extrapleural approaches

**Combined (Anterior and Posterior) Approach**

Typically, this approach should be reserved for severe destructive lesions with severe deformities or inherently unstable spines only, as it is associated with significant morbidities and complications. The approaches can be performed in single or more than one stage.

**Minimally Invasive Surgery**

Recently, minimally invasive approaches including thoracoscopic debridement, minimally invasive fusion procedures and posterolateral endoscopic debridement have been demonstrated to provide an excellent outcome in TB spondylitis.

**Surgery in Healed Tuberculosis**

Surgery may be indicated in healed disease with instability or kyphotic deformity more than 60 degrees.
