Rotational vertebral artery syndrome presents with nonspecific symptoms consistent with vertebrobasilar deficiency. Most commonly, patients report dizziness, syncope, impaired vision/nystagmus, nausea, Horner syndrome, and other motor and sensory deficits that occur with head rotation. Patients often present with symptoms of transient ischemic attacks and strokes, which can have a plethora of underlying causes.

As mentioned briefly above, bow hunter syndrome was initially described in a patient who developed symptoms analogous to lateral medullary syndrome, normally caused by an infarct of the vertebral artery or the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. Lateral medullary syndrome, or Wallenberg syndrome, is characterized by ipsilateral pain and temperature sensation loss in the face and contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation in the body accompanied by gait ataxia/vertigo, nystagmus, nausea/vomiting, and dysphagia.
