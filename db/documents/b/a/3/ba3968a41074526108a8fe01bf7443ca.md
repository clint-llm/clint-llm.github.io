Ischemic strokes are due to the occlusion of vascular supply to a specific part of the brain leading to tissue hypoxia and damage. In lacunar infarction, the small penetrating cerebral vessels supplying the subcortical areas are occluded due to various vascular pathologies, including lipohyalinosis and microatheromas.

In some cases, small embolic fragments from a cardiac source or large vessel disease can cause deep penetrating artery occlusion.

The development of small vessel disease, causing a lacunar stroke, is mainly due to underlying medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Other risk factors include smoking, LDL levels, carotid artery atherosclerosis, peripheral artery disease, previous TIA, and hyperhomocysteinemia.

Certain genetic factors also increase the risk of developing small vessel disease. APOE e4 alleles and carriers are at increased risk of developing white matter lesions. Also, cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is one of the rare genetic disorders that can cause small vessel arteriopathy.
