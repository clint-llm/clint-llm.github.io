As mentioned, patients with pericardial cysts are predominantly asymptomatic, with reportedly <25% of patients presenting with symptoms due to compression or erosion of adjacent structures. There have been reports of a large 11 x 11 cm pericardial cyst, causing substernal pain radiating to the bilateral shoulders after a long road trip, only discovered incidentally on imaging ordered to assess for pulmonary embolism.

Common symptoms are vague and can include chronic cough, chest pain, dyspnea, and retrosternal pressure. Rarely, dysrhythmias, syncope, and pneumonia can occur.
