Multiple disorders can cause achlorhydria.

- Pernicious anemia (anti-parietal and anti-intrinsic factor antibodies): It is an autoimmune phenomenon in which antibodies are formed. These autoantibodies cause the autoimmune destruction of parietal cells leading to atrophic gastritis.

- Use of antisecretory medications: Short-term standard dose treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) has been shown to have low risk, but long-term use of PPIs has been linked to hypochlorhydria.

- Helicobacter pylori infection: Acute H. pylori infection of gastric epithelial cells represses H-K-ATPase alpha-subunit gene expression leading to transient hypochlorhydria and supporting H. pylori proliferation. This growth of H. pylori may even initiate a pathological process causing gastric cancer.

- Gastric bypass: Gastric bypass is a gastric exclusion operation performed in patients with morbid obesity to reduce food intake. Studies show that the acid secretion unbuffered by the food in the excluded stomach results in lowered gastrin secretion hence leading to achlorhydria in such patients.

- VIPomas: VIPoma is an endocrine tumor that usually arises from beta-pancreatic cells and secretes vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). It may be associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). The massive amounts of VIP secretion cause watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, achlorhydria, vasodilation, hypercalcemia, and hyperglycemia.

- Hypothyroidism: Thyroid hormone plays a role in hydrochloric acid secretion; hence hypothyroidism can lead to achlorhydria.

- Radiation to stomach: Radiation to the stomach has also been reported to cause achlorhydria.

- Gastric cancer: Animal studies have shown evidence of achlorhydria in gastric cancer.
