Initial treatment for renal artery stenosis is observation instead of revascularization when either stenosis is 50% to 80%, and scintigraphy findings are negative, or the degree of stenosis is less than 50%. The management which involves serial control every 6 months with duplex scanning, accurate correction of dyslipidemia, use of drugs that block platelet aggregation, may require three or more different drugs to control hypertension.

The degree of renal artery stenosis that would justify any intervention attempt is greater than 80% in patients with bilateral stenosis or stenosis in a solitary functioning kidney regardless of whether they have renal insufficiency or not.

When renal function is normal or nearly normal, revascularization is recommended for prevention of renal insufficiency if the patient fulfills  the mentioned criteria:

- The degree of renal artery stenosis is greater than 80% to 85%

- The degree of  RAS is 50% to 80%, and captopril-enhanced scintigraphy demonstrates the presence of intrarenal renal artery stenosis.

When renal function abnormality is present, the criteria for revascularization are as follows:

- The serum creatinine level is less than 4 mg/dL

- The serum creatinine level is greater than 4 mg/dL but with a possible recent renal artery thrombosis

- The degree of stenosis is higher than 80%

- The serum creatinine level increases after administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors

- The degree of stenosis is 50% to 80%, and the scintigraphy results are positive for RAS.
