Betaxolol selectively antagonizes Beta-1 receptors. The adrenergic receptors are located primarily in the kidney, cardiac myocytes, nodal tissue, and other cardiac conduction tissue.

For example, in the ciliary body, the increase in calcium leads to an increased aqueous humor production, which can lead to increased intraocular pressure seen in glaucoma. Betaxolol prevents the G protein cascade from increasing intracellular calcium, thus preventing the production of aqueous humor production from the ciliary body.

Betaxolol is rarely associated with bronchospasm, sometimes seen in nonselective beta-blockers like timolol. Beta-2 receptors are present in bronchial and vascular smooth muscle; this explains betaxolol’s preferred use over nonselective beta-blockers, like timolol, in those with mild comorbid respiratory pathologies and contraindications to other therapeutic options.
