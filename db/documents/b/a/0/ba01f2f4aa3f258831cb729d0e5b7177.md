Laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS) is a narrowing of the upper airway between the larynx and the trachea with potentially devastating consequences, including respiratory failure, cardiopulmonary arrest, and death. The upper airway is constituted by the larynx, glottis, subglottic region, and trachea. The trachea is a cylindrical-shaped tube with an anterior cartilaginous wall formed by c-shaped rings and a posterior membranous wall. The trachea branches off into the right and left mainstem bronchi at the carina, which is located at the level of the fourth thoracic vertebra (T4). This activity reviews the etiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, management, and complications of laryngotracheal stenosis. It also covers the role of the interprofessional care team in the treatment of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of laryngotracheal stenosis.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of laryngotracheal stenosis.
- Outline the treatment options available for laryngotracheal stenosis.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance laryngotracheal stenosis and improve outcomes.
