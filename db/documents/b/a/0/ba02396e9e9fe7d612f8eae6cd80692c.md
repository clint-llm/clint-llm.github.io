Most patients with isolated PLD are asymptomatic, and estimates are that 80% of patients are usually diagnosed incidentally on imaging studies. Symptomatic severity is dependent on the number, size, and location of the cysts. In symptomatic patients, the cysts are impeding on nearby intrahepatic structures such as the inferior vena cava, hepatic veins, portal veins, or bile ducts. The common symptoms in patients with PLD include abdominal distension, shortness of breath, postprandial fullness, esophageal reflux, abdominal pain, and back pain. If patients have reflux or early satiety/postprandial fullness, they can be at risk for malnutrition and failure to thrive.

Compression of nearby vascular structures can lead to portal hypertension, and patients may present with variceal bleeding, jaundice, ascites, and/or encephalopathy.

Liver cysts can also cause a Budd-Chiari-like syndrome if venous drainage from the liver is obstructed and may present with the classic triad of abdominal pain, ascites, and hepatomegaly.
