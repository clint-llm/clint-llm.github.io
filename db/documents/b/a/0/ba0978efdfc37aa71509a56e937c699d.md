**Reduction techniques for anterior shoulder dislocation**

**Scapular Manipulation**(80% to 100% successful)

- Upright or prone

- In upright position, the patient is sitting up, may rest unaffected shoulder against upright head of bed

- Stand behind patient and use one thumb over tip of scapula and push medially while pushing acromion inferiorly with the other thumb

- Assistant simultaneously provided traction by grabbing patient’s wrist with one hand and flexed elbow with other hand and pushing down on elbow

- The reduction may be subtle, without obvious “clunk.”

- Reduced risk of associated fractures

**External Rotation Technique**

The external rotation technique reduces anterior glenohumeral dislocation by overcoming spasm of the internal rotators of the humerus, unwinding the joint capsule, and enabling the external rotators of the rotator cuff to pull the humerus posteriorly.

- Easy and can do alone

- With patient supine, elbow flexed to 90 degrees, elbow held with one hand, and wrist is held with another hand

- Slowly, have patient allow the arm to fall to the side, externally rotating forearm. The patient pauses with pain and allows muscles to relax. Over 5 to 10 minutes, the arm externally rotates, and reduction occurs

- Reduction usually occurs with arm externally rotated between 70 to 110 degrees

**Cunningham Technique
**

- Patient is seated with examiner seated in front of patient, and the patient places ipsilateral hand on top of examiner’s shoulder

- The clinician rests one arm in patient’s elbow crease and uses the other hand to massage the patient’s biceps, deltoid, and trapezius muscles

- Have patient relax and instruct to pull their shoulder blades together and straighten their back

- Popular technique now since rarely conscious sedation needed

**Milch Technique**(add Milch technique if external rotation unsuccessful)

- Patient is supine, fingers over the shoulder with thumb in axilla to stabilize

- Arm is externally rotated and then abducted over patient’s head while maintaining external rotation with simultaneously placing direct pressure over the humeral head

**Stimson Technique
**

- No assistant needed and no need for conscious sedation

- Patient is prone with affected arm hanging off the side of bed with 5 lb (2.3 kg) to  15 lb (6.8 kg) of weight

- Reduction is usually achieved within 30 minutes

**Traction Countertraction
**

- A sheet is wrapped under the axilla, and one assistant provides continuous traction at the wrist or elbow while the other provides countertraction with the sheet from the opposite side

**Spaso Technique
**

- Patient is supine while examiner grasps wrist or distal forearm and lifts vertically with gentle vertical traction and external rotation

**Fares Technique
**

- Patient is supine with upper extremity at their side

- The examiner holds patient’s wrist and gently pulls the arm to provide traction

- The arm is abducted while continuously moving arm in anteriorly and posteriorly in small oscillating movements (about 10 cm)

- If shoulder has not reduced by 90 degrees of abduction, add external reduction

**Fulcrum Technique
**

- Patient is supine or sitting, and a rolled towel or sheet is placed in axilla

- The distal humerus is adducted with simultaneous posterolateral force on the humeral head

- Requires increased force, may have increased complications

**Kocher’s and Hippocratic Techniqueoot**placed in patient’s axilla before traction) no longer recommended due to higher risk of complications

**Posterior Shoulder Reduction
**

- The patient is in the supine position. An assistant applies anterior pressure to humeral head while examiner applies axial traction to the humerus with internal and external rotation of humerus

**Disposition After Shoulder Reduction**

- Place patient in a sling

- Neurovascular exam

- Post-reduction imaging

- Follow-up with an orthopedic surgeon
