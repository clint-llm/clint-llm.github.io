Located in the posterior aspect of the lower leg, the Achilles tendon is the thickest tendon in the human body with the ability to resist large tensile forces. It attaches the muscles of the posterior calf, namely the confluence of the distal attachment of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles to the calcaneus. Originally named after Achilles, a character in Greek mythology, this tendon is also termed the calcaneal tendon, referring to its attachment. However, its more common name is the Achilles tendon.
