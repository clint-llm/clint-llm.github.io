Triglycerides are carried in the circulation by triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (VLDL and chylomicrons). ****Chylomicrons are released from the small intestines and carry a significantly high percentage of TGL. The TGL rich chylomicrons undergo hydrolysis in peripheral tissues. Due to the lipolysis, free fatty acids (FFA) are released.****The FFA is taken by muscle cells, where they are a source of energy. In adipose tissue, the FFA is stored as an inactive fuel.

When compared to very large triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, the remnant triglyceride-rich lipoproteins can be atherogenic.

The release of excess free fatty acids and lysolecithin from chylomicrons in pancreatic capillaries is linked to the causation of pancreatitis. Hyperviscosity from increased chylomicrons leads to acidosis and ischemia in the capillary beds. This leads to the activation of pancreatic lipases, lipolysis, and release of toxic FFA, which cause inflammation, cytotoxic injury, and pancreatitis. ****In most instances, pancreatitis can be prevented by keeping triglyceride levels below 250 mg/dL to 500 mg/dL.
