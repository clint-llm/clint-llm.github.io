Congenital melanocytic nevi (CMN) are one of the most frequent skin lesions encountered at birth. They are composed of collections of melanocytes (pigment-forming cells) that show distinct clinical and histopathological features. They also present a different biological behavior to acquired melanocytic nevi.

Their clinical relevance relies on their association with the development of malignant melanomaÂ and with central nervous system (CNS) involvement (neurocutaneous melanosis), which are greatly dependent on their size.

This article will discuss the etiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of CMN.
