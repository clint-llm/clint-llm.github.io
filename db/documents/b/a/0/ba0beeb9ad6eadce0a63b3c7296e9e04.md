Testing olfactory nerve function is intuitive and straightforward. Proper testing requires a conscious, cooperative patient with intact higher cognitive function, a patent airway, and unobstructed nostrils. The patient must close their eyes, and the examiner tests each nostril individually, while the other nostril is blocked. Anything with a characteristic smell is usable for the test. For example, coffee is a common choice. The patient is presented with the coffee to the open nostril and reports whether they recognize the scent or not. It is important to note that the primary olfactory cortex in each hemisphere receives input bilaterally, from both olfactory bulbs. Assessing olfactory symptoms in cases like stroke is clinically unhelpful because an isolated unilateral stroke in the primary olfactory cortex will not result in significant olfactory symptoms. Olfactory nerve dysfunction can arise from a variety of etiologies, some of which include genetic defects, trauma, neoplasms, and iatrogenic injury.

**Congenital Anosmia:**

Isolated congenital anosmia is a rare condition inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion that is characterized by a life long inability to smell, with no associated congenital structural or metabolic abnormalities. Although anosmia may occur alone, anosmia since birth may also be a symptom of another condition called Kallman syndrome. Kallman syndrome is a form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism that is distinguished from other forms of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism by the additional and unique symptoms of anosmia. Kallman syndrome occurs as a result of impaired development of the olfactory system and disrupted embryonic migration of GnRH-synthesizing neurons from the olfactory epithelium to the hypothalamus. The failure to develop proper early olfactory neuron projections from the olfactory placode to the olfactory bulb results in aplasia or hypoplasia of the olfactory bulbs that are visible on MRI.

**Tumors and olfaction:**

Tumors can affect the olfactory bulb and tract through compression and mass effect; meningiomas are most commonly the culprit. Tumors of the anterior skull base are known to affect olfactory sensation and can present insidiously with hyposmia, anosmia, or parosmia. Esthesioneuroblastoma is a malignant tumor arising from the neuroepithelium that lines the cribriform plate, superior aspect of the nasal septum, middle turbinate, and superior turbinate. These tumors involve the frontal skull base and are commonly seen growing along the cranial nerves as they exit and enter the skull base. These tumors commonly affect the olfactory nerve, olfactory bulb, and olfactory tract. Rare tumors like olfactory ensheathing cell tumors or primitive neuroectodermal tumors can also affect the olfactory system and are found almost exclusively in children.

**Post-Traumatic Anosmia:**

Head trauma can occur through a multitude of mechanisms and is a common cause of olfactory dysfunction in the modern world. Regardless of the specific initiating incident, post-traumatic olfactory dysfunction occurs primarily through 3 mechanisms: Sinus or nasal tract disruption, shearing of olfactory nerve fibers at the cribriform plate, and localized hemorrhage/contusion within the olfactory bulb and primary olfactory cortex.
