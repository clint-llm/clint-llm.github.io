Anterior NCS is the most common type, in which the LRV is compressed between the Ao and SMA. Rarely, posterior NCS occurs and is most commonly a variant involving a retro aortic or circumaortic LRV compressed between the Ao and spinal column.

Moreover, co-occurrence of venous compression syndromes in the paralumbar area and resultant hypertensive venous collaterals might describe the association of two underdiagnosed entities of NCS andÂ May - Thurner (MTS).

Hematuria occurs when the elevated blood pressure in the collaterals and subsequent venous sinuses near the renal calyces ruptures the thin-walled septum between the small veins and the renal collecting system.
