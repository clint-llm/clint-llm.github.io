The appearance of AGEP is described as tiny nonfollicular sterile pustules with underlying erythema that develop and spread rapidly and are accompanied by pruritus or burning sensation plus an actual or subjective fever. Although often described as “pinhead” size, the pustules may coalesce, appear more prominent, and lead to superficial skin detachment with gentle pressure akin to a positive Nikolsky sign.

Symptoms begin in flexural or intertriginous regions before becoming more generalized to the trunk, limbs, and face within a few hours to days while usually sparing palms and soles.

Over the next 1 to 2 weeks, the pustules desquamate in a collaret-like manner. Other reported symptoms include lymphadenopathy or atypical presentations that include purpura, vesicles, bullae, or symptoms localized to the face, neck, and chest. Historical clues consistent with AGEP include rapid development of symptoms, often within ten days or less of exposure to an offending medication, and resolution within 15 days of discontinuation.

In some cases, such as AGEP triggered by hydroxychloroquine or terbinafine, the time from onset to resolution may be much longer.
