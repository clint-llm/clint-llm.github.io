Capgras syndrome is a complicated and organic condition caused by structural brain injuries with neuroanatomical damage.

Some psychologists hypothesized that patients with CS have conscious ability to recognize faces was still potent. Still, they may also present with damage to the system that facilitates emotional arousal to familiar faces.

CS can be seen with reduplicative paramnesia, a delusional misidentification syndrome in which a subject believes a location has been relocated. CS and reduplicative paramnesia are linked since they affect the same brain regions.
