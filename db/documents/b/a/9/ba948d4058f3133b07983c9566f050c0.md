Genital HPV infections have an estimated prevalence of 10% to 20%, with clinical manifestations in 1%. The incidence of HPV infection has been increasing. About 80% of those infected are between the ages of 17 and 33 years, with the peak age group being 20 to 24.  It has been estimated that 2.9% of the US male population will have genital HPV DNA.

Although treatments can remove warts, they do not remove HPV. Warts may sometimes spontaneously regress. Traditional theories postulate that the virus remains in the body for a lifetime. However, it is now believed that the virus may be either cleared or suppressed to levels below what polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests can measure.

HPV infection appears to be the cause of most cases of anal cancer (about 90%) and virtually all cases of cervical cancer in women, with HPV type 16 accounting for about 50% of these.  (Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women.) Some vulvar cancers have been linked to HPV infections (29% to 43%), while vaginal cancer is associated with HPV infections about 70% of the time (HPV Types 16 and 18).

In men, Bowen disease of the penis and about 35% to 40% of all penile cancers are associated with HPV infections.

Risk factors for HPV persistence include age, smoking, immunosuppression, and simultaneous infection with multiple HPV types.

**HPV Vaccinations**

An HPV vaccination is available.

For previously unvaccinated adults, the CDC suggests vaccinations for those 27 to 45 years of age.

For adolescents, the CDC suggests the vaccine be given at ages 11 or 12 years, but may be started as early as 9.
