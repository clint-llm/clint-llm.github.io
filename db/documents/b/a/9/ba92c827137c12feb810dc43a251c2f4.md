Osmoreceptors classify into central and peripheral osmoreceptors based on their location. The central receptors are primarily present in the anterior hypothalamus, including two of the circumventricular organs named the organum vasculosum laminae terminalis (OVLT) and the subfornical organ (SFO).

These central receptor cells have an osmotically activated ion channel called transient receptor potential vanilloid channel (TRPV1) as well as another receptor sensitive to angiotensin II called angiotensin receptor type 1(AT1R).

One of the central receptor organs, SFO, has two distinct types of neurons with opposing actions. A glutamatergic population (SFO-GLUT) that promotes thirst and sodium intake, and a GABAergic population (SFO-GABA) that inhibits thirst.

OVLT, the other central receptor, is close to the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO). Hence its exact cellular diversity is not clear at the moment.
