Vitamin E or tocopherol is a fat-soluble vitamin that functions as an antioxidant, protecting the cell membrane. As with all vitamins, the body does not form vitamin E. It solely forms from the photosynthetic processes of plants and therefore must be consumed from outside sources in small quantities. Vitamin E is a medication used to manage and treat vitamin E deficiency states and disease prevention. This activity outlines the indications, action, adverse reactions, contraindications, and other key elements of vitamin E therapy in the clinical setting as relates to the essential points needed by members of an interprofessional team managing the care of patients with vitamin E deficiency and applications of vitamin E in disease prevention.

**Objectives:**
