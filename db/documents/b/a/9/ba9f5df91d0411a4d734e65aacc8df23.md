Although the rooting reflex disappears typically after 4 to 6 months, its persistence after the expected resolution period may suggest congenital cerebral injury. Multiple reflexive abnormalities may be observed with the rooting reflex,Â as they are commonly regulated by the frontal lobe. Hyperreflexia responses may suggest neonatal withdrawal after in utero exposure to maternal substance abuse, such as heroin or opiate medications. Recurrence of the reflexes in adults suggests central nervous system pathologies. It may be related to neuronal loss related to normal aging or dementia. Persistence or reappearance of primitive reflexes may serve as an early sign of neurological dysfunction. Further testing should be performed to detect any underlying conditions. Early detection of disease will allow providers to plan out interventions promptly and prevent or slow down the progression of the disease.
