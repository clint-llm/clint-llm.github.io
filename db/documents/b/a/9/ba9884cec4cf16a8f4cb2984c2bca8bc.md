Amyloid plaque burden and spatial distribution of the plaques are now visible on imaging. A radiotracer called Pittsburgh Compound B is FDA approved for use in PET scan for the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. This molecule preferentially targets and binds to amyloid beta plaques with high affinity and specificity and can estimate the plaque burden and distribution of Alzheimer disease. This imaging is now in use in almost all clinical trials of Alzheimer disease.

Free amyloid peptide levels are measurable in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma. Low levels of amyloid beta, perhaps an indicator of low clearance from the brain, and abnormally high tau protein in CSF serve as biomarkers of Alzheimer disease in clinical trials.

**Amyloid Beta as Therapeutic Target**

Several clinical trials using immunotherapy have attempted to decrease plaque burden as a mechanism to stop the progression of Alzheimer disease. However, most of these trials failed to meet the primary endpoint or were stopped due to safety concerns. Typically, vaccination against the amyloid beta or passive immunization with antibodies targeted against amyloid peptide was was the attempted intervention. The failure of these therapies may argue against the central role of amyloid deposition in Alzheimer disease. However, it is possible that the treatments were tested in the later stages of the disease rather than early in the disease process when the impact on disease modification could be higher. Alternatively, this approach does not address the tau protein pathway in the disease and hence could not affect disease progression.

**Teaching Points**

The amyloid precursor protein is processed to form an amyloid beta peptide. An imbalance in production and clearing of the peptide appears to lead to the formation of excess amyloid oligomers and amyloid plaques. The latter is the histopathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease.

The gene for amyloid precursor protein is located on chromosome 21 and encodes a transmembrane protein. The amyloid precursor protein is cleaved by beta-secretase and gamma-secretase to release the amyloid beta peptide. Genetic mutation of the amyloid precursor protein gene or the catalytic subunits of the gamma-secretase complex, for example, Presenilin 1 and Presenilin 2, cause familial Alzheimer disease.

Mutation in amyloid precursor protein was the first to be discovered, but a mutation in Presenilin 1 is the most common cause (up to 80%) of familial Alzheimer disease.

Familial Alzheimer disease characteristically presents with early-onset dementia, onset before age 60 years, and usually autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.

Apo E4 carrier status confers a high risk for sporadic Alzheimer disease. This risk is dose-dependent with homozygous status conferring higher risk.

Low CSF amyloid beta peptide and high CSF Tau peptides are biomarkers in a clinical trial setting.

Chemical compounds, for example, Pittsburgh Compound B, that bind the amyloid plaque, can be used as imaging biomarkers.
