- Non-suppurative infectious dermo hypodermitis diagnosis

- Nodular hypodermitis with vascular involvement (periarteritis nodosa and superficial thrombophlebitis) and damage to deep vessels of medium to sometimes large diameter is associated with hypodermic septal or lobular involvement. Nodules can become necrotic. The diagnosis is primarily histological.

- Lobular hypodermitis or panniculitis involves lesions that are primarily greasy. The diagnosis is primarily histological, hence the absolute need for biopsy. Several entities have been distinguished. The nodules can liquefy, fistulate, and leave a scar.
