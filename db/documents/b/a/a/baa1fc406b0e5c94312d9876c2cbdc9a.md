Depending on the patient, it can be helpful to show or describe the size of the defect after tumor clearance and explain the chosen transposition flap and the expected scar. Addressing the patient expectations is key to proper care of the flap as well as improving the perception of the outcome. Patients often underestimate the size of the tumor, and satisfaction may be increased byÂ encouraging them to see the size of the defect after tumor clearance to understand better why the scar appears the way that it does. Photographs should be taken of the lesion before incision, the defect after tumor clearance, and the completed repair. Typical postoperative changes and the potential need for revisions, such as laser or dermabrasion, should also be discussed.
