Synthetic melatonin is a dietary supplement. The FDA does not regulate supplements. Consequently, melatonin is not officially FDA-approved for any indication. However, melatonin receptor agonists such as ramelteon and tasimelteon are FDA-approved for the treatment of insomnia. Non-FDA-approved Indications for melatonin include insomnia. Despite the lack of FDA approval, melatonin is considered the first-line pharmacologic therapy for the treatment of insomnia by the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP). It is relatively safe with a low risk of side effects. There are other indications as well surrounding sleep-related concerns, including shift work and jet lag. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, pharmacology, monitoring, and relevant melatonin interactions pertinent for interprofessional team members in treating patients with conditions where it is of clinical value.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the mechanism of action of melatonin.
- Identify the indications where exogenous melatonin might prove beneficial.
- Review the potential adverse effects of melatonin.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes and treatment efficacy for patients who might use supplemental melatonin.
