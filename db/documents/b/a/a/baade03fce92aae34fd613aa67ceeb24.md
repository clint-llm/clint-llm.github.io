Amsler sign is an important clinical sign which is usually innocuous. However, in all cases of intraoperative hyphema, it is prudent to review the medical history specifically to rule out uncontrolled systemic diseases, including hypertension, clotting disorders, or anticoagulant therapy. The role of the nursing staff is very important in this regard. Interprofessional coordination with the physician and pharmacist isÂ needed in such cases to improve patient care and to deliver excellent outcomes, both ocular and systemic.
