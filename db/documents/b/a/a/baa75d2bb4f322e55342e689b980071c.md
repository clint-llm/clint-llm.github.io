Breastfeeding is an important part of the neonatal and infant periods. Breastfeeding or lactation provides total nutritional support and promotes the emotional dependency of the baby on the breastfeeding parent. A strong emotional bond facilitates the successful prolongation of breastfeeding.

Milk production is regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary tract and its associated hormones. Oxytocin and prolactin are the main hormones in milk production and the resulting let-down reflex.

Milk production occurs in stages, the first of which usually begins before the birth of the infant. The first milk is colostrum and is available after labor. Occasionally, there is pre-colostrum before the postpartum stage. Colostrum is high in protein, sodium, and immunoglobulins and is low in lactose.

Vitamin D supplementation should be started within the first few days of life. Initial dosing of 400 IU daily should be increased to 600 IU daily at one year of age.

Maintenance of lactation follows an autonomous pattern wherein infant suckling and emptying of the breast are the main factors regulating the milk flow.
