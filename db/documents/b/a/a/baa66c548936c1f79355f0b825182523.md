Mallet finger injuries are usually caused by a traumatic event resulting in forced flexion of the extended fingertip. This causes a stretching or tearing of the extensor tendon. In severe injuries, this forced flexion can cause an avulsion of the tendon insertion on the distal phalanx and is described as a mallet fracture. Mallet finger injuries can also be caused by a laceration/abrasion, or more rarely, a forced hyperextension of the distal interphalangeal joint.  Such an injury results in a fracture at the dorsal base of the distal phalanx. This disruption of extensor tendon function causes an unopposed flexion force on the finger and is accompanied by the inability to extend the digit. This injury results in the classic “mallet” appearance of the finger.

**Classification System**

Acute mallet finger deformities are defined as those occurring within four weeks of the injury, while chronic mallet finger deformities occur four weeks after the injury.

**Doyle’s Classification of Mallet Finger Injuries**

- Closed injury, with or without small dorsal avulsion fracture

- Open injury (laceration)

- Open injury (deep abrasion involving skin and tendon)

- Mallet fracture

- Distal phalanx physeal injury in children

- Fracture fragment involving 20% to 50% of the articular surface

- Fracture fragment involving more than 50% of the articular surface
