Managing the administration of triamcinolone requires an interprofessional team consisting of a primary care clinician (MD, DO, NP, PA), pharmacist, nurse, and other specialty clinicians such as an allergist or dermatologist. An immunologist may also be called upon to evaluate immune system processes affected by the administration of triamcinolone. The interprofessional team must instruct patients on the proper technique for applying triamcinolone. The healthcare team should be vigilant regarding adverse effects as well as therapeutic outcomes of triamcinolone. Nursing can verify patient adherence, answer questions, provide counsel, and monitor for adverse events and treatment effectiveness, informing the clinician of any concerns that may arise. Pharmacists should be involved with recommendations regarding dosing and storage. Additionally, a clinical pharmacologist consult is necessary if the patient is experiencing toxicity symptoms. Regular follow-up with the patient is prudent to assess for abnormalities and drug efficacy.

To summarize, triamcinolone therapy requires an interprofessional team approach, including clinicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient outcomes. [Level 5]
