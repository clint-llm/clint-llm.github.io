Common features of central or peripheral nervous system involvement include cranial mononeuropathy involving the facial nerve, neuroendocrine dysfunction involving the hypothalamus (i.e. neurogenic diabetes insipidus), myelopathy or radiculopathy if the spinal cord is affected (in rare cases cauda equina polyradiculopathy may occur), hydrocephalus, meningitis, mononeuropathy, mononeuritis multiplex, carpal tunnel, and muscle involvement which may cause proximal myopathy and muscle atrophy. Symptoms of neurosarcoidosis may be multifocal, commonly seen first in the cranial nerves. The facial nerve is the most common cranial nerve affected, which may mimic Lyme disease. Heerfordt syndrome is a rare manifestation of neurosarcoidosis which presents with facial nerve palsy and the presence of parotid gland enlargement, anterior uveitis, and fever.

In gathering a history, the first sign of neurosarcoidosis may be seizures, which generally confers a poor prognosis. Patients with simple partial or complex partial seizures may have a better prognosis in comparison to generalized tonic-clonic seizures.

Depending on the location of the disease in the brain, the patient may also present with:

- Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH)

- Changes in appetite

- Somnolence

- Autonomic impairment

- Weight gain

- Impotence

- Galactorrhea

- Dementia

- Impaired cognition
