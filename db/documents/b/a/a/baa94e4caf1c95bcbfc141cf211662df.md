There a few risk factors associated with true gallbladder polyp formation. Some studies suggest conditions such as familial polyposis, Peutz-Jeghers, Gardner syndrome, and hepatitis B may be factors associated with polyp formation. Pseudo or cholesterol polyps can develop when the cholesterol or bile salt content in the bile is high. This leads to condensation of cholesterol clumps which can adhere to the wall of the gallbladder. This condition may be a precursor to gallstone formation and can also at times be seen in conjunction with gallstones. Other factors typically associated with gallbladder diseases such as obesity, sex, weight loss, and diabetes have not been shown to increase the formation of gallbladder polyps.
