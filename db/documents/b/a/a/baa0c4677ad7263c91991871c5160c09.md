For patients with atrial fibrillation, percutaneous left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) emerged as a valid alternative to oral anticoagulation. This activity reviews the evaluation, indications/contraindications, pre/post-procedural management of percutaneous LAAC and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify indications and contraindications for percutaneous left atrial appendage closure.
- Describe pre-procedural planning and preparation to perform successful percutaneous left atrial appendage closure.
- Summarize the complications of percutaneous left atrial appendage closure.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to ensure the appropriate selection of candidates for percutaneous left atrial appendage closure and to enhance post-procedural management.
