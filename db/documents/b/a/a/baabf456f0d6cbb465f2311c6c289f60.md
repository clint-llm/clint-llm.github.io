Supportive care is the mainstay of treatment, beginning with control of airway, breathing, and circulation. Securing the airway or administering supplemental oxygen is often required in cases of significant exposure. Depending on the amount of pulmonary edema, positive pressure may be necessary to maintain oxygenation. The exogenous surfactant has been used with success; however, steroids and antibiotics are not proven to be beneficial. In the event of hypotension, aggressive fluid resuscitation is recommended as catecholamines such as epinephrine and norepinephrine may cause dysrhythmias. In the case of hydrocarbon ingestion, gastric lavage or charcoal is not used as these substances are quickly absorbed.  Charcoal is contraindicated due to the high risk of aspiration. Decontamination should be done before arriving in treatment areas to decrease the risk of secondary exposure to fumes. Consultation with a toxicologist is recommended, especially in higher-risk exposures such as aromatic or halogenated hydrocarbons.

Patients who are asymptomatic after 6 hours from inhalation or aspiration without any changes on pulse oximetry or chest radiography can be discharged with good return precautions. Hospitalization is required in patients with moderate to severe symptoms or patients with exposures to hydrocarbons that may produce delayed complications such as hepatotoxicity.
