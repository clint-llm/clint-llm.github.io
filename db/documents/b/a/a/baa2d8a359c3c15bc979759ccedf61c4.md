Initially, TSH, free T4, and T3 should be measured to assess whether the patient is thyrotoxic, subclinically toxic, hypothyroid, or euthyroid. Then ultrasonography (US) must be done to assess nodules. Features that make nodules suspicious are hypoechogenicity, microcalcification, hypervascularity, and if there are solid components of complex nodules. In these situations, fine needle aspiration cytology under US guidance is recommended. A chest x-ray is useful in assessing retrosternal goiter and if there any tracheal deviation. Sometimes computerized tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are useful in describing anatomical relations regarding tracheal deviation, airway compression, retrotracheal, or retrosternal extension.

Radionuclide scanning can be used to assess thyroid anatomy and function.

In some cases, radioisotope scanning, pulmonary function tests, flow volume loops, and barium swallow studies have some role in evaluating goiter patients. Preoperative vocal cord movement assessment is important using laryngoscopy.
