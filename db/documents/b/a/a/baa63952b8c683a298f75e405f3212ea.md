Sir Harold Ridley implanted the first intraocular lens (IOL) in 1949.

In most patients, emmetropia is the targeted post-operative refraction, while some patients are targeted for residual myopia.

Apart from the axial length and keratometry, other parameters may also be required, such as anterior chamber depth and the corneal white-to-white distance.
