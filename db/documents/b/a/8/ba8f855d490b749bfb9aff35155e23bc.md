There are many reasons patients take vitamin E supplementation in larger dosages. In rat models, it was found that topical alpha-tocopherol at lower concentrations was useful in prolonging the onset of cataracts. At higher levels, it actually increased the onset of cataracts.

In osteoporosis, vitamin E has been explored both as an anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory with mixed benefits. In diabetes, alpha-tocopherol was found to help with wound healing.  In inflammatory diseases, such as asthma, Crohn, rheumatoid arthritis, it has been shown that tocotrienols are more effective compared to alpha-tocopherols at decreasing inflammation. In patients who have been exposed to large amounts of radiation, vitamin E is effective by helping hematopoiesis after radiation.

Vitamin E has been used in cardiovascular disease prevention such as stroke, coronary heart disease, and myocardial infarction. Tocotrienols were found to be more beneficial in coronary artery disease and strokes than alpha-tocopherols.****In a large retrospective analysis completed in 2017, there was found to be no difference in the cognitive decline of patients who were supplemented with Vitamin E versus placebo in both patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment.
