Medical ethics, a set of values used to navigate complicated situations, are founded in the concepts of patient autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice.

In 2016, Canada introduced Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID), for cases of grievous and irremediable suffering. With an estimated 2,000 cases of euthanasia per year, this may present another avenue for increasing organ availability. From 2016 to 2019, 30 patients made donations for a total of 74 organs donated.
