Healthcare providers are obligated to ensure that a patient who receives the gift of an organ has the best possible outcome. Efficient communication between the multi-disciplinary team consisting of the primary care physician, the consulting organ specialist, and the transplant surgeon is vital in providing comprehensive treatment to patients. Given the high complexity of treatment in these patients, consulting an endocrinologist early on for the evaluation and treatment of osteoporosis is likely to improve patient outcomes. Early preventive therapy for osteoporosis is associated with a decreased incidence of osteoporosis and fractures among transplant recipients.
