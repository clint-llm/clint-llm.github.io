Meckel's diverticulum is a common congenital gastrointestinal malformation on the ileum resulting from incomplete atrophy of the vitelline duct in the embryo. The omphalomesenteric duct incompletely regresses to form a blind pouch at the antimesenteric border of the gut.

The presence of ectopic tissue is associated with symptomatic Meckel's, in which the intestinal mucosa normally found on the ileum also is located in the walls of the Meckel's diverticulum along with gastric tissue or other cases by pancreatic tissue. Infrequently ectopic duodenal and colonic tissue can be present.

The diagnosis of Meckel's diverticulum-related diseases is often challenging, with imaging playing an important role in their prompt recognition and differentiation from other common conditions that can have a similar clinical presentation. 99mTc-pertechnetate is taken up by the mucin-producing cells of gastric mucosa and is secreted into the lumen of the gut.

Meckel scintigraphy is indicated to localize ectopic gastric mucosa as the unexplained GI bleeding. This procedure should be used in patients that are not actively bleeding. For active bleeding, a 99mTc-RBC scan is the preferred modality.
