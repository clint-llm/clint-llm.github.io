The current definition of hypertension (HTN) is systolic blood pressure (SBP) values of 130mmHg or more and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) more than 80 mmHg. Hypertension ranks among the most common chronic medical condition characterized by a persistent elevation in the arterial pressure.

Hypertension has been among the most studied topics of the previous century and has been one of the most significant comorbidities contributing to the development of stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and renal failure.

The definition and categories of hypertension have been evolving over years, but there is a consensus that persistent BP readings of 140/90mmHg or more should undergo treatment with the usual therapeutic target of 130/80mmHg or less.

This article will attempt to review the available knowledge derived from RCTs and the recent updates and guidelines on hypertension put forward by major societies including those from the 8th report of Joint National Committee (JNC-8), American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Society of Hypertension (ASH), European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Society of Hypertension (ESH).
