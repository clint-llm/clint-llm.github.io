The two principal reasons for artificial rupture of membranes are to induce or augment the labor process, or to assist in the placement of internal fetal monitoring devices to provide the direct assessment of fetal status. Monitoring of the fetal heart rate as well as uterine activity can be easily obtained via external monitoring systems. However, in certain circumstances, a more direct evaluation of the fetal heart rate or uterine activity is required during labor. The amniotic membrane presents a physical impediment to this form of monitoring, and to place a fetal scalp electrode or intrauterine pressure catheter, the membranes must necessarily be broken before placement.
