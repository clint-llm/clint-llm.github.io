Horner syndrome is primarily an acquired condition secondary to systemic/local diseases or iatrogenic causes but maybe congenital and purely hereditary in some rare cases.

First-order neurons are mostly affected by intracranial conditions and include the following:

- Cerebral vascular accidents (CVA)

- Multiple sclerosis

- Arnold-Chiari malformation

- Encephalitis

- Meningitis

- Lateral medullary syndrome

- Syringomyelia

- Intracranial tumors (pituitary or basal skull)

- Spinal trauma above the T2-T3 level

- Spinal cord tumors

Second-order neurons traverse the thoracic region and are affected by the following:

- Malignancies involving the apex of the lungs (Pancoast tumor)

- Cervical rib (tractional injury)

- Lesions of the subclavian artery (an aneurysm)

- Mediastinal lymphadenopathy

- Trauma to brachial plexus

- Neuroblastoma of the paravertebral sympathetic chain

- A dental abscess involving the mandibular region

- Iatrogenic (including thyroidectomy, radical neck dissection, tonsillectomy, coronary artery bypass grafting, or carotid angiography)

Third-order neurons are in close proximity to the internal carotid artery and cavernous sinus and are affected by the following:

- Carotid cavernous fistula

- Internal carotid artery dissection or an aneurysm

- Cluster headaches or migraines

- Raeder paratrigeminal syndrome (unilateral facial pain, headache, and Horner syndrome)

- Herpes zoster infection

- Temporal arteritis
