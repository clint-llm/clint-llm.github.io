During spinal cord development, the three layers called the marginal, mantel, and matrix layers can differentiate after the closure of the neural tube.

The marginal layer becomes the zone of peripheral white matter fibers.

The anterior mantle Layer, also called the basal plate, expresses The sonic hedgehog, which induces the development of the motor area anteriorly as the ventral gray horn. The alar plate expresses bone morphogenic proteins and Wnt factors, which will induce the development of the sensory area posteriorly as the dorsal gray horn.

The matrix layer, located around the central canal, is composed of neuroblasts that will migrate up to the mantle layer. This zone in between becomes the periventricular gray matter.

The spinal ganglia derive from the neural crest cells will form bipolar cells and will carry sensory input.
