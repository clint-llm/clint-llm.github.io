Cardiac risk stratification is a very useful assessment and very patient-specific regarding the decision to proceed to surgery.  It is an assessment requiring the entire healthcare team to provide the best care to our patients. Evidence-based guideline therapy is not all-inclusive; however, it has brought us closer to providing prediction and expectation in the perioperative setting.  As continued research is performed, advancements in testing, improved patient care, and cost-effectiveness will bring us closer to risk reduction and making the best decision in the perioperative setting.
