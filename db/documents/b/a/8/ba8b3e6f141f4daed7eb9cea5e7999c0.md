Rhinophyma is diagnosed clinically with erythema, telangiectasias, and skin thickening in the nasal region. The lower two-thirds of the nose is affected more than the upper third. There is no specific test for rhinophyma. Diagnostic confirmation is by histology.

Rosacea was divided into four stages by Wilkin in 1994: pre-rosacea, vascular rosacea, inflammatory rosacea, and late rosacea. Rhinophyma belongs to the "late rosacea" stage.

Further refinement of rosacea in 2002 by the National Rosacea Society (NRS) allowed standardization of rosacea.
