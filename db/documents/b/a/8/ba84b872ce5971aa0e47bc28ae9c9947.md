The first MTP is a ginglymi arthrodial joint, which functions as aÂ hinge and a sliding joint. The shallow articulation between the convex metatarsal head and the concave base of the proximal phalanx articular surface results in little bony stability. Therefore, it relies on the complex attachments of the capsule, ligaments, and musculotendinous structures surrounding the joint. The plantar plate is the strongest stabilizer of the first MTP joint and is composed of a thickening of the joint capsule. It attaches to the transverse head of the adductor hallucis, the flexor tendon sheath, and the deep, transverse intermetatarsal ligament. The classification system is composed of the degree of injury to the plantar plate:

- Grade I injury is a sprain of the plantar plate.

- Grade II is a partial tear of the plantar plate.

- Grade III is a complete tear of the plantar plate
