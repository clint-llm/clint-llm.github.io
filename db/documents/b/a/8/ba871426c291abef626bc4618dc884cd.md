Neuroplasticity, also known as neural plasticity or brain plasticity, is a process that involves adaptive structural and functional changes to the brain. It is defined as the ability of the nervous system to change its activity in response to intrinsic or extrinsic stimuli by reorganizing its structure, functions, or connections after injuries, such as a stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI). This activity describes neuroplasticity, the evaluation and management of neuroplasticity, and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the treatment considerations for patients with a stroke that utilize neuroplasticity.
- Describe the classic imaging findings associated with diaschisis.
- Identify the risk factors associated with poor synaptic plasticity.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with stroke as it relates to neuroplasticity.
