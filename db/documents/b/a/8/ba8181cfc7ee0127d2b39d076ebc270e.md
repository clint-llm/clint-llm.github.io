During the 1980s, researchers discovered that the endogenous opioid system, and met-enkephalin, in particular, has a role in regulating cell proliferation in both normal and neoplastic cell lines. Met-enkephalin, in this context, has the name OGF, and its target receptor is the OGF receptor (OGFr). Notably, OGFr is significantly different in its structure and molecular composition as compared to the classical mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors. The principal mechanism of action is through the upregulation of p16 and p21 cyclin-dependent kinases, which serve to stall the progression of the cell replication cycle from the G0/G1 phase to the S phase. The system is tonically active, and OGFr protein and gene expression are present in most proliferating cell lines.
