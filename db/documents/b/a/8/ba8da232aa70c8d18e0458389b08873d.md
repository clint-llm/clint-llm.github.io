**Lymphadenitis**

The majority of mycobacterial lymphadenitis cases will present in children under the age of five whose parents have noticed one or more soft but firm, unilateral, subcutaneous masses, usually in the submandibular or cervical chain regions. The masses are usually non-tender at the beginning of the disease, followed by the later development of fluctuance and even purulent discharge from fistulizing tracts. A diagnosis of mycobacterial lymphadenitis is frequently suspected after enlarged cervical nodes in children fail to respond to empiric antibiotic therapy directed at Staphylococcus and Streptococcus or fail to resolve under watchful-waiting for a presumed viral process.

**Skin and Soft Tissue Infections**

Mycobacterial skin and soft tissue infections can result from localized or disseminated infection and occur in patients of all ages. Patients with localized lesions may give a history in which they experienced trauma to their skin while swimming (freshwater, saltwater, swimming pool, hot tubs). Other risk factors for skin and soft tissue infections include patients who are currently immunosuppressed or have had recent surgical procedures. Skin lesions can range from erythematous papules/nodules that progressively ulcerate, to ecthyma, resembling cellulitis. A separate category of skin lesion, the Buruli ulcer, is characteristic of a painless area of soft tissue swelling that slowly begins to ulcerate with poorly defined and irregular borders. Untreated, they can grow from a few centimeters to span large areas of the body. Patients with these lesions are usually from West Africa, Central, and South America, Australia, and Japan.

**Pulmonary Infections**

Mycobacterial pulmonary infection typically presents in patients with impaired host defense of the lung. This includes patients with cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, HIV, and other immunodeficiency syndromes. In patients without known immunodeficiency syndromes, patients are more often male, middle-aged or older, and have a history of comorbid alcohol and/or tobacco abuse. These patients present with cough and worsening respiratory function in all cases but can also present with pneumonia, hemoptysis, persistent fever, and weight loss. These patients tend to have a much more rapidly progressing disease. Another subset of patients with a more slowly progressing disease and similar symptoms has been identified as women who have undergone menopause, have a lower BMI, scoliosis, or rib cage abnormalities.
