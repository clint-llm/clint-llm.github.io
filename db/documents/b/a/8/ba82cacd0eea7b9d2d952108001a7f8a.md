Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HPSCT), sometimes referred to as bone marrow transplant, involves administering healthy hematopoietic stem cells to patients with dysfunctional or depleted bone marrow. There are several types of HPSCT in clinical use, and transplanted cells may be obtained from several sources. This procedure has several benefits and may be used to treat malignant and non-malignant conditions. It helps to augment bone marrow function. In addition, depending on the disease being treated, it may allow for the destruction of malignant tumor cells. It can also generate functional cells that replace dysfunctional ones in cases like immune deficiency syndromes, hemoglobinopathies, and other diseases. Survival rates after HPSCT are increasing, but morbidity due to complications of the procedure continues. This activity reviews the indications for HPSCT, the different options by which to obtain donor cells, including the advantages and disadvantages of each, and the acute and chronic complications of the procedure. Additionally, it highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients who undergo HPSCT to improve patient outcomes and decrease procedure-associated morbidities.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the malignant and non-malignant indications for hematopoietic stem cell transplants. 
- Contrast the advantages and disadvantages of different types of hematopoietic stem cells.
- Outline the potential complications of hematopoietic stem cell transplants and apply strategies to ameliorate these risks.
- Describe the need for a well-integrated, interprofessional team approach to improve care for patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplants.
