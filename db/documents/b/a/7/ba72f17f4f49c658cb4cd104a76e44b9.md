The coronary sinus, if dilated, is seen on transthoracic echocardiography in parasternal long-axis view and apical 4-chamber view. It is even more reliably visualized on transesophageal echocardiography in a modified mid-esophageal 4-chamber view and the bi-caval view

On the other hand, asymptomatic chronic coronary sinus thrombosis in patients is detected incidentally on a CT scan or angiography or routine echocardiography done for other purposes. In acute severe cases where sudden cardiac death results it is found on autopsy if one is done promptly. In the majority of deaths due to acute coronary sinus thrombosis, the antemortem diagnosis was not made due to lack of clinical suspicion, until autopsy findings of thrombosed coronary sinus were discovered.
