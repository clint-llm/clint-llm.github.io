Unfortunately, despite the development of guidelines in the treatment of nasopharyngeal cancer, some patients appear to be overtreated with chemoradiation therapy, which also results in severe adverse effects and poor quality of life. Given this, an interprofessional approach to the cancer is recommended to ensure that all patients get the appropriate stage dependent treatment.

The treating team should consist of an oncologist, dentist, a dietitian, surgeon, radiation oncologist, otorhinolaryngology (ENT) surgeon, a pharmacist, and a chemotherapy nurse.

The oncology nurse and the pharmacist play a vital role in the education the patient about adverse effects of the drugs and how to relieve them. The nurse should emphasize the importance of a dental follow-up and consult with an endocrinologist for assessing thyroid function.

**Outcomes**

Chemoradiation has led to good outcomes, but the patients also develop a variety of adverse effects. While survival has increased, the overall quality of life remains poor. To improve the quality of life, it is important to closely follow up and refer patients early to the appropriate specialist.
