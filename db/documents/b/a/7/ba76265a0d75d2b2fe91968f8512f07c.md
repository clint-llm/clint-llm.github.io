The diagnosis and management of galactosemia are best done with an interprofessional team that includes a pediatrician, geneticist, dietitian, social worker, primary care provider, pediatric nurse, and internist. The key is to eliminate galactose from the diet. In infants, this means cessation of breastfeeding or standard infant formula feeding and transition to non-galactose-containing formula, typically a soy-based, casein hydrolysate, or elemental formula. This dietary restriction of galactose is required throughout the lifetime, although some fruits, vegetables, legumes, unfermented soy-based products, and mature cheeses with minimal galactose content may be permissible. Currently, there is no enzyme replacement or other therapy available to allow for the safe intake of galactose.

The outcomes depend on the dietary compliance of the child. Today, there is continued debate about screening all newborns for this disorder.
