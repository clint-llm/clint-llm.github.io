Eczema herpeticum is due to cutaneous superinfection with herpes simplex virus (HSV), usually HSV-1, in patients with atopic dermatitis. Cases due to reactivation of HSV are more common than primary infection.

Risk factors associated with the development of EH are more severe atopic skin disease, decreased epidermal expression of filaggrin, and decreased production of cathelicidin and other antimicrobial peptides.Staphylococcus aureus and molluscum contagiosum infections.
