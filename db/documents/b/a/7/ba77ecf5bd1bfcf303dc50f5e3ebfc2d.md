Impaired hearing contributes to cognitive dysfunction in older adults.

****Negative effects on mood, such as increased incidence of anxiety, depression, and lethargy, can be present.

Impaired high-frequency hearing can pose serious safety concerns, as it may be difficult for older adults to respond to warnings and signals, such as doorbells, ringing phones, smoke alarms, and turn signals. There is evidence for a relationship between hearing loss and postural control in older adults, which may be related to the perception of one's motion and position in space.
