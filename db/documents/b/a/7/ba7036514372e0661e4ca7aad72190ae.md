An abdominoperineal resection involves the left colon, pelvic floor, rectum, and anal canal. Appreciation of the key anatomical features in this operation is crucial to understanding the procedural steps and potential complications that can occur.

**Descending and Sigmoid Colon**

The left colon is comprised of the descending colon and the sigmoid colon. The descending colon is a retroperitoneal structure descending on the left side of the abdomen towards the pelvis, becoming the sigmoid colon in the left lower quadrant. The sigmoid colon is attached to the posterior abdominal wall via the mesosigmoid, a piece of mesentery allowing the sigmoid to move freely within the abdomen.

The inferior mesenteric artery arises from the aorta and gives off the left colic artery and sigmoid artery, which travel to the descending and sigmoid colon. Lymphatic drainage and nerves follow the vasculature, all situated within the associated mesentery.

**Rectum**

The rectum begins at S3 and lacks features such as haustra and taenia coli, making it distinct from the colon. The upper third of the rectum is covered in peritoneum on the anterior and lateral surfaces. The middle rectum only has an anterior covering, with the lower third devoid of the peritoneum. Anterior to the rectum lies the seminal vesicles, prostate, and bladder in men and the vagina in women.

There are three separate blood supplies to the rectum, the superior, middle, and inferior rectal arteries, arising from the inferior mesenteric, internal iliac, and internal pudendal artery, respectively.

**Pelvic Floor**

The pelvic floor is a cavity located beneath the pelvic brim, where structures including the bladder, rectum, and genital organs are found and supported by muscular walls attaching to the pelvis walls. A key component of the pelvic floor is the levator ani muscles, including puborectalis, pubococcygeus, and iliococcygeus.

**Anal Canal**

The anal canal is the final 4 cm of the gastrointestinal tract from the rectum to the anus. The internal anal sphincter surrounds the upper two-thirds and the external sphincter around the lower third. A fundamental structure for surgeons is the anorectal ring, where the anal sphincters and puborectalis muscle merge to mark the demarcation between the rectum and anal canal. It is formed by joining the puborectalis muscle, deep external sphincter, conjoined longitudinal muscle, and the highest part of the internal sphincter. Clinically, this point can be felt during a digital rectal examination and be used to assess low-lying rectal lesions.

The anal canal is divided according to the embryological origin and is separated by the dentate (pectinate) line, an irregular circle formed by anal valves. This line divides the anal canal into upper and lower parts, which differ in structure and neurovascular supply. The tissue above the dentate line is derived from the hindgut and receives its blood supply from the superior rectal artery branching off the inferior mesenteric artery. Below the dentate line, the structures originate from the ectoderm and are supplied by the inferior rectal artery, a branch of the pudendal artery.
