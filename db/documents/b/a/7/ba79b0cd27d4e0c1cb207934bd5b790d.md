Doxycycline hyclate is a highly tolerated drug compared to its tetracycline counterparts and has limited evidence for causing serious adverse effects. The following are some of the rarely observed adverse events:

**Severe Adverse Effects**

- Bloody diarrhea

- Leukopenia

- Migraines

- Hemolytic anemia

- Throat irritation or trouble swallowing

- Chest pain

- Exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus

- Shortness of breath

- Irregular or fast heart rate

- Dysuria

- Intracranial hypertension

- Esophagitis/esophageal ulcerations if taken without water

Researchers described a Type I anaphylactic reaction with hypotension, bronchospasms, and urticaria in a patient who received intravenous doxycycline with a beta-blocker during general anesthesia.

In rare cases, Doxycycline hyclate has also reportedly caused Steven-Johnson Syndrome, potentially life-threatening mucocutaneous eruptions with a diffuse distribution of purpuric macules or targetoid lesions. Treatment usually entails hospitalization and supportive care for symptoms, with the administration of hydroxyzine hydrochloride, mupirocin ointment, and prednisone.

Administration of doxycycline with warfarin has resulted in an enhanced anticoagulant effect due to the competitive interaction for albumin binding and potential inhibition of the cytochrome P-450 pathway.
