The scalene muscles (anterior, middle, and posterior scalenes) play a role in neck posturing and movement as well as breathing due to pulling on the ribs. The middle and posterior scalene muscles receive their blood supply from the ACA and the superficial branch of the TCA.

The trapezius receives its blood supply from the TCA. The trapezius controls scapular motion (elevation, depression, retraction). A useful mnemonic is to remember that the TRAnsverse cervical artery supplies the TRApezius muscles.

The four rotator cuff muscles are the supraspinatus, the infraspinatus, the teres minor, and the subscapularis (rotator cuff acronym: SITS). They control the movement of the shoulder. The main blood supply of the rotator cuff muscles stems from the SSA and the subscapular artery. The SSA is a branch of the thyrocervical trunk and the subscapular artery branches from the axillary artery.
