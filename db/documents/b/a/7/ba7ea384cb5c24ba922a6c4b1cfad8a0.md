Detrusor sphincter dyssynergia is believed to occur due to neurological lesions of the suprasacral spinal cord. The lesions might be due to spinal cord injury (traumatic), myelodysplasia, multiple sclerosis, congenital anomalies like neural tube defects, spina bifida, and spinal dysraphism, stroke, infections of the spinal cord, and transverse myelitis. Of these, spinal cord injuries, spina bifida, and multiple sclerosis are most commonly associated with DSD.

DSD is categorized into 3 types. Type 1 describes the condition where, initially, there is a simultaneous detrusor contraction and sphincter tightening. As the detrusor contraction peaks, the sphincter relaxes suddenly, resulting in urination. In type 2 DSD, the external urethral sphincter contracts sporadically across the entire detrusor contraction. Type 3 DSD is characterized by a crescendo-decrescendo pattern of sphincter contraction that results in obstruction of the urethra throughout the entire detrusor contraction.

This classification has been simplified by Weld et al. (2000) into two types: continuous or intermittent DSD.
