Administration of a supraphysiological dose of synthetic ACTH or cosyntropin stimulates the pituitary and thereby a release of cortisol from the adrenal cortex, as long as the adrenal cortex has a functional reserve. CST involves checking cortisol levels at baseline, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes after IV or IM administration of 250 mcg cosyntropin.

A negative (normal) result occurs if the cortisol level is stimulated to greater than 500 to 600 nmol/L.

AI can be diagnosed if cortisol is unequivocally low, but intermediate or higher levels need further evaluation by CST.Â There is no universally agreed-upon definition or criteria for the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency (AI) in critically ill patients.
