Once JLNS is suspected in a child with congenital deafness and syncopal episodes, the next step is to evaluate the QTc interval to check if it is longer than 500 msec. Identifying the pathogenic variants in either the KCNQ1 or KCNE1 confirms the diagnosis. Testing for the genes can either be done as a single-gene test, a multigene panel, or comprehensive genomic testing.

Once the diagnosis is established, the extent of the disease should be assessed. Evaluation should include a formal audiology evaluation, geneticist consultation, complete blood count to look for anemia, thorough family history.
