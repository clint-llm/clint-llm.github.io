In 95% of cases, SMA results from a homozygous deletion of SMN1 on chromosome 5q13; however, this does not explain how there can be significant clinical heterogeneity in phenotype.

SMN2 is identical to SMN1 except for a single C-T substitution in exon 7. This substitution promotes splicing 80 to 85% of the time during transcription and resultant removal of exon 7.

There is not a perfect correlation as there are anomalies in phenotypic variation in SMN2, leading to varying amounts of functional SMN protein production in different individuals. Therefore a low number of SMN2 copies with a milder clinical phenotype have been described.
