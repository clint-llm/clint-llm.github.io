Anemia may not instantly be evident on laboratory testing in acute blood loss from trauma, since the fluid shifts have less time to normalize the circulating volume and dilute the number of remaining RBCs.

Significant hemodilution due to large volume fluid resuscitation and phlebotomy hemolysis are a few other reasons that lead to a falsely low red cell count.

- Iron deficiency anemia: At earlier stages, it can appear as normocytic normochromic anemia.

- Other causes of microcytic anemia: Thalassemia, sideroblastic anemia, and lead poisoning

- Macrocytic anemia with B12/folate deficiency

- Liver disease: Usually macrocytic anemia

- Acute blood loss anemia, esp. upper or lower gastrointestinal bleed
