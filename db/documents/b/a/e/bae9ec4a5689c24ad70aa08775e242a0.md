In the past, the term cholangiocarcinoma was used to reference intrahepatic bile duct cancer. However, usage of the term has evolved and it is now used to reference intrahepatic, perihilar, and extrahepatic tumors of the bile tract such as hepatobiliary tract cancer. The gallbladder and ampulla of Vater are considered structures of the biliary tract system hence malignancies of those parts are usually included in research and publications involving cholangiocarcinoma. Cholangiocarcinoma remains a rare and highly lethal malignancy due to the characteristically locally advanced, unresectable stage upon diagnosis. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and prognosis of hepatobiliary tract cancer and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the population most at risk for developing hepatobiliary tract cancer.
- Explain exam findings that should prompt consideration of hepatobiliary tract cancer.
- Review the evaluation of hepatobiliary tract cancer.
- Demonstrate interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination to enhance outcomes for patients affected by hepatobiliary tract cancer.
