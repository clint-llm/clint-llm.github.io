Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the knee is a somewhat rare cause of knee dysfunction and pain that has been recognized for over one hundred years, but the etiology is still poorly understood. The highest incidence is in patients between the ages of 10 and 20 years, and males have a much higher incidence of osteochondritis dissecans than females. The most common location for osteochondritis dissecans lesions of the knee is the distal femur, specifically in the lateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients who present with osteochondritis dessecans of the knee and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for those with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of osteochondritis dessecans of the knee.
- Summarize the diagnostic procedure for suspected osteochondritis dessecans of the knee, including any necessary diagnostic imaging.
- Outline the various treatment options for osteochondritis dessecans of the knee.
- Explain possible interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and treatment of osteochondritis dessecans of the knee and improve outcomes.
