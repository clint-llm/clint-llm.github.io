Robert et al. reported that in 36% of cases, the supratrochlear nerve originated from the frontal nerve at the distal half of the orbit, while in 64% of cases, the supratrochlear nerve origin was from the frontal nerve at the proximal half the orbit.

The supratrochlear artery branches from the ophthalmic artery in 85 to 90% cases, while in 10 to 15% of cases, the supratrochlear artery and the supraorbital artery emerge as a single branch from the ophthalmic artery and then divide into supratrochlear and supraorbital arteries.
