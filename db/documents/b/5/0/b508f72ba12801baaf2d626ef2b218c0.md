Tolcapone is a catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor. Levodopa, a common medication used for Parkinson disease, is normally metabolized by decarboxylase in the periphery to dopamine. Therefore, levodopa is typically administered with a decarboxylase inhibitor like carbidopa to increase the amount of levodopa that reaches the brain and to decrease adverse effects caused by dopamine when produced in the periphery. However, when decarboxylase becomes inhibited by carbidopa, levodopa is metabolized by COMT in the periphery. Therefore, by inhibiting COMT, tolcapone further decreases the degradation of levodopa in the periphery, which allows more levodopa to reach the brain and potentially allows for a decrease in the dosage of levodopa.
