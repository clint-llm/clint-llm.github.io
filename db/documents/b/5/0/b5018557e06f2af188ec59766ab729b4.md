Prevention is the best intervention to decrease the prevalence of obesity. The pediatrician should explore the risk of obesity and overweight during every clinical visit for all children.

- Both bottle-fed and breastfed infants are at risk of overfeeding. However, overfeeding is more prevalent among bottle-fed infants. Exclusive breastfeeding and delayed initiation of solid foods may reduce the future risk of overweight.

- Skim milk is a safe replacement for whole milk after two years of age. Parents or caretakers should never use food like sweets for a reward. The entire family should have a balanced diet that comprises less than 30 percent of calories from fat. AAP recommends consuming a variety of vegetables and fruits, whole grains, proteins, low-fat dairies and decreasing the intake of sodium, saturated fats, and refined sugars beginning at the age of two years.

- An essential step in preventing obesity is reducing sedentary time. Limit the screen time, including television, video games, or mobile, not more than 2 hours per day for more than six-year-old children and not more than 1 hour per day for 2-6 years of age group. AAP strongly recommends not allowing kids less than two years to have screen time.

- Encourage physical activity for children. Children aged 3 to 5 years should be active throughout the day. Children and adolescents ages 6 to 17 years should be physically active for at least 60 minutes every day.

- As per CDC, 60% of middle school kids and 70% of high school kids do not meet the standard sleep recommendations. AAP recommends that children aged 1 to 2 years sleep 11 to 14 hours per day, children 3 to 5 years sleep 10 to 13 hours, children 6 to 12 years sleep 9 to 12 hours, and adolescents aged 13 to 18 years should regularly sleep 8 to 10 hours.

The pediatrician should explore for associated morbidity in all obese children. The detailed assessment in obese children should include assessing cardiac comorbidities, orthopedic complications, and psycho-social complications.

- Reasonable weight-loss goals should be initially 5 to 10 pounds (2 kg to 4.5 kg) or a rate of 1 to 4 pounds (0.5 to 2 kg) per month.

- **Dietary management:**Dieticians provide dietary prescriptions mentioning the total calories per day and recommended percentage of calories from carbohydrates, protein, and fat. The Traffic Light Plan is one method of providing dietary management. The Traffic Light Plan classifies foods as green (low energy density), yellow (moderate energy density), and red (high energy density). These categories help children in adopting healthier eating patterns.[41] The dietician plays a significant role in guiding the diet plan for the patients.

- **Physical activity:**As per the fitness level, begin the physical activity with the goal of 30 minutes/day in addition to any school activity. Treatment should target gradually increasing the activity to 60 minutes per day. An exercise physiologist, along with the physician, can help the patients to achieve their target physical activity.

- **Behavior modification:**Primary care-based behavioral interventions such as self-monitoring, nutritional education, improvement of eating habits, increasing physical activity, attitude change, and rewards help manage childhood obesity.

- **Family involvement:**Review overall family activity and television viewing patterns and always involve parents in nutrition counseling. Family-based behavioral treatment is the most robust intervention for childhood obesity.

- **Psychotherapy:**Behavioral therapy and Cognitive therapy are commonly used by the psychologist in the management of obesity. Behavioral therapy trains patients to act differently around food, and cognitive therapy trains patients how to change their thoughts and emotions related to food.

- None of the anorexiant medications are FDA approved for use in childhood obesity. Orlistat is the only FDA-approved medication for use in adolescents.

- Surgical procedures like gastric bypass have not been studied sufficiently in children to advise their use.

An interprofessional team that provides a holistic and integrated approach can help achieve the best possible outcomes. Collaboration, shared decision making, and communication are key elements for a good outcome. Multidisciplinary teams include a primary physician, a dietician, a nurse or nurse practitioner, a clinical exercise physiologist, and a psychologist. The interprofessional team can provide a comprehensive weight loss program that benefits the patients.
