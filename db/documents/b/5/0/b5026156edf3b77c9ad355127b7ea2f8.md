Prognosis is poor in most cases despite aggressive therapy. Prognosis can be enhanced comparatively by early diagnosis and prompt treatment. The mortality rate depends upon the severity and expansion of the disease. Mortality in rhinocerebral form is high around 30% to 70%, in disseminated form is up to 90%, and with AIDS has up to 100%. It is demonstrated that the survival rate of a combination of surgical debridement and antifungal therapy is greater (70%) than the surgery (57%) and chemotherapy alone (61%).

One study concluded that survival of patients is 85% when managed within 5 days of diagnosis as compared to 49% when treatment initiated after the 6th day of diagnosis.
