The thin walls present within bursae allow for them to become easily inflamed when they become irritated. This may be produced by acute direct trauma or, more commonly, as repetitive trauma from kneeling. Much less frequently, prepatellar bursitis may be caused by gout, rheumatoid arthritis, or infections. Conditions causing immunosuppression lead to an increased risk for developing bursitis, such as diabetes mellitus, chronic steroid use, and hemodialysis. Chronic bursitis may also develop from repetitive trauma, although it occurs less frequently in the prepatellar when compared to olecranon bursa.
