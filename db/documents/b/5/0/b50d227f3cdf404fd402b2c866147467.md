The presenting patient is commonly a thin, tall male that appears to be slouching, and thoracic scoliosis may also be appreciated.  Sternal depression and rotation may depress the heart, causing a slew of cardiopulmonary signs and symptoms, including exercise intolerance. An audible murmur can be attributed to a defective mitral valve (i.e., prolapse, regurgitation).  Exercise intolerance, though its exact cause is unclear, is one of the most common presenting complaints. Additionally, the psychological impact on patients can be significant, especially during the adolescent period.
