Complications of the extended SMAS facelift are similar to other rhytidectomies. These include hematomas, seromas, edema, great auricular nerve damage, facial nerve branch damage, transient neurapraxia, unfavorable scars, altered hairlines, pixie ear deformity or deformity of the tragus, wound infections, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Hematomas are among the most feared complications of facelifting due to the risk of subsequent flap necrosis, and sometimes even airway compromise. The most common adverse event after extended SMAS rhytidectomy is patient dissatisfaction.
