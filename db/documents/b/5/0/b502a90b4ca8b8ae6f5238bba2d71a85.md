Dexmedetomidine is an alpha agonist having sedative, anxiolytic, hypnotic, analgesic, and sympatholytic properties. It produces these effects by inhibiting central sympathetic outflow by blocking the alpha receptors in the brainstem, thereby inhibiting the release of norepinephrine. It has a selectivity of 1600 to 1 for the alpha2 receptor as compared to alpha1. This selectivity is especially significant compared to another alpha agonist, clonidine, with a selectivity of 220 to 1.Â The mechanism by which dexmedetomidine may increase the duration of a peripheral nerve block is not fully understood but is believed to most likely be a perineural mechanism rather than a systemic or central mechanism, which appears to prolong the duration by blocking the cation current.
