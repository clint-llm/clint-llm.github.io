Bypass surgery with a greater saphenous vein graft, or another alternative autologous venous graft, is a well-established treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in the lower limbs.

The long-term patency and success of vein grafts in bypass surgery remain challenging due to their accelerated atherosclerotic rates compared to their arterial counterparts.

To improve the primary or secondary patency, endovascular therapy of the vein graft itself may be attempted first.
