Education and reassurance about the symptoms and the underlying etiology should be provided to patients. This includes avoiding triggers such as hot baths or exposure to excessive heat. Education aboutÂ what new and old symptoms can be related to a demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis can empower patients to report them to the physician for further workup, including the presence of possible new lesions or exacerbation. This could alert physicians of loss of effectiveness of the patient's current treatment and progression.
