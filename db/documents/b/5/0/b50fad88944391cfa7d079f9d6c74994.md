The differential diagnosis includes:

- Thrombocytopenic purpura

- Benign pigmented purpura

- Schamberg disease

- This is an idiopathic phenomenon, which results from erythrocyte extravasation into the dermis in the lower extremities due to capillary fragility or leaky blood vessels, venous stasis or exercise.Â  Hyperpigmentation in the lower extremities is frequently present.

Skin biopsy can easily differentiate benign pigmented purpura from leukocytoclastic vasculitis given the lack of features of vasculitis such as fibrinoid necrosis and vessel wall disruption by the inflammatory infiltrates.
