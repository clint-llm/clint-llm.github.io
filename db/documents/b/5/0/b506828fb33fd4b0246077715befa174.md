Sweet syndrome can present typically and atypically, and the diagnosis can be challenging. A biopsy shall always is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. It is important to be mindful of the association with hematologic malignancy. Patients with an underlying myelodysplastic syndrome may have the classical cutaneous lesions of Sweet syndrome but with lymphocytic, infiltrate, and atypical mononuclear infiltrate rather than neutrophils.

In some patients with classical Sweet syndrome, the signs and symptoms of Sweet syndrome may spontaneously resolve without any form of medical intervention. However, the lesions often persist for many weeks or months in others. Successful management of any malignancy will result in clearing the related dermatosis in patients with malignancy-associated Sweet syndrome. Similarly, spontaneous improvement and subsequent resolution of the syndrome typically follows discontinuation of the associated medication in patients with drug-induced Sweet syndrome.
