It is important to differentiate VF from pulseless electrical activity (PEA)/asystole as both these conditions are managed differently as per ACLS protocol. Other causes of sudden collapse such as aortic dissection and pulmonary embolismÂ should be considered. The following conditions can be easily confused with VF on an ECG and should be ruled out.

- Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia

- Torsade de pointes

- Ventricular flutter

- Pulseless electrical activity

- Accelerated idioventricular rhythm

- SVT with aberrancy
