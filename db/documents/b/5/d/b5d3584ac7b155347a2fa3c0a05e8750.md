Lymphedema is a chronic disease marked by the increased collection of lymphatic fluid in the body, causing swelling, which can lead to skin and tissue changes. The chronic, progressive accumulation of protein-rich fluid within the interstitium and the fibro-adipose tissue exceeds the capacity of the lymphatic system to transport the fluid. Swelling associated with lymphedema can occur anywhere in the body, including the arms, legs, genitals, face, neck, chest wall, and oral cavity. There are many psychological, physical, and social sequelae related to a diagnosis of lymphedema. This activity reviews the presentation of lymphedema and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of lymphedema.
- Review the presentation of lymphedema.
- Summarize the treatment options for lymphedema.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by lymphedema.
