Women should begin an exercise program to improve their pregnancy outcome and the health of the infant. Weight loss may occur due to a patient who previously had a sedentary lifestyle but has now developed an active one, but it is not the goal during pregnancy. It is a possible side effect. Proper exercise during pregnancy will help with weight loss after delivery.
