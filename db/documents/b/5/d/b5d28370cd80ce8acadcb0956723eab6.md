The aorta is the central source of oxygenated blood from which all the arteries of the body arise before traveling distally to their destination tissues. The aorta gives rise to major arterial branches such as the left and right coronary arteries, brachiocephalic artery, left common carotid artery, left subclavian artery, celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery, left and right renal arteries, gonadal arteries, inferior mesenteric artery, median sacral artery, and the left and right common iliac arteries.

The abdominal aorta enters the abdomen posterior to the median arcuate ligament and lies anterior and slightly to the left of the anterior aspect of the lumbar vertebrae, with the inferior vena cava lying to its right.

Structures crossing the abdominal aorta:

- Between the origins of coeliac and superior mesenteric arteries - splenic vein and body of pancreas

- Between the origins of superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric arteries - left renal vein, the uncinate process of the pancreas and 3 part of the duodenum

The branches of the abdominal aorta:

- Paired branches: the middle adrenal, renal, gonadal, inferior phrenic, and lumbar arteries

- Unpaired branches: the coeliac, superior mesenteric, inferior mesenteric, and median sacral arteries

- Terminal branches: the common iliac arteries
