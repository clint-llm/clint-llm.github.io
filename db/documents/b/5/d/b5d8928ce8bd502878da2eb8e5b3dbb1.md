The PTT test uses decalcified blood to prevent clotting in the tube before the test begins. In the lab, plasma is separated from cellular components by centrifuge. Calcium and activating substances are then added to the plasma to begin the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade. The activating substances are kaolin, which activates the contact-dependent Factor XII (hydrated aluminum silicate), and cephalin, which substitutes for platelet phospholipids. PTT is the number of seconds needed to form a clot. Although time can vary due to laboratory specifics, the standard for a sample clot is 35 seconds.
