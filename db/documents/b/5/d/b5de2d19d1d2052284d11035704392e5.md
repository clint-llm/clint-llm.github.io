Afatinib is a targeted therapy that irreversibly inhibits the ErbB family of tyrosine kinases.

There are three known tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKIs) widely used as a treatment for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with proven efficacy: gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib.

Aredo J. et al. found that afatinib had limited activity in non-small cell lung cancer patients previously treated with osimertinib who developed resistance to it because of an acquired EGFR mutation.

Li. T. examined afatinib activity on uncommon EGFR mutations, e.g., Gly719Xaa, Ser768Ile, and Leu861Gln. Forty-two patients with uncommon EGFR mutation received treatment with afatinib for advanced lung adenocarcinoma. The investigators found that afatinib was effective in treatment.

Xu H. et al. found that afatinib and anlotinib effectively treat lung adenocarcinoma in patients with the rare mutation p.Asp769Tyr.

Saran F. et al. conducted a clinical trial in patients with glioblastoma multiforme to determine the maximum tolerated dose of afatinib in combination with radiotherapy and with or without temozolomide. The maximum tolerated dose of afatinib was 30 mg daily with radiotherapy and temozolomide and 40 mg of afatinib daily with radiotherapy.

Afatinib is being examined for treating HER2-positive gastric cancer.
