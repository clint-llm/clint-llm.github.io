**Laboratory Workup**

The laboratory test can provide a supportive data to evaluate the underlying medical conditions that can be associated with insomnia. The initial laboratory workup should include thyroid function tests, glycosylated hemoglobin, complete blood count, serum iron studies, liver function tests, and renal function tests.

**Questionnaires**

Self-evaluating questionnaires and assessment scales are helpful to document sleep disturbances and the quality of sleep. The most widely used ones are Epworth Sleepiness Scale (from 0 to 24 with a score of more than 15 indicating severe daytime sleepiness) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (poor sleep score of greater than 5).

**Sleep Logs/Diary**

Sleep logs/diaries are reliable and cost-effective ways to assess the sleep-wake cycle in an individual. Sleep logs are maintained for 2 to 4 weeks and also include documentation of alcohol and caffeine consumption, bedtime activities, and daytime napping. Sleep logs are used to determine the total sleep time (TST), wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO), sleep efficiency (SE), and circadian rhythm disturbances. The only major limitation associated with the sleep log is the reliability and validity of its documentation.

**Actigraphy**

Wrist actigraph is a noninvasive device used to record the gross motor activity during the daytime and sleep. The various sleep parameters assessed by actigraphy are total sleep duration, wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO), sleep latency and daytime naps. One of the limitations associated with this device is that it cannot access the periodic limb movements (PLM) or abnormal breathing pattern in insomnia in which case polysomnography is indicated to assess the other sleep disorders associated with insomnia.

**Polysomnography**

Polysomnography is the preferred method in the diagnosis of a variety of sleep disorders including sleep apnea, sleep-related hypoventilation, and parasomnias. However, it is not indicated in the initial assessment of primary insomnia
