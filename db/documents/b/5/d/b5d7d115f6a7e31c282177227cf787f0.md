The prognosis of a patient with lymphocytosis depends on the underlying etiology. Examples of specific disease prognosis are as follows:

- Acute IM: Most patients recover from the acute episode of mononucleosis, although some continue to have fatigue for a prolonged period.

- Other infections: Pertussis in adults may cause prolonged symptoms (greater than two weeks).

- CLL: CLL prognosis is highly dependant on risk stratification and whether a patient presents with high-risk features or not. These latter include a high-risk karyotype (del 17p and del 11q), unmutated IGHV status, high ZAP-70, CD38, and Beta-2 microglobulin levels.[21][22]

- NHL: The prognosis depends on the type of histology. Histologies like FL, MZL, and HL are incurable but have a prolonged indolent course. On the other hand, DLBCL and T-cell lymphomas are aggressive but responsive to therapy.

- DRESS: mortality rates from DRESS are reported to be around 5Â to 10%.
