**Hemophilia:**

While mild hemophilia may only present after a traumatic injury or surgery, those with a moderate to severe form of the disease may exhibit hallmark characteristics such as mucosal or gingival bleeding, easy bruising, and hematoma formation.  The concern is when there is bleeding into joints, particularly in the ankles, knees, and elbows, referred to as hemarthrosis.  Hemarthrosis can initiate an inflammatory process to occur in which the joints become painfully swollen and eventually limit motion.

**Von Willebrand Disease**

Von Willebrand disease can exhibit clinical signs and symptoms starting in childhood with a history of easy bruising and bleeding.  While patients with a very mild version of the disease may not have clinical symptoms at all, patients with vWF that is qualitative or quantitatively low may present with a predisposition to mucosal bleeding and episodic epistaxis.  Women with von Willebrand disease may have significant menorrhagia which is often a presenting sign of the illness, precipitating a workup and eventual diagnosis.
