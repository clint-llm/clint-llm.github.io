Its accompanying vein performs the venous drainage of the anterior humeral circumflex artery. The anterior circumflex humeral vein that drains into the axillary vein the majority (90%) of cases (10% of upper limbs drain into the cephalic vein).

Most of the upper limb lymph nodes are located in the axilla. Based on their location, they divide into five main groups: apical, central, humeral, subscapular, and pectoral. Which sum up to about 20 to 30 nodes total. Out of these five groups, those classified as humeral are the ones most relevant to the anterior humeral circumflex artery and nearby structures. The lymphatics of the shoulder and axilla are drained by the subclavian lymphatic trunk, which continues to enter the right venous angle on the right side and is drained by the thoracic duct on the left side.
