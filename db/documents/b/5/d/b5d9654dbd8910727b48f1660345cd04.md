Patients who develop CTK may initially present with DLK and associated inflammation after having undergone excimer laser ablation. Thus, patients may complain of nonspecific findings such as pain, photophobia, halos, floaters, a foreign body sensation, and/or blurry vision, which is common to this pathology. However, DLK is not necessary for diagnosis.

On the slit lamp exam, the prominent finding in CTK is a non-inflammatory central or pericentral amorphous corneal opacity involving the stroma. This condition leads to a decreased visual acuity in the affected eye(s), generally within nine days of surgery. The cloudiness (distinct from the hazy cornea that is occasionally associated with PRK surgery) reportedly persists for 2 to 18 months before resolving spontaneously. Though most opacities largely clear within a year, residual stromal thinning and decreases in uncorrected visual acuity may remain.

A complete ocular exam with OCT in cases of CTK may also show an inverse dome-shaped appearance of the opacity with backscattering within the central cornea and increased homogenous internal reflectivity that extends from the anterior to the posterior stroma.
