Hospital-acquired infections (healthcare-associated infections) are nosocomially acquired infections that are not present or incubating at the time of admission to a hospital. These infections include catheter-associated urinary tract infections, central line-associated bloodstream infections, surgical site infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, and Clostridium difficile infections. Symptoms that favor an infection include productive cough, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, rebound tenderness, altered mental status, palpitations, suprapubic pain, polyuria, dysuria, and costovertebral angle tenderness. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of hospital-acquired infections and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of hospital-acquired infections.
- Review the laboratory tests used in the evaluation of hospital-acquired infections.
- Summarize the management of hospital-acquired infections.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to prevent transmission of infections and enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by hospital-acquired infections.
