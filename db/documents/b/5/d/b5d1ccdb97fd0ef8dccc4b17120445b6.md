Patients need to understand the movement or activity that precipitated the condition and rest from it for a specified period. They must also be counseled to comply with medication and therapy.

Even as the condition improves, patients should be sure to warm-up before beginning exercise. They should avoid performing repetitive movements at work and not remain sedentary; get up and regularly move throughout the day. Building muscle tone and increasing overall physical fitness may also help prevent tendinosis.
