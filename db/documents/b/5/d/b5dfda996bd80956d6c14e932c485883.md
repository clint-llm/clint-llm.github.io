The quantum of data available on halitosis is fairly insufficient as there are no distinct criteria to define a bad odor and its extent for an individual. Hence, a lack of social and ethnic standardization of malodor is the main hindrance for carrying out scientific studies. Willing enrollment in clinical trials would again be questionable because of the sensitive nature of the affliction socially.

Exact documentation of prevalence rates is difficult owing to the nonspecificity in defining a halitosis patient. Certain studies have shown the prevalence of halitosis up to 50%. Differences in prevalence values, however, would vary nationwide or community-wide due to differences in the method of the study.

Certain studies have shown a prevalence of 6 to 23% in China, 50% in the United States, and 21.7% and 35.3% for male and female Indian dental students, respectively.
