The second most common upper extremity entrapment neuropathy is ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE). At the elbow, the ulnar nerve lacks protective cover in the ulnar groove. This causes its susceptibility to external compression. Repetitive elbow flexion and extension, arthritic changes, and valgus deformities at the elbow increase its vulnerability to injury. In some individuals, the ulnar nerve may be subluxed out of the retroepicondylar groove medially over the medial epicondyle during elbow flexion. In a study investigating patients with UNE, the pressures recorded between the ulnar nerve and overlying arcade increased up to above 200 mm Hg in elbow flexion or during isometric contraction of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle. In contrast, the pressure was less than 19 at elbow extension.

Repetitive movement that exerts pressure on the ulnar wrist and hypothenar eminence predisposes the ulnar nerve to develop neuropathy. Wrist fractures and compressive mass lesions may also cause ulnar neuropathy at the wrist (UNW).
