The levator palpebrae muscle derives from the mesenchyme of the second pharyngeal arch. It begins formation during the sixth week of gestation and develops from lateral and medial mesodermal extensions of the frontal nasal process. Initially, the levator palpebrae muscles begin development as a part of the superior mesodermal complex with the superior rectus muscle and the superior oblique muscles. During the eighth week of gestation, the superior mesodermal complex and lower mesodermal complex fuse, followed by the differentiation of the upper and lower lid structures, including the levator palpebrae muscles.
