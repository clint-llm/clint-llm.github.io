Loss of bombesin receptors correlates with age-dependent obesity, hypertension, glucose intolerance, and high insulin levels. This expanded adipose deposition may, in part, be due to a decline in energy consumption without a shift in eating or movement, which infers that bombesin receptors may signify a plausible target upon which notable advancement can take place in the realm of anti-obesity agents.

Bombesin has the theoretical capability to address prostate cancer screening. Current screening methods include prostate-specific antigen serum testing, followed by a digital rectal examination. Those screening techniques do not yield information on the primary location of the carcinoma cells. Therefore, possible metastases cannot be determined or diagnosed with high accuracy. The fact that radiolabeling cannot differentiate between benign hyperplastic prostate cells and malignant carcinoma cells limits their diagnostic value. BBR and gastrin-releasing peptide receptors are over-expressed in solid malignancies and particularly in prostate cancer.

Precision medicine is also known as theranostics, is a medical model that separates people into different groups with medical care tailored to the individual patient based on their predicted response or risk of disease.

Measuring bombesin stimulated gastrin response can serve as a marker for patients who are at very high risk for gastric cancer. Patients with late-onset hypogammaglobulinemia are at very high risk for gastric cancer. Late-onset hypogammaglobulinemia patients have reduced secretion of gastrin after stimulation with bombesin. Stimulated gastrin response can, therefore, be useful as a marker for this type of immunodeficiency. Plasma gastrin responses to stimulation with bombesin correlate with late-onset hypogammaglobulinemia. (72% sensitivity , 100% specificity). Bombesin can help to distinguish late-onset hypogammaglobulinemia from X-linked agammaglobulinemia, early-onset hypogammaglobulinemia, and lymphoproliferative cancer.

AÂ bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide antagonist might hold promise as a possible new agent for the treatment of breast cancer.
