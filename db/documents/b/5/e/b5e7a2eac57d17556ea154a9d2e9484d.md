The cause of various vasculitis is unknown — there is a recognition in the literature of several risk factors that increase the incidence and prevalence of vasculitis, including geography, age, ethnicity, gender, genetic, and environmental factors. Behcet disease is more common among inhabitants of countries that border the ancient Silk Route.

Takayasu disease is more common in females (9 to 1 ratio) than males, while Behcet disease tends towards higher severity in men, with a higher frequency of advanced ocular disease. GCA and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) occur predominantly in the White population.

Studies have found the association of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B51 with Behcet disease, increasing the risk of disease susceptibility and disease severity.

Several medications and certain infections have well-known associations with systemic vasculitis, e.g., hepatitis B with polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), hepatitis C with mixed cryoglobulinemia, silica dust with pauci-immune vasculitis.
