When communicating with patients with Wernicke's aphasia, it is important to eliminate background noise and distractions, maintain eye contact, and keep voice at a normal volume and rate. Ideally, sentences should be short, and one should avoid asking questions that require a lengthy explanation. Yes or no questions are often preferable. Patients may prefer to write their answers, so it is advisable to keep a notepad and pen available.
