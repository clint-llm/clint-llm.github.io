A patient with decreased vision due to cataracts presents to an ophthalmologist. If the patient requires cataract surgery, then the calculation of IOL power is a necessary procedure. The optometrist and the ophthalmologist should know all the generations of  IOL power formulae. They should know their indications and where to use them. The know-how of the A-scan, keratometer, and optical biometer is a must. The nursing staff, optometrist, and ophthalmologist should be conversant with the upkeep and usage of these instruments. Thus interdepartmental communication will ensure better patient management.

The primary physicians can follow up with the postoperative patients. The nursing will be the first medical staff to contact the follow-up patients. They can assess the postoperative refractive error and report any issues to the primary care clinician or the ophthalmologist. This collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to care can ensure better patient outcomes.
