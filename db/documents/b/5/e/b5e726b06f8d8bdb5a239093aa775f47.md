While itraconazole is a relatively safe medication, there are some adverse side effects with itraconazole use. Cardiotoxicity is a rare adverse effect. Itraconazole can decrease heart contractility and left ventricular ejection fraction.

Another adverse effect is hepatotoxicity, which is often a reversible increase in aminotransferase levels. This side effect is minimizable with intermittent or short-term dosing. In patients already being treated for hypertension, itraconazole can cause resistant hypertension.

The most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal disturbances, such as nausea, mild diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Researchers noted these side effects in 2 to 39% of patients that have used itraconazole.
