Abnormalities within the arterial wall, obstruction in the vessel lumen or arteriovenous malformations may predispose to an imbalance in the cerebral hemodynamic leading to an acute onset of neurologic symptoms.

**Intracranial Aneurysms**

An aneurysm is a focal ballooning of the arterial vessel due to weakness within its wall. Rupture of an intracranial aneurysm is responsible for approximately 80% of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Although all arterial vessels can be affected, the anterior circulation is the most involved.  Hemodynamic stress at the arterial bifurcation is the main determinant in the aneurysm formation.

**Arteriovenous Malformations (AVM)**

AVM is a congenital malformation characterized by an abnormal collection of blood vessels in which the arterial blow flow directly into veins without the normal capillary bed. There is an increased risk of rupture of the nidus leading to intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

**Stroke**

Stroke is an occlusive cerebrovascular disease due to a distal thrombus or migrated emboli. The inadequate brain perfusion leads to focal areas of brain infarction. Thrombolytic therapy in the early hours of the stroke onset can restore the brain perfusion.
