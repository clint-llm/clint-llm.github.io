Patients with symptoms consistent with encephalitis are initially evaluated with neuroimaging and lumbar puncture. MRI or CT scans are usually normal. A lumbar puncture may be significant for elevated opening pressure, normal or slightly decreased glucose, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lymphocytic pleocytosis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell counts rarely exceed 500 cells/mm3, and CSF protein is elevated in half to two-thirds of cases. Blood work may reveal leukocytosis but is often unremarkable. These findings are common in many forms of encephalitis or viral meningitis. In patients who develop neurologic disease about 30% will also develop hyponatremia and fluid overload due to inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).

Electroencephalography (EEG) may show diffuse slowing and delta-wave activity with isolated spikes. EEG abnormalities have not been shown to correlate well with clinical findings.

The diagnosis of Saint Louis encephalitis is usually made by detecting the presence of IgM antibodies to the virus in serum using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. The ELISA test may also be performed on CSF. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of CSF is often performed to exclude enterovirus or herpes virus infection, as the presentations are similar. Virus culture from infected patients is usually unsuccessful.
