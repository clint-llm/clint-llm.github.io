If there is clinical suspicion of a pheochromocytoma, then the initial assessment starts with biochemical laboratory testing.

The discussion above indicates that the best initial screening test is the plasma-free metanephrine biochemical test.

Once metanephrine levels are 4-fold high from the normal reference value, then the next goal is to localize the hormone-secreting tumor. The problem arises when the metanephrine levels are minimally elevated or equivocal.

Computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used for localizing the tumor. In certain conditions like pregnancy, contrast allergy, and the pediatric population, MRI should be done instead of a CT scan. These imaging modalities are sensitive but not specific. A 123I-labeled metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy is very specific for catecholamine-secreting tumors. It not only helpful in differentiating between adrenal and paraganglionic tumors but also helps in revealing multiple lesions and metastases.

Positron emission tomography (PET) scan is superior to MIBG, especially in the evaluation of metastatic disease.
