The post-operative care of a dislocated elbow is similar to that of any upper extremity procedure.Â  Opiate pain medicine is usually necessary for a short period, generally prescribed by the orthopedic surgeon. Patients are typically discharged in a splint that should be worn for several weeks before the resumption of prescribed range of motion exercises. Physical therapy after this time may speed recovery and allow for a full or almost full range of motion of the joint. Typical postoperative instructions may also include monitoring for signs of infection.
