Patients should be counseled on and offered ECV when appropriate. Some data show that only 20% to 30% of eligible candidates are offered ECV.

Women who have a successful ECV have a lower cesarean delivery rate than women who do not, although they are still at a higher risk of cesarean delivery than women with cephalic presenting fetuses and no ECV. ECV is cost effective if the probability of a successful ECV is greater than 32%.
