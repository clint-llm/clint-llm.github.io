To this date, the exact mechanism of the collapse of immune tolerance in AIE largely remains unknown. Cases with AIE often have an infection as a preceding event, causing inflammation leading to neurological symptoms. There have been case reports and observational studies to suggest that herpes simplex virus encephalitis (HSVE) triggers immune response causing Anti- NMDAR encephalitis.

Table-1 shows the commonly reported antibodies that have been described in the literature so far.

NMDAR - N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, LG1- anti-leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 encephalitis, CASPR2 - contactin associated protein-like 2 receptors, GABA- gamma aminobutyric acid; AMPA- alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid; DPPX- dipeptidyl-peptidase-like protein-6, CLL - chronic lymphocytic leukemia; MOG- Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein.
