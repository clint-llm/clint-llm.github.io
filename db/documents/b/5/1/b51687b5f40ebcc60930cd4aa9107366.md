While the emergency department clinician and traumatologists are almost always involved in the care of patients with a thoracolumbar spine fracture, it is essential to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that include neurosurgeons, orthopedic spine surgeons, physiatrist, and other associated healthcare professionals. It is critical to have a high degree of suspicion when evaluating the patient. The nurses are also a vital member of the interprofessional group. They will monitor the patient, educate the patient and family, and help with the mobilization and avoidance of pressure ulcers. Neuroradiologists will determine the amount of bone and ligamentous injury. Pharmacists are essential to administer pre and postoperative medications for pain control and wound infection prophylaxis.

When the patient is to be discharged home, consultation should be made with a social worker, community nurses, occupational therapy, and physical therapy. One major complication associated with high morbidity and mortality is deep vein thrombosis. If the patient has paraplegia, prophylactic anticoagulation should be administered. Physical therapists will help with early ambulation in those with incomplete deficits. The earlier signs and symptoms of a complication are identified, the better the prognosis and outcome after appropriate management. Interprofessional communication is essential to provide the patient with an integrated care pathway combined with an evidence-based approach to evaluation and management for a good outcome.
