The differential diagnosis of primary HypoKPP includes:

- Hyperkalemic or normokalemic periodic paralysis

- Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis

- Andersen-Tawil syndrome

- Secondary hypokalemia

- Myasthenia gravis

- Paramyotonia congenita

These conditions are associated with either recurrent episodes of hypokalemia, episodic attacks of muscle weakness, and weakness or stiffness associated with exercise. Thus they should be in the mind of the treating physician as they can mimic hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Nevertheless, they can be differentiated based on their clinical features and laboratory tests findings as they differ in several ways.

**1. Normokalemic and Hyperkalemic Periodic Paralysis**

They differ from the HypoKPP in following several ways:

- Normal or elevated serum potassium levels during attacks

- Absence of some precipitating factors for HypoKPP, e.g., carbohydrate-rich meals

- Younger age of onset of attacks with high penetrance

- EMG shows myotonic discharges between attacks, but the EMG findings in a short exercise test and long exercise test are difficult to distinguish from that in HypoKPP

- The response to oral potassium might differ from that to HypoKPP, it can ameliorate or can even worsen the symptoms

Generally, the distinction between HypoKPP and normo/hyperkalemic periodic paralysis can be made by potassium level during attacks, EMG, and genetic testing.

**2. Andersen-Tawil Syndrome (ATS)**

It is caused by the mutation in the KCNJ2 gene, which codes for inward rectifier potassium (Kir2.1) channel.

It is potentially a fatal condition, so careful attention to the identification and treatment of disease is needed. Treatment is needed for episodes of muscle paralysis and cardiac manifestations. Treatment of acute attack of muscle paralysis depends on the level of potassium and thus is individualized. ECG monitoring is needed to look for any arrhythmia. Patients are treated empirically with antiarrhythmics to prevent the occurrence of arrhythmias. Flecainide had been reported to have benefits in preventing arrhythmia in ATS patients.

**3. Thyrotoxic Periodic Paralysis**

Except for certain clinical features and the hyperthyroidism features, the pattern of muscle weakness is identical to that of familial HypoKPP.

**4. Paramyotonia Congenita**

It is a congenital disorder of muscle weakness and myotonia, induced by cold and aggravated with continued activity. The patients develop prolonged myotonia or weakness in a localized group of muscles, which is not associated with the change in serum potassium level. It mainly affects eyelids, neck, and upper limb muscles. Patients characteristically present in their childhood complaining of inability to open their eyes following rapid, forceful successive closures. Weakness and myotonia last for minutes to hours. Even after the immediate rewarding of the muscles, cold-induced weakness usually persists for several hours. The disease is non-progressive, does not cause muscle wasting or hypertrophy. It is caused by mutations in the sodium channel gene SCN4A that codes for the alpha-subunit of the skeletal muscle sodium channels, i.e., voltage sensor domain.

**5. Secondary Hypokalemia**

The most common manifestation of hypokalemia is muscle weakness. The episodes of muscle weakness can occur in chronic hypokalemia secondary to renal, gastrointestinal, endocrine, and iatrogenic causes. Following conditions can cause chronic hypokalemia:

- Diuretics use

- Type IV renal tubular acidosis

- Hyperaldosteronism

- Hyperglucocorticoidism

- Gitelman syndrome

- Bartter syndrome

- Liddle syndrome

A low potassium level between attacks is a clue to secondary hypokalemia. The patient should be carefully examined to look for the systemic manifestation of the disorders, and a careful interpretation of the patient's blood pressure finding, urine potassium, and blood bicarbonate level should be performed to rule out the possibility of any secondary cause of hypokalemia.

**6. Metabolic Myopathies**

Patients usually complain of fatigue, exercise intolerance, myalgia rather than muscle weakness. Rhabdomyolysis is common and may result from strenuous exercise, stress, illness, cold exposure. Muscle biopsy is required for the diagnosis of the disorder.

**7. Myasthenia Gravis**

Weakness is not episodic as in periodic paralysis, rather it is predictable and precipitated by exertion. Extraocular and bulbar muscle involvement is common in myasthenia gravis, which is uncommon in HypoKPP. During the myasthenic crisis, respiratory muscle involvement is common. Patients also complain of fatigue. This usually manifests early in second and third decades with female predominance or later in life in sixth to eighth decades with male dominance.

The first episode of quadriparesis can always be confused with the paralytic attacks of Guillain Barré syndrome (GBS), acute myelopathy, myasthenia crisis, tick paralysis, and botulism. But the presence of low potassium level and absence of other specific clinical features like ocular and bulbar involvement, sensory abnormalities, dysautonomia, history of travel and insect bite, fever, history of recent illness can rule out the other causes of paralysis and narrow the diagnosis to HypoKPP.
