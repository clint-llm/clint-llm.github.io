In the neck region, there is a group of muscles located inferior to the hyoid bone called the infrahyoid muscles. This group of muscles contains the omohyoid muscle, the sternohyoid muscle, the sternothyroid muscle, and the thyrohyoid muscle. Due to the origins and attachments of the infrahyoid muscles, they function to depress the hyoid bone when they contract. This group of muscles also contribute to the protection of the trachea, esophagus, blood vessels, and thyroid gland.

As for the sternohyoid muscle, it is a flat muscle located on both sides of the neck. This muscle originated from the medial edge of the clavicle bone, sternoclavicular ligament, and posterior side of the manubrium. The sternohyoid muscle then ascends the neck and attaches to the body of the hyoid bone. The sternohyoid muscle also has a continuation muscle that attaches the thyroid to the hyoid bone via the thyrohyoid muscle. The primary function of the sternohyoid muscle is to work in sync with the other infrahyoid muscles to depress the hyoid bone. The hyoid bone is depressed during jaw opening for speak, mastication, and swallowing. The sternohyoid muscle also participates as a minor contributor to head motions.
