Most pulmonary embolisms originate as lower extremity DVTs. Hence, risk factors for pulmonary embolism (PE) are the same as risk factors for DVT. Virchow's triad of hypercoagulability, venous stasis, and endothelial injury provides an understanding of these risk factors.

Risk factors can be classified as genetic and acquired. Genetic risk factors include thrombophilia such as factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin gene mutation, protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, hyperhomocysteinemia, among others. Acquired risk factors include immobilization for prolonged periods (bed rest greater than three days, anyone traveling greater than 4 hours, whether by air, car, bus, or train), recent orthopedic surgery, malignancy, indwelling venous catheter, obesity, pregnancy, cigarette smoking, oral contraceptive pill use, etc.

Other predisposing factors for VTE include:

- Fracture of lower limb

- Hospitalization for heart failure or atrial fibrillation/flutter within the previous three months

- Hip or knee replacement

- Major trauma

- History of previous venous thromboembolism

- Central venous lines

- Chemotherapy

- Congestive heart failure or respiratory failure

- Hormone replacement therapy

- Oral contraceptive therapy

- Postpartum period

- Infection (specifically pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and HIV)

- Cancer (highest risk in metastatic disease)

- Thrombophilia

- Bed rest greater than three days

- Obesity

- Pregnancy

Cancer carries a high risk for thrombus formation and hence, PE. Pancreatic cancer, hematological malignancies, lung cancer, gastric cancer, and brain cancer carry the highest risk for VTE.

**Types of Pulmonary Embolism**

It is extremely crucial to divide PE based on the presence or absence of hemodynamic stability.

Hemodynamically unstable PE (previously called massive or high-risk****PE) is PE which results in hypotension (as defined by systolic blood pressure (SBP) less than 90 mmHg or a drop in SBP of 40 mm Hg or more from baseline or hypotension that requires vasopressors or inotropes), the old term "massive" PE does not describe the size of the PE but describes its hemodynamic effect. Patients with hemodynamically unstable PE are more likely to die from obstructive shock (i.e., severe right ventricular failure).

Hemodynamically stable PE is a spectrum ranging from small, mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic PE (low-risk PE or small PE) to PEs, which cause mild hypotension that stabilizes in response to fluid therapy, or those who present with right ventricle dysfunction (submassive or intermediate-risk PE), but is hemodynamically stable.
