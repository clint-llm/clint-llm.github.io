Animal and human studies of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)have implicated abnormalities in vessel wall thickness, lack of tight junctions and endothelial continuity, and splitting of the elastic lamina.

Cerebral AVMs are seen both in sporadic cases as well as in genetic syndromes. ConcerningÂ genetic associations, studies on syndromic cases have yielded valuable insight. For example, Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, the most common syndrome linked with cerebral arteriovenous malformations, has correlated with the insufficiency of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling genes such as SMAD4 and ENG.

Several studies have examined the role of overexpression of genes involving vasculogenesis such as VEGF, angiopoietin-2, Notch4, and MMP-9 in the development and a predisposition to rupture of cerebral AVMs.
