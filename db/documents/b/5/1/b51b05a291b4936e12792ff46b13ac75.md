The management of ALHE requires the efforts of an interprofessional team of physicians, pharmacists, and nurses. In most of the cases, patients present with unique or multiple cutaneous papules and/or nodules. Therefore primary care providers and nurse practitioners generally address them to a dermatologist. In many other cases, ALHE can present in any site of the body and present with several symptoms. Thus, different specialists such as ophthalmologists, cardiologists, gastroenterologists, neurologists, and otorhinolaryngologists can be involved in making the diagnosis and organizing a treatment plan. The role of the radiologist can also be vital in some cases where the lesions are not accessible, especially in ALHE with arterial involvement.  A biopsy is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and requires a trained pathologist. Many patients with disfiguring lesions develop depression and anxiety. Psychological counseling is useful for these individuals.
