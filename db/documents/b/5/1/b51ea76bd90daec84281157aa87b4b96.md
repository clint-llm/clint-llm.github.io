Many patients require hospitalization for supportive care, including respiratory support. Long-term neurological sequelae are common in individuals diagnosed with arthropod-borne encephalitis. For example, previous studies of patients hospitalized with WNV encephalitis have demonstrated neurocognitive deficits and self-reported symptoms ranging from fatigue to neurological symptoms lasting from months to years after the onset of illness.
