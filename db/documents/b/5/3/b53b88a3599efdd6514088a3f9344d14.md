An interprofessional approach to PJS is recommended. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is a hereditary cancer syndrome characterized by GI polyposis, mucocutaneous pigmented macules, and cancer predisposition. Patients with PJS are at an increased risk for developing GI cancers of the colorectal, pancreatic, and gastric organs, besides a wide variety of non-gastrointestinal epithelial malignancies such as breast, uterine and cervical cancer, lung, and tumors of the ovaries and testicles. An interprofessional team consisting of a geneticist, gastroenterologist, general surgeon, dermatologist, urologist, and gynecologist is recommended to decrease the morbidity and mortality of this syndrome. The primary care provider and nurse practitioner should refer these patients to the appropriate specialist as soon as the diagnosis is made. A consult should take place with a board-certified oncology pharmacist regarding the patient's medication regimen for both cancer and non-cancer meds, and an oncology specialty nurse can assist in the monitoring, answer patient questions, and report any changes in status to the managing clinician immediately. The outlook for most patients is guarded. For those who remain cancer-free, the long-term outlook is good, but once malignancies develop, the lifespan is shorter.
