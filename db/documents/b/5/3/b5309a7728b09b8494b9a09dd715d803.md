Bullous myringitis (BM) is a relatively common infectious condition characterized by bullae or vesicles on the tympanic membrane (TM), without affecting the contents of the external or middle ear.

The current thinking is that bullous myringitis is caused predominantly by viruses, although one study insinuated mycoplasma pneumoniae, which was not substantiated by subsequent studies.
