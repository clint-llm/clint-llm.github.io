In cases of chlordiazepoxide overdose or toxicity, the patient may present with confusion, diminished reflexes, comatose, or somnolent. Interventions include securing the airway and providing adequate intravenous fluid resuscitation. Patient respiration, blood pressure, and pulse must have regular monitoring. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist used for a partial or complete reversal of the sedative property of benzodiazepines, is an option for treatment. Flumazenil works by competitive inhibition of the alpha-beta subunit GABA binding site to insert its effect. After the administration of flumazenil, clinicians should monitor the patient for the risk of seizure associated with this medication, especially in patients with chronic benzodiazepine use.
