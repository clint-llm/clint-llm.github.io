Bacteremia, in the strictest sense, refers to viable bacteria in the blood. Asymptomatic bacteremia can occur in normal daily activities such as conducting oral hygiene and after minor medical procedures. In a healthy person, these clinically benign infections are transient and cause no further sequelae. However, when immune response mechanisms fail or become overwhelmed, bacteremia becomes a bloodstream infection that can evolve into many clinical spectrums and is differentiated as septicemia. This activity describes the causes and presentation of bacteremia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of bacteremia.
- Outline the workup of a patient with bacteremia.
- Review the treatment and management options available for bacteremia.
- Explain the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding the management of patients with bacteremia.
