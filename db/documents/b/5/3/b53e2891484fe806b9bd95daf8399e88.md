PS has a characteristic autosomal dominant inheritance with complete penetrance with variable expressivity in terms of syndactyly.

PS type I is associated with mutations in FGFR1 and FGFR2. PS type II and type III are associated with mutations in FGFR2. PS is most commonly caused by mutations in the FGFR2 gene (on chromosome 10q26.13). Mutations in the FGFR1 gene (on chromosome 8p11.23) cause a small percentage of cases of type I PS only and usually are not associated with other types of PS. The FGFR1 and FGFR2 genes are responsible for the production of fibroblast growth factor receptors 1 and 2, respectively. These receptors are mainly involved in the transformation of pluripotent stem cells to osteoblasts during embryonic development. Mutations in these genes can lead to prolonged protein signaling, which leads to premature fusion of cranial bones and maldevelopment of extremity bones. Four major FGFR2 mutations p.W290C, p.Y340C, p.C342R, and p.S351C are responsible for severe forms of PS; whereas, FGFR1 p.P252R mutation usually gives rise to a relatively mild phenotype.FGFR1 locus.

One major risk factor for the development of PS is advanced paternal age. The risk of an offspring getting affected with PS from an affected parent is 50% for each pregnancy. Both males and females have equal risks of affliction.
