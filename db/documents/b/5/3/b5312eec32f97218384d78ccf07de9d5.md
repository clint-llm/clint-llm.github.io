**How to bridge**

Our bridging recommendations follow the AT9 guidelines, which agree with the American Society of Regional Anesthesia (ASRA) 2018 guidelines and are similar to the American College of Surgeons 2018 guidelines.

During the preoperative period:

- Discontinue warfarin five days before surgery.

- Three days before surgery, start subcutaneous LMWH or unfractionated heparin (UFH), depending on the renal function of the patient at therapeutic doses.

- Two days before surgery assess INR, if greater than 1.5 vitamin K can be administered at a dose of 1 to 2 mg.

- Discontinue LMWH 24 hours before surgery or 4 to 6 hours before surgery if UFH.

During the postoperative period:

- If the patient is tolerating oral intake, and there are no unexpected surgical issues that would increase bleeding risk, restart warfarin 12 to 24 hours after surgery.

- If the patient received preoperative bridging therapy (high thromboembolic risk) and underwent a minor surgical procedure, resume LMWH or UFH 24 hours after surgery. If the patient underwent a major surgical procedure, resume LMWH or UFH 48 to 72 hours after surgery.

- Always assess the bleeding risk and adequacy of homeostasis before the resumption of LMWH or UFH

**How to Manage Patients on DOAC Anticoagulation Therapy Undergoing Elective S****urgery**

It is important to note that bridging therapy is not indicated in patients on DOACs. The predictable pharmacological effect of DOACs allows a properly timed interruption of anticoagulation therapy before surgery. Various societies have issued recommendations about the timing of DOAC interruption. Our recommendations are based on the American College of Cardiology Expert Consensus (2017), European Heart and Rhythm Association (2018), American Society of Regional Anesthesia (ASRA) (2018).

The appropriate timing interruption for patients on DOAC anticoagulation is based on the invasiveness and bleeding risk of the procedure, pharmacokinetic profile of the DOAC, and clinical characteristics of the patient (renal function and liver function, see Table.4). As a common recommendation among guidelines, DOACs should be held 3 half-life times before low-risk procedures and 5 half-life times before high-risk procedures. Nevertheless, there are some procedures considered less than low bleeding risk, such as a colonoscopy without biopsy, where DOAC therapy may be continued.(see table.4)

Betrixaban is a new inhibitor of factor Xa. Though many aspects of the clinical use of this drug are still under study, ASRA (2018) recommends betrixaban interruption at least 72 hours before a neuraxial block. ASRA also recommends at least 5 hours between catheter removal and reinitiation of the drug.

In 2019, a new strategy was published in the PAUSE study, a prospective clinical trial evaluating a standardized approach for perioperative management of DOACs. The interruption scheme used in this study was simple. For high bleeding risk procedures, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran were suspended 48 hours before surgery in patients with CrCl>50 ml/min. If the renal function was compromised (CrCl< 50 ml/min), these drugs were interrupted for four days before surgery. For low bleeding risk procedures, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran were interrupted 24 hours before surgery in patients with CrCl>50 ml/min. If the renal function was compromised (CrCl <50 ml/min), drugs were suspended two days before the procedure. Regardless of renal function, all drugs were reinitiated at 48 hours for high bleeding risk surgical procedures and 24 hours for low bleeding risk procedures. The 30-day postoperative rate of major bleeding was 1.35% (95% CI, 0%-2.00%) and rate of arterial thromboembolism of 0.16% (95% CI, 0%-0.48%). However, more studies are needed in patients with high surgical bleeding risk.

**How to Manage Antithrombotic Therapy in Patients Undergoing Elective Surgery**

Ideally, patients with recent coronary stent implantation should postpone elective surgery during critical periods post-placement (6 weeks for bare metal stents and 6 months for drug-eluting stents). If elective surgery cannot be postponed, dual antithrombotic therapy should be continued throughout the perioperative period. In patients at high risk of cardiac events, aspirin should be continued throughout the perioperative period, with clopidogrel and prasugrel discontinued 5 days prior to surgery and resumed 24 hours postoperatively. For patients at low risk of cardiac events, dual antiplatelet therapy can be discontinued 7 to 10 days before surgery and restarted 24 hours postoperatively.

**Considerations for Patients Undergoing Neuraxial Anesthesia**

The following recommendations for neuraxial puncture and catheter removal are based on the European Society of Anesthesiology and ASRA. Included in these recommendations are the timelines for interrupting and resuming anticoagulation after the puncture, catheter manipulation, or removal.

For patients treated with intravenous UFH, the infusion should be interrupted 4-6 hours before puncture or catheter removal/manipulation. However, if the patient is receiving UFH subcutaneously, the drug should be interrupted 8-12 hours before puncture or catheter removal/manipulation. Independent of the route of UFH administration, the drug can be restarted 1 hour after puncture or catheter removal/manipulation.

For patients receiving a prophylactic dose of LMWH, the drug should be interrupted for 12 hours before puncture or catheter removal/manipulation and 24 hours if the dose is therapeutic. Independent of LMWH dose, the drug may be restarted 4 hours after puncture or catheter removal/manipulation. If the patient is receiving fondaparinux at a prophylactic dose (2.5 mg/day), it should be stopped 36-42 hours before any neuraxial approach and might be resumed 6 to 12 hours post-procedure.

For patients receiving DOACs, the time of interruption will vary according to the specific drug. Patients on rivaroxaban at a prophylactic dose (less than 10 mg/day) should have the drug interrupted 22 to 26 hours before a neuraxial approach. If the patient is on apixaban at a prophylactic dose, it should be discontinued 26 to 30 hours before a neuraxial puncture or catheter placement. Both of these drugs may be restarted 4 to 6 hours after the puncture or catheter removal/manipulation. If the patient is on coumarin anticoagulation, the INR should be less than 1.4 before any neuraxial approach.

Drugs such as NSAIDs, including aspirin, do not require interruption for neuraxial anesthetic interventions. However, others such as cilostazol will require 42 hours of an interruption prior to neuraxial anesthesia and can be resumed 5 hours after the puncture or catheter removal.

**How to Perform Emergency Reversal of Anticoagulation**

Definitions of emergency and urgent surgery can vary slightly between guidelines. An urgent procedure is defined as one that can be delayed up to 24 hours, giving time to the physician to conduct anticoagulation reversal based on repeated coagulation tests. On the other hand, the emergent scenario can be defined as one in which the patient requires surgical intervention in less than 1 hour or is experiencing life-threatening bleeding. In emergent cases, the amount of time, number of coagulation tests that can be performed, and opportunities to delay the procedure until the bleeding risk is lower are limited.

Reversal of warfarin: For non-significant bleeding with alterations of the INR, conservative strategies such as interruption of the drug and oral vitamin K are suitable options. In the emergent scenario, the reversal of warfarin anticoagulation is based on prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) administration as follows:

- INR 2-4: PCC 25 IU/kg IV

- INR ≥4-6: PCC 35 IU/kg IV

- INR >6: PCC 50 IU/kg IV

- Vitamin K: 10 mg IV administered slowly

- FFP: 10 to 20 ml/kg

- Trauma patients: 1 gm of tranexamic acid can be used at arrival and repeat dose of 1 gm in 8 hours

- PCC is commercially available as prothrombin complex concentrate both contain heparin and are thus contraindicated in patients with a past medical history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

The required time for anticoagulant reversal and INR correction with vitamin K and PCC are 6 to 24 hours and 15 minutes after 10-minute to 1-hour infusion, respectively. FFP should be administered if there is ongoing bleeding or PCC is not available. The timing of anticoagulation reversal depends on the timing to complete infusion. Complete reversal usually takes up to 32 hours. PCC must be administered with vitamin k.

Reversal of DOACs: The FDA recently approved andexanet alfa for the reversal of the anticoagulative effects of apixaban and rivaroxaban.
