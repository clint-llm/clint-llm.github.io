The electrical activity in the brain consists of postsynaptic potentials generated by cortical regions. Postsynaptic potentials can be either excitatory or inhibitory. The summation of potentials is mainly generated by pyramidal cells and recorded relative to the potentials between two brain locations plotted over time. Rhythmic bursting on the EEG is generated in the nucleus reticularis of the thalamus with extensive projections through the thalamocortical tracts.
