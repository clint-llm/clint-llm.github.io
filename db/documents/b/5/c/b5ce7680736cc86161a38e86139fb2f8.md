Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), a heterogeneous group of chronic arthritis, is the most common chronic rheumatological condition in children. There are seven different JIA subtypes with distinct phenotypes, genetic predispositions, pathophysiology, laboratory findings, disease course, and prognosis. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of JIA and reviews the role of the healthcare team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the classic presentation and typical physical exam findings associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
- Explain the imaging findings associated with JIA and the most common tests for the evaluation of juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
- Outline the imaging findings associated with JIA and the most common tests for the evaluation of juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
- Review the importance of collaboration amongst the interdisciplinary team to improve outcomes for patients affected by juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
