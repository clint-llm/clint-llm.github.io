**Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy**

Mechanism: Subaortic outflow tract obstruction from abnormal hypertrophy of the septal region of the heart, leading to precipitation of ventricular arrhythmias.

Risk Factor: Autosomal dominant mutation in the gene coding for cardiac sarcomere(Beta myosin heavy chain). Suspect this in a patient with a family history of sudden cardiac death in 2 first-degree relatives.

Symptoms: Syncope with exertion, palpitation, develops early heart failure symptoms.

Treatment: Beta-blockers are the mainstay of therapy. Surgery is indicated for patients with obstructive physiology with an outflow gradient greater than 50 mmHg. The defibrillator is indicated for patients who are symptomatic post maximal medical therapy, abnormal systolic blood pressure response to exercise, septal thickness > 30 mm, runs of ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation on telemetry or during the stress test.

Indications for ICD placements to prevent sudden cardiac death with arrhythmia:

- CHF with EF < 35% after three months of maximal medical therapy.

- Myocardial infarction (MI) with EF < 40% with inducible VT or VF in electrophysiological studies.

- MI with EF < 30%

- Patients with long QT if QTc > 500 and an episode of unexplained syncope or Holter showing NSVTs
