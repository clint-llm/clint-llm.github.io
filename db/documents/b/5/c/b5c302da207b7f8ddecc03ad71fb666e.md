Patients with impaired renal function, alcohol use disorder, malabsorption, and geriatric patients are more at risk of developing Vitamin B6 deficiency. They should be encouraged to take vitamins appropriate for their age and condition. Young patients undergoing bariatric surgery are at risk of developing B6 deficiency and should be educated about their conditions and risk of future complications.

In the United States and other developed countries, the risk of developing Vitamin B6 is unlikely unless they have chronic conditions. Meanwhile, in less developed countries, patients should be screened for Vitamin B6 deficiency if they present with dermatologic signs or polyneuropathy.

Especially patients on Isoniazid (INH) therapy should be educated about the medications' side effects and the importance of B6 supplementation. Such patients should be screened for deficiency if they present with symptoms, mainly after six months of therapy.
