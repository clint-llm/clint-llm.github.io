Deterrence of coronoid fractures is difficult given their traumatic nature.

The patient should always have a thorough comprehension through education on the common complications of this injury. Instability and arthritis are possible with and without surgical intervention. As many coronoid process fractures require surgical treatment, the risk and benefit of such procedures should always be discussed at length to provide patient autonomy and the ability to make wise decisions. There should also be a discussion regarding expectations and limitations after surgery.
