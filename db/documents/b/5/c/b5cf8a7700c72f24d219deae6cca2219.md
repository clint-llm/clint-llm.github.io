All bleeding disorders, including factor deficiencies and platelet dysfunction syndromes, can mimic FXIII deficiency.

- Conditions that can be distinguished based on an abnormal coagulation profile (prolonged PT or aPTT)

- Hemophilia A and B- must be ruled out in any patient presenting with recurrent and delayed joint bleeds. 
- Type III von Willebrand disease- The bleeding is severe due to severe factor VIII deficiency 
- All other factor deficiencies that are rarely seen in clinical practice

- Platelet disorders with severe bleeding phenotype - Can be distinguished using platelet aggregation studies, platelet morphology, and platelet number. All these tests are normal in patients with FXIII deficiency. 

- Glanzman thrombasthenia
- Bernard Soulier syndrome
- von Willebrand disease (type 1 and 2)

- Rare coagulation defects which present with deranged coagulation profile

- Alpha-2 plasmin inhibitor deficiency
- Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 deficiency
- Inherited afibrinogenemia and dysfibrinogenemia

Acquired factor XIII deficiency is also in the differential diagnosis of FXIII deficiency. The etiology behind acquired FXIII deficiency is discussed above.
