- The nucleocapsid protein (NP)

- the phosphoprotein (P)

- the fusion glycoprotein (F)

- the matrix protein (M)

- The hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) glycoprotein

- The RNA polymerase (L)

HPIVs share similarities in their structural and biological characteristics, but each of them infects people at different ages and causes different symptoms and illnesses.
