Out of the four suprahyoid muscles, mylohyoid and anterior belly of digastric are derived from the mesoderm of the first pharyngeal (branchial) arch and hence supplied by the nerve of the first arch, i.e., the mandibular nerve (the third division of cranial nerve V - the trigeminal nerve). The posterior belly of the digastric muscle and the stylohyoid are developed from the mesoderm of the second pharyngeal arch and hence supplied by the nerve of the second arch, i.e., the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII).

The geniohyoid muscle derives from occipital somitic sources compared to other muscles.

The suprahyoid muscles appear towards the eighth week of gestation.
