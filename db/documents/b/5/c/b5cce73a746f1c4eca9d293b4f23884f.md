The most common cause of facet joint disease is degeneration of the spine, also known as spondylosis. When the degeneration of the joint is secondary to natural wearing and abnormal body mechanics the condition is known as osteoarthritis (OA). The pathophysiology of OA is not entirely understood but is a complex one involving various cytokines and proteolytic enzymes as well as personal risk factors. Other causes of facet joint disease include trauma secondary to injury or sporting activities. Inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis may also contribute due to the inflammation of the synovium. Subluxation of the facet joints due to spondylolisthesis can also contribute to the development of facet joint disease. Those with facet joint disease show signs of cartilage erosion and inflammation, which can lead to pain. The body will also undergo several physical changes in response to this process. Ligaments, such as the ligamentum flavum, can become thickened and hypertrophic. New bone formation around the joint can occur with the development of osteophytes or “bone spurs.” There can also be an increase in the subchondral bone volume with hypomineralization.
