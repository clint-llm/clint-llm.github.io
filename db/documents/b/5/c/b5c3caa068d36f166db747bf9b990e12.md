The substitution of lysine for glutamic acid in the sixth position of the beta-globin chain induces an electrostatic interaction between positively chargedÂ beta-6-lysyl groups and negatively charged adjacent molecules, leading to the decreased solubility of HbC in red cells. Due to this, crystal formation occurs, leading to increased blood viscosity and decreased red blood cell life span. But, unlike sickle cell disease, which is caused due to the substitution of valine for glutamic acid, Hb C does not cause intracellular polymerization during low oxygen tension. Thus, in general, the vaso-occlusive crisis is not seen with hemoglobin C disease unless it is combined with sickle cell (Hb SC).

Several heterozygous combinations of hemoglobin C with other hemoglobin variants are seen. One case study reported a young woman with compound heterozygosity for Hb-D-Ibadan and HbC, a rare Hb combination that was previously not identified. This combination was detected during prenatal screening, and HbD-Ibadan was present in excess amount than HbC in the combination (70.3% to 24.4%). The combination is clinically silent and demonstrates thalassemia-minor-like red cell indices.

Hemoglobin C-Harlem is another rare condition that has the same electrophoretic mobility as that of HbC on alkaline electrophoresis. But this molecule, similar to HbSS, can polymerize when deoxygenated and hence has a clinical course similar to sickle cell disease.
