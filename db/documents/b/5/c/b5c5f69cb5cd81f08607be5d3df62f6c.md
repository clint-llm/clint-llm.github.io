After drawing tumor markers, the treatment of an intratesticular mass is a radical inguinal orchiectomy. Rarely is there a role for biopsy before orchiectomy unless exceptional circumstances exist, such as a solitary testis with mass. Prior to orchiectomy, patients should receive counsel on sperm banking. Radical orchiectomy should take place through an inguinal incision to avoid leaving the inguinal portion of the spermatic cord or altering the lymphatic drainage in the setting of a potentially malignant tumor. The clinician should consider an inguinal biopsy of the contralateral testicle if scrotal ultrasound demonstrates a suspicious mass or marked atrophy or if there exists a clinical history of cryptorchidism on that side.

Some authors have proposed Leydig cell tumors to be an ideal testicular tumor for testis-sparing surgery.

While the majority of Leydig cell tumors are benign and orchiectomy curative, post-orchiectomy surveillance is still a recommendation. However, primarily because of the limited number of cases, there exist no widely accepted protocols for follow-up.

Malignant behavior of Leydig cell tumors is exhibited by metastasis to the retroperitoneal lymph nodes, liver, lungs, and bone.
