It is important to assess the etiology of the fracture in low-energy-mechanism, elderly patients. A thorough history is paramount. In the case of the elderly patient, a fragility fracture is most common. However, if a patient is on chronic bisphosphonates for bone health, they may have an atypical fracture characterized by cortical thickening at the fracture site. A history of antecedent thigh pain also may be noted in these cases.

The proximal fragment, which is held in flexion, may threaten the skin anteriorly. It is always important to assess for an open fracture. A thorough neurovascular exam with particular attention to assessment of vascular status is important.
