Leptospira can invade nonintact skin and mucous membranes. The infection is acquired by coming into contact with infected animals or their infected urine or body tissues. Sometimes Leptospira can even be acquired after contact with contaminated soil and water. Historically, exposures were primarily from recreational water, but more recently the United States has seen an upswing in occupational exposures from agricultural workers.

When the organism is shed in the infected animal's urine, it can survive in freshwater for up to 16 days and in soil for almost 24 days. They can then enter the human host through open wounds, mucous membranes, or the lungs if infected water is inhaled. It can also be transmitted across the placenta if an infected human is pregnant, leading to a miscarriage in the first two trimesters. If infected during the third trimester, pregnancy can result in stillbirth or intrauterine death.

Once within the body, the bacteria goes into the lymphatics and then into the bloodstream. From the bloodstream, the infection can spread to the entire body but tends to settle in the liver and kidneys.

It usually takes between 1 to 2 weeks for the infected person to begin to show symptoms, but could take up to a month.
