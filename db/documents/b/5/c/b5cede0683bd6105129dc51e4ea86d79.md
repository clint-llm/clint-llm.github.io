Hantavirus is a viral zoonosis that is most commonly found in the southwestern United States, South America, Europe, and Asia. It has been linked to hemorrhagic fevers, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and renal failure. Hantavirus is an RNA virus of the family Bunyaviridae.Peromyscus maniculatus) in the southwestern United States. This particular virus was found after a cluster of hantavirus cases occurred in 1993. Hantavirus was found in the United States in 1977, with at least 10 distinctive serotypes identified. Each serotype belongs to a specific rodent vector, geographic distribution, and clinical manifestation. Most hantavirus serotypes have a renal predilection.

Hantavirus, like other viruses in the Bunyaviridae family, have a lipid envelope around 3 RNA segments, but they chronically infect rodents instead of the usual arthropod vectors. Hantaviruses can be wherever one can find Muridae rodents. Sigmodontinae are host to the Sin Nombre virus and are the largest group of rats and mice in the western hemisphere.
