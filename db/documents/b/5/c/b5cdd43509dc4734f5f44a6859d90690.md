G6PD is the most common human enzyme defect known, affecting upward of 400 million people worldwide. Men are more commonly affected than women due to X-linked inheritance. It is most prevalent in tropical and subtropical areas. Interestingly, there is evidence to suggest that G6PD deficiency is protective against uncomplicated malaria, but not severe malaria cases. The protective mechanism for G6PD deficiency and malaria is still being investigated. With regards to ethnicity, G6PD deficiency is more common in people of African, Mediterranean, or Asian descent, likely owing to its suggested protective effect from malaria.
