There are many variations of anatomy in the general population. Failure of the anterolateral abdominal wall to form leads to infants born with "prune belly syndrome." These infants have no musculature in their abdominal wall to help compress the internal viscera and flex the trunk. They often have undescended testes accompanied by urogenital malformations. These children undergo multiple surgeries to reconstruct the abdominal wall to support internal organs, improved respiratory effort, and cosmetic improvement.

Weakness in the abdominal wall can lead to a variety of hernias. The linea alba may also thin and spread laterally to form a weakened portion of the anterior wall, resulting in an outpouching when there is increased intra-abdominal pressure, also known as diastasis recti. As mentioned previously, the pyramidalis is absent in up to 20% of the population.
