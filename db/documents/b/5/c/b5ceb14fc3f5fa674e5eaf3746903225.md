Since the 1960s, with the development of chlordiazepoxide and shortly thereafter diazepam, benzodiazepines quickly becameÂ popular medications secondary to their vastly superior safety profiles when compared to previous sedative-hypnotics such as barbiturates and other non-barbiturates used for the treatment of anxiety and insomnia. Since their initial development, multiple benzodiazepine drugs have been developed over the course of several decades. Benzodiazepines are currently used to treat anxiety, seizures, withdrawal states, insomnia, agitation and are commonly used for procedural sedation. Due to their many uses and addictive properties, benzodiazepines have been widely prescribed and abused since their development several decades ago. Today, there are over 50 different agents available on the worldwide market, and the high incidence of benzodiazepine overdose mirrors their widespread use and availability.
