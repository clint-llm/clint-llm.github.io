**History**

Get a thorough but focused history if possible, but priority assessment should include the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) and if necessary, initiating resuscitation.

If patients are unable to communicate, obtain as much history as possible from EMS or those at the bedside.

History should also focus on the possible source of bleeding, such as a more complete gastrointestinal (GI) history if there is a concern for GI hemorrhage, and likewise a focused menstrual and/or pregnancy history if concern for gynecological causes.

**Physical Exam**

Vital signs should undergo frequent monitoring. As above, the initial exam should focus on the organ thought to be the cause of the patient’s bleeding. If trauma is suspected, then the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and extremities must be both physically examined and imaged, as clinically indicated.

Below are the various stages of presentation of hemorrhagic shock:

- Class I (<15% blood loss): 

- Mild tachycardia is usually the first sign
- Blood pressure is normal
- Skin may start to feel cool to the touch

- Class II (15-30% blood loss):

- Tachycardia continues
- Tachypnea begins
- Decreased pulse pressure

- Class III (30-40% blood loss):

- Tachycardia worsens
- Decrease in blood pressure as well
- Skin becomes cold and appears pale and mottled
- Urine output decreases significantly

- Class IV (=40% blood loss):

- Extremely dangerous with high mortality
- Tachycardia and decreased blood pressure continue to worsen and can lead to loss of consciousness
- If there is more than 50% loss of blood, the pulse can disappear

Other useful skin examination findings include:

- Flank ecchymosis (Grey-Turner sign): suggests retroperitoneal hemorrhage

- Umbilical ecchymosis (Cullen sign): suggestive of intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal bleeding

- Jaundiced, yellow skin may suggest liver disease, hemoglobinopathies, or other forms of hemolysis

- Purpura and petechiae suggest platelet disorders

- Hemarthrosis suggests hemophilia

- Diffuse bleeding from intravenous (IV) sites and mucous membranes may be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
