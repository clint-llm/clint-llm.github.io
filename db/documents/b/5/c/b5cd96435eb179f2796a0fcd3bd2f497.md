Diagnosis is usually clinical. Traditionally the criteria as described by Billingham include the following:

- Immunologically competent cells must be present in the graft.

- The recipient should have transplantation alloantigens that appear foreign to the graft and can therefore stimulate it antigenically.

- The recipient should not be capable of mounting an effective immunologic reaction against the graft, or it must allow for enough time for the graft to manifest an immune response.

All patients who underwent hematopoietic cell transplantation are at potential risk of GVHD, although it usually occurs during the first few months post-transplantation

The use of biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis estimation is an area of investigation. Currently, no biomarker is ready for clinical application, but examples include ST2, REG3alpha, and TNFR1
