Capsule endoscopy, also known as wireless capsule endoscopy or video capsule endoscopy, is a gastrointestinal study that uses a pill camera to take images of the intestinal lumen. The first capsule endoscopy was performed in 1999, and the US Food and Drug Administration approved its use in the United States in 2001. The M2A capsule (mouth to anus) was the first available pill camera and was eventually renamed as PillCam SB (small bowel). This activity reviews the indications, contraindications of capsule endoscopy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with gastrointestinal pathology.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for capsule endoscopy.
- Describe the technique of capsule endoscopy.
- Recall the limitations of capsule endoscopy.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication in patients undergoing capsule endoscopy and improving outcomes.
