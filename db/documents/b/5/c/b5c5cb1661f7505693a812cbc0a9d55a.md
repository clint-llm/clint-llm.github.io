The differential diagnosis of lumbosacral radiculopathy includes herniated disc, lumbosacral plexopathy, lumbar spinal stenosis, mononeuropathies, diabetic amyotrophy, cauda equina syndrome, and non-radicular back pain.

Diabetic patients are prone to diabetic amyotrophy, which is a microvascular complication of the spinal blood vessels. It presents as weakness, dysesthesias, and pain in the proximal leg along the L2, L3, and L4 nerve roots with progression over the course of days to weeks.

New-onset acute back pain in a patient with osteoporosis should raise the suspicion of vertebral body fracture.

A patient with acute back pain in the setting of fever raises concerns for discitis or epidural abscess.

Pain that wakes the patient at night or an inability to become comfortable in various positions is concerning for malignancy, alongside symptoms such as weight loss, fatigue, fever, and chills.

Spinal stenosis is a form of degenerative spondylosis. Patients with symptomatic spinal stenosis will experience symptoms of neurogenic claudication. These symptoms include bilateral and asymmetrical radicular pain, weakness, and or sensory loss of the lower extremities. These symptoms are made worse by walking or standing for prolonged periods.

New-onset urinary incontinence, in the presence of progressive weakness, saddle anesthesia, changes to the gait, and/ or bowel dysfunction is concerning for cauda equina syndrome.
