The hand consists of tendons, ligaments, and bones. There are 27 bones total, consisting of 14 in the phalanges of the fingers, five metacarpal bones, and eight carpal bones. The bones in the hand are positioned and connected with ligaments. The tendons are what insert the muscle into the bones and are divided into the flexor components and the extensor components. The flexor tendons are located on the palmar side of the hand, and the extensor tendons are located on the dorsal aspect of the hand. The motor and sensory functions of the hand are mediated by the median, ulnar and radial nerves. The median nerve innervates the thenar muscles, index and middle finger lumbrical muscles, the ulnar nerve innervates all of the rest of the intrinsic muscles in the hand. Malfunction of any of these components of the hand may lead to injury or wear that ultimately leads to decreased functionality and disability.
