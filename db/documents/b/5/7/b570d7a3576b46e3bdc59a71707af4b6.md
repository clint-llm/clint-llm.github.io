Extreme hyperbilirubinemia (TB of 25 to 30 mg/dL) can cause bilirubin encephalopathy, Kernicterus, which is usually characterized by the deposition of unconjugated bilirubin (yellow stain) in brain cells. Neuronal necrosis/damage occurs in the basal ganglia, hippocampus, hypothalamic nuclei, diencephalon, midbrain responsible for neurohumoral and electrolyte control, brainstem nuclei accounting for oculomotor and auditory function, and in the cerebellum depositing as a bilirubin-phosphatidylcholine precipitate. Vision, hearing, speech, cognition, gait, and language are typically affected.
