Given that this is a rare and potentially lethal condition, a knowledgeable team member could have a dramatic impact on the patient’s outcome. Additionally, since this is a genetic condition, helping one patient helps others in their family. Members of the patient’s care team work together to make this diagnosis, firstly by having a low threshold for suspicion that vague behavioral and neurologic signs and symptoms may underlie a metabolic condition. Symptoms may first be discovered by nurses monitoring a patient’s vitals, by the patient’s parents or the patient themselves. Pediatricians, internists, or family physicians should have a low threshold for suspicion to test ammonia levels in patients presenting with neurological or behavioral disturbances. Given these presenting symptoms, specialists such as psychiatrists, neurologists, and radiologists play a role in diagnosis. Hemodialysis is an option for emergent treatment; thus nephrologists should be consulted immediately. Geneticists, pharmacists, and dieticians play key roles in treating these patients in the short and long term. It is the ethical responsibility of the care team to recommend genetic counseling to the patient or their family since carrying this mutation will affect not only their lives but also the lives of their relatives. This condition is treatable if caught early and fatal or debilitating if left undiagnosed.
