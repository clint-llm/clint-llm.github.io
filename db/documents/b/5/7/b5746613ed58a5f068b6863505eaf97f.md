Korsakoff syndrome is a chronic neuropsychiatric syndrome that is caused by the deficiency of thiamine, also known as vitamin B1. This deficiency leads to damage to multiple areas of the brain, which in turn cause amnesia and confusion. Korsakoff syndrome is most commonly seen in the context of chronic alcohol abuse and thought to be on the spectrum with Wernicke encephalopathy, however, Wernicke encephalopathy is acute and often reversible while Korsakoff syndrome is chronic and may be irreversible. This activity describes the evaluation and management of patients with Korsakoff syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.
