Like many other statin medications, lovastatin is commonly used to help lower cholesterol levels. Although lovastatin shares several notable side effects with the other drugs in its class, it is generally well-tolerated. Therefore, it could be beneficial for patients that are more sensitive to other statins. Lovastatin is effective in lowering cholesterol and the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Both patients and physicians should discuss the risks and benefits of lovastatin before starting treatment. Patients must also adhere to a heart-healthy diet before and during therapy with lovastatin. Patients should also know that routine checks are needed every four weeks to adjust and monitor serum levels of cholesterol.

Due to its many serious side effects and multiple drug-drug interactions, clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, and patients must openly communicate to optimize treatment with lovastatin. Pharmacists should notify clinicians and patients to discontinue any drugs that may cause harmful adverse effects while taking lovastatin and perform medication reconciliation. Nurses are well-positioned to monitor adverse reactions related to the medication and verify medication compliance on the patient chart. It is important to establish strong communication between all disciplines of care to maximize the benefits of lovastatin; this includes interprofessional team communication between physicians (both primary care and/or cardiologist), nursing (particularly those with cardiovascular specialty training), and pharmacy to achieve optimal results from lovastatin therapy.
