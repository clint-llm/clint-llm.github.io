Hernias may be found throughout the abdominal wall. The inguinal hernias are commonly a weakness either in the internal ring leading to the inguinal canal or the anterior abdominal wall medial to the inferior epigastric vessels. The weakness in the internal ring, formed by the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle, may lead to the formation of an indirect hernia. Peritoneal contents will protrude through the inguinal canal, and in severe or emergent cases, become strangulated, requiring emergency surgery. If the bowel contents protrude directly through the abdominal wall without traveling the inguinal canal, it is considered a direct hernia. If a hernia occurs along the semilunar lines, located laterally to the rectus abdominis, these are called Spigelian hernias. The umbilicus has a naturally weaker area of the fascia where the umbilical cord once emerged. This weakness may become even weaker with obesity, pregnancy, or any other cause of increased abdominal pressure leading to an umbilical hernia. Although diastasis recti is a widening of the linea alba with a sausage-like protrusion when the patient sits up, it is not a true hernia and does not need surgical intervention.
