Interprofessional team monitoring is critical to the outcomes of the patient. While a patient is on ECMO, they should be monitored continuously by an ECMO technician who constantly monitors the circuit and looks at the vital signs. They can make small changes to help facilitate better hemodynamic stability for the patient. They must remain in constant contact with the ECMO coordinator and ICU nursing staff to alert the team if any changes arise.

All team members must be able to monitor the patient from the perspective of their field and be able to communicate to provide the patient with the best possible outcomes. The patient could have a complication arise at any time. Therefore all team members must be ready to do their part to help with the care of the patient. When all team members are prepared, the patients have better outcomes with less morbidity and mortality.
