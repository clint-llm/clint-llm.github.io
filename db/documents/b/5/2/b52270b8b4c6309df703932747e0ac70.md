First and foremost, a sound comprehension of the relevant anatomy is vital to performing a safe and successful non-surgical rhinoplasty using filler.

Below are the layers of the nose encountered during nonsurgical rhinoplasty (listed from superficial to deep):

- Skin – thickest at the tip and radix, and thinnest at the rhinion; NOTE: skin in Asian and African American patients tends to be thicker and oilier, thus making for a more difficult injection (i.e., less pronounced effects and more post-procedural edema)

- Superficial fat – a space where major vessels lie

- Superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) – a thin fibromuscular layer where major vessels may lie

- Deep fat – this is a relatively avascular plane ideal for injecting filler; NOTE: small perforators of the arteries mentioned above may lie in this sub-SMAS plane; thus, the filler should be injected slowly and in small amounts while consistently aspirating before every injection.

- Perichondrium and periosteum – a thin fibrous layer over cartilage and bone, respectively

- Nasal cartilages and nasal bones

The vasculature of the nose encountered during nonsurgical rhinoplasty arises from both the internal and external carotid system via the ophthalmic and facial artery, respectively. While various branching patterns (particularly with the facial artery) and anastomoses exist between the two systems, the following categorization provides a basic description of the relatively constant vasculature encountered during nonsurgical rhinoplasty

- Ophthalmic artery (internal carotid system)—gives rise to the dorsal nasal artery and external nasal artery (via the anterior ethmoid artery) to supply the upper portion of the nose

- Facial artery (external carotid system)—gives rise to the superior labial and angular arteries which branch to include the columellar artery and the lateral nasal artery, respectively, to supply the lower portion of the nos

NOTE: For a useful and simplified schema of the superficial nasal blood supply, the reader is referred to the cadaveric study performed by Saban et al.

Emphasis is on injecting into the avascular deep fat or sub-SMAS plane to avoid vascular occlusion and its devastating sequelae, namely skin necrosis, and blindness.

Equally important to adhering to safe injection planes is comprehending pertinent rhinoplasty terms and definitions, several of which are characterized below

- Anatomic dome – the anteriormost projected portion of the lower lateral cartilages between the medial and lateral crus

- Columella – the column in between the nostrils at the base of the nose

- Dorsum – the anterior nasal surface between the tip and the radix

- Infratip lobule – the part of the tip between the tip-defining points and the columellar-lobule junction

- Lower lateral cartilage (LLC) – the paired caudal nasal cartilages consisting of the medial, intermediate, and lateral crura

- Nasion – the skin depression at the junction of the nose with the forehead (should protrude roughly 11 to 14 mm from the upper eyelid with its deepest portion at a level between the lashes and supratarsal crease)

- Nasolabial angle – the angle that exists resulting from a line drawn through the most anterior to the most posterior point of the nostril intersecting the vertical facial plane on the lateral view. Ideal angles vary, though they have been defined as 90 to 115 degrees, with a more acute angle preferred for males.

- Radix – the junction that exists between the frontal bone and the nasal bones

- Rhinion – the point located at the bony-cartilaginous junction over the dorsum of the nose

- Soft triangle – the thin skin fold between the anterior portion of the nostril and the caudal border of the dome between the medial and lateral crura

- Subnasale – the junction of the columella and the lip

- Supratip area – the area just cephalad to the nasal tip at the caudal portion of the nasal dorsum

- Tip – the most anterior aspect of the nasal lobule

- Tip defining points – the most projecting area on each side of the tip that produces an external light reflection

- Tip projection – the distance from the most projected portion of the tip to the most posterior point of the nasal–cheek junction; in general, the tip projection should be roughly 55% to 60% of the length of the nose

- Tip rotation – the movement of the tip cephalad or caudad pivoted at the alar base on the profile view

- Upper lateral cartilages – the paired cephalad nasal cartilages spanning laterally from the anterior septum and composing the lateral walls of the middle third of the nose

For a more comprehensive review of nasal anatomy, the reader can read the references cited for further study.

Upon obtaining a thorough understanding of the relevant anatomy, only then can a comprehensive nasal analysis be performed. Such analysis should include not only classically recognized facial/nasal angles and proportions (some of which are detailed above) but also acknowledge cultural and/or ethnic preferences.
