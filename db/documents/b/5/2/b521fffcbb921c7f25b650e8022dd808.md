The gold standard in the diagnosis of tuberculosis is the culture of Mycobacterium; however, the TB bacillus is fastidious; and the sole reliance on positive cultures for diagnosis can be associated with poor sensitivity.

Alternate laboratory reference standards for diagnosis include a histopathological demonstration of classic caseating granulomas, staining of smears to identify acid-fast bacilli (AFB), serological inflammatory markers, immunological tests, and molecular diagnostic modalities. A typical clinical presentation with additional indirect evidence from radiological and laboratory tests are usually necessary to clinch the diagnosis in a significant proportion of patients.

**Imaging Modalities**

Plain radiographs (15% sensitivity): Early stages (less than 30% vertebral destruction) – not much role; later stages (beyond 30% vertebral destruction) – can present with disc space reduction, endplate rarefaction, vertebral body destruction, instability, and spinal deformity. The chest x-ray is also an important investigation, as up to thirds of these patients with spinal TB can also have a concomitant pulmonary disease.

Computed tomography (CT) (100% sensitivity): Can help in the diagnosis at a much earlier stage than plain x-rays. The types of vertebral destructive lesions by CT in spinal TB include fragmentary, osteolytic, subperiosteal, and localized sclerosis. CT scans can also aid in image-guided biopsy for establishing the diagnosis.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (100% sensitivity and 80% specificity): MRI is the most useful modality in the diagnosis of spinal TB. MRI best detects the extent of soft tissue enhancement, the location of the abscess and spinal canal compromise. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI may provide additional information regarding the diagnosis. Screening sequences involving the whole spine can also help us in identifying non-contiguous vertebral involvement. MRI can also assess response to treatment.

Nuclear imaging: 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) labeled positron emission tomography (PET) scan provides evidence of functional activity in the involved tissues, based on the rationale that 18F-FDG is known to accumulate in macrophages at the inflammation site.

**Laboratory Tests**

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (60% to 90% sensitivity) is usually more than 20 mm/hour in TB and decreases with treatment response. Nevertheless, it is not a very sensitive test. C-reactive protein (CRP) (71% sensitivity) is more specific than ESR.

Serological examination of IgG and IgM antibody levels against TB antigen cannot effectively distinguish between active or healed disease; natural TB infection or vaccinated persons; and is raised in both active and chronic stages of infection.

Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) staining (25% to 75% sensitivity and 99% specificity): Using the Ziehl-Neelsen technique, tubercle bacillus presents with a bright red stain. At least, a concentration of 1 to 10 bacteria/ ml is necessary for detection.

TB culture: BACTEC radiometric culture assay (56% sensitivity and 100% specificity) takes 2 weeks of incubation time; while traditional culture on Lowenstein-Jenson (LJ) medium takes up to 6 weeks (47% sensitivity and 100% specificity).

Molecular testing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (75% sensitivity and 97% specificity) This technique requires only a concentration of 1 to 10 bacilli/ ml. This is a very useful technique in paucibacillary, extrapulmonary TB infections.

Gene Xpert MTB/RIF: This is a fully automated test, which yields results within 90 minutes (82.9% sensitivity and 98% specificity). This test also helps in diagnosing resistance to rifampicin. WHO, in March 2017 recommended Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (87.8% sensitivity and 94.8% specificity) as an investigation with good yield in pediatric and extrapulmonary patients.

Histopathological evaluation: Characteristic findings including caseating necrosis, epithelioid cell granuloma, and Langhans giant cells can be found in 72% to 97% of patients.

**Tests to Detect Latent Tuberculosis**

Mantoux test (40% to 55% sensitivity and 75% specificity): Skin hypersensitivity test (purified protein derivative [PPD]) has been recommended as a low-cost test in developing nations; nevertheless it is not an accurate test in endemic countries or immunodeficient patients.

Interferon-gamma release assay (50% to 65% sensitivity and 85% specificity): Measuring interferons produced in response to tubercular antigens; not useful in endemic regions.

Whole blood-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
