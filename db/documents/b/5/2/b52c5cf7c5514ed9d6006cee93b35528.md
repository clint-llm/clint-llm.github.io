Patients diagnosed with hearing loss should be managed by a multidisciplinary team of otolaryngologists, audiologists, speech-language pathologists, pediatricians, and primary care physicians. Children born in the United States must undergo universal hearing screening using a combination of OAE and ABR. Children screening positive for hearing loss should be immediately referred for a formal hearing evaluation, genetic testing, and hearing augmentation with hearing aids, cochlear implants, and/or speech rehabilitation to promote long-term speech and language outcomes.

The pediatrician should perform long-term monitoring of childhood development with regular follow-up with audiology for routine hearing aid and audiogram assessments. Formal hearing loss support groups can aid children and parents in addressing their concerns. The school system should alsoÂ provide an optimal classroom learning environment for children with hearing impairment.
