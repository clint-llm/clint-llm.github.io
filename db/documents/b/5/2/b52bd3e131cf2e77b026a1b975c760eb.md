Frequently, patients areÂ unable to be educated on the requirement for endotracheal intubation and possible complications, such as LTS, due to the emergent situation in which it takes place. In cases where patients have a history of autoimmune diseases and may have LTS, they should be counseled by their physician regarding what signs and symptoms they should not ignore and seek immediate medical attention, especially if they have had a previous episode of LTS. Additionally, patients affected by LTS, especially of idiopathic etiology, may benefit from online forums where they may connect with other patients who are similarly affected in order to share information, experiences, and emotional support.
