The smooth functioning of the human body depends on coordination between somatic and visceral parts of the nervous system. Visceral part of the nervous system is commonly known as the autonomic nervous system. It has two components parasympathetic and sympathetic. Visceral efferent has at least two sets of neurons, i.e. preganglionic and postganglionic neurons.

Fibers of cranial parasympathetic ganglion originate from brain stem nuclei. After leaving the brainstem, these fiber synapses in the peripheral parasympathetic ganglion. There are four peripheral parasympathetic ganglia (ciliary ganglion, pterygopalatine ganglion, otic ganglion, and submandibular ganglion) situated in the head and neck region. Postganglionic parasympathetic fibers provide parasympathetic innervation to the target organ.

Ciliary ganglion is a peripheral parasympathetic ganglion. It is situated near the apex of orbit between the optic nerve and lateral rectus muscle. It is related medially to the ophthalmic artery and laterally to the lateral rectus muscle.
