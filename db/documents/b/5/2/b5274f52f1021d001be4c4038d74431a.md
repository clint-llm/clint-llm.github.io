Following a surgical procedure, postoperative urinary retention may present as suprapubic pain or discomfort, bladder spasm, and/or urine leaking combined with the inability to urinate. However, some or all of these symptoms may be disguised by anesthesia or sedation from the operation.

On physical exam, one should palpate and percuss the suprapubic area for bladder fullness represented by a tense suprapubic area on palpation and dull percussions. The average bladder holds around 400 to 600 mL, and a rough estimate for 500 mL of volume on physical exam is dullness to percussion just below the umbilicus. Dullness extending above the umbilicus may represent as much as 1000 mL.
