Patients at increased risk for developing central retinal artery occlusion are those with:

- Giant cell arteritis

- Atherosclerosis

- Thromboembolic disease

Arterial supply to the eye is via the ophthalmic artery which is a branch of the cavernous portion of the internal carotid artery. The central retinal artery enters the globe along with the optic nerve and serves the inner layers of the retina through its many branches. Fifteen percent to 30% of the population have a cilioretinal artery which is part of the choroidal arterial supply. This supplies the area of the retina around the macula which is the central vision area. Patients who have a cilioretinal artery may still have preserved central vision because this portion of the retina is still being perfused.

In central retinal artery occlusion, the inner retinal layers which are normally served by the retinal circulation will die. This is what causes the vision loss. However, these layers may receive enough oxygen via diffusion from the choroidal circulation to maintain viability if the patient is exposed to increased FiO2. Normally the choroidal circulation supplies most of the oxygen to the retina.
