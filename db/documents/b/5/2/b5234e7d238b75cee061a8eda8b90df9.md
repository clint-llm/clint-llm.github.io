Experimentally, a nitric acid/zinc complex solution for topical application has been successfully used on difficult to treat warts. The solution includes dilute nitric acid, zinc, copper, and organic acids. The application of this solution causes destruction and desiccation of the wart through a combination of denaturation and active protein coagulation actions. So far, it appears to be well tolerated and effective.

The use of antivirals such as topical cidofovir also appears promising, but more study is needed before it can be safely utilized clinically.

Curcumin, a derivative of turmeric, has shown efficacy against genital warts anecdotally, but more study is needed to determine its true safety and effectiveness.
