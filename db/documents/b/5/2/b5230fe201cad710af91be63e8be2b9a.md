**Olfactory Nerve (CNI)**

The olfactory nerve transmits signals from the nasal cavity to the brain to give the sense of olfaction. The olfactory epithelium is in the superior portion of the nasal cavity. Within this epithelium are sensory cilia that project up through the cribriform plate to the olfactory bulb. From the olfactory bulb, signals are sent through the olfactory nerve proper to a network of secondary neurons for processing before ending up in the brain.

**Trigeminal Nerve (CNV)**

The trigeminal nerve is the sensory innervation to the external and internal nose. The branches are the ophthalmic (V1), maxillary (V2), and mandibular (V3).Â  Sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers run with these branches to supply their target tissues. The ophthalmic and maxillary branches innervate the nose and nasal cavity.

- **Ophthalmic Branches (V1):**As the ophthalmic nerve begins to branch, it gives off a nasociliary branch, which then provides the anterior and posterior ethmoid nerves. The anterior ethmoid gives off an external branch that supplies the nasal tip, an internal branch that supplies the anterosuperior nasal cavity and a septal branch that supplies the anterior superior nasal septum. The posterior ethmoid supplies the posterosuperior nasal cavity. Two other branches of the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve are the supratrochlear and infratrochlear nerves that supply the nasal dorsum.

- **Maxillary Branches (V2):**The maxillary branches of the trigeminal nerve that innervate the nose and nasal cavity branch in or near the pterygopalatine fossa then enter the nasal cavity. The only external nasal branch is the infraorbital nerve, which supplies the malar and lateral nose. The nasopalatine nerve traverses the nasal septum from posterior to anterior in a downward projection to enter the incisive canal. It supplies the posterior and inferior nasal septum as well as mucosa just posterior to the incisors. The greater palatine nerve follows the greater palatine artery down the palatine canal, giving off posterior inferior lateral nasal nerves that supply the posterior lateral wall of the nasal cavity. Three other nerves come off the maxillary branch (V2). Two of these are the posterior superior lateral nasal nerve and posterior superior medial nasal nerve, both of which pass through the sphenopalatine foramen to supply the lateral and medial walls of the nasal cavity, respectively. The superior alveolar nerve is the last branch of V2, and it supplies the anterior septum and the area near the nasal vestibule.
