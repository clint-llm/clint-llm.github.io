Whether the initial diagnosis is made in the emergency department, urgent care, or primary clinic, differentiating the type of conjunctivitis is critical in enhancing patient-centered care and outcomes. Depending on the setting of the initial diagnosis, history and examination may be performed by a single individual or multiple practitioners. Therefore, it is essential for all team members, including the ophthalmic nurse, to have a clear and open line of communication. Specialty-trained nurses and pharmacists also figure into the interprofessional team approach to managing this condition. Efficacious communication will enhance interprofessional team performance and provide the best possibility for the correct diagnosis and, therefore, the best opportunity for a successful outcome for the patient. Assessing for red flags and ruling out sight-threatening diagnoses are also critical in the interprofessional care of conjunctivitis. When necessary, prompt ophthalmologic consults and/or speedy referrals for high-risk disease should not be overlooked by providers. [LevelÂ 5]
