Factitious hypoglycemia is the intentional attempt to induce low blood glucose levels. It remains one of the diagnostic challenges that endocrinologists face during their practice and usually leads to costly, unnecessary investigations to rule out other causes of hypoglycemia.

When insulin is self-injected, laboratory studies will show high plasma insulin levels in combination with low plasma C-peptide levels during the hypoglycemic episode. With sulfonylurea consumption, the clinical picture may mimic an insulinoma with high plasma levels of both C-peptide and insulin; a positive drug screen canÂ render the diagnosis.
