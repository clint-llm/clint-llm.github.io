- Congenital melanocytic nevi are pigmented lesions that are usually present at birth but which can actually become apparent in the first two years of life (tardive CMN).

- They are often polychromatic and can present hypertrichosis and a verrucous surface.

- Patients with single small or medium CMN have a very low risk of developing melanoma.

- The presence of large, especially multiple lesions, is the main risk factor for melanoma in pediatric populations.

- Individuals with multiple large or giant CMN are also at a higher risk of presenting neurological involvement and should have an MRI performed in the first year of life (ideally in the first 6 months) to rule out neurocutaneous melanosis.

- Melanomas arising from CMN usually present as subcutaneous nodules and tend to be very aggressive.

- A new understanding of the genetics of CMN is leading to better understanding and managing this condition.
