Many patients with osteoarthritis suffer from chronic pain and difficulty performing daily activities; hence, an interprofessional approach is necessary to improve this large cohort of patients' quality of life. Primary care physicians (internists or family physicians), orthopedic surgeons, rheumatologists, specialty trained nurses, and physical therapists share the responsibility to the care of these patients. Most importantly, patients should be counseled and educated about the prognosis and natural history of the disease. Patients should be encouraged to implement lifestyle modifications and control modifiable risk factors to hinder the disease's progression. Referring patients to physiotherapy, orthotics, occupational therapy, or dietitian services is recommended if clinically indicated.

Referral to the orthopedic surgeon should not be delayed in patients who fail to respond adequately to pharmacological management. Joint replacement surgeries have high success rates and can effectively alleviate pain and improve joint alignment lasting 10 to 15 years.
