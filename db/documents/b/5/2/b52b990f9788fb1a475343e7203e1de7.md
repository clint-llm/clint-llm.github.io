Psychosocial distress can be elicited by the cosmetic appearance of hyperkeratosis, especially in exposed areas such as the face, scalp, and neck. Another complication that can occur is scarring secondary to the traumatic manipulation of the lesions by the patient. Clinicians must educate patients on the necessity of using the prescribed topical medications and refrain from manipulating the lesions.
