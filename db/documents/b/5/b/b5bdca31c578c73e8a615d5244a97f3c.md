**Bony Anatomy**

The fibula is a long and straight, thick bone measuring approximately 3 cm x 40 cm, slightly longer in males than females. It has a tricortical profile, or triangular cross-section, with the muscle attachments to the fibula determining this shape. The mean fibula length is 387.4 ± 23.7 mm in males and 361.5 ± 12.3 mm in females.

**Joints and Supporting Structures**

1. Proximal tibiofibular joint

The synovial joint between the head of the fibula and the lateral condyle of the tibia is supported by a capsule and anterior and posterior superior tibiofibular ligaments. The lateral collateral ligament and biceps femoris support the joint coronally. External rotation of the ankle produces a small amount of movement at the proximal tibiofibular joint.

2. Distal tibiofibular joint (ankle syndesmosis)

The fibrous joint between the fibular notch and distal tibia is made up of the interosseous membrane, the anterior and posterior inferior tibiofibular ligaments, and the inferior transverse tibiofibular ligaments. For this reason, the distal 5 cm of the fibula is essential for ankle joint function; any disruption to the syndesmotic structures can cause ankle instability.

**Vascular Anatomy**

The blood supply of the fibula is important for graft viability and union. Penetrating periosteal vessels supply the metaphysis and epiphysis while nonpenetrating periosteal vessels supply the diaphysis.

Understanding this anatomy is very important for deciding which part of the fibula is needed for a particular patient's reconstruction. The length of the vascular pedicle can be up to 15 cm if the distal fibula is harvested, less if more proximal bone is used. Additionally, perforating vessels from the peroneal artery can support a skin paddle measuring up to 10 x 20 cm in surface area, which is very useful in head and neck reconstruction. Vascularized bone grafts may withstand early mechanical loading better than non-vascularized grafts and minimize the likelihood of bone resorption and stress fracture, as they can remodel over time.
