Ingrown toenails are usually encountered and managed by a wide variety of healthcare professionals, including general practitioners, dermatologists, general and orthopedic surgeons, and podiatrists. Specialty nursing involvement will generally be with changing dressings and monitoring healing progress, ensuring the patient is using any accompanying medications appropriately (e.g., topical antibiotics). The specialty-trained foot and nail nurse should report all progress or setbacks to any clinicians involved. The foot and nail nurse should also assist the clinician with patient and family education in training the patient and family in regard to appropriate nail trimming techniques. An interprofessional team approach is thus, essential to render the best patient care and achieve optimal outcomes. [Level 5]
