Rickets should be differentiated from the following conditions that mimic based on either the biochemical abnormalities or radiological features:

- Renal insufficiency: Bone disease, also known as renal osteodystrophy, occurs due to many reasons such as the reduced formation of 1,25- dihydroxy vitamin D, metabolic acidosis, retention of phosphate, aluminum toxicity, and secondary hyperparathyroidism.

- Conditions increase ALP: Transient hyperphosphatasemia (a benign condition characterized by an increase in ALP mostly seen in children less than < 5 years of age, where both bone and liver fractions are elevated, however, liver enzymes and 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels will be normal

- Conditions which cause hypocalcemia: Primary hypoparathyroidism

- Other bone diseases such: Osteogenesis imperfecta, congenital syphilis

- Nonaccidental injury

- Normal variation: Bowlegs may be seen normally in children < 2 years.

- Skeletal dysplasia: Achondroplasia

- Blount disease: Pathological cox vara (bow legs) due to disruption and altered enchondral bone formation of the medial aspect of proximal metaphysis of the tibia
