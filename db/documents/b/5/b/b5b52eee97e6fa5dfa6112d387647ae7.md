Protamine should be given slowly, and patients should be monitored closely for anaphylaxis, rapid hypotension, or an increase in pulmonary artery pressures.  Anaphylaxis can cause an increase in peak airway pressures along with hypotension, a rash, and wheezing, or difficulty breathing. The presence of an arterial line for invasive blood pressure monitoring and/or a pulmonary artery catheter to monitor changes in pulmonary artery pressures is advantageous to recognize early negative sequelae from protamine administration. It is also imperative for the medical staff to have access to cardiovascular rescue drugs (vasoactive/inotropic drugs) and resuscitation equipment should an adverse reaction occur.
