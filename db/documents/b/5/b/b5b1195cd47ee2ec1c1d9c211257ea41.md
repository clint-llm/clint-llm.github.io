Fractures are usually encountered by the emergency department physician, urgent care nurse, and primary care provider. In all but the simplest non-displaced fractures, one should consult an orthopedic surgeon before discharge as part of an interprofessional team approach to diagnosing and managing these injuries. A missed or inappropriately treated Salter-Harris fracture has lifelong implications. Once the patient has been treated, follow-up is required to ensure that healing is taking place. Finally, healthcare providers must be aware that Salter V fracture diagnosis may be delayed unless there is a high degree of clinical suspicion. Often the diagnosis is not made at the initial presentation. An emergent orthopedic consultation should be obtained if the fracture is recognized in the emergency department.

Orthopedic specialty nurses can also be valuable assets in the interprofessional approach by assisting with evaluation and, indeed, during surgery, providing counsel to patients/parents in all cases. They can also coordinate activities and information sharing between the various clinicians involved in the case. Physical therapists likewise play a crucial role on the interprofessional team and must keep other team members apprised of the patient's progress or lack thereof, so appropriate therapy changes can be implemented if necessary. These are a few examples of how interprofessional care benefits the patient, leading to improved outcomes. [Level 5]
