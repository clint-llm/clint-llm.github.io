Recovery from pancuronium can be prolonged compared to other NMBDs. The use of an anticholinesterase drug can help hasten this recovery; neostigmine is a typical drug for reversal of NBMD in the peri-operative setting, although edrophonium or pyridostigmine are also options. Reversal of neuromuscular blockade occurs by increasing the ACh available at the NMJ by inhibiting cholinesterase, allowing ACh to competitively inhibit pancuronium from binding and blocking the postjunctional receptors. It is critical to note that the administration of anticholinesterase medications may be ineffective with a significant depth of blockade. Anticholinesterase drugs should be administered with anticholinergic drugs to prevent bradycardia in the reversed patient.

Due to the long duration of action of pancuronium, it may be associated with more residual blockade after reversal when compared to intermediate- and short-acting NMBDs.
