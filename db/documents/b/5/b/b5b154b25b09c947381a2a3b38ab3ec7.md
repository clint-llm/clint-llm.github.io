Fentanyl is typically administered intravenously (IV), intramuscularly (IM), transdermally (TD) as skin patches, intranasally (IN) in the form of a volatile nasal spray, and intrathecally (IT). It is also available as a buccal soluble thin film, which can dissolve in the mouth, similar to the sublingual tablets. However, in contrast to other opiates, it is less common to find forms of synthetic drugs such as oral tablets or powders. A new medication currently being used to address the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects without counteracting its primary analgesic aims acts selectively on the GI mu-opioid receptors and can aid in alleviating constipation while still providing pain relief, a dilemma previously treated off-label in some hospitals by suspending a vial of naloxone in ice water and taking the mix enterally. The transdermal patch is for the long-term management of pain. This article focuses on injectable fentanyl; more detailed coverage of the transdermal formulation is available in the StatPearls specific article on transdermal fentanyl.

Fentanyl comes in an injectable form of 50 mcg/mL. Dosing is as follows by indication:

- Preoperative analgesia

- 50 to 100 mcg IV/IM for a single dose 30 to 60 minutes before surgery; consider lower dosing in patients 65 and older.

- Anesthesia adjunct

- 2 to 50 mcg/kg/dose IV for a single dose

- 2 to 20 mcg for low dosing; 20 to 50 mcg for higher dosing. Low dosing is favored in patients 65 and older.

- Regional anesthesia adjunct

- 50 to 100 mcg IV/IM for a single; consider lower dosing in patients 65 and older.

- General anesthesia

- 20 to 50 mcg/kg/dose IV for a single dose; consider lower dosing in patients 65 and older.
- For high-risk patients undergoing complicated surgical procedures, use with oxygen and a muscle relaxant; doses up to 150 mcg/kg/dose may be necessary.

- Post-operative pain control

- 50 to 100 mcg IV/IM every 1 to 2 hours as needed; alternately 0.5 to 1.5 mcg/kg/hour IV as needed. Consider lower dosing in patients 65 and older.
- PCA (patient-controlled analgesia): 10 to 20 mcg IV every 6 to 20 minutes as needed; start at the lowest effective dose for the shortest effective duration - refer to institutional protocols.

- Moderate to severe acute pain (off-label)

- 1 to 2 mcg/kg/dose intranasally each hour as needed; the maximum dose is 100 mcg. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest effective duration.
