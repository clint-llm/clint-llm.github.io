Human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLV) are a family of human retroviruses recognized as oncoviruses. They are known for their causation of other immunosuppressive and inflammatory diseases. HTLV-1 is the most clinically significant of this family and was the first demonstrable case of a pathogen capable of inducing malignant disease. HTLV-1 is now widely believed to be one of the most potent oncogenic agents in humans.
