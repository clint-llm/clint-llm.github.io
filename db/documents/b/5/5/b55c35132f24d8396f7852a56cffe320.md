Bezold's abscess may occur in both children and adults with well-developed mastoid bones. Both may have had a history of recurrent otitis media or chronic otitis media with tympanic membrane perforation and a draining ear. Prior mastoid surgery for cholesteatoma normally causes further thinning of the mastoid walls making it easier for infection to spread in this way. An important early clinical sign of a coalescent mastoiditis on physical examination is sagging of the posterior superior external auditory canal. Other common clinical signs includeÂ the following:

- neck pain

- swelling in the lateral neck

- postauricular tenderness over the affected mastoid bone

- otalgia

- otorrhea

- hearing loss

If any of the above is documented, and the patient presents with fever with an associated neck mass one should have a high index of suspicion that the infection has spread to adjacent regions within the head and neck. Thus a thorough head and neck evaluation should always be conducted. In the differential diagnosis, one must always consider an abscess of post-auricular lymph nodes, other deep neck space abscesses from oropharyngeal or odontogenic sources, and malignancy. If CT scanning is not available, then a simple lateral x-ray of the temporal bone may be helpful in ascertaining the status of the mastoid air cell system. A thorough cranial nerve examination is essential, as the progression of the infection into the infratemporal fossa can cause cranial neuropathies.
