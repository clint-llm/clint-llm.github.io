In either case of prolactin excess or deficiency, measuring the serum prolactin level is appropriate. Measuring TSH and reviewing medication lists are suggested as part of the workup as well. These two steps are crucial to rule out hypothyroidism or medication adverse effects as an underlying cause of prolactin excess symptoms.

In males, serum prolactin levels range from 2 to 18 ng/ml, in females 2 to 30 ng/ml, and during the third trimester of pregnancy, 10 to 210 ng/ml. In cases of prolactinomas, the serum prolactin level is typically greater than 200 ng/mL. MRI is the imaging modality of choice for identifying the presence or absence of aÂ prolactin-secreting tumor called a pituitary adenoma.
