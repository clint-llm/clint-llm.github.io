Madelung deformity may be developmental or post-traumatic. The classic or congenital form of Madelung deformity is thought to be caused by the Vickers ligament, a pathologic ligament that crosses the ulnar radial physis, therefore tethering and restricting the growth of the volar ulnar corner of the distal radius, although the exact cause is unknown.

Vickers ligament is a hypertrophicÂ radiolunate ligament, or less commonly, a radiotriquetral ligament.

This leads to an increase in radial inclination and volar tilt, causing subsidence of the lunate, therefore altering carpal kinematics. Classic Madelung deformity is more common in Leri-Weill dyschondrosis, a form of mesomelic dwarfism resulting in a triad of short stature, mesomelic disproportion, and Madelung deformity caused by mutations in the short stature homeobox-containing gene (SHOX).

A similar appearing deformity referred to as Madelung-like deformity may occur in other conditions, including post-traumatic, multiple hereditary exostoses, Ollier disease, and gymnasts wrist (repetitive microtrauma to the distal radial physis) when there is damage to the volar ulnar distal radius physis.
