Lambl excrescences are uncommon cardiac valvular strands now more frequently detected even on routine transthoracic echocardiograms due to advancements in ultrasonography technology. These filiform strands can be an incidental finding or can be associated with severe complications like ischemic stroke, coronary embolism, pulmonary embolism, or valvular obstruction. There is no direct, causal relationship between Lambl excrescences and these complications. It is only a clinical association. When detected, their proper identification and differentiation from other similar pathological entities are essential. When complications such as embolic stroke occur, a thorough workup to identify the source of emboli should be performed. Lambl excrescences should be a potential but last consideration in cryptogenic strokes, when associated. Various treatment modalities have been tried including observation, antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, and surgical excision. However, at this time, there are no specific evidence-based guidelines to assist medical professionals in the long-term management of such patients. Further systemic studies are needed.

With further medical technological advancements, Lambl excrescences have a higherÂ potential of detection and, therefore, a higher risk of incidence and prevalence. Early presentation of patients could help in better management.
