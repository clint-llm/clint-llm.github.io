In the event that adequate notice is given, contacting the PICU or NICU team, either at your facility or another site, is vital to aid in management and disposition. The preparation and training of these teams are vital for cohesion. Many children with known congenital disorders will have specialists that can assist in providing optimal care and the transfer of the patient to another facility, if necessary. Anesthesiology should also be alerted if the impending respiratory failure is suspected. Having a code cart and airway cart with age-specific equipment available at a moment's notice is crucial to helping ensure a well-run code.
