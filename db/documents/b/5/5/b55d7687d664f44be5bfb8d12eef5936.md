It is crucial to differentiate and rule out other forms of dementia that are treatable and reversible. Further dementia may be associated with cerebellar signs/symptoms, which can be differentiated with kuru disease by the brain and vascular imaging, appropriate blood workup, serological workup, pathological evaluation, and genetic studies. These differentials for kuru include:

- Other prion diseases

- The most common of the prion disease is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), which usually presents with neurological manifestations like myoclonus and upper motor neuron signs. Also, dementia presents early in CJD as compared to kuru, where dementia may be a late manifestation.
- Familial fatal insomnia, in contrast to kuru, presents with prominent insomnia, dysautonomia, and myoclonus.
- Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker (GSS) presents with a more diverse clinical picture with cerebellar signs, spastic paraparesis, and cognitive impairment more like Alzheimerâ€™s disease.

- Autoimmune/antibody-mediated disorders

- Alzheimer disease, frontal, temporal dementia

- Other dementia (Lewy body, vascular, unclassified)

- Encephalitis, not specified

- Infection (herpes virus, syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus, Lyme, aspergillosis of the brain)

- Neoplasm and paraneoplastic syndromes

- Metabolic disorders/toxins/metal poisoning including lithium and heavy metals
