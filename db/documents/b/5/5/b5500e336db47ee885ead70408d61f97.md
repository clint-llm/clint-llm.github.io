When evaluating a patient with suspected diaphragmatic paralysis, it is important to consider the underlying cause. For example, if a patient underwent cardiac surgery, it is known that up to 20 percent of patients have residual weakness due to the cooling of the phrenic nerve that resolves with time. An extensive workup is not likely required urgently for these patients.

**Chest Radiographs**

As mentioned previously, many cases of unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis are asymptomatic, leading to some cases being found incidentally by chest radiographs. Chest X-ray alone can diagnose up to 90 percent of unilateral diaphragmatic palsy. A Chest x-ray is sensitive but not specific for diaphragm paralysis. Usually, frontal, inspiratory, upright, and lateral positions are required. The right hemidiaphragm is usually slightly elevated compared to the left side, and therefore if it is further elevated with a more acute costophrenic angle, one could suspect right diaphragm paralysis. The normal hemidiaphragm dome usually projects over the 5th or 6th rib anteriorly and over the 10th rib posteriorly, with the left hemidiaphragm dome being one interspace lower than the right. If the left hemidiaphragm was similar in height to the right, left hemidiaphragm paralysis is suspected.

**Fluoroscopic Evaluation (Snif test)**

If a patient is suspected of having unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis based on chest X-ray findings, the diagnosis can be confirmed through fluoroscopic examination "Snif test." In unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis, the paralyzed hemidiaphragm will either show no movement or have a paradoxical movement into the thoracic cavity with sniffing or deep inspiration (positive test in over 90% of cases).

**Pulmonary Function Tests**

The diaphragm is the most important muscle for inspiration, accounting for up to 80 percent of the power generated during respiration. With unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis, a 50 percent decline would be expected in the forced vital capacity. This is further decreased up to 25 percent more during supine positioning due to muscle weakness and cranially directed pressure from the abdominal cavity. Other pulmonary volumes may remain unchanged as long as the paralysis remains unilateral.

Positional (supine versus upright) spirometry measurements are very informative and significantly different in individuals with neurological diseases such as spinal cord injury and unilateral diaphragm paralysis.

**Electromyography (EMG)**

Electromyography has somewhat of a limited role in diagnosing unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis. If the issue is localized to the phrenic nerve, stimulation of the nerve will not cause muscle contraction, and this can be detected. If the pathology is muscular in origin, the phrenic nerve will conduct the impulse as expected, but the diaphragm muscle will not contract.

**Transdiaphragmatic Pressure Measurements**

In unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis, trans-diaphragmatic pressures (Pdi) would be expected to be reduced as the diaphragm cannot contract properly. With left hemidiaphragm paralysis more than right, the gastric component of Pdi measurement is decreased. Pdi measurements correlate well with phrenic nerve conduction study (NCS), a non-invasive method that provides additional information that can identify the mechanism for unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis.

**Thorax Ultrasound**

Ultrasound of the thorax can be used to assist with the diagnosis of diaphragm paralysis. The B mode of ultrasound can show the diaphragm as a thick echogenic line.

**CT Scan**

Once patients have been diagnosed with unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis, a CT scan can be beneficial to determine the cause of the paralysis, along with ruling out any possible compression from tumors or other thoracic etiology. Another common finding is atelectasis at the base of the lung on the affected side.

**MRI**

An MRI may be considered if the patient presents with cervical spine pain or for a closer look at soft tissue after trauma to diagnose the etiology of the diaphragm weakness accurately. A case report of a patient who underwent foraminotomies after foraminal stenosis was seen on MRI and reported a resolution of hemidiaphragm paralysis.

**Sleep Study**

As mentioned earlier, with unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis, the ability to ventilate may diminish and lead to hypercapnia that worsens during sleep. Some studies recommend the use of sleep studies or continuous pulse oximetry. If there is evidence of sleep-disordered breathing,

**Laboratory Tests**

Lab testing is non-specific for unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis. Testing can be done to assess underlying conditions that potentially cause diaphragm paralysis, such as thyroid tests or serology for Borrelia burgdorferi in suspected Lyme disease. Other tests, such as a complete blood count, may be considered part of the initial workup to rule out anemia as a potential cause for dyspnea.
