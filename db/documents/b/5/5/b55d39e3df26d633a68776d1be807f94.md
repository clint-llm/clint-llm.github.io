Peak expiratory flow measurement (peak flow) is a simple measure of the maximal flow rate that can be achieved during forceful expiration following full inspiration. Patients can learn the technique quickly, and the equipment necessary is affordable and widely available. Major societies and advocacy groups have published patient-facing websites with clear videos that demonstrate proper technique, which can help clinicians electing to start home measurements for their patients. This activity describes the indications of peak flow meters and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the education of patients with asthma and other lung disorders.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for use of peak flow meters.
- Review the technique of using a peak flow meter.
- Summarize the clinical relevance of peak flow meters.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for asthma patients who use peak flow meters.
