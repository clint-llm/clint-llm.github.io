Radiation therapy is frequently used in medicine as both a curative and palliative treatment modality. When cancer metastasizes to the spine, patients may experience debilitating back pain and neurologic dysfunction when there is compression of the spinal cord. Loss of sensation, muscle strength, and bowel/bladder incontinence are clinical manifestations of spinal cord compression. This activity reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients who require palliative radiotherapy to the spine.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of malignancy requiring palliative radiation therapy in the spine.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of patients who require palliative radiation therapy.
- Review the treatment options available for patients requiring palliative radiation therapy to the spine.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance palliative radiation therapy and improve outcomes.
