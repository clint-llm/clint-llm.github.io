Cestodes are flat, parasitic, hermaphroditic tapeworms with complex life cycles that infect animals, including humans. Three cestodes that cause human disease are Taenia solium (pork tapeworm), Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm), and Diphyllobothrium (fish tapeworm). This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of these tapeworm infections and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the transmission of Taenia solium, Taenia saginata, and Diphyllobothrium.
- Outline the history and physical exam findings expected in patients with Taenia solium, Taenia saginata, and Diphyllobothrium infections.
- Summarize the treatment options for Taenia solium, Taenia saginata, and Diphyllobothrium infections.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with Taenia solium, Taenia saginata, or Diphyllobothrium infections.
