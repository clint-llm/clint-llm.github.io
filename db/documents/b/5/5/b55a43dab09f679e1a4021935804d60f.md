The first dorsal compartment of the wrist is comprised of the abductor pollicis longus (APL) and extensor pollicis brevis (EPB). These tendons have a unique anatomical pathway proximally in which they cross over the second dorsal compartment tendons just proximal to the extensor retinaculum and radial styloid. The second dorsal compartment of the wrist is comprised of the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) and extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL).
