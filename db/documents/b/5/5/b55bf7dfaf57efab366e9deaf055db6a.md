The urea cycle begins in the mitochondria of hepatocytes and ends in the cytoplasm. The following reactions will be shown schematically below each described step. Note that the enzyme responsible for each respective step will not be shown but can be found in the preceding text.

**Step 1**

- The first step, which is also rate-limiting, involves the conversion of CO and ammonia into carbamoyl phosphate via the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS I). Ammonia is the source of the first amine group of urea. What is unique about this step is that CPS I requires an obligate activator, N-acetyl-glutamate (NAG). NAG arises from glutamate + acetyl-CoA via the enzyme NAG synthase, which can be upregulated by arginine. Of note, some sources may use NH and HCO+ as the initial reactants, but these are equivalent to CO+ HO + NH.

- CO+ NH+ 2ATP produces carbamoyl phosphate +2ADP + P

- Synthesis of NAG: glutamate + acetyl-CoA NAG

**Step 2**

- Carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine combine to form citrulline via ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC). Citrulline is then transported from hepatocyte mitochondria into the cytoplasm by ornithine translocase.

- Carbamoyl phosphate + ornithine citrulline

- Citrulline in mitochondria citrulline in the cytoplasm

**Step 3**

- Citrulline reacts with aspartate to form argininosuccinate. This reaction is carried out by the enzyme argininosuccinate synthetase, which requires ATP. Aspartate is the source of the second amine group on urea. Recall that aspartate results from the transamination of oxaloacetate and glutamate via aspartate transaminase, which requires vitamin B.

- Citrulline + aspartate + ATP argininosuccinate 

- Oxaloacetate + glutamate à aspartate + alpha-ketoglutarate

**Step 4**

- Argininosuccinate is converted into arginine via argininosuccinate lyase. This reaction also gives off fumarate, which is involved in the mitochondrial generation of NADH in the TCA cycle, as well as tyrosine catabolism.

- Argininosuccinate à arginine + fumarate

**Step 5**

- Arginine undergoes hydrolysis via arginase to form urea and ornithine. Take a moment to review step 2. Note that the regeneration of ornithine in step 5 is involved in step 2.

- Arginine + HO urea + ornithine
