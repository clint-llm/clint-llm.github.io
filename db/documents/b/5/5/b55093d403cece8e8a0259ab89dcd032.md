Treatment of blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome is largely symptomatic. The most important step is monitoring the evolution of gastrointestinal lesions and preventing severe bleeding. Patients may benefit from iron replacement or transfusions if iron deficiency anemia occurs from gastrointestinal bleeding. Other treatment options for vascular malformations include endoscopic sclerotherapy, band ligation, or laser photocoagulation. Resection of portions of the gastrointestinal tract may become necessary if there is significant intestinal involvement in order to prevent life-threatening gastrointestinal hemorrhage.

Pharmacologic agents have been tried with variable responses.

The patient may require evaluation by an orthopedic surgeon if they develop complications from venous malformations in the bone leading to deformation such as bowing or pathologic fractures. They will also need to be managed by a gastroenterologist, hematologist, ophthalmologist, and possibly, cardiovascular or neurosurgeon if central nervous system involvement occurs.
