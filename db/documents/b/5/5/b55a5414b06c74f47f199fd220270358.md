Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is an acute infection of the abnormal accumulation of fluid in the abdomen (ascites) without an identifiable source of infection. It can occur in adults and children, and the majority of isolated organisms being gram-negative enteric organisms (e.g., Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumonia), pointing to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract as the main source of infection. This activity reviews the diagnosis and management of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the causes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
- Review the presentation of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
- Summarize the treatment options for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to regularly monitor the patient's response to treatment in order to ensure the proper delivery of care for those with this condition.
