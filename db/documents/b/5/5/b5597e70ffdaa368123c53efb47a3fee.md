The process of auditory transduction begins with sound waves entering the external acoustic meatus and striking the tympanic membrane, resulting in vibration. These vibrations are then transferred to the middle ear along the ossicular chain of the malleus, incus, and stapes. The footplate of the stapes contacts the oval window in a piston-like motion that transmits vibration to perilymph within the cochlea. The vibrations then travel up the cochlea to the apex through a hollow bony tube called the scala vestibuli and then from the apex to the base of the cochlea through another hollow, bony tube called the scala tympani.

At the end of the scala tympani, the vibrations within the perilymph displace the round window. The cochlear duct lies between the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani. This hollow, bony tube contains endolymph, which has a higher positive potential than the surrounding perilymph. This positive potential results from high potassium and low sodium ions concentrations compared to the surrounding perilymph.

The organ of Corti contains hair cells that respond to vibration by brushing their stereocilia against a fixed structure called the tectorial membrane. The result of the hair cells bending against the tectorial membrane is the depolarization of the attached nerve fibers. The frequency of the vibration traveling through the perilymph will correspond to an area along the BM of the cochlea that is maximally stimulated. The BM of the cochlea is not uniform in its width or stiffness. At the base of the cochlea, the BM is more narrow and stiff, while at the apex of the cochlea, the BM is wider and more flexible. Additionally, the further away from the base of the cochlea, the elasticity of the BM decreases; the BM is most elastic at the apex of the cochlea.

This non-uniformity of the BM creates a tonotopic map and enables humans to hear different sound frequencies. For example, an auditory vibration will stimulate a specific location on the BM, depending on the sound frequency. The highest frequencies will be registered at the base of the cochlea, while the lower frequencies will be registered at the apex.
