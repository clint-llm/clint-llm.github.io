Toxicity is often dose-dependent and can manifest with cardiovascular, metabolic, central nervous, and hepatic instability and damage. Symptoms of overdose include initial GI upset that slowly develops to acute metabolic encephalopathy, seizures, tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, arrhythmia, hypoxia. Amounts up to  20 mg/kg of elemental iron is usually well-tolerated, but may have mild GI symptoms.  Amounts between 20 to 60 mg/kg is mild to moderately toxic, and over 60 mg/kg can cause severe symptoms and morbidity due to circulatory collapse.

Accidental iron ingestion in children under the age of 6 has been a leading case of fatal poisoning.

Iron overdose can have therapy using gastric lavage with an iron chelator such as deferoxamine or GI decontamination procedures such as lavage solutions and whole-bowel irrigation.
