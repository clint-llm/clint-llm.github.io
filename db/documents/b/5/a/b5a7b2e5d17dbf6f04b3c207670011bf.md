Contraindications to central line placement may vary based on the site chosen to cannulate. Common contraindications to central line placement are:

- Coagulopathy (anticoagulated status, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or other inherited or acquired coagulopathies)

- Placement at noncompressible sites is relatively contraindicated, due to the risk of hemorrhage especially in patients with coagulopathies and high risk of hemorrhage. However, in a large retrospective study, there was no increased predictability of bleeding in patients with underlying coagulopathy, and there was no decrease in bleeding complications in those patients receiving platelets or fresh frozen plasma (FFP) prior to line placement in these cases.

- Infection at the insertion site (cellulitis, abscess)

- History of surgical manipulation or trauma at the insertion site

- Trauma to other structures (e.g. cervical spine collar is a soft contraindication to an IJ central venous catheter (CVC) placement, a pelvic binder is a contraindication to a femoral CVC placement)
