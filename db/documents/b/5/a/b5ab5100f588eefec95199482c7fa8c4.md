Before any biopsy, the patientâ€™s previous imaging should be reviewed. At that time, a tentative plan is developed with an emphasis on patient positioning, the shortest distance from skin to the lesion, and the identification of important structures such as blood vessels and breast implants. Traditionally US-guided breast biopsies are performed with the patient lying supine to slightly anterior oblique on an examination table. To reduce shifting of tissue due to gravity, the side to be evaluated is elevated, and the ipsilateral arm flexed over or under the head (right breast right side is anterior oblique, and the right arm is positioned over the head).
