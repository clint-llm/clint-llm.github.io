The clotting cascade is a complex process involving multiple factors acting in three defined phases: initiation, propagation, and fibrin formation.

- Initiation: This step occurs when the vascular endothelium and the clotting factors are disturbed.

- Propagation: This step involves the production of large amounts of thrombin at the site of injury.

- Fibrin Formation: Thrombin acts on fibrinogen to form fibrin.

The coagulation proteins form the basic components of the coagulation system. They lead to a complex interplay of reactions resulting in converting plasma-soluble fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin strands. There are two main pathways to the clotting cascade: the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. External trauma activates the extrinsic pathway and causes blood loss from the vascular system, and it is faster than the intrinsic pathway and involves factor VII. Trauma inside the vascular system activates platelets via exposed endothelium, chemicals, or collagen, which can initiate the intrinsic pathway. It involves factors XII, XI, IX, and VIII. Both pathways share a common ending where they activate factor X to Xa, which activates prothrombin (II) to thrombin (IIa), thereby forming a stable clot.

Apixaban is a highly selective direct factor Xa inhibitor, blocking the propagation phase of the coagulation cascade. It exerts its effect on both free and clot-bound factor Xa. For antithrombotic activity, it does not need antithrombin III. Factor Xa is a catalyst for the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, which is the final step in the coagulation cascade leading to fibrin and clot formation.

Apixaban exerts no effect on platelet aggregation.
