**Pregnancy**

- There is inadequate data on the fetal risk associated with ocrelizumab use in pregnancy.

- Ocrelizumab is an antibody of immunoglobulin G1 subtype, which is known to cross the placental barrier.

- Administration of ocrelizumab to pregnant monkeys at 2 to 10 times the recommended human dose has shown increased perinatal mortality and depletion of B-cell populations. Offspring were observed to have bone marrow, renal, and testicular toxicities not seen in the mother.

- While data on ocrelizumab exposure during pregnancy is sparse, rituximab use (as a proxy) has shown B-cell depletion in delivered babies.

**Other**

- No data shows the existence of ocrelizumab in human milk; animal studies have shown its presence in monkey milk. However, large molecules like monoclonal antibodies are unlikely to be excreted into human breast milk or absorbed into the baby’s circulation in any significant amount.

- Ocrelizumab’s safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients.

- Ocrelizumab’s safety and efficacy have not been established in patients over 65 years old.

- In clinical studies of ocrelizumab, there were six cases of breast cancer as compared to none in the placebo or interferon beta-1a groups.
