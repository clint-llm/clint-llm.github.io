The following qualities define an ideal occlusion: class I molar and canine classification, 1- to 2-mm overjet, 1- to 2-mm overbite, slight to no crowding, and protective guidance movements. Furthermore, the incisal edges and buccal cusps of the teeth in the mandibular arch should align to form a smooth curve.

Likewise, the smooth curve in the maxilla encompasses the central fossae of posterior teeth and the cingulum of the canines and incisors. Other ideal qualities include alignment of the maxillary and mandibular midlines with each other and the face. Angle class I is seen in around 60% of the affected population and is the most commonly seen molar relationship.

Depending on the case, symptoms of malocclusion can vary from mild to severe. Notable signs of malocclusion include misaligned teeth, speech problems, decreased masticatory function and efficiency, alteration from nasal to mouth breathing, and changes in facial structure.
