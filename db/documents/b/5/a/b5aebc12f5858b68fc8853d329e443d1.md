Gardnerella is a common genital infection that is often encountered by the emergency department physician, nurse practitioner, internist, and the gynecologist.  Asymptomatic Gardnerella colonization does not need to be treated as nearly 30% of cases resolve spontaneously. All symptomatic patients need treatment but despite treatment, recurrences are common.

Untreated BV can lead to increased risk of pregnancy complications and STIs, including HIV.

These patients need to be followed by the nurse practitioner until all symptoms have disappeared.

Even though BV is not a sexually transmitted infection, the nurse practitioner should educate the patient on the importance of safe sex measures, avoidance of multiple sex partners and use of barrier protection.
