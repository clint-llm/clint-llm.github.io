The mechanism of action of enflurane and other halogenated inhaled anesthetics is still poorly understood. The hypothesis is that these agents act on different ion channels within the nervous system by blocking excitatory channels and augmenting inhibitory channels. In particular, volatile anesthetics can depress ventral horn neurons, causing immobilization. For enflurane, 30% of depressant effects on the spinal cord are mediated by theÂ gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA-A) receptor, and glycine receptors mediate 20 % of the effects.
