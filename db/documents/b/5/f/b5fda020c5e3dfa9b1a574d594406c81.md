Patients describe difficulty opening the eyes voluntarily and feeling persistent periorbital contractions. Most of the time, it occurs after the patient voluntarily closes the eyes. Patients show compensatory behaviors, which may include thrusting the head backward, manually opening the eyes with their fingers, and rubbing the eyebrows.

It is crucial to ascertain the historical progression of symptoms. A thorough past medical and ocular history may reveal risk factors associated with the condition. A focal ocular exam is essential, including visual acuity and field testing, ocular pressure testing, pupillary reflexes, extraocular movements, dilated fundoscopic examination, and slit-lamp examination. The examination can help narrow the etiology of the symptoms.

An external evaluation of the eyelids and facial muscles is essential to assess eyebrow and eyelid ptosis, dermatochalasis, and spasms of theÂ orbicularis oculi, procerus, and corrugator muscles. Assessing mental status, language skills, and other cranial exams may be useful if central causes are suspected.
