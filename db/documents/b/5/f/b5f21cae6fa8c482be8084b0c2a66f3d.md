The human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) is an enveloped, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the family of Paramyxoviridae. HPIV can cause both upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in children, usually under the age of 5, immunocompromised adults, and the elderly. It is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in infants worldwide. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of parainfluenza virus infection and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of parainfluenza virus infection.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation of parainfluenza virus infection.
- Review the management options available for parainfluenza virus infection.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of parainfluenza virus infection and improve outcomes.
