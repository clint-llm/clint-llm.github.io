Review of symptoms and physical examination and serum tumor markers should be assessed every 2% to 4% for the first two years and then every six months thereafter. Routine imaging studies are not recommended in postoperative surveillance unless directed by the onset of symptoms suggestive of recurrence. GCT tends to late recurrence, and once the tumor recurs, it is fatal in 80 percent of cases.

There is a paucity of high-quality data on the optimal management of the recurrent disease. If the recurrent disease is resectable, few case series have reported a survival advantage for salvage surgery followed by platinum-based chemotherapy.
