The thigh region is essential to the proper postural stability and locomotion of humans and is also a key conduit for neurovascular structures that pass from the abdomen to the lower limbs. The thigh muscles are divided into groups based on location â€“ the anterior, medial, and posterior compartments - each affording the lower limb different functional movements. Understanding the main function of each group of muscles and the unique properties of muscles within a group will help identify different disorders based on the physical examination and patient history.
