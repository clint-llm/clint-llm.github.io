Olfaction is the chemical sensation of gaseous odorants colloquially referred to as the ability to smell. The olfactory nerve (cranial nerve one) in coordination with other neuroanatomical structures in the nasal passages, neurotransmitters, and the cerebral cortex is responsible for carrying out this intricate chemosensory process. In humans, olfaction closely couples to other complex functions such as gustation (taste) and involuntary memory formation.
