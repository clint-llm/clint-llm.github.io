The two variants of the orexin molecule (orexin A and orexin B) play an important role in the human sleep-wake cycles. Orexin A acts nonselectively to both the orexin-1 receptor (OX1R) and orexin-2 receptors (OX2R), while Orexin B acts more selectively on OX2R.

The wakefulness effects of orexins agonizing OX1R and OX2R are widely accepted and consistently supported in animal models. Additionally, the inhibition of both the OX1R and OX2R has demonstrated sedative characteristics in both human and animal models. Unlike most current medications used to treat insomnia, which act on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor, lemborexant presents a unique mechanism of action.

It has been proposed that taking advantage of this unique mechanism may come with fewer side effects than more commonly prescribed drugs to treat insomnia, such as benzodiazepines. Current medications used to treat insomnia include benzodiazepines and "z-drugs," which act on the GABA receptor, antihistamines that disrupt the wakeful effects of histamine, and trazodone, which exerts its effects on both the serotonergic system and histamine receptors. Benzodiazepines present with a high potential for misuse and physical and psychological dependence.
