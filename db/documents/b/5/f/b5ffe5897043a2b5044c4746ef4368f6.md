Skin biopsy should be done to include the border of the lesion. A column of parakeratotic cells is seen correlating to the raised border. This column is called the cornoid lamella. The granular layer underneath this column can be thin or not present. There is also dyskeratosis in the epidermis under the cornoid lamella. Spongiosis can be present.
