Epigenetics is the study of making chemical modifications to DNA. Our DNA has a determined nucleotide sequence that cannot be changed. However, this genetic code can undergo chemical modification through epigenetic mechanisms. DNA strands wrap around proteins called **histones**, which are composed into structures called**nucleosomes**. There are four types of histones, named: H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Octomers of two of each type of histone form nucleosomes. These nucleosomes are wrapped together in a spiral structure called a solenoid. Additional H1 proteins are associated with each nucleosome as links to maintain the overall chromatin structure. There are two states of chromatin:**euchromatin**, which is open and amenable to transcription, and**heterochromatin**, which is a compact DNA-protein structure that cannot be transcribed. Chemical modifications to these histones result in the conversion of DNA from its euchromatin state to its heterochromatin state and vice versa.
