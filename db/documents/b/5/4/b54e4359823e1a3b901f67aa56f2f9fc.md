Obtaining a thoroughÂ history is important, but the questioning should show empathy to the patient and their condition.

Communicating the patient's medical history to other medical professionals is important and can have significant implications in preventing medical errors. When recording the patient's medical history in the chart, accuracy may reduce medical errors or improper diagnoses. An accurate medical history will cross through all aspects of the interprofessional team involved in the care of the patient.
