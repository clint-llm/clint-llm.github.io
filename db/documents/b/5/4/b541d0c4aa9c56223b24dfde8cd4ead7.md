Patients with granuloma annulare may present to their primary care provider, internist, or dermatologist. The key thing to know is that this skin lesion is benign and can spontaneously regress.

Unfortunately, despite the availability of dozens of treatments, none works with any reliability or consistency; recurrences are common with all treatments.
