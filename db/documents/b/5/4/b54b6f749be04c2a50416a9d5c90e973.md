Aducanumab is an immunotherapeutic classified as a human immunoglobulin gamma 1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody. It exerts its mechanism of action by crossing the blood-brain barrier and selectively targeting and binding aggregated soluble oligomers and insoluble fibril conformations of Aβ plaques in the brain.

Biochemical and structural analyses showed that the aducanumab binds to a linear epitope formed by Aβ amino acids 3 to 7.

The greater selectivity of aducanumab for aggregated Aβ forms results in reducing the brain Aβ plaques**.**
