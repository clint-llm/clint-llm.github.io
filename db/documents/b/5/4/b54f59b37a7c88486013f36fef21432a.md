The most common cause of contrast-induced nephropathy is pre-existing chronic kidney disease. About 8% of patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 45 ml/min/1.73m2 to 60 ml/min/1.73m2, 13% of the patients with eGFR between 30 ml/min/1.73m2 to 45 ml/min/1.73m2, and 27% of patients with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 30 ml/min/1.73m2 develop contrast-induced nephropathy following contrast exposure.

Contrast media (CM) affect distinct anatomic sites in the kidney and manifest adverse effects via several mechanisms. They exert Four cardinal effects:

- A direct cytotoxic effect on the proximal tubules of the kidney

- Enhance cellular damage via reactive oxygen species

- Increase resistance to blood flow in the kidney

- Exacerbate renal vasoconstriction, particularly in the medulla which is especially important in patients with chronic kidney disease

There are several risk predictor models available to predict contrast-induced nephropathy risk before the procedure and the use of preventive measures. Gurm and colleagues used a cohort of over 68,000 percutaneous coronary intervention procedures to develop an online calculator risk predictor (http://bmc2.org/calculators/cin).

Similarly, the Roxana Mehran score predictor applies the following ten variables:

5 points

3 points

A risk score of less than 6 carries a risk of 7.5% and more than 16 carries up to 57% risk.
