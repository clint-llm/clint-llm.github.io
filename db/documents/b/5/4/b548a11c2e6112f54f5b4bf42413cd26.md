- Every case of AC should prompt an investigation for oral candidiasis. A finding of oral candidiasis should prompt an investigation for diabetes or immunosuppression including, but not limited to, steroid use.

- Do not use topical steroid monotherapy without excluding infectious AC.

- Unilateral AC may be due to local trauma, herpetic lesions, or syphilitic papule. Cases that do not respond to treatment may also be a manifestation of malignancy.
