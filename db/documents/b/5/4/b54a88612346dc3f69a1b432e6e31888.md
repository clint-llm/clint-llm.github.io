Ethacrynic acid is contraindicated in patients already receiving treatment with other ototoxic drugs such as cisplatin or gentamycin. When taken alone, ototoxic drugs like gentamycin have a relatively low uptake into the cochlea, explaining why they rarely cause hearing loss. However, when taken with high doses of ethacrynic acid, permanent hearing loss can be observed. This effect appears to be caused by ethacrynic acid's effect on cochlear tight junctions. Damage to these tight junctions leads to increased permeability and a weakened blood-cochlear barrier allowing entry of ototoxic drugs.
