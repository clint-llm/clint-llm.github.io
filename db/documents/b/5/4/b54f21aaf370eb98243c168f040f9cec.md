Cleft hand, otherwise referred to as ectrodactyly or colloquially as "split hand," is defined as a central longitudinal deficiency expressed as suppression of bone and soft tissues in the central elements of the hand, including the index, middle, and ring fingers. This activity reviews the presentation, pathogenesis, and management of patients presenting with cleft hand deformities. It examines the complications and briefly explores the impact of the disorder on patients and highlights the importance of an interdisciplinary approach to treat these individuals appropriately.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of cleft hand deformities.
- Describe the common presentation of cleft hand deformities.
- Outline the pathogenesis of cleft hand deformities.
- Review the importance of the interprofessional team in optimizing the management of cleft hand deformities.
