Various muscles are innervated by cranial nerves that exit the cranium via the jugular foramen.

Cranial nerve IX innervates the stylopharyngeus muscle, which plays a role in elevating the larynx, and pharynx, and helps to dilate the pharynx to assist with swallowing.

Cranial nerve X plays a significant role in controlling the heart rate via parasympathetic innervation. Additionally, the nerve has inputs in the intestinal musculature to assist with peristalsis and digestion.

Cranial nerve XI, appropriately named spinal accessory nerve, innervates the trapezius and the sternocleidomastoid muscles. The trapezius has many actions, including shoulder shrugging, neck movement, and overall stabilization of the scapula. The sternocleidomastoid primarily acts to rotate the head to the opposite side and flexion of the neck.
