CMV infection is frequently asymptomatic in immunocompetent patients. Immunocompromised patients may present with symptoms, but clinical presentation alone is not specific. Symptoms, if present, are usually non-specific and include diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, malaise, rectal bleeding, and weight loss. However, hematochezia and diarrhea are the most frequent symptoms observed in confirmed cases of CMV colitis. The symptoms tend to mimic inflammatory bowel disease exacerbation, and it is difficult to distinguish between ulcerative colitis from CMV colitis based on clinical presentation alone.
