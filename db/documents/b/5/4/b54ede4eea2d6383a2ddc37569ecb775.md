Primary iron overload is often inherited. Hereditary hemochromatosis is the leading case of iron overload disease. In 1996, 2 gene mutations (C282Y and H63D) of the HFE gene were discovered and linked to primary iron overload. The most common is C282Y. The introduction of excess iron into the body causes secondary iron overload. This occurs most commonly through blood transfusion but also can be due to hemolysis or excessive parenteral and/or dietary consumption.
