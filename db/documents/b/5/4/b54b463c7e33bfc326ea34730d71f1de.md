Beta-blockers, as a class of drugs, are primarily used to treat cardiovascular diseases and other conditions. Beta-blockers are indicated and have FDA approval for the treatment of tachycardia, hypertension, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, hyperthyroidism, essential tremor, aortic dissection, portal hypertension, glaucoma, migraine prophylaxis, and other conditions. They are also used to treat less common conditions such as long QT syndrome and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, safe administration, adverse effects, contraindications, toxicology, and monitoring of the broad array of physiological possibilities when using beta-blockers in the clinical setting.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the mechanism of action of the beta-blocker class of medications, including the difference between selective and non-selective agents.
- Identify the indications for beta-blocker therapy.
- Review the adverse events, contraindications, toxicities, and interactions of beta-blockers.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients using beta-blockers for indicated conditions.
