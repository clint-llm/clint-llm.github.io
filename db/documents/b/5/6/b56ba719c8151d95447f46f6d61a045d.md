In the United States, the rubella vaccine is available only in a combined preparation. Current vaccines include measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) without or with varicella (MMRV). Single antigen (i.e., monovalent) formulations of the rubella vaccine are not available in the United States but are available in some other countries.

- MMR combination vaccine: MMR contains live attenuated measles, mumps, and rubella viruses. It is licensed for routine use in individuals >12 months of age and for infants >6 months of age who are traveling internationally.

- MMRV combination vaccine: MMRV is a vaccine that includes live attenuated measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella viruses. It is licensed for use in children 12 months through 12 years.

The dose of MMR is 0.5 mL. MMR is administered subcutaneously with a 5/8 inch (1.6cm), 23 to 25 gauge needle. The site of administration of individuals >12 months of age is usually the upper outer triceps. Doses administered intramuscularly do not need to be repeated; immunogenicity appears similar in intramuscular and subcutaneous administration.

In the United States, routine immunization with MMR vaccine is recommended for children at 12 to 15 months and 4 through 6 years of age.
