Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are a separate class from other antidepressants, treating different forms of depression and other nervous system disorders such as panic disorder, social phobia, and depression with atypical features. Even though MAOIs were the first antidepressants introduced, they are not the first choice in treating mental health disorders due to several dietary restrictions, side effects, and safety concerns. MAOIs are only a treatment option when all other medications are unsuccessful. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, pharmacology, monitoring, and relevant interactions of MAOIs, pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in treating patients with conditions where this drug class has a therapeutic purpose.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the mechanisms of actions of the MAOI class of drugs.
- Identify the approved and off-label indications for MAOI therapy.
- Review the adverse event profile of MAOIs.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes and treatment efficacy for patients who might benefit from MAOI therapy.
