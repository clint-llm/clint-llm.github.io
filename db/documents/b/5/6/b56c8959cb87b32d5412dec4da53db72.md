Tourette syndrome, also referred to as Tourette disorder, is a common neurodevelopmental disorder affecting up to 1 percent of the population. It is characterized by multiple motor and vocal tics that begin in childhood. Children with Tourette syndrome may have additional comorbid neuropsychiatric conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). The prognosis for Tourette syndrome is generally positive, as tics typically remit by adulthood, but other neuropsychiatric conditions may persist. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients with Tourette syndrome and other tic disorders and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Tourette syndrome. 
- Describe the population at risk for developing Tourette syndrome. 
- Explain the management strategies for Tourette syndrome.
- Explain the importance of improving coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by Tourette syndrome.
