The prognosis of diabetic retinopathy depends on the duration of diabetes, glycemic control, associated comorbid conditions, and patient compliance to the appropriate line of treatment.

OCT biomarkers of prognosis of diabetic retinopathy include refractile bodies, disorganization of inner layers of the retina (DRIL), disruption of outer layers of the retina (DORL), choroidal thickness, epiretinal membrane, vitreomacular adhesions, subretinal fluid, macular thickness, and integrity of ellipsoid zone.
