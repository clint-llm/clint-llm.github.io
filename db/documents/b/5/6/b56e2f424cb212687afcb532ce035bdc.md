Differential diagnosis may include any of the aforementioned disease processes. However, the presence of POI within each disease is not absolute. In patients with primary amenorrhea, it is necessary to differentiate between chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., Turner syndrome) or Mullerian anomalies (e.g., Mullerian agenesis, imperforate hymen). In women with secondary amenorrhea, it is imperative for pregnancy to be ruled out as the underlying etiology. Nutritional status and activity level must be evaluated to exclude the possibility of functional hypothalamic dysfunction causing menstrual irregularity. Endocrine abnormalities such as hyper- or hypothyroidism, prolactinoma, diabetes mellitus, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia may be the underlying mechanism of infertility rather than POI. Autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, or Addison disease can be present without evidence of POI. The polycystic ovarian syndrome may be the etiology of menstrual irregularity and anovulation leading to infertility. Early menopause may be considered in a small subset of the female population greater than 40 years of age but less than 45 years of age.
