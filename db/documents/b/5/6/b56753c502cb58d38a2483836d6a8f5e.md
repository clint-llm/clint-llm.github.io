Erythromycin has traditionally been used for various respiratory infections (i.e., community-acquired pneumonia, Legionnaires disease), prophylaxis of neonatal conjunctivitis, and chlamydia. It is also FDA-approved for treating skin infections, intestinal amebiasis, rheumatic fever, prophylaxis, syphilis, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). In addition, if mixed with tretinoin cream or benzoyl peroxide, it is effective for treating acne. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, pharmacology, monitoring, and relevant interactions of erythromycin, other key factors (e.g., dosing, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the treatment of patients with infections and other conditions where this agent is indicated.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of antibacterial action for erythromycin.
- Outline the infectious and non-infectious indications for erythromycin.
- Review the potential adverse events associated with erythromycin.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients when using erythromycin.
