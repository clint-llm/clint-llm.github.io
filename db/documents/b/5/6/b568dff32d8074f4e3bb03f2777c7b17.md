Cetuximab is an inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) utilized for the treatment of several malignancies. Its administration and management require the effort of an interprofessional healthcare team. The drug is usually administered only by the oncologist, but a board-certified oncology pharmacist should play a role in dosing, administration, scheduling, and educating the patient on the potential adverse effects. Also, oncology nurses should be aware of the possible complications that can occur during the infusion and report these to the oncologist when encountered.

The team should monitor vital signs during infusion and observe the patient for at least 1-hour post-infusion. Patients developing dermatologic toxicities should be monitored for the development of complications. It is recommended to continue periodic monitoring of serum magnesium, calcium, and potassium over an interval consistent with the half-life (8 weeks); monitor closely (during and after treatment) for cetuximab plus radiation therapy, and obtain KRASÂ genotyping of tumor tissue in patients with colorectal cancer.

This type of interprofessional team approach is necessary to achieve optimal patient outcomes with cetuximab therapy. [Level 5]
