Impetigo is usually managed by an interprofessional team that consists of a nurse practitioner, primary care provider, pediatrician, and a dermatologist. Topical antibiotics alone or in conjunction with systemic antibiotics are used to treat impetigo. Antibiotic coverage should cover both S aureus and S pyogenes (i.e. GABHS). While untreated impetigo is often self-limiting, antibiotics decrease the duration of illness and spread of lesions. In addition, antibiotic treatment decreases the chances of complications involving kidneys, joints, bones, and lungs, as well as acute rheumatic fever.

The infectious disease should educate the patient to refrain from touching the skin lesions and the importance of handwashing. Because the infection is contagious, the school nurse should recommend that the child not return to daycare os school for at least 24-48 hours after starting antibiotic therapy.

In areas of a high prevalence of MRSA  or if cultures are positive for MRSA, clindamycin or doxycycline are the preferred treatments. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is effective against MRSA, but should only be used if group A streptococci are not the causative agent, or in addition to an anti-streptococcal antibiotic.
