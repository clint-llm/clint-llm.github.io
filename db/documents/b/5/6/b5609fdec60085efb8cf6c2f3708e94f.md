As summarized above, a legacy of injustice and discrimination has shaped contemporary health and social disparities. The significant historical loss and trauma experienced by some AIAN communities has led to intergenerational harm and may account for the disproportionate prevalence of numerous health conditions and higher mortality rates among AIANs.

**Morbidity Disparity Rates**

Health disparities emerge for AIANs beginning from early childhood. Overall, there’s a greater prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders among AIAN children when compared to children in the general U.S. population.****They are also twice as likely to be overweight, three times as likely to be obese, and three times more likely to have untreated dental decay.

Compared to the general U.S. population, AIAN adults are more likely to experience alcohol dependence and substance use disorder and twice as likely to experience posttraumatic stress disorder.

**Mortality Disparity Rates**

Disparities in mortality rates emerge in infancy and continue throughout development for AIAN populations. Rates of inadequate prenatal care and post-natal death are more than two times higher for AIAN infants than the general U.S. infant population.****AIAN infants are more likely to die from sudden infant death syndrome, pneumonia and influenza, accidents, and homicide.

There are devastatingly high death rates among AIAN adults as well. Compared to the general U.S. population, AIAN adults continue to die at higher rates from several conditions.

- Heart disease

- Accidents/ unintentional injuries (ex. motor vehicle injuries)

- Diabetes mellitus

- Alcohol consumption

- Chronic lower respiratory disease

- Cerebrovascular disease (stroke)

- Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis

- Influenza and pneumonia

- Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome

- Intentional self-harm/ suicide

- Septicemia

- Assault (homicide)

- Essential hypertension diseases

**Clinical Implications of Significant Health Disparities**

These massive health disparities demonstrate a public health crisis that must be attended to urgently. Clinicians should consider several issues when serving AIAN populations to evaluate and treat their patients effectively. First, they should keep in mind the social, political, and economic factors that contribute to disparities in social determinants of health in AIAN communities. They should also consider the historical and contemporary stressors that impact AIANs. Next, they should practice cultural humility and reflect on their own biases and beliefs while actively learning about their patients’ cultural and individual attitudes towards health and illness. Finally, providers should incorporate each AIAN patient's unique personal and cultural strengths to develop context-specific interventions.
