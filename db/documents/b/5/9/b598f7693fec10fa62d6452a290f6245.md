Single ventricle physiology is a term used to describe the group of congenital heart defects with one functioning ventricle. There is a mixing of the systemic and pulmonary venous blood, and then mixed blood is distributed to both systemic and pulmonary circulation from the single functional ventricle. Hypoxemia may ensue from birth when the parallel circulation of the fetus starts transitioning to the series circulation of the adult. Some conditions may even need immediate medical and surgical management to sustain life. The repair in these cases is focused on the gradual transition of the parallel circulation into series circulation. It can be achieved either by a series of palliative surgical procedures with a single functioning ventricle or by restoring two ventricle physiology. This activity summarizes different conditions that present as the single ventricle physiology and their anesthetic management by the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify conditions presenting as single ventricle physiology.
- Describe the physiology of single ventricle lesions.
- Review various factors that alter single ventricle physiology.
- Outline perioperative management of single ventricle lesions.
