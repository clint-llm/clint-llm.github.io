Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is an enzyme found in the cytoplasm of all cells in the body. It is a housekeeping enzyme that plays a vital role in the prevention of cellular damage from reactive oxygen species. It does this by providing substrates to prevent oxidative damage. Erythrocytes are particularly vulnerable to ROS due to their role in oxygen transport and the inability to replace cellular proteins as mature cells. Inherited deficiencies of glucose-6- phosphate Dehydrogenase can result in acute hemolytic anemia during times of increased reactive oxygen species production. In particular, anti-malarial agents have a strong association with inducing hemolytic anemia in patients with Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. This activity outlines the causes of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the medications associated with glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. 
- Describe the pathophysiology of glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. 
- Outline the treatment and management options for a patient with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. 
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and improve patient outcomes.
