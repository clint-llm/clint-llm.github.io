As with any biochemical pathway, there are numerous steps that are carefully executed and are tightly regulate and controlled. However, with many steps in processing collagen, there can be genetic mutations which can lead to errors in assembly, posttranslational modification or nutritional deficiencies which can affect enzymatic function. Some examples include:

Osteogenesis imperfecta which is an autosomal dominant disorder of type 1 collagen, which can present with a spectrum of findings from mild to lethal. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome which is also an inherited collagen disorder with at least 6 different subtypes with different mutations of different collagen types. Lastly, Vitamin C deficiency is a nutritional deficiency which leads to altered hydroxylase enzyme function which requires Vitamin C as a cofactor.
