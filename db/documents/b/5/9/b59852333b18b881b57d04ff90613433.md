Sleeping difficulty is a common complaint encountered in clinical practice. With many causes, the condition is best managed by a multidisicplinary team that includes a pharmacist, nurse practitioner, neruologist, psychiatrist, primary care provider, psychotherapist and an internist.

Proper sleep is essential to maintain health and optimize overall functioning during wakefulness. Sleeplessness has been linked with several health problems from including diabetes, obesity, and heart disease. Sleeplessness also leads to decreased work performance, traffic accidents, mood and relationship problems, and countless other issues.

Simply prescribing sedatives and hypnotics is not the answer and healthcare workers address the cause and manage it. Unfortunately, chronic sleep disorders cannot be cured in most cases and often lead to a poor quality of life.
