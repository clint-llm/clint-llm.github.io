Any fluid that leaks from one or both nipples of a non-pregnant and non-breastfeeding breast is referred to as nipple discharge. Nipple discharge is a complex diagnostic challenge for the clinician as it can occur normally or be a manifestation of a wide variety of diseases. Each human breast has 15 to 20 milk ducts. Nipple discharge can originate from one or more of these milk ducts.

The most important consideration in a patient with nipple discharge for both the patient and the physician is the possible association of this condition with underlying breast cancer. With the increased public awareness of breast cancer, an increasing number of women are asking their health care providers about nipple discharge. Thus, a clinician must be aware and knowledgeable in evaluating nipple discharge. Nipple discharge is not an uncommon complaint in the emergency department and can be benign (physiologic discharge) or a sign of a pathologic process.

Nipple discharge is normal during the last few weeks of pregnancy, after childbirth, and during the breastfeeding period. It can also be normal in women who are not pregnant and are not breastfeeding, especially during reproductive years. Certain manipulations of the breasts, such as fondling, sucking, or massagingÂ can stimulate milk ducts to secrete fluid. Stress also has been shown to cause nipple discharge.
