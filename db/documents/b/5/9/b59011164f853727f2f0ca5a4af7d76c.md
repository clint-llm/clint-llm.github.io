Previously, the prognosis and clinical outcome of telangiectatic osteosarcoma were considered to be poor. However, with the advent of chemotherapy, the prognosis has significantly improved, with around a 60% survival rate at ten years, which is similar to that of conventional osteosarcoma.

Colomina et al. reported the outcome of 8 patients with telangiectatic osteosarcoma with pathologic fractures. They described that the presence of a pathologic fracture did not worsen the outcome and had similar survival and recurrence rates.
