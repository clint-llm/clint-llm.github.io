Penetrating keratoplasty is the treatment of choice for LCD once visual symptoms progress to the point that surgical intervention is warranted. Transplant is not usually necessary before the fourth decade, although it may be required as early as the second decade of life. The prognosis after PK is excellent; however, recurrence is quite common with amyloid deposits forming in the grafted cornea anywhere from 2to 14 years after transplant.

Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) has similar outcomes to PK. With recent advances in operative techniques and equipment, some studies now show that DALK may have better visual outcomes and lower risks of graft rejection. Because of these advantages, DALK is now considered first-line therapy for LCD in addition to PK.

Phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) may also be used to improve vision.

- PTK can be used to delay the necessity of corneal grafting.

- PTK can be used to treat the recurrence of lattice changes after corneal grafting. Recurrent opacities after grafting are often more superficial and within reach of PTK. Removing these opacities can delay or prevent the need for regrafting.

- PTK is especially useful for epithelial erosions, which have a significant impact on visual acuity. Both the erosions and any associated opacifications are easily removed, being superficial and, therefore, easily within reach of PTK.

- Childhood corneal dystrophy, particularly concerning due to the risk of amblyopia, is another indication for PTK. Corneal grafting is less successful in the very young, and PTK is well adapted to treating the early opacifications seen in this age. PTK also provides rapid visual improvement, particularly important in the avoidance of amblyopia.

Recurrence is frequent, with the average recurrence occurring 9-10 years after the procedure.

Femtosecond laser-assisted lamellar keratectomy (FLK) removes a section of the anterior cornea, as does PTK. However, FLK can proceed to a greater depth than PTK (20% to 30% of corneal thickness).Â Because of this, FLK may be another second-line therapy in LCD when treating the anterior to middle depth of the cornea. OCT can accurately map the corneal deposits, and with the precision afforded by FLK, the deposits can be carefully resected with minimal damage to healthy structures. This results in fewer intraoperative and perioperative complications and is free of the risks of graft rejection, as seen in first-line therapies. While it is capable of removing opacifications deeper than PTK can reach, it remains limited to anterior disease and is often used as a temporizing measure. Eyes treated with FLK will most likely need eventual treatment with PK or DALK. Like PTK, FLK is particularly useful in young patients and recurrent LCD after a corneal graft. FLK is not as useful in patients with deep pathology or with notable corneal thinning in the area of the pathology. In one study, mild recurrence was seen at around two years of follow up.

Femtosecond laser-assisted lamellar keratoplasty (FALK) is another modality that may be used to treat LCD. This method precisely removes diseased tissue via femtosecond laser, followed by the replacement of removed tissue with grafted corneal explant. The cornea is carefully mapped prior to the procedure via OCT, allowing for extreme precision. This process allows for increased depth (up to 500 um, as compared to less than 200 um in FLK) without dangerously thinning the cornea. It is similar to DALK, but with the femtosecond laser, there are the advantages of additional precision.

A note on the recurrence rate: Data is currently inadequate on the relative rates of recurrence in the various treatment modalities due to varying definitions of recurrence and often insufficient follow-up. In comparing the different treatment modalities, it can be assumed that recurrence is likely with any treatment due to the reaccumulation of amyloid after 5 to 10 years.

Other temporizing measures may be employed to delay the necessity of long-term treatments. These include corneal scraping, diamond burr polishing, topical antibiotic use, bandage contact lenses, and topical steroids. While none of these are curative, they may temporarily give some improvement in vision and allow for the delay of more invasive surgical treatments.

Treatment of type II LCD is broader due to the systemic nature of the disease. The corneal dystrophy itself is also treated with penetrating keratoplasty or PTK as above with excellent results. The dry eye symptoms are treated with topical lubricants, hydrophilic contact lenses, and lacrimal duct plugs. Symptoms related to increased skin laxity, including ectropion and deficient eyelid closure, can be treated with oculoplastic surgery to minimize symptoms.

Gene therapies are also under development and may soon be the mainstay of treatment for corneal dystrophies. Significant progress has been made in identifying specific mutations associated with LCD. Because of this progress, therapies targeted at these specific mutations are becoming more feasible. Chaperone nanobodies, siRNA, CRISPER, and antisense oligonucleotides have all been suggested as possible treatments for LCD. So far, siRNA and nanobodies show promise for type I and type II LCD, respectively. Antisense oligonucleotides and CRISPR show promise in investigations for treatment of other corneal disorders, but have not yet been investigated for use in LCD.
