Cardiac allograft vasculopathy encompasses a constellation of vascular changes characterized by intimal fibromuscular hyperplasia (arteriosclerosis), vasculitis, and atherosclerosis. Veins, in addition to arteries, are affected. Immunohistochemistry demonstrates the infiltration of macrophages and T lymphocytes into the intima, media, and/or adventitia of affected vessels. In contrast to atherosclerosis, calcium deposition is not a prominent finding, even in severely stenotic arteries.
