Active transport requires the use of energy (namely ATP) since it takes molecules from a lower to a higher concentration, i.e., against its concentration or electrochemical gradient. Importantly, active transport is necessary for homeostasis of ions and molecules, and a significant portion of the available energy goes towards maintaining these processes. In particular, the sodium-potassium pump is required to maintain cell potentials and can be seen in neuronal action potentials.
