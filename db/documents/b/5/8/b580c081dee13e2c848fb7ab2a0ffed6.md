In addition to the routine medical management of hyperbilirubinemia, which for breastmilk jaundice involves monitoring the jaundice without changes in the infant’s breastfeeding, nursing management includes providing education and support for the parents of infants with jaundice. Anything outside of normal can cause stress for new parents. In the rare cases where an infant needs to stop breastfeeding for 24 hours, nurses need to educate the mother on proper pumping procedure and safe storage of breastmilk. Infants who will continue breastfeeding should be encouraged to breastfeed every 2 to 3 hours until they learn to self-pace their own feedings. A sleepy jaundiced baby sometimes does not stay awake long enough for a good feeding, which can worsen hyperbilirubinemia. The mother may need breastfeeding assistance, and referral to a lactation consultant is a good option in areas where that is available. In addition, as bilirubin is excreted, the infant’s stools may become rather explosive. Reassure parents this is normal, and the more green that comes out in the stool, the less yellow will be in the baby’s skin. Education on infant bathing and appropriate diapering and skincare to prevent breakdown is important.
