It is estimated that up to 95% of adults in the world are eventually seropositive to EBV. Therefore, EBV is widely disseminated in all population groups. The traditional age group where peak incidence is noted, however, is in 15 to 24-year olds. Classically, the symptomatic infection is in adolescents, which is why laypersons may refer to the infection as the “kissing disease.” Mononucleosis is uncommon in adults:  approximately 2% of all pharyngeal disease in adults is attributable to this disease. Adults are generally not susceptible to clinical illness because of previous exposure. In the United States, clinically evident infection occurs at rates estimated at 30 times higher in whites than in blacks. One explanation for this disparity is that if acquired at a young (childhood) age, EBV is often subclinical. This would suggest earlier EBV exposures in blacks, and a higher frequency of asymptomatic infection as young children.

After exposure, the EBV infects the epithelial cells of the salivary glands and the oropharynx. Lymphocytes residing in the tonsils get exposed to the virus and then enter the bloodstream. Lymphoid hyperplasia is common and may be seen as generalized lymphadenopathy, tonsillitis, and hepatosplenomegaly.

The infection of the B-lymphocytes results in the production of immunoglobulins (heterophile antibodies).
