No treatment is indicated for a PVD or vitreous floater. If a retinal break is found, follow treatment guidelines for the break or tear.

The management of the patient should include educating the patient on retinal detachment symptoms such as the following: increase in floaters, flashing lights, worsening vision, or the appearance of a curtain or shadow anywhere in the visual field. If these symptoms develop, immediate evaluation by an ophthalmologist is needed.

If no break or hemorrhage is found on examination, a repeat dilated exam with scleral depression needs to occur in 2 to 4 weeks. If at 2 to 4 weeks, no detachment is seen, then repeat the dilated exam at three months and six months from the original onset of symptoms. If no retinal break is seen, but mild vitreous hemorrhage or peripheral punctate retinal hemorrhages are present, a dilated exam needs to be performed one week, 2 to 4 weeks, three months, and six months from the onset of symptoms. If no retinal break is found, but significant vitreous hemorrhage or anterior pigmented vitreous cells are present, a repeat examination should be performed the following day by a retina specialist because of the high chance of a retinal break.
