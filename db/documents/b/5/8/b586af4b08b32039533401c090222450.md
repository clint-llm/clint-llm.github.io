The diagnosis and management of bacterial endocarditis is with an interprofessional team that includes an infectious disease expert, cardiologist, cardiac surgeon, internist, nurse practitioner, and the primary care provider. Once the diagnosis is made the treatment depends on the status of the valve.

Empiric antibiotic therapy should cover Staphylococcus (methicillin-susceptible and resistant), Streptococcus, and Enterococcus. Initial treatment with vancomycin and gentamicin should cover a number of organisms prior to the results of blood cultures.

The duration of therapy depends on the pathogen and site of valvular infection. The duration of therapy should be counted from the first day of negative blood cultures. Most patients are treated parenterally with regimens for up to 6 weeks.

Patients with relapse of native valve endocarditis following completion of appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be considered for surgery.
