Glucose has a vital role in every organ system. However, there are select organs that play a crucial role in glucose regulation.

**Liver**

The liver is an important organ with regards to maintaining appropriate blood glucose levels. Glycogen, the multibranched polysaccharide of glucose in humans, is how glucose gets stored by the body and mostly found in the liver and skeletal muscle. Try to think of glycogen as the body's short-term storage of glucose (while triglycerides in adipose tissues serve as the long-term storage). Glucose is liberated from glycogen under the influence of glucagon and fasting conditions, raising blood glucose. Glucose is added to glycogen under the control of insulin and energy-rich conditions, lowering blood glucose.

**Pancreas**

The pancreas releases the hormones primarily responsible for the control of blood glucose levels. Through increasing glucose concentration within the beta-cell, insulin release occurs, which in turn acts to lower blood glucose through several mechanisms, which are detailed below.  Through lower glucose levels and lower insulin levels (directly influenced by low glucose levels), alpha-cells of the pancreas will release glucagon, which in turn acts to raise blood-glucose through several mechanisms that are detailed below. Somatostatin is also released from delta-cells of the pancreas and has a net effect of decreasing blood glucose levels.

**Adrenal Gland**

The adrenal gland subdivides into the cortex and the medulla, both of which play roles in glucose homeostasis. The adrenal cortex releases glucocorticoids, which will raise blood glucose levels through mechanisms described below, the most potent and abundant being cortisol. The adrenal medulla releases epinephrine, which also increases blood glucose levels through mechanisms described below.

**Thyroid Gland**

The thyroid gland is responsible for the production and release of thyroxine. Thyroxine has widespread effects on almost every tissue of the body, one of which being an increase in blood glucose levels through mechanisms described below.

**Anterior Pituitary Gland**

The anterior pituitary gland is responsible for the release of both ACTH and growth hormone, which increases blood glucose levels through mechanisms described below.

**Hormones**

There are many hormones involved with glucose homeostasis. The mechanisms in which they act to modulate glucose are essential; however, at the very least, it is essential to understand the net effect that each hormone has on glucose levels. One trick is to remember which ones lower glucose levels: insulin (primarily) and somatostatin. The others increase glucose levels.****

- Insulin: decreases blood glucose through increased expression of GLUT4, increased expression of glycogen synthase, inactivation of phosphorylase kinase (thus decreasing gluconeogenesis), and decreasing the expression of rate-limiting enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis.

- Glucagon: increases blood glucose through increased glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.

- Somatostatin: decreases blood glucose levels through local suppression of glucagon release and suppression of gastrin and pituitary tropic hormones. This hormone also decreases insulin release; however, its net effect is a decrease in blood glucose levels.

- Cortisol: increases blood glucose levels via the stimulation of gluconeogenesis and through antagonism of insulin.

- Epinephrine: increases blood glucose levels through glycogenolysis (glucose liberation from glycogen) and increased fatty acid release from adipose tissues, which can then be catabolized and enter gluconeogenesis.

- Thyroxine: increases blood glucose levels through glycogenolysis and increased absorption in the intestine.

- Growth hormone: promotes gluconeogenesis, inhibits liver uptake of glucose, stimulates thyroid hormone, inhibits insulin.

- ACTH: stimulates cortisol release from adrenal glands, stimulates the release of fatty acids from adipose tissue, which can then feed into gluconeogenesis.
