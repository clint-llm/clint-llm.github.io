Central nervous system (CNS) involvement by tumoral metastasis is a potentially life-threatening complication, representing the immediate cause of death in more than 50 percent of the cases.

The most common spread route is through the hematogenous route with the seeding of the brain tissue (microvasculature).

The brain ecosystem represents a unique microenvironment with the inherent ability to aid and limit tumor homing in equal measures. While the microvasculature promotes the spread of tumors, penetration of systemic therapies to the brain tissue is limited.

Radiation therapy aims to mitigate the adverse impact of intracranial metastasis on survival and improve the health-related quality of life (HRQoL).

The first evidence of the utility of whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in palliation of brain metastasis came from Chao et al.

This chapter aims to recall, analyze, and select appropriate indications and contraindications for the use of palliative radiotherapy in patients with intracranial metastasis. The clinical significance, technique involved, and recent advances in providing palliative radiotherapy in this clinical setting are also addressed.
