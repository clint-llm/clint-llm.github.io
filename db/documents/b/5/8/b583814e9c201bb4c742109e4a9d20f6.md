This activity provides a comprehensive review of spinal cord infarction. It discusses the vascular anatomy of the spinal cord, including both the arterial and venous networks. Knowledge regarding the anatomy of the spinal cord and its respective functions is paramount when diagnosing and managing spinal cord infarction (SCI). Also, it describes the risk factors and etiologies that can lead to SCI. This activity reviews studies that analyzed the prevalence of SCI relative to specific etiologies. This activity provides a review of the clinical phenotypes associated with SCI, emphasizes that examination is crucial in providing prompt diagnosis, and proper interprofessional management modalities in achieving a better outcome for the patient.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the epidemiology and characteristics of spinal cord infarction patients, including the age of onset, and common anatomical locations of infarction.
- Describe commonly encountered clinical features during the physical evaluation of spinal cord infarction.
- Review the surgical management warranted in cases of vascular compression and an acute aortic event.
- Outline the significance of joint efforts and full participation from patients and interprofessional teams in improving overall outcomes.
