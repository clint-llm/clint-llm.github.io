The long-term outcome of treated DDH is based on the degree of dysplasia, the age of diagnosis and type of treatment, and whether a concentrically reduced hip joint was obtained.

Approximately 90 percent of neonatal hips with instability or mild dysplasia (Barlow-positive with an alpha angle of 50 to 60 and with 50% to 60 % of coverage) resolve spontaneously with normal functional and radiographic outcomes.[
