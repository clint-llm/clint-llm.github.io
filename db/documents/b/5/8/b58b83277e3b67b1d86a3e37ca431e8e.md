**Coronary Artery Calcifications**

There is no known treatment for coronary artery calcifications. As mentioned above, a certain threshold of CAC risk score predicts which patients would benefit from statins and hence should be prescribed per the guidelines. In addition, other modifiable risk factors for ASCVD, including hypertension, diabetes, and cigarette smoking, should be addressed.

**Valvular Calcifications**

For valvular calcifications and stenosis that fulfills the criteria for valvular replacement, either a transcatheter or surgical valve replacement procedure should be performed. This should take into account the frailty of the patient as well as the surgical risks, calculated using the STS score (Society of Thoracic Surgeons). While surgery is preferred in young patients, a transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) may be more desirable in patients with higher surgical risks.

**Pericardial and Myocrdial Calcifications**

In addition to medical management of heart failure with diuretics and other guidelines directed medical treatment (GDMT), a pericardiectomy may be necessitated in refractory constrictive pericarditis.Â Pericardiectomy is a procedure with high morbidity and mortality rates.

The treatment of myocardial calcifications is not well elucidated in the literature.
