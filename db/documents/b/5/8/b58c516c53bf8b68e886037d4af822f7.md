Revision arthroplasty with a diaphyseal fit stem provides a stable construct that has resulted in an overall decrease in patients requiring extensive weight-bearing restrictions. The goal of treatment is to adequately stabilize the fracture and return the patient to full weight-bearing as quickly as possible. Mulay et al. advocated for six to twelve weeks of weight-bearing restrictions for periprosthetic proximal femur fractures exclusively treated with plate fixation.
