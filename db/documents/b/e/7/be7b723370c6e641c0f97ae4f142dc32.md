The ophthalmologists should meticulously evaluate any patient presenting to the outpatient department with suspected ectopia lentis. If the diagnosis is in doubt and an expert opinion is mandated, the patient should be referred to the cataract and IOL specialist for a higher opinion. If the patient develops secondary glaucoma, it should be managed with the help of glaucoma specialists.

In the case of corneal complications like corneal decompensation and megalocornea, the cornea specialist plays a crucial role in managing these cases. If the patient has pathological myopia, lattice retinal degeneration, or retinal detachment, the vitreoretinal surgeon help in managing these cases. Last but not least, all cases of ectopia lentis need a detailed systemic evaluation with the help of an internist. The cardiologist, rheumatologist, orthopedics, pediatrician, microbiologist, pathologist, and genetic specialist also have a crucial role in arriving at a final systemic diagnosis.
