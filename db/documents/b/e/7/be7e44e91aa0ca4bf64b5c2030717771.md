The mortality rate in heart failure in 2008 was 18.2 per 100,000 for males and 15.8 per 100,000 for females based on the "Morbidity and Mortality: 2012 Chart Book on Cardiovascular, Lung and Blood Diseases". Patients with HFpEF have been known to have a lower mortality rate than those with HFrEF.

Multiple variables have associations with worse outcome in heart failure: male gender, advancing age, low ejection fraction, high NYHA functional class, low hematocrit, and sodium levels, high brain natriuretic peptide, low peak exercise oxygen uptake, wide QRS, renal failure, low blood pressure, elevated heart rate, and volume overload refractory to medical treatment.
