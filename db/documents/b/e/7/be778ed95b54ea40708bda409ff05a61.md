**Mechanism Of Action**

Several theories have been proposed the mechanism as follows

- Cellular - suggests that the reduction in IOP occurs due to the cellular activity stimulated by the laser; there is increased recruitment of macrophages in the trabecular meshwork, which aids in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix, thus allowing for increased aqueous outflow.

- Cytokine production- there is increased expression and secretion of IL-1 beta and TNF alpha in the first 8 hours after treatment; these mediate increased trabecular stromelysin expression, which leads to remodeling of the juxtacanalicular extracellular matrix of the trabecular meshwork. This improves the normal outflow facility, thereby decreasing IOP.

- The increased conductivity of Schlemm's canal- SLT leads to a 3-fold increase in Schlemm's canal cells conductivity, thus increasing the transendothelial fluid flow across Schlemm's canal cells.

- ALT- causes coagulative necrosis of the trabecular meshwork.

- SLT- causes cracking of intracytoplasmic pigment granules and disruption of the endothelial cells of the trabecular meshwork

**Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty**

**Laser type**

Argon green laser

Frequency-doubled Nd: YAG laser

**Duration**

3 ns

**Spot size**

50 microns

400 microns

**Power**

300 - 1000 mW, depending on the response

0.8 – 1 mJ in lightly pigmented angles, 0.3 – 0.6 mJ in heavily pigmented angles.

**Target**

Junction of anterior non pigmented and posterior pigmented trabecular meshwork

Pigmented trabecular meshwork

**End Point**

Blanching of trabecular meshwork or appearance of a tiny bubble

The appearance of small bubbles closer to the trabecular meshwork

**The extent of angle treated**

Treating 360 degrees in one sitting is associated with IOP spikes; hence 180 degrees of the angle is treated first -  further treatment is decided based on the initial response

180 or 360 degrees can be treated in a single session****
