**Visual Acuity**

Although this is not a test for potential vision, it is a test that needs to be performed at the very beginning of the ocular examination.

- Distant vision – Snellen's chart, Landolt C chart, Sheridan Gardiner HOTV test.

- Near vision – Jaeger chart, Roman chart, and Snellen near vision chart.

- Color vision – Ishiharas pseudoisochromatic plates, Farnsworth Munsell 100 Hue test, Green lantern test and Anomaloscopes.

- Contrast sensitivity – Pelli-Robson, Regan, Arden-Grating charts.

**Brightness Acuity Test**

It is a subjective test that can be performed in clear or slightly opaque media.

- Direct overhead sunlight - the high setting of the device

- Partly cloudy day - medium setting

- Bright overhead commercial lighting - low setting

Visual acuity is measured in all three conditions, and if reduced in comparison to the baseline acuity, the patient is said to have a glare disability. The glare disability is usually seen due to anterior segment pathologies like cataracts, whereas posterior segment diseases will not cause a significant deterioration in vision on exposure to light.

**Photostress Test**

It is a subjective test that can be performed in clear media as well as in the presence of media opacities.

**Procedure**

- The distant visual acuity of both eyes is measured.

- The patient is asked to remove their spectacles.

- The bad eye is occluded, and the normal/better eye is tested first

- A direct ophthalmoscope or any other bright source of light is held 2 to 3 cm in front of the eye being tested.

- The patient is asked to look directly at the light, which is turned off after 10 seconds.

- The patient is asked to wear their spectacles and asked to read one line above the original visual acuity on the distant vision chart as soon as the after images disappear and the optotypes are just visible.

- The time taken to read 2 or 3 optotypes is recorded as the PSRT.

- The same procedure is repeated for the other eye.

**Amsler Grid**

It is a subjective test that can be performed in clear media as well as in the presence of mild media opacities.

- Chart 1/ Standard grid – It tests the general subjective response to distortions in the pattern. It consists of 400 small squares, each measuring 5 mm and subtending 1 degree on the retina when held at 30 cm. It also has a central white dot. If the patient cannot see the white dot, they can be considered to have a central scotoma.

- Chart 2 – It is used if the patient has a central scotoma, as tested by chart 1. It looks like chart 1 and additionally has 2 diagonal white lines running across the grid. These diagonal lines help in determining the limits of the central scotoma.

- Chart 3 – It is primarily used to detect color scotomas and can also be used to check color desaturation in optic nerve diseases. It can also be used along with red–green dissociative glasses in patients with suspected malingering. It consists of a similar grid as found in chart 1, with the only difference being that the lines of the grid are red in color.

- Chart 4 – It is used to differentiate between a scotoma and metamorphopsia, which can be seen in macular edema.

- Chart 5 – It is used in patients with metamorphopsia to identify the specific meridians that are affected. The chart has parallel lines with a central white dot for fixation. The chart can be rotated to change the meridian.

- Chart 6 – It is used for detailed central evaluation. It is the same as chart 5, with the only difference being that the parallel lines are placed closer to each other, 0.5 degrees above and below the fixation point.

- Chart 7 – It is used to diagnose subtle macular diseases. It has a fine central grid where each square measures 2.5 mm and subtends 0.5 degrees when held at 30cm. This grid can be used to evaluate the central 8 degrees of the visual field.

**Procedure**

- The patient is seated, and an appropriate near add is given, enabling visualization at 30 cm. Multifocal/progressive addition lenses should be avoided.

- The test is performed for each eye separately. The non-viewing eye is occluded.

- The appropriate chart is held at 30 cm with the ambient room lights switched on. The patient is asked to fixate on the center of the grid and then asked whether all four corners of the grid are still visible. Then the patient is asked whether any of the squares in the grid look blurry or wavy.

- The test is repeated with any of the other charts deemed appropriate.

- The patient records the defects by drawing any findings directly on the Amsler recording sheet or by the doctor based on the patient's explanation.

**2-Point Discrimination**

It is a subjective test for the potential vision that requires clear media for testing.

**Entoptic Phenomenon**

It is a subjective test that can be performed even in the presence of opaque media.

The opacities closer to the retina are perceived as their umbral shadows are projected on the retina. Normally, blood vessels on the retina are not visualized as the photoreceptors below them are adapted to the reduced level of illumination. However, if the light is thrown at an unusual angle, the shadow of the blood vessels falls on un- adapted photoreceptors and thus becomes visible. These visible blood vessels are called the Purkinje tree, and this technique is called the Purkinje tree entoptic test.

**Procedure**

- Transillumination method – A small flashlight is placed over the closed eyelid at the lateral canthus. The light is constantly oscillated to prevent local adaptation.

- Pinhole disc method – The patient is made to look at a bright background through a pinhole in a disc that is constantly moving.

- Blue field entopic phenomenon – The patient is asked to look at a bright and diffusely illuminated surface with accommodation relaxed. The background is illumination by blue light (350 to 450 nm), which is maximally absorbed by hemoglobin.

- Luminous spots that move in patterns similar to the retinal capillaries can be seen by the patient. These are believed to be red blood cells because:

- No spots are seen in the area corresponding to the foveal avascular zone.
- The movement occurs in curved, sinusoidal patterns that simulate capillary loops of the vascular tree.
- If intraocular pressure is raised above 50 mm of Hg, the movement ceases.
- They are best seen at 350 to 450 nm, which is the peak absorption wavelength of hemoglobin found inside red blood cells.

**Maddox Rod Test**

It is a subjective test that can be performed even in the presence of opaque media.

**Procedure**

- The patient is made to sit 6 meters away from a light source.

- A Maddox rod is placed in front of the eye to be examined monocularly. The Maddox rod converts the point source of light to a line that is seen by the patient.

- The Maddox rod is rotated - vertical, horizontal, and oblique and the patient is asked what direction the line is oriented in and whether the line is continuous or not.

**Potential Acuity Meter (PAM)**

It is a subjective test that can be performed even in opaque media. It is designed to check the visual acuity due to the retina, and it bypasses the lens and the cornea. It is a device that attaches to the slit lamp and emits a 0.15 mm diameter point light source in the pupillary plane that is aimed through the clear portions of the cataractous lens.

It is useful in predicting the post-operative visual outcome after cataract surgery in patients with retinal pathologies like dry age-related macular degeneration and those with choroidal neovascularization.

**Procedure**

- The pupil is dilated before the test to allow the light to pass through different parts of the lens.

- The patient is seated at a slit lamp, and the PAM projects a miniature Snellen's chart through the less dense parts of the cataract.

- The patient is asked to read the Snellen letters of different sizes.

**Advantages**

- The PAM shows a strong correlation with post-operative Snellen's visual acuity.

- It is easy to use and easy to explain to the patient.

**Laser Interferometry**

It is a subjective test that can be performed even in the presence of opaque media.

The different models available are:

- Heine Lambda retinometer

- Lotmar visometer

**Procedure**

- The patient's pupil is dilated.

- The interferometer is used to project a fringe pattern onto the retina.

- The patient is asked to recognize the direction of the fringes – vertical, horizontal, or oblique.

- The fringes are made finer until the patient is unable to identify the orientation.

- The endpoint fringe pitch is noted and correlated to Snellen's visual acuity using a chart provided.

**Advantages**

- Unaffected by the optics of the eye.

- Easier to use

- More accurate than PAM in predicting visual acuity in patients with a macular hole

**Critical Flicker Fusion Frequency (CFFF)**

It is a subjective test that can be performed in opaque media. Critical flicker fusion frequency (CFF or CFFF) is defined as the frequency at which flickering light can be perceived as continuous. It is used to assess the processing of temporal vision.

During the CFF test, the patient is asked to fixate on a light-emitting diode that emits light that oscillates at a gradually increasing frequency. The patient is then asked to press a button when they believe the light to be continuous. Critical flicker fusion thresholds are reduced in retinal and neural diseases but resistant to degradation due to media opacities.

**Electroretinogram (ERG)**

It is an objective test that can be performed even in opaque media.

**Procedure**

- Three electrodes are placed on the patient –

- Active electrode – corneal contact lens, gold wick electrodes in the conjunctival sac, or gold foil electrodes on the eyelids.
- Reference electrode – placed at the lateral canthus.
- Ground electrode – placed at the nasal canthus.

- A Ganzfeld stimulus is used to stimulate the retina, and the changes in the resting potential are recorded as a graph.

- A scotopic ERG is first performed after pupil dilation and after dark adaptation for 20 mins. Increasing intensities of the stimulus are presented to the retina. The recordings obtained are referred to as the dark-adapted ERG.

- A photopic ERG is then performed after 10 minutes of light adaptation. Increasing intensities are presented to the retina, and the light-adapted ERGs are recorded.

- There are different types of ERGs –

- Full-field ERG/ Ganzfeld ERG – there is uniform stimulation of the whole retina.
- Pattern ERG – records the macular response to an alternating checkerboard stimulus.
- Multifocal ERG – It records the response of the central 40 to 50 degrees of the retina to a 61-103 hexagonal foci stimulus.

**Visually Evoked Potentials (VEP)**

It is an objective test that can be performed in cloudy media.

**Procedure**

- Scalp electrodes are usually placed in the occipital area as it is closest to the visual cortex. There are two systems of placement:

- 10-20 international system
- Queen square system

- The waves produced by the visual stimulus are then recorded as a graph.

- There are different types of VEP:

- Flash VEP – flash stimuli are presented to the eye at a rate of 1 to 5 times/second. It indicates if the stimulus was perceived by the cortex or not. It is the test of choice in infants as it can be done even during sleep.
- Pattern VEP – Checkerboard patterns displayed on a screen are used as stimuli. This can be used to roughly estimate the visual acuity.

**Slit Lamp Biomicroscopy**

It is an objective technique that can determine the expected visual acuity in the presence of a cataract.**.**For example, if the patient's visual acuity is 20/100, but the doctor's view of the fundus is 20/40, then there should be a suspicion that the ocular media is not the only cause of reduced visual acuity. Additionally, the brightness, shape, direction, and angle of illumination of the slit lamp can be adjusted to view all the different structures of the anterior segment of the eye. It can also be used to visualize the posterior segment. The most accurate testing requires the pupil to be fully dilated and also requires condensing lenses to enable seeing the fundus. The different lenses that can be used are as follows:

- Hruby lens biomicroscopy - It is a planoconcave lens of 58.6 dioptre power. A virtual and erect image of the fundus is produced. The image has a low magnification, and the field of view is small. The fundus cannot be visualized beyond the equator.

- Contact lens biomicroscopy - 

- Modified Koeppe lens - It is a posterior contact lens that produces a virtual and erect image.
- Goldmann's three-mirror contact lens - It is made up of a central contact lens and three mirrors with different angles of inclinations.

- Indirect fundus biomicroscopy - It is a method of noncontact fundus biomicroscopy. A +78 Dioptre or a +90 Dioptre lens can be used to produce a real, inverted, and magnified image.

**Fundus Fluorescein Angiography (FFA)**

It is an objective technique that requires clear media to perform.

**Procedure**

- The fundus camera is correctly aligned, and the eyes are dilated.

- Baseline red-free images are taken.

- A 21 Gauge butterfly needle is inserted into the antecubital vein, and the fluorescein dye is injected at 1ml/sec.

- A timer is started, and photos are taken, starting 15 seconds before the dye is injected up to 10-20 min.

**Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)**

Although media opacities deteriorate the image, OCT is still often used to determine the integrity of posterior segment structures such as the macula and the optic nerve. It is an objective method that may be done in the presence of slightly opaque media but not in the presence of dense cataracts.

By screening for posterior segment pathologies in eyes with cataracts, the OCT is able to detect if the macula, retina, and optic nerve are contributing to the reduced visual acuity. It produces cross-sectional images of biological tissues with less than 10-micron axial resolution. A near-infrared beam of light is projected onto the retina. The light reflected back from the retinal microstructures is scattered. The echo time delay of the scattered light is compared with the echo time delay of the light reflected from the reference mirror.

**Microperimetry**

It is an objective test that requires clear media to perform.

The following are some potential clinical uses:

- When macular scotomas are measured carefully, this allows the clinician to identify a patient's fixation pattern. This makes it easier to implement different treatment modalities, such as eccentric viewing techniques, and monitor the pathology's functional impact.

- Once the focus pattern is recorded, planning and rehabilitation with low vision aids can proceed more effectively.

- In order to investigate the relationship between physical alterations and their functional importance, research methods compare microperimetry and OCT evaluation of macular disorders.

**Procedure**

- The test can be carried out in low light with an undilated pupil.

- The first stage is to align the fundus image with the target such that when a target is later projected on the photograph of the fundus at a particular position, the stimulus is automatically presented to the patient at that exact actual fundus location.

- The ambient lighting is set to 4 apostilbs. The range of the stimulus's volume is 0 to 20 dB. Goldmann I to V sizes are the range of stimulus sizes.

- Depending on the patient's visual acuity, the fixation target might vary in size and form and is typically at 100 apostilbs.

- Either numerical data or a color scheme is used for reporting.
