Hydralazine has been reported to cause headaches, nausea, flushing, hypotension, palpitations, tachycardia, dizziness, and angina.

Immune phenomena such as drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE), serum sickness, hemolytic anemia, vasculitis, and glomerulonephritis have been reported using hydralazine.

Hydralazine-related DILE, also known as hydralazine-induced lupus syndrome (HILS), usually occurs with greater than 6 months of exposure, and roughly 5-8% of hydralazine users are at risk of developing DILE.

Cases of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) have also been reported with the use of hydralazine. Symptoms of DILI are consistent with hepatitis and include nausea, vomiting, dark urine, jaundice, abdominal pain, and pruritus. Treatment entails discontinuation of hydralazine.

There have been rare cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) reported in association with hydralazine.

There have also been rare cases reported of polyneuritis that are amenable to pyridoxine supplements.
