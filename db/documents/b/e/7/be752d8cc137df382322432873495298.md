# Introduction

The term teledebriefing describes a process in which learners who are participating in a simulation scenario undergo debriefing with a facilitator located at an off-site location.

Telesimulation has seen rapid growth in the last several years and has been implemented in many areas, including (but not limited to) pediatric resuscitation, surgery, anesthesia, nursing, and emergency medicine.

In a simulation, debriefing is often considered to be the most crucial component and is the time when a majority of the learning occurs.

# Function

Research has shown that simulation is a superior educational modality compared to passive methods such as didactic lectures for critical care conditions.

By utilizing telesimulation with teledebriefing, facilities which are lacking faculty resources may gain access to simulation education by the use of basic equipment and a simple Internet connection.

Implementing telesimulation into educational curriculum requires (at a minimum) resources that include (but are not limited to)

- Simulation equipment (ranging from simple procedural task trainers to high-fidelity mannequins)

- Telecommunication equipment that allows the capture and transmission of audio/visual data (can vary from a simple smartphone to full simulation audio/video software programs)

- Internet connection

- Software that has teleconferencing capabilities

In resource-poor/restricted areas, this concept is beneficial since it eliminates the time and distance barriers to the delivery of educational content.

The body of literature supporting the effectiveness of telesimulation is growing. Among these is a prospective, randomized crossover study that examined the effectiveness of telesimulation versus standard simulation in teaching medical students the management of critically ill patients. The study demonstrated no significant difference in evaluation scores (which assessed the learner's comprehension of the educational material delivered) between the two groups of medical students, nor in the favorability of teaching modality (telesimulation vs. standard simulation). The authors concluded that telesimulation could provide educational benefit to learners at off-site locations.

# Issues of Concern

**Tips for Implementing Teledebriefing**

**Required Equipment**

Teledebriefing can be accomplished cost-effectively and straightforwardly using basic equipment and an Internet connection.

Telesimulation allows learners to benefit from the simulation in large part by overcoming time, distance, and limited human resource barriers. Teledebriefing is one process in telesimulation that allows learners to benefit and gain knowledge and skills from subject matter experts/educators that are not on-site. Teledebriefing also allows subject matter experts the ability to share their expertise and provide value to the community without having to travel extended distances or take the additional time to be physically present at the site of instruction; this can be particularly beneficial for those educators who travel nationally and internationally to provide educational content to learners.

**Debriefing Techniques**

Teledebriefing is a process in which learners participating in a simulation scenario undergo debriefing with a facilitator located at an off-site location. There is a myriad of specific debriefing techniques that utilizable with teledebriefing. For example, the Plus/Delta technique of debriefing focuses on learner self-assessment. The debriefer will ask open-ended questions such as "What went well?" (plus) and "What could be changed?" (delta), to identify issues that may have occurred during the case to improve future performance. This technique may also be useful in the debriefing of systems-focused simulations (e.g., in-situ code blue team simulation).

Rapid Cycle Deliberate Practice (RCDP) is a technique of debriefing that has demonstrated effectiveness in simulation scenarios designed to teach procedures such as airway management, technical skills, and adherence to resuscitation guidelines. It differs from traditional post-scenario debriefing by moving the debriefing to occur within the scenario itself. In RCDP, the scenario gets paused if participants perform an action incorrectly, and they receive immediate feedback and correction by a facilitator. The case then "rewinds," and the participants are allowed to practice the action again, this time doing it the "right way." Upon the mastering of a skill, the scenarios progress in difficulty, built on previously mastered skills.

Advocacy inquiry is a technique where the facilitator first advocates his/her observation of an action or behavior and then inquires about the participant's frame of mind relative to the action.

The GAS (Gather Analyze Summarize) conversation structure is yet another debriefing method that is also commonly used in medical simulation.

# Clinical Significance

Debriefing is arguably the most critical part of the simulation session that pertains explicitly to knowledge consolidation. There is now a small but growing body of evidence addressing this aspect of telesimulation. A study that examined the efficacy and feasibility of teledebriefing as an alternative to in-person debriefing found that teledebriefing was rated slightly lower than in-person debriefing, but was still found to be consistently effective. The authors of this study came to the conclusion that since the overall rating of teledebriefing was very high (receiving a score of "consistently effective/very good" on the Debriefing Assessment for Simulation in Healthcare Student Version (DASH-SV)), it may be a practical alternative to debriefing if faculty or staff is unavailable to provide traditional in-person debriefing for simulation-based medical training.

The authors also report the possible reasons why teledebriefing was rated lower than traditional debriefing. These included the loss of non-verbal cues (in part due to the debriefer only being viewable from the shoulders up on the video screen), the inability to demonstrate maneuvers or procedures physically, and the inability of teledebriefing faculty to visualize or hear subtle forms of communication between participants during their observation of the simulation session.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Simulation encompasses any processes or technology that recreate a contextual background that allows learners to make decisions, experience success and mistakes, receive feedback, and gain confidence in an environment that is void of patient risk.
