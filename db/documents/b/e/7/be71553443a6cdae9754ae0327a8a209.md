The rotator cuff is made up of the muscle bellies and tendons of the infraspinatus, supraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis muscles. Rotator cuff syndrome (RCS) describes any injury or degenerative condition affecting the rotator cuff. This includes subacromial impingement syndrome and bursitis, rotator cuff tendonitis, partial or full-thickness rotator cuff tears. Chronic rotator cuff syndrome can increase the risk for the development of glenohumeral degenerative disease and rotator cuff arthropathy. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of rotator cuff syndrome and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- State the definition of rotator cuff syndrome. 
- Explain how rotator cuff syndrome is evaluated.
- Describe complications of chronic rotator cuff syndrome.
- Explore the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional teams to provide physical therapy, monitor effects of anti-inflammatory medications and ensure proper employment of surgical techniques when appropriate to enhance the delivery of care for patients with rotator cuff syndrome.
