**Parathyroid Gland Physiology**

The parathyroid glands play a vital role in calcium homeostasis.

**Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) Physiology**

The initial synthesis of parathyroid hormone takes place within the parathyroid gland as pre-pro-PTH (a 115-amino-acid polypeptide). It is then cleaved into pro-PTH (90-amino-acids). A second cleavage leads to an 84-amino-acid mature PTH, with a half-life of approximately 3 minutes, allowing for rapid control of serum calcium. PTH exerts its effects primarily through action in the kidneys, bones, and the GI tract.

- PTH Effect in the Kidney - Multiple effects

- Increased calcium absorption in the distal convoluted tubule
- Increased phosphate excretion in the proximal convoluted tubule
- Increased activation of Vitamin D to its active form, calcitriol

- PTH Effect in the Bones - Stimulation of RANKL leading to osteoclast differentiation

- Increased bone resorption - increasing serum calcium and phosphate

- PTH Effect in the Intestines - Indirect effect secondary to increased calcitriol

- Increased calcium absorption in the small intestine
