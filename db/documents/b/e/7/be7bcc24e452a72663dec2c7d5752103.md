Differential diagnoses for symptomatic atrial tachycardia are primarily other arrhythmias. In order to identify different rhythms, a 12 lead EKG will need to be obtained and read accurately. Â A full workup needs to be completed to establish if the arrhythmia is secondary to another condition.

Differentials include:

- Sinus tachycardia

- Atrial fibrillation,

- Atrial flutter

- Ventricular tachycardia

- Torsades de Pointes

- Hyperthyroidism

- Anemic state
