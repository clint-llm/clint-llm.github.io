Zenker diverticulum develops in the hypopharynx, typically between the cricopharyngeus muscle and the inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle at the level of cervical vertebrae 5 and 6. It often presents with dysphagia. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of Zenker diverticulum
and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the recognition and management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of Zenker diverticulum.
- Explain when a barium fluoroscopic evaluation should be considered in patients presenting with dysphagia. 
- Explain the recommended treatment of Zenker diverticulum.
- Employ collaborative interprofessional team strategies to improve detection of Zenker diverticulum and improve care for affected patients.
