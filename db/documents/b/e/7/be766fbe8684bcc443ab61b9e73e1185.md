THese interprofessional entities need to collaborate in a team approach to patient care in ptosis cases. Oculoplastic and plastic surgeons perform ptosis correction. Practicing surgeons should be aware of the anatomy, etiology, examination and surgical techniques for ptosis correction. Surgeons should be well aware of what surgery to perform when and also when not to operate.
