Because natural family planning often requires time-intensive patient education or multiple instructional sessions, successful use of these methods may benefit from a coordinated team approach. The pharmacist dispensing contraceptive pills or a physician performing a routine wellness visit may identify patients who are interested in pursuing natural family planning. Subsequently, a trained educator (physician, nurse practitioner, etc.) may be called upon to perform the detailed teaching. The awareness of all family planning methods, including natural family planning, will allow physicians and advanced practitioners to provide options that are patient-centered and individualized.
