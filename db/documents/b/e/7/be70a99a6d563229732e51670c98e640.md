Incisional hernias are often noticed as a protrusion of the abdominal wall at the site of the incision from previous abdominal surgery

The physical exam involves abdominal palpation. In most of the cases, hernial content can be palpated. Occasional the edges of hernial defect can be felt and the size can be estimated. Planning for a surgical approach can be discussed with the patient on that visit. Although most cases of an incisional hernia are diagnosed with a history and physical, imaging is sometimes warranted like in early stages, obese patients, or complex cases

Occasionally small incisional hernias are identified intraoperatively when the patients undergo another abdominal surgery. Incisions made at the same scar site or laparoscopic approach may show the fascial defects with occasional fat incarceration.
