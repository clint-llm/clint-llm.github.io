Agammaglobulinemia or hypogammaglobulinemia is a rare inherited immunodeficiency disorder. It is characterized by low or absent mature B cells, which can result in severe antibody deficiency and recurrent infections.

Agammaglobulinemia is comprised of the following types:

- X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), discovered in 1952 by Dr. Ogden Bruton.

- X-linked agammaglobulinemia with growth hormone deficiency

- Autosomal recessive agammaglobulinemia (ARAG)
