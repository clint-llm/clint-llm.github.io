The differential diagnosis should include subacromial impingement, rotator cuff tear (partial versus full-thickness), bicipital tendonitis, glenohumeral arthritis, acromioclavicular arthritis, adhesive capsulitis, and calcific tendonitis. Â Note that many of these occur as a continuum of supraspinatus tendonitis and can occur concomitantly.
