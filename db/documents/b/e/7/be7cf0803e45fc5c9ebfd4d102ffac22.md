The original CA 125 assay involves using murine monoclonal OC 125 antibody as both the capture and the tracer antibody. While it is supposed to bind to the corresponding epitope on the CA 125 antigen, certain individuals demonstrate the presence of the human anti-mouse antibody or human anti-murine antibody (HAMA).

Pre-analytical errors while testing for tumor markers such as CA 125 are related to simple specimen-related errors such as incorrect sample processing, an insufficient sample, and inappropriate handling. In the case of CA 125, care must be taken to time the specimen appropriately.

Human anti-murine antibodies are known to interfere with the test, and adding non-immune murine serum can neutralize this interference.
