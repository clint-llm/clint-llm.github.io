In a hypertonic environment, cells use membrane proteins called aquaporin channels to take advantage of the osmotic pressure gradient and shift water towards the higher concentration medium. Cells are permeable to water, and thanks to this, they can shrink and elevate the concentration of intracellular solutes. Cell survival mechanisms include the accumulation of organic osmolytes and increased expression of proteins through numerous pathways, resulting in osmotolerance.

In steady-state conditions, a fundamental property of cells is that they contain a significant amount of large-molecular-weight anionic colloids, mostly proteins and organic phosphates, to which the plasma membrane is impermeable.
