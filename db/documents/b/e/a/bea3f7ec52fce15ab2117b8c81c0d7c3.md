It is imperative that physicians carefully check and recheck neonates for the presence or absence of properly placed testicles. While there is a chance for spontaneous descent for up to 6 months, both clinicians and parents should carefully check the scrotum routinely. Patients and families of patients should be informed of the nature and natural history of untreated cryptorchidism and the recommendation for early surgery, including its benefits and the risks associated with undue delay.
