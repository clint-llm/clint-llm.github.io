The exact number of patients affected by chronic aspiration is unknown. While this condition can affect any age group, it most commonly affects children, the elderly, and ICU patients, all of whom exhibit a higher incidence of aspiration risk factors. The incidence of aspiration pneumonia hospitalizations in the United States is declining but still represents a significant healthcare burden, especially in patients greater than 65.

In children, it has been estimated that up to 25% of this population has swallowing and feeding disorders. This statistic increases to 40% in prematurely born infants and up to 78% in developmentally delayed children.
