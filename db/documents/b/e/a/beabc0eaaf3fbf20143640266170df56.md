**Septo-optic dysplasia:**In addition to enlarged ventricles and hypothalamo-pituitary axis failure, it also consists of optic nerve degeneration and absent septum pellucidum, which are both absent in holoprosencephaly.

**DiGeorge syndrome:**Abnormalities such as cleft palate, hypertelorism, are associated with other anomalies like cardiopulmonary anomalies like aortic arch anomalies and conotruncal defects. Other anomalies like T cell deficiency and signs of hypocalcemia as a result of parathyroid hypoplasia are seen as well.

**Hydranencephaly:**A CT of the head shows absent bilateral cerebral hemispheres with no cortical mantle, and a fluid-filled cavity. However, since the entire falx is preserved, this rules out holoprosencephaly.

**Porencephalic cyst:**On MRI, it appears as an abnormal accumulation of CSF within the brain parenchyma, rather than an absence/midline fusion of cerebral lobes, as seen in holoprosencephaly.

**Arachnoid cyst:**This occurs in conjunction with HPE or could be the only finding. It occurs secondary to trauma or could be inherited in an autosomal manner. It does not present with facial defects unless coexisting holoprosencephaly exists.
