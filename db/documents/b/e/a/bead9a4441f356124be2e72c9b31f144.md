Fortunately, atypical fibroxanthoma rarely metastasizes and recurs in only 6% to 10% of cases. Risk factors for metastases include immunocompromised patients, tumor depth, vascular or perineural invasion, and the presence of tumor necrosis. The most commonly reported locations for metastases include the parotid gland, lymph nodes, and subcutaneous tissue. Metastases, when present, are typically evident 12 to 24 months after the initial diagnosis of atypical fibroxanthoma. The treatment of choice for atypical fibroxanthoma is surgical excision. Previously, this utilized 1 cm margins, however Mohs micrographic surgery and regular follow-up have become the standard of care, with recurrence rates reported at 0.0% to 6.9%. In patients who are poor surgical candidates, electronic brachytherapy has successfully treated atypical fibroxanthoma and is even more effective if there is tumor debulking before therapy. Another reported treatment modality is electrodesiccation and curettage, which may be appropriate for slow-growing lesions that are less than 1 cm in diameter.
