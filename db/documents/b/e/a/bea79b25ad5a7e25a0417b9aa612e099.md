Congenital hearing loss is a disease affecting 1 to 3 per 1000 live births. For many children born with hearing loss, it is an isolated finding known as a nonsyndromic hearing loss. Alternatively, a syndromic hearing loss is where the patient has hearing loss in addition to other medical anomalies. Of the children with genetic abnormalities causing their hearing loss, approximately 20% of these children have other associated findings along with their hearing loss. This review evaluates further syndromic sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), or hearing loss due to problems associated with the vestibulocochlear nerve.
