The lingual artery has multiple branches and subsequently supplies many structures in the lingual and sublingual regions. The first branch of the lingual artery is the suprahyoid artery, which courses along the hyoid bone, a sesamoid bone, while supplying the muscles attached to it. The next branch is the dorsal lingual artery, which supplies the posterior portion of the tongue, palatoglossal arch, lingual tonsil, soft palate, and epiglottis.

Of relevance, there is an anatomical triangular landmark where the lingual artery can be located with consistency. Lesser’s triangle, which is inside the submandibular triangle, contains the lingual artery as it courses toward the apex of the tongue from its origin of the external carotid artery. Lesser’s triangle is bound by the anterior belly of digastric muscle inferiorly, the posterior belly of the digastric muscle posteriorly, and the hypoglossal nerve superiorly.

The lingual artery has a diameter of about 2 to 5 mm, which increases as it approaches the external carotid artery.
