Leadbetter and Burkland first described fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) of renal arteries in 1938. Palubinskas and Ripley reported FMD of craniocervical arteries in 1946. The exact prevalence of FMD remains unknown. The prevalence of renal FMD is 0.4 %, whereas the estimated prevalence of craniocervical FMD is much lower at 0.1%. Autopsy series from Mayo clinic reported a 1.1% prevalence of renal FMD, while prevalence among kidney donors who underwent angiography varied between 2% and 6.6%. Among older hypertensive patients who underwent renal angiography, a prevalence of 5.8% was noted from the cardiovascular outcomes in renal atherosclerotic lesions (CORAL) trial. Evidence from the above studies, interestingly, notes higher prevalence, and many cases may be asymptomatic and thereby often under-diagnosed.

FMD occurs predominantly in females below the age of 50 years. The female to male ratio reported in most studies is 3:1, however, data from the US and French registry supported 9:1 female preponderance. The median age for FMD is 48 years, though cases have been reported in pediatric as well as geriatric populations. There is no evidence to support racial or ethnic propensity, but Caucasians are more likely to be affected than Blacks. Bilateral involvement is seen in 15% of the patients.
