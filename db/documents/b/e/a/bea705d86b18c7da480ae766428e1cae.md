The diagnosis of a wrist dislocation and management is incredibly complex. The majority of these patients first present to the emergency department or to the primary care provider/nurse practitioner. Lunate and perilunate dislocations are often missed due to the lack of experience of the practitioners who may be reviewing them.

The outlook for patients with wristÂ dislocations is guarded. Chronic pain, restricted range of motion and osteoarthritis are common chronic complaints. In some cases, the injury can be disabling.
