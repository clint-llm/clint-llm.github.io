Potential means of preventing HUS include minimizing fecal Shiga toxin enterohemorrhagic shedding in animals and transmission of infection to humans. Public health measures to safeguard food and water from contamination remain essential in addition to personal hygiene and special care of food preparation and storage. Preventing the spread of E. coli 0157:H7 hemorrhagic colitis includes isolation of potentially infectious contacts in school or within institutions to minimize infectious transmission. Ample evidence suggests that personal hygiene, particularly handwashing, effectively prevents infectious acquisition and spread of E. coli 0157:H7 infections in the community, thereby altering the risk of HUS. Public health education, guidelines, and legislation to safeguard food and water against Shiga toxin enterohemorrhagic E. coli food and water contamination and to ensure safe food production, preparation, and storage of food will benefit society as a whole. Â Research investigating altering bovine intestinal conditions with different feeds as a means of reducing fecal E. coli 0157:H7 shedding has demonstrated that cattle fed hay rather than grain for a brief period before slaughter has reduced fecal shedding of pathogenic E. coli. Developing a human vaccine to prevent enterohemorrhagic E. coli infection may eventually provide herd immunity, protect against HUS, and provide value in low-income, high-risk dysentery settings.
