The overlying soft tissue of the nose varies in thickness, attachments, and composition among different ethnicities, and these factors should be taken into consideration when planning surgical procedures.

Nasal septal deviation is common. When performing cartilaginous septal manipulation with resection, a one-centimeter segment of caudal and dorsal cartilage should remain to provide structural support to the nose.

Surgical manipulation to the inferior turbinates should be undertaken conservatively to preserve their humidification functions. If surgical treatment is overly aggressive, a phenomenon known as Empty Nose Syndrome can present with pathological nasal dryness and mucus stasis.
