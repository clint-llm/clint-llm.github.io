The majority of morbidity and mortality from snake bites are secondary to the toxin production associated with the bite. Patients who seek proper medical attention within the first 6 hours after the bite have significantly lower morbidity and mortality.Â  Patients who are monitored and given supportive treatment during this period typically do not have any long-term side effects. Those with significant local tissue injury secondary to the snake envenomation may develop longstanding paresthesia, muscle damage, or even amputation in severe cases.
