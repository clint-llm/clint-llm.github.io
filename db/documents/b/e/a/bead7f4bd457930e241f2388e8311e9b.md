Non-tuberculosis mycobacterial lung infections are not as common as mycobacterium tuberculosis, but they are still serious and associated with high morbidity and mortality. Non-tuberculous lung infections are relatively uncommon with low physician awareness and a long silent period. These infections frequently get misdiagnosed and undertreated; their true prevalence suffers from gross underestimation. To avoid the high morbidity and mortality connected with these infections, they must receive a prompt diagnosis and treatment. This activity covers the evaluation and treatment of non-mycobacterial lung infections and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with these infections.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of non-tuberculosis mycobacterial lung infections. 
- Describe the typical imaging findings associated with nontuberculosis mycobacterial lung infections.
- Outline the pathophysiology of non-tuberculosis mycobacterial lung infection. 
- Describe the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with a non-tuberculosis mycobacterium lung infection.
