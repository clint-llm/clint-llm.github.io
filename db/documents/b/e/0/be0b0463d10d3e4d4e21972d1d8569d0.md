As mentioned above, monitoring the patient's weight loss periodically, typically after 12 to 16 weeks of therapy in the pediatric and adult populations, is recommended. Evaluation for appropriate growth and maturation in pediatric patients is important as well. Adverse drug reactions (ADR), such as new or worsened depression, hyperpigmentation, and sexual dysfunction in both males and females, should be monitored. In case of severe ADR, setmelanotide therapy should be discontinued.
