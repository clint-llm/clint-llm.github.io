MRA has similar complications as with MRI exams. A meta-analysis of 716,978 contrast-enhanced MRI exams from 9 studies revealed an overall rate of allergic-like reactions of 9.2 per 10,000 administrations, and a rate of severe allergic-like reactions was 0.52 per 10,000 administrations.

A recent study reviewed the MRI-related adverse event reports received by the Food and Drug Administration during a 10-year period.
