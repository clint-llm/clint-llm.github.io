Malunion: Either in the form of shortening, angulation, or malrotation. Where there is functional impairment as a result of malunion, surgical intervention would be indicated. This is either in the form of corrective osteotomy at the malunion site or metacarpal osteotomy that offers limited degrees of correction.

Nonunion: Usually of the atrophic type, however, it is an uncommon complication. There are various options of management including debridement, bone grafting, and plating, fusion, or ray amputation
