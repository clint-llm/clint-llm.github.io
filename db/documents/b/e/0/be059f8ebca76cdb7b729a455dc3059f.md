Relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma is challenging to treat due to poor prognosis secondary to treatment resistance and complications. Therefore, effective communication and collaboration among physicians, advanced practice practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, lab technicians, mental health caregivers, and social workers are essential in developing and implementing a comprehensive treatment plan for patients with multiple myeloma, resulting in improved patient outcomes and quality of care.

Involving palliative care in the management of multiple myeloma patients has demonstrated positive outcomes, including improved medication compliance, enhanced symptom management, and increased survival rates.
