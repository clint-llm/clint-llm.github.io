Acute aortic syndromes encompass three life-threatening conditions, including acute aortic dissection (AAD), intramural hematoma (IMH), and penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU). This activity reviews the interprofessional team's common presentations, evaluation, and management of this deadly trifecta of conditions. Despite the overlapping signs and symptoms of each condition, they are individual entities that can progress from one into the other or co-exist at presentation, with approximately 12% of patients with AAD also having IMH or PAU.

**Objectives:**
- Describe common presentations of acute aortic syndromes.
- Review best practices in workup and diagnosis of acute aortic syndromes.
- Explain treatment options for patients with acute aortic syndromes.
- Review risk factors and prognosis of patients with acute aortic syndromes.
