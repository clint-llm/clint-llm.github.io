With the growing need for catheterization procedures, it has become evident that appropriate management of the arteriotomy site has become essential. Although there are a variety of vascular closure devices that exist, as discussed in this article, it should be noted that manual compression remains the "gold standard" of treatment. Intriguingly, several studies have found that there is no overall benefit in clinical outcomes using vascular closure devices compared to manual compression; however, a significant reduction in time to hemostasis and time to ambulation was noted with the use of femoral access closure devices. Therefore interventional cardiologists and vascular surgeons must familiarize themselves with the different types of devices that can be used and the benefits and risks of each to certain patient groups.
