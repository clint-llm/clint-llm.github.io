UME may develop in the acute or chronic phase of the disease. The health care team's responsibility is to make the patient understand that there will be a need for several investigations from an ocular and systemic standpoint before any diagnosis may be made and treatment initiated. The interprofessional team constituting the ophthalmologist, physician, rheumatologist, radiologist, hematologist, optometrist, nurses, and hospital administration need to build a well-chained network for patient investigation and management.

Uveitis may be a manifestation of a systemic disease entity that needs a thorough evaluation by the physician and rheumatologist in conjunction with evidence from imaging and hematology reports. The initiation and long-term continuation of steroid and immunosuppressive therapy, along with the need for alteration in drugs depending on the ocular response, need good teamwork between the ophthalmologist, physician, and rheumatologist. In addition, underlying infective or non-infective conditions need simultaneous treatment to prevent the UME from becoming non-responsive to treatment and turn chronic.
