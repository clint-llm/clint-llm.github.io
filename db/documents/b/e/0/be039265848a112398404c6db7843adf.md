Exogenous HCM remains the most common form of HCM statistically, and patients using glucocorticoids must receive thorough education regarding the pros and cons of using hormonal products. The potential side effects have to communicate to the patient clearly, and the fact that long term glucocorticoid use can be dependence forming and often associated with euphoria, and a sense of well-being increases the potential for abuse and potential factitious overuse for which primary care providers need to be alert. Additionally, the primary care provider or the endocrinologist involved in the care of patients receiving these agents needs to be the central coordinator with all the other specialists that prescribe these hormonal products for therapeutic reasons to explore the possibility of steroid-sparing therapeutic alternatives, to ensure the use of the minimum dose of these hormones for the shortest possible duration of time and that responsible closely monitored efforts take place to wean patients off these products. For patients in whom discontinuing, exogenous glucocorticoids are deemed medically impossible; the same caregivers have to be central in partnership with the patient and the other specialists involved in the care of these patients to continue ongoing surveillance for potential side effects of long-term glucocorticoid use. For patients with endogenous HCM, the clinician needs to share the underlying cause, full treatment options, and prognosis of the condition with the patient. The potential of a full swing from cortisol excess to adrenocortical deficiency following effective treatment full detailing to the patient and precautionary measures are necessary to keep the patient safe.
