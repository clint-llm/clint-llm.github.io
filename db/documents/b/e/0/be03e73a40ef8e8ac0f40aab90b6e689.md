Mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 3 cause VHL. These mutations prevent the production or cause abnormal production of the VHL protein (pVHL). pVHL is primarily responsible for the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), a protein responsible for oxygen regulation in the cells. Abnormal or absent pVHL results in the uninhibited upregulation of HIF and multiple downstream growth factors leading to the formation of cysts and hypervascular tumors characteristic of VHL.
