Trichoblastoma (TB) and trichoepithelioma (TE) are benign hair-germ tumors that most commonly arise on the face and scalp of adults. Brooke first described TE as epithelioma adenoides cysticum in 1892. In 1953, Pinkus further modified its description and then individually by Lever and Montgomery in 1967 to include embryonic origins within pluripotent hair follicle germ cells.

TB was first described in 1970 by Headington as a differentiated follicular neoplasm, and in 1993 was further characterized by Ackerman et al. in 1993 to include all benign hair-germ cell tumors.
