Monitoring blood pressure and urine flow is necessary — monitoring of more advanced hemodynamic parameters such as cardiac output, including rhythm and pulmonary wedge pressure, is also recommended. It is worth noting that dopamine agonists and mimetics that cross the blood-brain barrier interact with the neurological circuitry involved in motor, executive, and limbic functions, including addiction-linked reward systems, impulse control mechanisms, and arousal. Thus, the cessation of DA therapies may lead to a condition called dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome. This condition has wide-ranging symptoms, including anxiety, depression, panic attacks, fatigue, hypotension, nausea, irritability, and even suicidal ideations.
