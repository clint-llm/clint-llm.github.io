Gastrocnemius muscle innervation receives its nerve supply from the tibial nerve (S1, S2); the soleus receives neural supply from the tibial nerve (L4, L5, S1, S2). Cutaneous innervation is also from the tibial nerve. The Achilles tendon is innervated mainly by the sural nerve (sensory contribution), with minor contributions from other smaller branches of the tibial nerve. Testing of the Achilles deep tendon reflex is common and involves bluntly hitting the tendon, ordinarily causing plantar flexion of the foot. This test assesses the sacral nerve roots S1 and S2.
