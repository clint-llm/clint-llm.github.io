Bleomycin administration is via the parenteral route, as the GI tract does not significantly absorb it. Bleomycin is quickly absorbed following intramuscular, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, or intrapleural administration and reaches peak plasma concentrations in approximately 60 minutes. The half-life of bleomycin varies between patients and depends on a variety of factors, including the route of administration. Less than 1% of the drug given intravenously binds to plasma proteins, leading to high bioavailability.
