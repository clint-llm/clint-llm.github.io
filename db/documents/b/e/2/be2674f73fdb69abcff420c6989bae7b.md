As the diagnosis of rosacea is mainly based on clinical judgment, a large number of patients, especially those with mild disease, may remain undiagnosed. It is estimated that the worldwide incidence of rosacea is higher than 5% of the population. It favors adults between 30 and 50 years of age, affects females more than males, and is more commonly diagnosed in individuals with fair skin (phototypes I and II), affecting more than 10% of Whites.
