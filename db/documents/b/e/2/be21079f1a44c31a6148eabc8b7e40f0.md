Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is associated with substantial financial benefits without compromising on the quality of patient healthcare.Â It is associated with a decreased risk of pneumonia, sepsis, and mortality compared to invasive positive pressure ventilation.

Similar complications and contraindications exist for the varying modes of noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV), including AVAPS, and comprises the following:

**Complications**

- Mucosal dryness/plugging

- Nasal congestion

- Sinus/ear pain

- Claustrophobia

- Air leaks

- Fascial erythema/abrasions due to tight fascial mask

- Gastric insufflation

- Treatment failure

- Hypotension (seen in patients with cardiac dysfunction)

- Pneumonia (infrequent)

- Barotrauma (rare)

**Contraindications**

- Respiratory arrest

- Cardiac arrest/hemodynamic compromise/unstable arrhythmia

- Fascial trauma/surgery/burns

- Blockage of upper-airway

- Impaired cough reflex/swallowing (lack of airway protection)

- Profuse gastrointestinal bleeding

- Severe encephalopathy
