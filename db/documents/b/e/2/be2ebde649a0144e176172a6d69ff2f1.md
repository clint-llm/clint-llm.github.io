Pustular psoriasis appears as numerous discrete or confluent superficial, yellowish pustules on a background of erythema. Pustular psoriasis can be diffuse or localized. A full body skin examination should be performed, including careful evaluation of the mucous membranes and the nails for other signs of psoriasis and to exclude other causes of pustulosis.

Pustular psoriasis starts as red papules or plaques that quickly evolve into yellowish, superficial pustules on a background of erythema. The generalized von Zumbusch subtype usually presents with systemic symptoms like fever, joint pain, headaches, and leukocytosis. In contrast, the exanthematic subtype presents as an acute pustular eruption without systemic symptoms. The annular subtype is seen more frequently in children as annular lesions with pustules along the advancing edge.
