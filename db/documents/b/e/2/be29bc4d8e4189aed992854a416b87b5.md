The lower extremities are especially prone to the repetitive microtrauma-induced complications of polyneuropathy. There is an increased propensity to develop not only recurrent neuropathic ulcers but Charcot neuroarthropathy and, to a lesser extent, motor neuropathy. Additionally, as patients age, their nails become dystrophic, and the risk of subungual ulcerations, gangrene, and osteomyelitis increases with decreased protective sensation. Periodic pedal-focused examinations are essential. Professional foot care, along with therapeutic shoes and insoles, have helped to reduce the lower limb amputation rates in patients with diabetes mellitus.
