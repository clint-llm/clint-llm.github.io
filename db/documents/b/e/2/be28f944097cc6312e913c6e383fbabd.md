Harlequin syndrome is a rare dysautonomic syndrome caused by the unilateral blockade of the T2-T3 fibers carrying sudomotor and vasomotor supply to the face. It results in hemifacial discoloration with half of the flushed hyperemic face sharply differentiated in the midline from the other pale half. It can be caused by an injury, compression, or blockade of sympathetic fibers along the pathway. However, almost half of the cases are idiopathic. It has been reported following many surgical and anesthetic procedures. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of Harlequin syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of Harlequin syndrome.
- Review the different procedures associated with the Harlequin sign.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with Harlequin syndromes.
- Summarize the management and role of the interprofessional team to improve patient outcomes.
