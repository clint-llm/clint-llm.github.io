Antibody deficientÂ disorders may present soon after birth with recurrent infections. Because the management of these disorders is complex, they are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an immunologist, pathologist, infectious disease nurse/specialist, pediatrician, and a geneticist. The key is to identify the antibody deficiency and initiate prompt treatment. These patients need lifelong monitoring as they are susceptible to a variety of infections. The nurse should educate the patient and caregivers on the importance of handwashing, maintenance of good personal hygiene, need for vaccination and follow-up. The nurse should assist the clinician in coordinating close follow-up care. A specialty-trained pharmacist should assist the clinician in the management of antibiotic therapy and IVIG and providing patient and caregiver education in regards to expected complications of therapy. an interprofessional approach to evaluating and treating antibody deficiency disorders will lead to the best outcomes.
