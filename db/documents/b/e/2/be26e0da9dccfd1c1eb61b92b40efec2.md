Alcohol metabolism by the liver is primarily via two enzymes:

- Alcohol dehydrogenase

- Aldehyde dehydrogenase

Alcohol dehydrogenase converts alcohol into acetaldehyde, and aldehyde dehydrogenase converts acetaldehyde into acetate. The metabolism of alcohol increases the production of NADH by reducing NAD in the body. This shifting of metabolic balance toward the production of NADH leads to the formation of glycerol phosphate, which combines withÂ the fatty acids and becomes triglycerides, which accumulate within the liver. When lipid oxidation (lipolysis) stops due to alcohol consumption, fats accumulate in the liver and lead to "fatty liver disease." Continued alcohol consumption brings the immune system into play. Interleukins with the help of neutrophils attack the hepatocytes, and swelling of the hepatocytes known as the "alcoholic hepatitis" takes place. Ongoing liver injury leads to irreversible liver damage, the cirrhosis of the liver.
