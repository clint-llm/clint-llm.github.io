Efficient use of PCR by the interprofessional healthcare team can lead to early detection of bacterial and viral pathogens prompting earlier treatments. This can also further aid in preventing antibiotic resistance and viral outbreaks, respectively. The interprofessional health care team comprises a primary care physician, pathologist, infectious disease specialist, lab technician, and nurses.

The polymerase chain reaction is a nucleic acid amplification testing procedure that consists of denaturing, renaturing, elongating, and amplifying a short segment of DNA or RNA. This is implemented by incorporating DNA I polymerase, which is derived from Thermus aquaticus, also known as Taq polymerase. Taq polymerase consists of thermostable properties preventing the irreversible alteration of the DNA or RNA physical and chemical properties, making it ideal for the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction procedure for diagnosing a wide range of bacterial and viral infections, as well as screening genetic diseases.

Laboratory technicians should be fully trained in the safe handling and use of samples to ensure quality and prevent contamination. Face masks, gloves, and hair caps should be worn at all times in the laboratory. Storage of solutions in their respective equipment (pipettes, glassware, plasticware) should be done with caution to prevent DNA from being exposed and contaminated. The interprofessional team of healthcare providers should be up to date with the latest guidelines and management strategies for patients with confirmed communicable diseases.

This integrated team-based approach provides care coordination from all interprofessional team members to further advance the health of patients suffering from infectious diseases. Patients should also be thoroughly informed on laboratory findings and counseled on preventative measures, and the importance of medication compliance is needed. Patients should also be educated on disease transmission and preventive measures they can incorporate to ensure public health and safety. Continuous communication between the healthcare team and their patients can help form a therapeutic alliance to prevent complications and spread of communicable disease, ensure patient and public safety, and preserve the quality of life.
