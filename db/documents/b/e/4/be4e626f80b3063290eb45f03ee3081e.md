Contrast agents, also called contrast media, are substances used to enhance the radiodensity of a targeted tissue by altering the way that electromagnetic radiation or ultrasound waves pass through the body. These substances can be administered orally, rectally, or intravenously. The type of contrast agent used depends on the modality and purpose of the imaging the patient will receive. The use of contrast agents has become ubiquitous in recent clinical practice. With the increase in contrast usage, concerns about the toxicities of the different agents have also increased. This activity reviews the etiology, prevention strategies, evaluation, and management of contrast agent toxicity and the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of contrast agent toxicity.
- Summarize presenting signs and symptoms that may accompany contrast agent toxicity.
- Review the treatment of contrast agent toxicity.
- Explain the importance of interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to aid in prompt diagnosis and appropriate management of contrast agent toxicity.
