The recurrent artery of Heubner (RAH) is typically the largest of the perforating medial lenticulostriate arteries arising from ACA. The recurrent artery of Heubner can arise from A1, from A2, or at the junction of the ACA-ACoA (anterior communicating artery) of the ACA. Later the artery characteristically turns posteriorly and runs in close relation to the gyrus rectus to reach the anterior perforating substance.

The recurrent artery of Heubner showed a mean diameter of 0.8 +/- 0.04, with a mean length of 23.4 +/- 1.1 mm in one study.

The recurrent artery of Heubner has vascular supply mainly to

- The head of the caudate nucleus

- The medial portion of globus pallidus

- Anterior crus of the internal capsule

- Anterior hypothalamus

- Nucleus accumbens, a connection between caudate and the putamen

- Parts of the uncinate fasciculus connecting the limbic system with the frontal lobe

- Diagonal band of Broca connecting the septal area to the amygdala and

- The basal nucleus of Meynert located in the substantia innominata
