Treatment follows the same principles as that for other causes of pancreatitis with the addition of alcohol cessation intervention during or after admission. Namely, these principles include

- Timely diagnosis, preventing recurrence and avoiding and managing complications

- Intravenous fluid therapy

- Analgesics and antiemetics

- Electrolyte replacement

- Feeding

- The current recommendations are also to initiate feeding trials within 24 hours of disease onset instead of keeping the patient nill per mouth (NPO).
- There are no clear indications for the type of diet, but typically small low-fat, soft or solid meals correlate with shorter hospital stays than starting a clear liquid diet with slow advancement to solid meals.
- Enteral feeds via a feeding tube are preferred to total parenteral nutrition in patients unable to tolerate PO.

- Involvement of intensive care for organ support if indicated

- The AGA currently recommends against the use of prophylactic antibiotics in predicted severe AP and necrotizing pancreatitis

Additionally, providing brief alcohol intervention during admission or repeated counseling regularly at primary care or gastrointestinal clinic appointments has been shown to decrease alcohol use, hospital admissions for recurrent attacks, and the development of chronic pancreatitis

Chronic pancreatitis pain can be managed with analgesics (avoiding high-potency opioids) and/or pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. Antioxidants may be helpful in cases where other pharmaceutical options fail

For those that medical therapy have failed, the following are options

- Endoscopic therapy

- Aims are to relieve obstruction through sphincterotomy, stenting, and dilation of strictures
- Lithotripsy procedures

- Neurolysis

- Nerve block

- Surgery
