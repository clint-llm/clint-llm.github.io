**Initial Management**

Initial management depends on the patient's clinical condition and probable etiology. If the patient is stable, most of the work can be done as an outpatient with regular follow-ups in the gastroenterology clinic. However, if the patient is febrile and showing signs of sepsis and hepatic dysfunction, admitting the patient for evaluation and treatment may be necessary. This is needed in patients with acute cholangitis, cholecystitis, and acute liver failure.

**Treatment**

Treatment varies widely depending on the etiology of biliary obstruction. Some common etiologies and board management are discussed below.

**Cholelithiasis and Choledocholithiasis**

- Gallstones with common bile duct (CBD) stones;

- CBD size less than 1.5cm with small stones- ERCP and sphincterotomy with cholecystectomy
- CBD size more than 1.5cm with large stones - ERCP and sphincterotomy with lithotripsy, choledochotomy, choledochoduodenostomy, choledochojejunostomy, or cholecystectomy

**CBD Stricture**

- Benign

- Endoscopic sphincterotomy and balloon dilatationÂ 
- Endoscopic stenting with stent removal/exchange at 4 to 6 weeks
- Biliary-enteric bypass if and when surgery is required

- Malignant

- Endoscopic drainage with stenting
- Percutaneous drainage with PTC with internal and external drainage
- Palliative biliary-enteric bypass in unresectable cases
- Resection of the tumor with biliary-enteric anastomosis in resectable disease

**Parasites**

- Medication

- Albendazole
- Mebendazole
- Pyrantel pamoate

- Surgical/endoscopic:

- ERCP with sphincterotomy and extraction using a basket.
- In the case of gallbladder invasion, cholecystectomy, CBD exploration, and T-tube placement

**Choledochal Cysts**

- Assessment for malignancy with ERCP and cytology

- Possible Excision and hepaticojejunostomy if required

**Neoplasm**

- Advanced disease

- Palliation with endoscopic biliary stenting and chemoradiotherapy or photodynamic therapy
- Percutaneous transhepatic endobiliary radiofrequency ablation along with biliary stenting
- Duodenal stenting in ampullary carcinoma

- Resectable disease

- Excision with clear margins and bilioenteric anastomosis

- Pancreatic head carcinoma

- Whipple procedure/pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy

- Ampullary carcinoma

- Whipple procedure

- Gallbladder malignancy

- Cholecystectomy with liver resection and lymph node clearance
