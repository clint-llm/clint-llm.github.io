Histopathology of the euthyroid sick syndrome is associated with a reduced follicular size and weight of the thyroid gland in chronically ill patients.

Patients with a history of chronic alcoholism have been found to have a reduction in the volume of the thyroid and also the development of fibrosis in the gland.
