Allergy testing can help prevent serious medical emergencies for patients by teaching themÂ what triggers their allergies or asthma. Knowing allergies in patients with other confounding medical problems can decrease further medical complications and decrease office and hospital visits. Being able to have some control can help them manage their asthma and allergies more appropriately at home. By doing this, patients can potentially decrease their medications, office visits, hospital visits, and improve their overall health and well-being. Results from the serum IgE and intradermal test help allergists decide the correct allergen dilutions to start with when initiating injection immunotherapy.
