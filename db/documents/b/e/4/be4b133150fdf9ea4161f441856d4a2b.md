According to information from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Rend-Results (SEER) database, as published on the American Cancer Society webpage, the 5-year relative survival rates for testicular cancer are;

- Localized disease (stage I) 99%

- Regional disease (stage II) 96%

- Distant disease (Stage III) 73%

Patients with testicular cancer are at an increased risk of secondary cancers because of their young age at diagnosis, high cure rate, and exposure to radiation, chemotherapy, or both. Tumors included malignant mesothelioma and those of the lung, colon, bladder, pancreas, and stomach.
