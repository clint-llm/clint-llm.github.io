To better understand arachnoiditis, it is important to increase the awareness of, the recognition of, and the reporting of this condition by various healthcare professionals. If more subclinical cases of arachnoiditis or mild cases of arachnoiditis are reported, it will help better identify the true frequency of this potentially debilitating condition and allow a better understanding of the various causes of arachnoiditis. More standardized and well-defined pathognomonic findings for arachnoiditis on imaging will be very important for making a timely and accurate diagnosis as well as important for avoiding unnecessary interventions, especially surgical interventions, which may exacerbate the condition. For instance, it is important to differentiate tumors from arachnoiditis since the appearance of interstitial edema, and cord swelling can mimic each other. An improved understanding of arachnoiditis and its exact causes will help medical professionals prevent it from occurring in patients, thereby improving outcomes.

It is crucial to raise medical awareness of the potential causes of arachnoiditis, especially iatrogenic potential causes such as spinal surgery, contrast pyelogram, and spinal injections. Given that many of the purported causes of arachnoiditis are iatrogenic, health care professionals need to consider the risks and benefits of an invasive spinal procedure, injection, or surgery and discuss this as a potential risk with patients.
