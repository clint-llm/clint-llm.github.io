Cutaneous melanoacanthoma is a rare benign epithelial lesion that typically presents as a solitary black plaque or nodule, usually on either the head and neck or trunk of an elderly individual in their seventh decade. The clinical features of a cutaneous melanoacanthoma mimic those of melanoma, and a biopsy is necessary to establish the diagnosis. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of cutaneous melanoacanthoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with cutaneous melanoacanthoma.
- Review the most definitive test for establishing the diagnosis of cutaneous melanoacanthoma.
- Describe the pathology findings associated with a cutaneous melanoacanthoma.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with cutaneous melanoacanthoma.
