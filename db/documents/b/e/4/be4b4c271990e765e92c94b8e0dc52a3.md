Chloroprocaine is contraindicated in patients with a known allergy to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA).

Chloroprocaine is pregnancy category C. Studies involving pregnant animals have not been conducted.  Despite the category C classification, chloroprocaine is used regularly on labor and delivery units throughout the world.  Low concentrations of chloroprocaine and only trace amounts of its byproducts (2-chloro-aminobenzoic acid and 2-dimethylaminoethanol) have been found in umbilical arterial or venous plasma after properly administered paracervical blocks (the rate of systemic absorption of local anesthetics increases paracervical > epidural > IM > spinal).

It is unknown how much chloroprocaine is excreted into breast milk, but based on the low amounts of other local anesthetics, it is not thought to cause infant toxicity.

Chloroprocaine should be used with caution in patients with end-stage liver disease as it is metabolized by pseudocholinesterase, which is produced in the liver. Somnolence and a prolonged epidural block have been described in a parturient with pseudocholinesterase deficiency.

Dosing for pediatric patients younger than four years old has not been established.
