Pes cavus typically presents in adolescence or early adulthood and is often a sign of an underlying neurological disease.

Through a combination of a history, physical exam, and imaging, the clinician should be able to diagnose if the deformity is forefoot or hindfoot driven. The clinician must also determine, primarily through specialized tests such as the Coleman block test, if the deformity is rigid or flexible.

Non-operative management may be considered, but in the majority of cases, where the underlying etiology is an HMSN, the cavus foot will continue to progress, and the deformity will become fixed and rigid without surgical correction.

Surgical interventions, including tendon transfers, osteotomies, and joint fusions, must be tailored to each specific patient’s clinical picture.
