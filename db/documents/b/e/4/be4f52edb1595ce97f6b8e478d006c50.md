There are 5.1 million patients with chronic heart failure in the United States, and heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization among adults greater than 65 years of age.

Since the first human heart transplant by Dr. Christiaan Barnard in 1967, a slew of disruptive innovations and multidisciplinary efforts have sophisticated the field.

Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a recognized long-term complication seen post-cardiac transplant. Considered a chronic fibroproliferative rejection to the transplanted heart, it is amongst the top three causes of death after the first year of transplantation. The prevalence of CAV in patients post-cardiac transplant at 1, 5, and 10 years was 8%, 29%, and 47%, respectively as described by the 2019 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) registry data report.
