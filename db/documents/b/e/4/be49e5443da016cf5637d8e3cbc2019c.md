Captopril is a widely prescribed drug in clinical medicine. All interprofessional healthcare team members need to work collaboratively and communicate openly to maximize therapeutic results. CliniciansÂ (physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners) who prescribe this medication for hypertension should be aware of its side effects and the need to monitor electrolytes and renal function. In some patients, captopril may produce a chronic cough, and in such scenarios, the drug should be discontinued, and another class of antihypertensive medication should be used. Nursing can provide patient counseling and answer questions. The pharmacist should keep track of the patient's medications to avoid polypharmacy and drug interactions and counsel the patient. This interprofessional approach will optimize patient outcomes. [Level 5]
