No specific monitoring is necessary per the package insert. However, considering that this medication is metabolized in the liver and excluded through the kidney, the levels of carisoprodol and meprobamate can potentially increase if the patient has decreased liver function or renal insufficiency. Therefore dose or frequency adjustments may be indicated.Â Also, given the significant abuse potential of this medication and given that it is a controlled medication, performing appropriate monitoring such as periodic urine drug tests and pill counts should be considered.
