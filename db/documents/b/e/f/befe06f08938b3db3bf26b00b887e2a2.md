The primary adverse effects of prednisone include hyperglycemia, insomnia, increased appetite, hypertension, osteoporosis, edema, adrenal suppression, cataracts, and delayed wound healing.

Adverse effects are common in patients receiving glucocorticoids in high doses or over a long period. High-dose prednisone is 40 mg/d or more. Potential adverse effects include skin fragility, weight gain, increased risk of infections, and fractures. Significant cardiovascular and metabolic effects are hypertension, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia.

Other adverse reactions include adrenal insufficiency, particularly when undergoing stressful procedures or during sepsis; this is typically diagnosable when the patient is hypotensive and not responsive to fluids, vasopressors, or cardiogenic medications. Once suspicion of adrenal insufficiency exists, treatment should be administered right away with a dose of 100 mg of hydrocortisone every eight hours.

Patients on high doses of glucocorticoids for 5 days or more should be tapered off the medication.
