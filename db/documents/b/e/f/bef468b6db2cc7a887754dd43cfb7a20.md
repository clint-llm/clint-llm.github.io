Facet joint injections are commonly performed to diagnose and manage facet joint pain (also referred to as lumbar spondylosis or zygapophyseal joint pain). Pain from facet joint etiology can be challenging to diagnose due to a lack of specific physical exam findings and imaging criteria. This activity will review the anatomy, indications, technique, and complications associated with facet joint injections and highlight the role of the interprofessional team in managing facet joint pain.

**Objectives:**
- Review the relevant anatomy and physiology associated with facet joint injection.
- Identify which patients would benefit from a facet joint injection.
- Describe the technique of performing a facet joint injection.
- Summarize complications associated with facet joint injection.
