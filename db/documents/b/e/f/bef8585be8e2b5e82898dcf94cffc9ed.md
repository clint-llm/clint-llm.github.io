The mechanism of action of rosuvastatin is inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. This enzyme is the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis, which reduces the production of mevalonic acid from HMG-CoA. Furthermore, this results in an increase of low-density lipoprotein receptors on hepatocyte membranes and stimulation of low-density lipoprotein catabolism. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors also decrease levels of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP). They also possess pleiotropic properties, including inhibition of platelet aggregation, anticoagulant effects, reduced inflammation at the site of a coronary plaque, and improved endothelial function.

Rosuvastatin is not extensively metabolized, with approximately 10% of a radiolabeled dose being recoverable as a metabolite. The pharmacokinetic properties of statin medications vary; however, rosuvastatin is unique in that its half-life is 19 hours, bioavailability is 20%, protein binding is 88%, possesses hydrophilic solubility, metabolized by CYP2C9, and primarily fecally excreted (90%) with only 10% urinary excretion.
