Flecainide acts on the fast-inward Na+ ion channel and has a high affinity to activated or open Na+ channels. It prolongs depolarization and increases refractoriness due to slow release from its binding site. It potently acts on the His-Purkinje system. It also works by inhibiting IKr channels, delaying potassium rectifier current resulting in prolongation of action potential duration in both ventricular and atrial muscle fibers. Flecainide is shown to block ryanodine receptor opening, which reduces calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum resulting after depolarization and triggered activity.

Flecainide is haptically metabolized via the CYP450 system; specifically, it is a CYP2D6 substrate. It is excreted in the urine and, to a lesser extent, the feces. Its half-life is approximately 20 hours.
