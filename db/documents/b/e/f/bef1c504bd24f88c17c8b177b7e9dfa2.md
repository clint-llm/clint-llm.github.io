An estimated 7.6- to 9.5% of the U.S. population reported one of 29 common autoimmune diseases in 2009.

**Systemic Autoimmune Diseases**

- Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: at least four of the following eleven criteria must be present: malar rash, discoid rash, photosensitivity, oral ulcers, arthritis, serositis, kidney disorder [most often lupus nephritis], hematologic disorder, neurologic disorder, immunologic disorder, and antinuclear antibody positivity

- Sjogren Syndrome: xerophthalmia and xerostomia with various renal, pulmonary, dermatologic, and nervous system manifestations possible

- Scleroderma: excessive deposition of collagen in the skin and internal organs; can present in both local and systemic forms (limited cutaneous systemic and diffuse cutaneous systemic); limited cutaneous systemic form is associated with CREST syndrome of calcinosis, Raynaud phenomenon, esophageal involvement, scleroderma, and telangiectasia

- Sarcoidosis: noncaseating granulomas in organs throughout the body, most commonly manifesting in the lungs as bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy but can also have ocular, dermatologic, cardiac, gastrointestinal, neurologic, and endocrine manifestations

- Rheumatoid Arthritis: symmetric synovial inflammation and morning stiffness > 30 minutes, and various extra-articular manifestations including rheumatoid nodules, amyloidosis, and systemic vasculitis

- Celiac Disease: duodenal villous atrophy and associated foul-smelling diarrhea and malabsorption upon consumption of gluten-containing foods

**Organ-Based Autoimmune Diseases**

- Type 1 Diabetes: autoantibodies to pancreatic islet cells leads to lack of production of insulin, resulting in hyperglycemia, polyuria, and polydipsia

- Crohn Disease: inflammatory bowel disease characterized by patchy, transmural lesions that can affect the entire gastrointestinal tract, with the possibility of fistulas, erythema nodosum, and pyoderma gangrenosum

- Bullous Pemphigoid: a subepidermal blistering disease caused by autoantibodies attacking the hemidesmosome; associated with symmetric tense bullae on the trunk, inner thigh, and flexures as well as urticaria, pruritus, and eczema

- Ankylosing Spondylitis: sacroiliac joint tenderness, lower back pain, peripheral arthritis, dactylitis

- Henoch-Schonlein Purpura: vasculitis associated with purpuric rash, arthralgia, gastrointestinal bleeding, abdominal pain, and nephritis

- Multiple Sclerosis: demyelination caused by chronic inflammation of the central nervous system results in spinal cord syndromes, optic neuritis, brainstem and cerebellar syndromes, and cognitive impairment
