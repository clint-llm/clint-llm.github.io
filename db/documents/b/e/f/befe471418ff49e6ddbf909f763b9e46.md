The complications can be either related to the tumor or surgical management. Gradual expansion of the tumor may lead to mandibular maxillary distortion leading to facial asymmetry, pain, teeth displacement, malocclusion, or recurrence. Distant metastases can be seen in cases of malignant tumors. Lungs and cervical lymph nodes are the most affected sites.

At the same time, surgical complications may be in the form of postoperative bleeding, which may be quite significant as it will endanger the airway patency, infection, neurosensory disturbance due to inadvertent injury of the inferior alveolar nerve. Other general complications may also occur, including aspiration, deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism. All necessary postoperative measures should be taken to avoid the occurrence of these complications.
