In individuals with normal hematocrit, fasting whole blood glucose concentration is approximately 10% to 12% lower than plasma glucose. Although glucose concentrations in the water phase of red blood cells and plasma are similar (the erythrocyte plasma membrane is freely permeable to glucose), the water content of plasma (93%) is approximately 11% higher than that of whole blood.

During fasting, capillary blood glucose concentration is only 2 to 5 mg/dL (0.1 to 0.3 mmol/L), higher than venous blood. After a glucose load, however, capillary blood glucose concentrations are 20 to 70 mg/dL (1.1 to 3.9 mmol/L) (mean approximately = 30 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L); equivalent to 20% to 25%) higher than concurrently drawn venous blood samples.

Glycolysis has been found to be inhibited, and glucose stabilized for as long as three days at room temperature by adding sodium fluoride (NaF) or, less commonly, sodium iodoacetate to the specimen.

Fluoride ions in high concentration inhibit the activity of urease and certain other enzymes; consequently, the specimens are unsuitable for the determination of urea in procedures that require urease and for the direct assay of some serum enzymes.
