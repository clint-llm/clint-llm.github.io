Recipient candidates must undergo an interprofessional care team review and workup before being listed for transplant. In the United States, heart-lung transplant recipients are currently listed under the heart allocation system to take advantage of more favorable wait times. The European system has a separate allocation for concomitant heart-lung candidates.

The donor should also be properly worked-up by the local organ procurement organization. Donation criteria are occasionally revised to maximize benefits in conditions of chronic international donation shortage. There are now standard criteria for lung donors and expanded criteria for lung donors.
