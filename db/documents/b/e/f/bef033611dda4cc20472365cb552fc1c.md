CLL is a complex disorder best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an internist/general practitioner, hematologist/oncologist, hematopathologist, and radiologist.

Given that most patients with CLL are asymptomatic, treatment is not recommended for everyone. The recommendation for treatment depends on severe disease symptoms or rapidly progressing disease. Symptoms such as severe fatigue interfering with daily activities, B-symptoms, recurrent infections, or increased tumor burden indicate early treatment. Rapidly progressing disease such as an absolute lymphocyte count doubling time of fewer than 12 months is also an indication for early treatment.

For patients who are not considered for treatment, regular follow-up at 3-month intervals is recommended. If the patient has developed increasingly abnormal laboratory finds or is symptomatically worse, further care should be discussed with the oncologist.  At the 12-month mark, depending on the symptoms and pace of disease, a decision on whether treatment is needed can be made.

Symptomatic CLL is treated, and despite many recent advances, it remains an incurable disease. However, the use of newer biological agents appears to be making some improvement in lifespan. For symptomatic patients, the outlook is dependent on various disease characteristics and underlying comorbidities, but those who are asymptomatic may have a normal life span.
