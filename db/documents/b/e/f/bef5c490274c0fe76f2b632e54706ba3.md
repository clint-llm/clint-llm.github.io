Overall, the treatment of paraneoplastic pemphigus remains controversial and undefined.

Medical treatment should aim at reducing inflammation, suppressing the immune response, and providing proper wound care. High-dose corticosteroids are considered first-line therapy. Additional systemic immunosuppressants (such as azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil) may be required if the disease continues to progress or is refractory to treatment with steroids alone.

While cutaneous lesions may improve within 12 weeks, mucosal involvement can be poorly responsive to treatment.

It is essential to recognize and address extracutaneous manifestations and secondary infections promptly. Loss of epidermal integrity places patients at significant risk of infection, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances. Ideally, PNP patients should receive treatment at a certified burn center for optimal wound care.

Occlusive, hydrating dressings should be used to prevent further fluid and electrolyte loss while promoting healing.

Anti-septic baths and topical antimicrobials are preferable to systemic medications.

Also, prophylaxis for side effects of prolonged corticosteroidÂ and other immunosuppressive therapies merits provider focus.
