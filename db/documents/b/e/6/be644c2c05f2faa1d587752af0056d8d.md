Aside from a thorough history and physical exam, appropriate imaging studies are also essential in the management of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Most patients have a computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to evaluate hemorrhage, ischemia, and anatomy. The most important study for pre-operative evaluation is a catheter angiogram to elucidate anatomy and hemodynamics.
