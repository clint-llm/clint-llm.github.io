- The tarsal tunnel syndrome is an entrapment neuropathy of the medial ankle.

- It is an uncommon but underdiagnosed cause of foot and ankle pain.

- The etiology is broad.

- Patients tend to have pain originating from the tarsal tunnel radiating down to the plantar foot; however, symptoms can vary.

- There is no best test to diagnose tarsal tunnel syndrome, and it is a combination of history, exam, imaging, and electromyography and nerve conduction studies.

- Conservative therapy can be tried in most patients.

- If a definitive cause is identified, surgical decompression can provide good results.
