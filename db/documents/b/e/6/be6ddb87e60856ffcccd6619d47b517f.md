Evaluation of a suspected patient with tropical pulmonary eosinophilia includes blood work-up, stool test, chest radiography, and pulmonary function tests.

- **Complete blood count**: Leukocytosis with eosinophilia >3,000/mm3 is the cardinal finding in a patient with TPE.

- **Stool examination**: To rule out other parasites causing the pulmonary eosinophilia syndrome.

- **Quantitative serum immunoglobulin test**: Elevated immunoglobulin E level is frequently seen in a patient with TPE.

- **Indirect ELISA test**: Diagnosis is confirmed by a rise in filarial antibody titers.

- **Chest x-ray**: May show reticulonodular opacities or miliary mottling in the middle or lower lung zones. About 20 to 30% of patients with TPE may have normal lungs. Fibrosis may be seen in advanced disease.

- **Chest CT scan**: May show bronchiectasis, lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion. It is done in cases where the diagnosis is not established.

- **Pulmonary function tests (PFTs)**: Typically shows a mixed pattern with a predominant restrictive and mild to moderate obstructive pattern.

The patient presenting with TPE-like syndrome due to other infectious causes may have serological tests that cross-react with filarial antigens. So, to differentiate TPE-like syndrome according to causes, there is a need for more specific tests.

**The diagnostic criteria for TPE**: (a) history of residence or travel to a filarial endemic region, (b) paroxysmal and nocturnal cough with dyspnea, (c) leukocytosis with peripheral blood eosinophilia >3,000/mm3, (d) elevated serum IgE and filarial antibody titers, (e) pulmonary infiltrations in chest x-ray, and (f) clinical improvement with DEC.
