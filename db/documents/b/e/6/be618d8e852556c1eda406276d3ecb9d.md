Renal trauma can result in injury to the parenchyma or the renal vasculature which can cause bleeding or injury to the collecting system with possible leakage of urine. Overall, genitourinary tract injuries are rare (10% of all traumas) with the most commonly affected organ being the kidney. Renal trauma accounts for about 1% to 5% of all trauma patients, the majority of which are due to blunt abdominal trauma (80% to 90%). This activity reviews the cause and presentation of renal trauma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of renal trauma.
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with renal trauma.
- Summarize the treatment of renal trauma.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by renal trauma.
