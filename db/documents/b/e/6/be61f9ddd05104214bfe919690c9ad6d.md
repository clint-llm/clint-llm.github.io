Hemosuccus pancreaticus is a rare entity for upper gastrointestinal bleeding. It isn't easily diagnosed and is easily missed. Practitioners should recognize it promptly, and further evaluation is warranted when intermittent abdominal pain and melena occurred. This will lead to improved recognition of potential complications, which, in turn, will dictate treatment strategies and improve management by the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with hemosuccus pancreaticus.
- Review the epidemiology of hemosuccus pancreaticus.
- Review the risk factors for developing hemosuccus pancreaticus.

- Summarize the risks associated with the angiographic method and surgical interventions.
