Understanding the physiology of uterine contractions allows clinicians to use targeted therapy for both the induction and cessation of labor. Commonly used medications for induction of labor include oxytocin, misoprostol, and dinoprostone.  Because uterine contractions dually function to minimize postpartum bleeding, these are the same medications used to manage postpartum hemorrhage. Carboprost, an analog of PGF2a, is an additional medication used to manage postpartum hemorrhage not used for the induction of labor.

Oxytocin is commonly used in modern obstetric practice to increase contractions when the labor process has failed in order to promote vaginal delivery.

Prostaglandins are active contractile agents and their analogs are used in combination with mifepristone (antiprogestin)for uterine evacuation for very early and second-trimester pregnancy.

In 2013, the FDA approved the use of progesterone supplementation (hydroxyprogesterone caproate) during pregnancy to reduce the risk of recurrent preterm birth in women with a history of at least one prior spontaneous preterm delivery.

Medications used to stop preterm labor antagonize uterine contractions. Commonly used tocolytics include nifedipine, terbutaline, magnesium sulfate, indomethacin, and atosiban. Figure 1 summarizes the medications used for induction of labor and tocolysis. Of these tocolytic agents, beta sympathomimetics, oxytocin receptor antagonists, and calcium channel blockers have the most promising data in terms of efficacy.

Understanding the normal pattern of contractions is also useful in defining the arrest of labor, which has different management based on the stage. For example, an arrested latent phase is an indication for augmentation with oxytocin, while an arrested active phase is an indication for the cesarean section. Defining the true arrest of labor requires analysis of the adequacy of uterine contractions, which requires the use of an intrauterine pressure catheter. Active phase arrest has specific requirements, which includes four or more hours of adequate contractions, or six or more hours of inadequate contractions. These definitions are essential for clinicians because they dictate management algorithms.
