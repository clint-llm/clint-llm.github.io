To prevent pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals, the following are recommended:

- Immunization against influenza (annually) and Pneumococcus. Vaccination against other encapsulated bacteria such as H. influenzae should also be done. Live attenuated vaccines are to be avoided, which include the intranasal influenza vaccine.

- Avoidance of unnecessary immunosuppression, e.g., avoiding unnecessary glucocorticoid use

- HIV-infected individuals should adhere to their antiretroviral therapy regimen.

- Compliance and adherence to antimicrobial prophylaxis

- Regular follow-up with a physician so that any abnormality may be caught early on.

- Maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle
