Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic that exerts its bactericidal effect by disrupting multiple aspects of bacterial cell membrane function. Daptomycin binds to the cell membrane of susceptible organisms and causes a rapid depolarization of membrane potential. The loss of membrane potential leads to the intracellular inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. This inhibition ultimately results in bacterial cell death. Daptomycin is only active against gram-positive bacteria.
