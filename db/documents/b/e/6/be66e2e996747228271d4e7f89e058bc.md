Patients are usually initially followed by a team of intensivists, surgeons, physical therapists, and speech/swallowing therapists in head and neck cancer reconstruction. Intraoperatively, an interprofessional group consisting of orthopedic/plastic/head and neck/oral surgeons, radiology technicians, surgical technologists, an anesthesiologist, and nursing staff must perform these complicated operations. When two surgical teams can operate simultaneously, the workload is divided operative time is decreased, which lowers the risk of perioperative cardiopulmonary complications.

Patients should be optimized medically before surgery, and the vascularity of the lower extremity should be evaluated with angiography or ultrasound. Careful preoperative evaluation of the patient will establish candidacy for microvascular fibular free tissue transfer and ensure the patient and surgeon share realistic expectations.
