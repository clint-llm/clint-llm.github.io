Fine-needle aspiration is contraindicated in any situation where it would not alter management; for example, if a patient has a large,Â isolated, and symptomatic pancreatic mass, there is no need to biopsy it since it already mandates surgical excision and, if malignant, runs the risk of seeding the needle tract with cancer cells.
