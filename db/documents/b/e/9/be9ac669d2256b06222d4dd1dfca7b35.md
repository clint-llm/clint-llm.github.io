Many conditions can cause pathologic changes to SVR. Some conditions can cause an increase or a decrease in SVR, and some pathologies can damage the walls of blood vessels. When blood vessel walls are damaged, their ability to dilate or constrict to adapt to hemodynamic changes becomes impaired. This damage often leads to too high resistance in that vessel, causing further damage to the vessel or preventing the flow of blood to that vascular territory.

Two common conditions that can disrupt normal SVR are diabetes mellitus and hypertension. In uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, chronic hyperglycemia can lead to the non-enzymatic glycosylation of the basement membranes of medium and small vessels in the body. This process contributes to atheroma formation.

An example of a pathology that may cause decreased SVR is distributive shock, such as in anaphylaxis, neurogenic shock, or sepsis. In septic and anaphylactic shock, massive amounts of cytokines are dumped into the circulation, which causes vascular dysfunction leading to a pathologic decrease in SVR.
