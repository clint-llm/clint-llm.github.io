Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is either a congenital or acquired disease, with the former being the most common etiology.

**Congenital Causes**

- Ureteral hypoplasia may lead to an aperistaltic segment of the ureter due to abnormal arrangement of the smooth muscle layer, which in turn will impair the urine drainage from the renal pelvis into the ureter and causes functional obstruction rather than mechanical.

- High insertion of the ureter into the renal pelvis can result in the failure of urine emptying from the pelvis into the ureter. This can be either primary or secondary to ureteral hypoplasia or renal scarring. Normally, the ureter is inserted into the most dependent part of the renal pelvis allowing free urine flow, while a highly inserted ureter will cause acute angulation in the ureteropelvic junction leading to functional obstruction with hydronephrosis.

- Entrapment of the ureter by a crossing accessory renal vessel, most commonly from the lower pole. This results in the kinking of the proximal ureter interrupting the free flow of the urine. This contributes to almost 50% of the surgically treated UPJO in symptomatic children.

- Rarely, a malrotated kidney can cause UPJO.

**Acquired Causes**

**Extrinsic**

This is mainly caused by an external compression on the ureteropelvic junction or the proximal ureter.

- Retroperitoneal fibrosis

- Retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy (e.g., testicular cancer, lymphoma)

- Retroperitoneal mass (e.g., sarcoma)

- Retroperitoneal freely mobile kidney might cause positional obstruction, by which the pressure on the ureter is affected by the position of the patient.

**Intrinsic**

- Ureteral wall and peri-ureteral scarring can result from an impacted stone, chronic inflammation, or radiation.

- Ureteric tumors such as transitional cell carcinoma of the ureteric urothelium.

- Iatrogenic

- The post-endoscopic procedures as ureteroscopy or endopyelotomy
- After open surgical procedures as pyelolithotomy or failed repair of a primary UPJO
