Methods used to make neurolysis include surgical transection, cryoneurotomy, thermal radiofrequency, neuroselective toxins, nonselective chemical ablation, and laser neurolysis. None of these techniques completely destroy the nerve.

Nonselective neurolytic chemical agents including phenol, ethyl alcohol, and glycerol 50%. Other compounds such as hypertonic saline (e.g., 10% NaCl), ammonium salts (e.g., ammonium sulfate 10%), and chlorocresol are less used. Neuroselective toxins include capsaicin and botulinum toxin.

The perineural administration of ethyl alcohol or phenol results in protein denaturation and neurolysis (Wallerian degeneration). This can produce long-lasting analgesia, with a duration of 3-6 months.

Capsaicin is a highly selective agonist for TRPV1 (vanilloid receptor 1) on unmyelinated C fiber nociceptors, provoking an influx of calcium and sodium ions and, in turn, depolarization of the nociceptive afferent terminals.

Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT) possess an analgesic effect through several mechanisms. Animal studies have shown that peripheral injection of BoNTs impairs the release of major pain transmitters such as substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and glutamate from peripheral nerve endings as well as peripheral and central neurons (dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord).

Peripheral cryoneurotomy (or cryotherapy) is performed through nitrogen or argon gas to create extremely cold temperatures to destroy diseased tissue. Studies showed that it resulted in good pain control for several years in patients with intractable neuralgia.

Radiofrequency denervation or ablation (RFA) or radiofrequency neurotomy, is a procedure commonly adopted in several non-painful conditions (e.g., cardiac arrhythmias, tumors, aesthetics dermatology, varicose veins) and for addressing pain. Through a medium frequency alternating current generated by a radio, a small area of nerve tissue is heat-treated, decreasing pain conduction from that specific area. The effectiveness of the technique depends on the application site. In general terms, it is possible to obtain a good result in over two-thirds of the patients. Concerning the duration of the effects, pain relief can last up to 12 months, but it can last for years. The indications for the technique are manifold. For example, this is approach is also used for treating migraines (sphenopalatine ganglion RFA).

Pulsed radiofrequency, which was first proposed by Sluijter ME as a treatment of neuropathic pain (NP), is a non-destructive, minimally invasive technique applied to the nervous system and has been widely administered clinically in many pain treatment centers.

Weintraub (1997) reported on the results of laser neurolysis in a series of 30 hands of 23 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome. The laser was delivered at a power of 9 Joules per point at 5 points along the median nerve. The investigators reported that 77% of cases achieved complete resolution of symptoms.

During all procedures, hemodynamic monitoring remains mandatory, and the care unit specializing in neurolysis must have the following equipment:

**Drugs**

- Chlorhexidine gluconate

- Local anesthetic, typically 2% lidocaine

- Regional block local anesthetic test solution (2% lidocaine)

- Chemical neurolytic agent (phenol, ethyl alcohol, and glycerol, capsaicin, and botulinum toxin)

- A 10 mL to 20 mL syringe with extension tubing

**Device**

- Block needle (length-variable depending on the region to be treated)

- Fluoroscopy equipment

- Nerve stimulator

- Ultrasound probe

- Radiofrequency probe

- Cryo machine and cryoprobe with cooling agents (i.e., nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide)

- Basic monitoring such as (electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure cuff, pulse oximetry, end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) for the entire procedure for observing symptoms due to inadvertent intravascular injection or other clinical conditions.
