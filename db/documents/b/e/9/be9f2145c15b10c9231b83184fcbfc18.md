The manifestations of a urachal anomaly depend on the location of the remnant tissue.patent urachus' results in a communication from the urinary bladder to the umbilicus, resulting in drainage of urine at the umbilicus, resultant dermatitis, and the potential for recurrent urinary tract infections. The presence of persistent tissue at the umbilicus without connection to the bladder can result in persistent umbilical drainage, dermatitis, and possible umbilical infection. A bladder diverticulum results when persistent tissue is connected to the bladder. A bladder diverticulum is typically of no consequence except in the instance when the diverticulum causes ureteral obstruction. A urachal cyst results when there is patency along the midportion of the urachus with the closure of the tract to both the umbilicus and bladder. Infection of the cyst can occur and result in abdominal or suprapubic pain with a palpable mass.
