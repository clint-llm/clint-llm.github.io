The levator scapulae muscle starts from the transverse processes of C1-C4 and inserts into the superior angle of the scapula. The action of this muscle on the scapula is an upward medial pull while aiding slightly in a downward rotation. The levator scapulae can also aid in drawing the cervical spine towards the same side shoulder.

The rhomboid major and minor originate off the spinous processes of C6-7 for the minor and T1-4 for the rhomboid major. Both muscles enter onto the medial border of the scapula with the minor typically inserting above the spine and the major inserting below the spine of the scapula. The action of these muscles to stabilize the scapula while the upper extremity is in functional use. Acting alone, the rhomboid major and minor can retract the scapula.
