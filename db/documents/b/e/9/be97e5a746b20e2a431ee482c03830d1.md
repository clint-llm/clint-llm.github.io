There is a compromise in the supply of nutrients reaching the fetus in FGR SGA. In an attempt to maximize the survival chance, the fetus responds to the reduction in its nutrient supply by reducing its overall size but preserving certain functions like brain growth, lung maturation, and increasing red blood cell production.

FGR SGA is divided into symmetric and asymmetric growth restriction. Infants with symmetric FGR SGA have a proportionate reduction in all organ systems, and the growth restriction typically begins early in the gestation. The incidence of symmetric FGR SGA ranges from 38% to 45%, and factors such as first-trimester congenital infection and chromosomal abnormalities have been implicated.Â In asymmetric FGR SGA, which constitutes about 55% to 61% of FGR SGA cases, the growth in head circumference is preserved while the length and weight are affected.

The growth restriction in asymmetric FGR SGA begins in the late 2nd or 3rd trimesters and usually results from a reduction in fetal nutrients due to placental or maternal factors. Continued brain growth is prioritized. Ponderal index (PI), which is a ratio of body weight to length (PI=[weight (g) x 100]/[length (cm)]), is an important tool to detect FGR SGA, especially in infants with asymmetric FGR SGA.
