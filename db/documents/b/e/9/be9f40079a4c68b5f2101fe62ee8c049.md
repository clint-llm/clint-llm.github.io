During the COMFORT trials, the most common nonhematologic adverse events included ecchymosis, headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, fatigue, and diarrhea. The most common hematological adverse events seen with ruxolitinib during the trials included anemia and thrombocytopenia due to the inhibition of JAK2, which plays a role in erythropoietin and thrombopoietin signaling.

It has been reported that patients taking ruxolitinib experience higher rates of herpes zoster infection and basal-cell and squamous-cell carcinomas.
