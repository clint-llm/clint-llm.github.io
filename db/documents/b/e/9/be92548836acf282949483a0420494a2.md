The exact underlying etiology of pituitary gland tumors is not yet known but most likely occurs due to genetic abnormalities and alterations. There are ongoing studies focusing on the underlying molecular mechanisms of pituitary tumor behavior. Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation by way of methylation, histone regulation

Some hereditary conditions are also related to an increased risk of pituitary tumors. For example, multiple endocrine neoplasias (MEN)-1 syndrome is often associated with pituitary adenomas. No environmental or lifestyle changes have been directly linked toÂ the underlying etiology of pituitary tumors, and therefore there are no preventable recommendations at this time.
