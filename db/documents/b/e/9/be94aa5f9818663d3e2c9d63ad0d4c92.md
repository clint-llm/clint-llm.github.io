Comprehensive first-trimester two-dimensional obstetric ultrasound includes transabdominal and transvaginal examinations.  Curvilinear probe (1 to 6 MHz) is used for the transabdominal approach, while high-frequency (7.5 to 10 MHz) transvaginal probe is the choice for the pelvic portion of the ultrasound.
