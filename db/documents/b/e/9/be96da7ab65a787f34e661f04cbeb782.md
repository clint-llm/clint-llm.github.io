Some conditions can mimic XLA thus a careful investigation to rule these out should be performed. These include Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy, common variable immunodeficiency, Autosomal-recessive agammaglobulinemia (ARA), and Combined T- and B-cell immunodeficiencies with agammaglobulinemia such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID).

Even with lab testing a few hints supporting a diagnosis of XLA include CD19+ B cell numbers which are usually normal in most other causes of hypogammaglobulinemia/ agammaglobulinemia except ARA and some types of SCID. The former can be ruled out using genetic testing for mutations in the BTK gene while the latter also has abnormalities in the T-cell number.

Certain atypical varieties of XLA with the delayed presentation are known which mimic other disorders such as CVID. They are characterized by the presence ofÂ B cells and antibody production albeit in low numbers. These patients have a less severe disease which peaks in intensity only in adulthood.
