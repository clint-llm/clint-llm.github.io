An extensive systematic review from 2015 provides evidence-based clinical guidelines for the treatment of amphetamines-related psychiatric disorders.

Clinicians should never delay the treatment of suspected amphetamine-related psychiatric disorders while awaiting urine or serum toxicology. Remission of psychotic symptoms usually resolves in one week with abstinence. This suggests most amphetamines-related psychiatric disorders resolve without the need for long-term pharmacologic therapy, instead of relying on abstinence and cognitive behavioral therapy combined with 12-step programs (Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous) to strengthen patientsâ€™ support system.
