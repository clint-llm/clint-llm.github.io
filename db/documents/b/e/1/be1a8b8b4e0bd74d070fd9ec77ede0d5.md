There are dozens of wound dressings and it is important for the interprofessional team caring for wounds to know the key differences between them. The key to wound healing is to ensure that there is an adequate blood supply and the wound is clean. A wound care nurse and a surgeon should regularly inspect the wound to ensure that it is healing. The dietitian should be involved in the care of the patient and ensure that the calorie intake is adequate. The floor nurses should change the dressings as scheduled and consult with the wound care nurse if there is any sign of infection or inflammation. The medical team should work together to monitor the progression of wound healing and report deviations of progression to the team leader.
