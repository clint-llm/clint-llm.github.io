Specialized structure of ependymal cells and blood vessels, collectively known as choroid plexus, produce the CSF that flows through the cerebral aqueduct. Throughout the ventricles of the brain, tufts of fenestrated capillaries make up the choroid plexus. At the rostral and caudal ends of the cerebral aqueduct lies a choroid plexus. In the third ventricle, branches of the posterior choroidal arteries contribute to the formation of the choroid plexus. In the fourth ventricle, branches of the anterior and posterior cerebellar arteries contribute to the formation of the choroid plexus.
