In general, elbow trauma can subdivide into the following categories:

- Traumatic injuries

- Soft tissue injuries range from mild, superficial soft tissue injuries (e.g., simple contusions, strains, or sprains) to traumatic arthrotomies following gunshot wounds or penetrating lacerations
- The osseoligamentous spectrum of injury encompasses fractures, fracture-dislocations, ligamentous injuries, and simple versus complex dislocation patterns

- "Simple" referring to no associated fracture accompanying the dislocation
- "Complex" refers to an associated fracture accompanying the dislocation


- Terrible triad elbow injuries

- Elbow dislocation

- Typically posterolateral direction with associated LCL complex injury
- Elbow dislocation is the two most common dislocated joint after the shoulder - most are posterior dislocations


- A radial head/neck fracture
- Coronoid fracture

- Attritional injuries

- Encompasses subacute or chronic presentations following various repetitive motion mechanisms

- Often seen in athletes involved in any upper extremity sport-related activity requiring repetitive motions (e.g., overhead throwers/baseball pitchers, tennis)
- Manual laborers with analogous occupational repetitive demands

**Traumatic injuries**

Traumatic injuries range from simple contusions to more complex osseoligamentous fracture-dislocation patterns.  The latter is often seen following a fall on an outstretched hand while the forearm is supinated and the elbow is either partially flexed or fully extended.  Direct trauma to the elbow, which often occurs from a fall directly onto the olecranon can yield various types of fracture- and fracture-dislocation patterns as well.  Additionally, isolated soft tissue injuries can range from mild contusions, sprains, and strains to more significant soft tissue-based injuries requiring clinical attention, such as deep penetrating lacerations or gunshot wounds (GSWs) resulting in traumatic arthrotomies.  While simple elbow dislocations most often resolve following nonoperative management alone, some patients develop recurrent dislocations or subluxation episodes.  These patients present commonly present with painful clicking and weakness.

**Attritional injuries**

Another form of elbow injuries consists of the subacute-to-chronic variety that occurs secondary to repetitive motions, eventually leading to various tendinosis conditions.  These can include but are not limited to, lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow), and chronic partial UCL injuries or strains.

**Pediatric considerations**

Elbow trauma in children most commonly occurs via sport or following falls.  Moreover, careful attention during the assessment is necessary, given the characteristic sequence of ossification center appearance and fusion, which can make the radiographic assessment rather challenging.  Commonly encountered pediatric elbow fractures include (but are not limited to)

- Supracondylar fractures

- Most common in childrenpeak ages 5 to 10 years, rarely occurs at greater than 15 years**Extension type**(98%): fall on an outstretched hand with fully extended or hyperextended armType 1: minimal or no displacementType 2: slightly displaced fracture, posterior cortex intactType 3: totally displaced fracture, posterior cortex broken**Flexion type**: blow directly to a flexed elbowType 1: minimal or no displacementType 2: slightly displaced fracture, anterior cortex intactType 3: totally displaced fracture, anterior cortex broken

- Lateral condyle fractures

- Medial epicondyle fractures

- Radial head and neck fractures

- Usually indirect mechanism (such as fall on an outstretched hand), and the radial head being driven into capitellum

- Olecranon fractures

Another common elbow injury in children:

- Subluxated radial head (nursemaid's elbow)

- Accounts for 20% of all upper extremity injuries in children

- Peak age 1 to 4 years; occurs more frequently in females than males

- Mechanism of injury: sudden longitudinal pull on the forearm with forearm pronated
