Similar to thrombosis at any other sites, coronary sinus thrombosis results from a combination of venous stasis, alteration of the coagulation profile, and vessel wall injury, for example, endothelial damage.

The following invasive right heart procedures have all been implicated in the etiology and pathogenesis of coronary sinus thrombosis

- Central venous catheter placement

- Coronary sinus instrumentation for ventricular lead placement during cardiac resynchronization

- Coronary sinus cannulation for retrograde cardioplegia during cardiopulmonary bypass for cardiac surgery (such as heart transplantation, mitral valve replacement)

- Bi-ventricular defibrillator placement in severe cardiomyopathy,

- Electrophysiologic ablations for arrhythmias such as supraventricular tachycardias

- Ventriculoatrial shunt insertion for hydrocephalus

The common factor in the etiopathogenesis of all of these cases has been endothelial injury leading to thrombosis.

Spontaneous non-iatrogenic coronary sinus thrombosis cases that do not involve endothelial injury, but rather involve either venous stasis or alteration in coagulation profile have been documented in association with preexisting disease processes including

- Atrial fibrillation

- Right heart failure

- Tricuspid regurgitation

- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

- Chronic cor pulmonale due to pulmonary fibrosis

- Kawasaki disease

- Acute lymphoblastic leukemia

It has been documented as a complication of infective endocarditis as well, specifically fungal endocarditis. Sepsis and disseminated coagulopathy play an additional role in precipitating spontaneous coronary sinus thrombosis.
