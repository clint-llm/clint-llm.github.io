Echinococcus is a parasite that leads to cyst formation in different viscera of the human body, particularly the liver and lungs. These cysts can rupture or acquire secondary infections leading to serious complications or may produce pressure or mass effects on the surrounding structures. To avoid this, they need to be diagnosed and managed properly. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of echinococcal disease and highlights the healthcare team's role in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of Echinococcus-related medical conditions.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of Echinococcosis.
- List the management options available for Echinococcal disease.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance Echinococcosis and improve outcomes.
