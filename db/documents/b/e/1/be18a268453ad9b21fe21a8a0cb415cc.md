Trichilemmal cysts may be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Patients with familial pilar cysts are often younger and often present with multiple lesions at the same time. They arise from the epithelium located between the sebaceous gland and the arrector pili muscle. They are most common on the head especially the scalp. The pilar cyst rate of growth is very slow; it takes several years to grow to a big size.
