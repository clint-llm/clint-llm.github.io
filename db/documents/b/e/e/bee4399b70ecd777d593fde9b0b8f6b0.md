Percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy should not be performed in patients with a left atrial thrombus, the heavily calcified mitral valve having morphology unfavorable for PMBC, and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (3+ or 4+). Other contraindications may include active infective endocarditis, acute thromboembolic stroke, mitral annular calcification, subvalvular fibrosis, and other valvular abnormalities requiring surgical correction. Mitral valve surgery is recommended in patients with symptomatic severe mitral stenosis with a contraindication to PBMV.
