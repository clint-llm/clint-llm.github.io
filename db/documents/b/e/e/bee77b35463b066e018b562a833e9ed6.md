Complications of Hurthle cell carcinomas are similar to thyroid neoplasms in general. They can cause complications in the neck by local invasion into the larynx, vocal cords, esophagus, trachea, or mediastinum and by compression of major nerves and vessels in the neck from bulky adenopathy. Metastases tend to occur in lymph nodes, lungs, bone, and infrequently the brain.
