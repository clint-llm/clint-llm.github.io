Human bites represent about 3% of the total bite injuries seen in the emergency department and are most commonly closed-fist injuries.  Bites in children are most often occlusion bites to the face and upper body from rough playing, while bites in the other age ranges are commonly at the metacarpal-phalangeal joint from striking another individual in the face or contact with another person’s teeth. These wounds are most typically found on the third, fourth, and fifth fingers at the MCP-joint. Occlusion bites predominate in presentation though this distribution may be skewed due to occlusion bites presenting as a known bite while closed-fist injuries (fight bites) typically present under altercation, assault, or other complaints that do not lend themselves to data collection and may only be incidentally found amongst other injuries. Fight bites are most commonly found in the teenage to young adult males.
