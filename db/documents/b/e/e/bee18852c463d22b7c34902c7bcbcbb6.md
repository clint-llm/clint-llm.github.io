Oxygen has been shown to be harmful to many tissues in the body via the formation of oxygen free radicals through normal metabolic processes. The higher PO2 used in hyperbaric oxygen therapy is thought to increase production of these harmful, reactive species. The body has natural defense mechanisms to protect against free radical damage. Superoxide dismutase, aÂ protective enzyme, acts to remove superoxide radicals and other reactive products of metabolism. Under hyperoxic conditions, it is thought that the increased production of these reactive species overwhelms the body's natural defense mechanisms which leads to oxygen toxicity and cellular damage.

The toxic effects of hyperbaric oxygen have damaging effects on the eye, particularly the lens. The most commonly reported symptoms are eyelid twitching, blurry vision, and visual-field disturbances. Many of the reported symptoms have been attributed to oxygen toxicity of the lens which leads to various complications such as myopia and the formation and progression of cataracts. The majority of ocular side effects are reversible, but some of the effects from prolonged therapy can be irreversible.
