Most cells in the body go through a cycle of life in which their genetic information is retained, fixed, and passed down to daughter cells through a highly coordinated and regulated process. However, during this cell cycle, there are many situations where mistakes are made by the cycle or by a regulating system that causes the cell to proliferate uncontrollably, leading to cancer. Somatic cells are the best know for this cell cycle and go through 2 main phases called interphase and mitosis.

During interphase, some subdivisions are important to cell division and maintenance of the genetic material. The subdivisions consist of G1, S, and G2.
