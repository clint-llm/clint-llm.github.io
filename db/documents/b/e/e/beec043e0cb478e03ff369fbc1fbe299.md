Appreciation of the regional anatomy and close structural relationship between the adductor pollicis aponeurosis and the UCL is central to the understanding of a Stener lesion pathophysiology.  Hung et al. described the anatomy as “ The PCL originates from the dorsal third of the metacarpal head and inserts on the volar aspect of the proximal phalanx. The ACL originates palmar to the PCL and runs continuously with the PCL to insert on the volar plate. The PCL is taut in flexion, while the ACL is taut in extension. Both ligaments ensure the ulnar stability of the MCP joint. The Adductor pollicis inserts on the proximal phalanx, functioning as a dynamic stabilizer of the MCP joint. It lies superficial to the UCL.”

The UCL lies deep to the adductor pollicies tendon.  A Stener lesion occurs when a complete distal, thumb UCL tear results in the interposition of the aponeurosis of the adductor pollicis muscle between the MCP of the joint and torn ligament.

This interposition results in the adductor aponeurosis acting as a barrier separating the ruptured ends of the ligaments preventing healing.
