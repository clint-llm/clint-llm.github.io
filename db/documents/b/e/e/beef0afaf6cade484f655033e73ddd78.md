**Cellular Senescence**

Telomeres play a crucial role in cellular senescence, and thus, biological aging. Cellular senescence refers to the irreversible loss of cellular division capability. The end replication problem, which describes the loss of base pairs during each S phase of cellular synthesis, can expose the ends of the DNA of a somatic cell, activating a process called DNA damage response (DDR). The purpose of this phenomenon is to prevent abnormal fusion of exposed chromosomal ends as well as chromosomal instability. Without telomere elongation, which is characteristic of most somatic cells, the telomeres will shorten. Telomerase has the ability to elongate telomere structures; however, with persistent telomeric DNA damage response activation, in addition to DNA damage, a senescence-initiating signal will be elicited. Cellular senescence, or replicative senescence, will also initiate when the telomere shortens to below a critical length.
