The costocervical trunk is in the upper thorax and the lower part of the neck, which is closely related to some critical structures like the vagus nerve, recurrent laryngeal nerve, phrenic nerve, sympathetic ganglia, and brachial plexus. On the right side, the vagus nerve runs anterior to the subclavian artery and medial to the costocervical trunk. The recurrent laryngeal nerve, which is a vagus nerve branch, runs medial to the costocervical trunk and posterior to the root of the subclavian artery. The right phrenic nerve runs lateral to the costocervical trunk. On the left side, the vagus nerve, recurrent laryngeal nerve, and phrenic nerve run medial to the costocervical trunk. The left phrenic and vagus nerve pass anterior to the root of the subclavian artery. The left recurrent laryngeal nerve is longer than its right-side counterpart because it loops around the aortic arch instead of the subclavian artery. The brachial plexus runs posterior to the costocervical trunk and the anterior scalenus muscle. The superior intercostal artery, one of the costocervical trunkâ€™s branches, runs medial to the anterior division of the first thoracic nerve. It also runs lateral to the first thoracic ganglion of the sympathetic trunk on both sides.
