The clinical presentation at the time of diagnosis is variable and could resemble other pathologic entities. The other tumors that appear as SPEN can be confused with mucinous cystic neoplasm of pancreas, neuroendocrine tumors with cystic features (cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma),Â serous microcystic adenoma, or intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). The definitive diagnosis has its basis on the combination of typical imaging findings and immunohistological assessments. There are currently no specific or sensitive tumor markers available to diagnose SPENs.
