Due to late diagnosis and limited therapeutic options, biliary tract cancer has the worst prognosis with a median survival less than 2 years and a survival rate less than 10%.

Although various chemotherapeutic agents are used in the treatment of unresectable tumors, the overall median survival remains only one year indicating the lethal nature of the tumor. Surgery provides the only potential cure for early-stage cancer, with post-surgery survival depending on factors as; margin status, the involvement of the surrounding structures, and metastasis.
