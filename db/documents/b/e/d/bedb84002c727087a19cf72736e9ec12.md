The vast majority of tumors of the peripheral nervous system arise from the cells of Schwann, rather than from the nerve cells themselves. Schwann cells, or neurilemma, are cells that are responsible for the production of the myelin sheath around neuronal axons. This activity reviews the presentation, pathogenesis, and management of patients presenting with neurilemmomas. We examine the complications and briefly explore the impact of the disorder on patients and highlight the importance of an interdisciplinary approach to treat these individuals appropriately.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the most frequent presentation of neurilemmomas.
- Summarize the pathophysiology of neurilemmomas.
- Explain the management of neurilemmomas.
- Explain the role of the interprofessional team in optimizing the management of neurilemmomas.
