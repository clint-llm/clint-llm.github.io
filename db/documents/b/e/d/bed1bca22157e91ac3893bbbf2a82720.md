There are few complications, most being with procedures such as fluoroscopic guided injections. Infection is a risk as well as damage to nearby anatomic structures. There are specific structures with each type of injection to be avoided. For injection of the interphalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints, the extensor tendons need to be avoided as they could become weakened with multiple needle sticks.

When injecting the tarsometatarsal joints, one must avoid the dorsalis pedis artery with the first, second, and third TMT joint injections. The posterior, middle, and anterior subtalar joint facets are approached from lateral, and the clinician must avoid the peroneal tendons as they can be damaged from needle sticks.
