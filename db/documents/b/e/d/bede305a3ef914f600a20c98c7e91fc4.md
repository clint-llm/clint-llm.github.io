While cases of isolated trochlear nerve palsy can be managed by ophthalmologists alone, patients with neurological etiology need collaborative effortÂ involving neurologists, radiologists, nursing personnel, and, at times, neurosurgeons and orthopedics. Any neurosurgical intervention, if needed, should be planned before any surgery for strabismus. Optometrists play an important role in non-surgical management by prescribing the required prismatic correction.
