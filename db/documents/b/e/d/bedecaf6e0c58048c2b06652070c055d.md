There are several cases in which applanation should be avoided or limited due to the nature of the testing method, which includes:

- The various methods used in applanation tonometry involve contact of the cornea with the instrument tip or with a column of air. Thus open globe wounds and traumas are contraindications.

- Goldmann and Perkins's applanation tonometry involves administering fluorescein and local topical anesthesia. Patients who do not tolerate these substances should preferably be assessed for IOP with alternative tonometers that are either non-touch or do not require drops or fluorescein.

- When performing tonometry, keratoconjunctivitis can be transmitted to the contralateral eye or other patients; thus, contact and air-puff tonometry need to be thoroughly disinfected or preferably avoided.

- GAT and Perkins require assessing the rings formed from the prism in the tip after direct contact with the cornea; thus, patients with central corneal scarring, elevated irregular astigmatism, unhealed corneal abrasions, and/or corneal ulcers should avoid IOP measurements with these tonometers.

- Most applanation tonometers (except for Perkins, which can be used in a supine position and is portable) require cooperative patients in an upright position. Children tend to have limited collaboration.
