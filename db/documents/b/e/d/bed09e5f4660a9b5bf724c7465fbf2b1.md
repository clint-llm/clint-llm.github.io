MDS is a clonal disorder of myeloid stem cells which may occur de novo or secondary to various insults to the bone marrow. Various environmental and iatrogenic etiologies have been implicated in MDS, including exposure to chemotherapy (alkylating agents in particular), radiation or environmental toxins such as benzene. Familial MDS has been reported but is a rare entity.SF3B1, TET2, SRSF2, ASXL1, DNMT3A, RUNX1, U2AF1, TP53, and EZH2.
RUNX1, for example, is a mutation noted to disrupt normal hematopoiesis. More than 100 genes have been found to be recurrently mutated in MDS, and these encode spliceosome components, chromatin remodeling factors, epigenetic pattern modulators, and transcription factors among others.

MDS may be de novo or related to prior use of chemotherapeutic agents, also known as treatment-related MDS (t-MDS). This entity is associated with a poor prognosis compared to de novo MDS and typically occurs five to seven years after use of chemotherapeutic agents. Alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide have been associated with this type of MDS.
