The developing limb buds blood supply comes from intersegmental arteries, which are a group of thirty arteries arising from the embryonic aorta. The lateral branch of the seventh intersegmental artery gives rise to the primary axial artery.   The primary axial artery becomes the brachial artery and its branches, including the profunda brachii artery.
