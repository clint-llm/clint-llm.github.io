Bochdalek hernia is a developmental defect in the posterolateral diaphragm, allowing herniation of abdominal contents into the thorax causing mechanical compression of the developing lung parenchyma and sometimes causing lung hypoplasia. As such, symptoms typically manifest in the pediatric age group and tend to be respiratory. Symptomatic adults are diagnosed rarely, with the majority of cases found incidentally. This activity explains the pathophysiology, relevant anatomy, evaluation, and management in patients with Bochdalek hernia. It highlights the role of the interprofessional team in treating and decreasing long term morbidity in patients with Bochdalek hernia.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology, and relevant anatomy of Bochdalek hernia.
- Outline the evaluation in a patient with Bochdalek hernia.
- Explain the management strategies in a patient with Bochdalek hernia.
- Explain the importance of a cohesive, interprofessional team approach to diagnose, resuscitate and manage patients with Bochdalek hernia.
