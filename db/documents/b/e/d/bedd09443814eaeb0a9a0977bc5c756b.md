Fluid balance, hydration, and acid-base status need to be monitored periodically during potassium replacement. Serum potassium levels require frequent monitoring in patients with renal impairment or with intravenous bolus potassium replacement. Regular potassium checks are also necessary when patients are receiving drugs that increase the risk of hyperkalemia (e.g., ACE inhibitors, potassium-sparing diuretics).
