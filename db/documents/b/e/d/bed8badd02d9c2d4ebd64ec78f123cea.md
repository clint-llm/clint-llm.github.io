Since carisoprodol itself likely acts at the barbiturate site, a carisoprodol overdose itself is not directly reversible with flumazenil, a GABA-A receptor antagonist. However, the primary metabolite meprobamate, similar to benzodiazepines, does work on the GABA A receptor.

Several case reports indicate that in overdose situations, there is direct cardiac toxicity.
