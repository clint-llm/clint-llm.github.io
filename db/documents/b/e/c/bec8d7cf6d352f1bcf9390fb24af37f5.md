Lymphomatoid papulosis is a non-aggressive T-cell lymphoma characterized by recurrent, spontaneously regressive papulonodular and sometimes, necrotic lesions, often disseminated with histologic features suggestive of a CD30-positive lymphoma. It accounts for about 12% of cutaneous lymphomas. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of lymphomatoid papulosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the histopathological characteristics of lymphomatoid papulosis.
- Summarize the epidemiology of lymphomatoid papulosis.
- Describe the treatment options for lymphomatoid papulosis.
- Identify interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with lymphomatoid papulosis.
