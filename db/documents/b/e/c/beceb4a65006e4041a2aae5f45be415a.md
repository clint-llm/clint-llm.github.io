Tinea barbae is a rare disease and is frequently misdiagnosed as more common conditions that affect the beard and mustache area like bacterial folliculitis, perioral dermatitis, pseudofolliculitis barbae, contact dermatitis, herpes simplex, sporotrichosis, acne vulgaris, acne rosacea,Â and rarely neoplasm.

Bacterial folliculitis or sycosis barbae caused by Staphylococcus species or other bacteria can be differentiated from tinea barbae by the presence of systemic symptoms like fever and malaise. Regional lymphadenopathy is more common with bacterial folliculitis, and hair removal is painless in tinea barbae in contrast to sycosis barbae. Pseudofolliculitis barbae is a form of irritant folliculitis caused secondary to shaving, and its presentation is bilateral and diffuse in comparison to tinea barbae. Candidal infections can be differentiated from tinea barbae by the involvement of adjacent mucosal surfaces.
