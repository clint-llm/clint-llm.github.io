LMI presenting as STEMI should be treated immediately. Early reperfusion has shown benefits with improved clinical outcomes.

Additionally, symptomatic management includes the usage of Morphine, Oxygen (in patients with hypoxemia), and nitrates (nitroglycerin).

LMI patients presenting as NSTEMI should receive initial medical therapy with oxygen (if hypoxic, Saturation of oxygen <94%), beta-blockers (Carvedilol, Metoprolol, Bisoprolol), and a statin (Rosuvastatin or Atorvastatin). Antithrombotic therapy including antiplatelet medications (using aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor such as Ticagrelor, Clopidogrel or Prasugrel) and anticoagulants such as unfractionated heparin should be initiated as soon as possible. NSTEMI patients have also shown better outcomes with early reperfusion strategy.

All patients with LMI should be placed on life-long therapy with aspirin, beta-blockers, and high intensity-high potency statins.
