Since the inception of IHS in 1955, the agency has been working relentlessly to improve the AIAN population's healthcare outcome. Although communicable diseases have drastically reduced within the AIAN community, the incidence of chronic conditions, cancer, obesity, and diabetes have risen to the forefront. The latest data available on the Center for Disease Control (CDC) website and the Office of Minority Health website gives an idea of the healthcare disparities in the AIAN community.

**Demographics**

- There are 574 federally recognized Indian Nations in the United States (also called tribes, bands, pueblos, nations, communities, and native villages). Alaska houses approximately 229 of these linguistically, culturally and ethnically, diverse nations. The rest of the federally recognized tribes are established in 35 other states. In addition to this, there are state-recognized tribes located throughout the United States recognized by their respective state governments. There also are tribes that the state or federal governments do not recognize.

- As of 2017, an estimated 5.6 million people identified themselves as AIAN. This comprises 1.7% of the entire US population.

- The 2010 Census reported that 78 percent of the AIAN population live outside of tribal areas.

- 22 percent of AIAN live on reservations or other trust lands. This is a sharp fall from the estimated two-third of the AIAN population living in reservation areas in the 1960s.
- 60 percent of AIAN live in metropolitan areas; this is the lowest metropolitan percentage of any racial group.

- In 2017, 28.7 percent of the entire AIAN population (1.6 million) were under 18 years. Arizona, California, Oklahoma, New York, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, North Carolina, Florida, and Alaska are the states with the largest AIAN population.

**Insurance Coverage (2018 data from CDC)**

- AIAN community has the largest percentage distribution of uninsured individuals amongst all races.

- Age below 65: 34.6 percent of AIAN alone or in combination had private health insurance coverage. 32.2 percent of AIAN relied on Medicaid or public coverage, and 28.8 percent of AIAN had no health insurance coverage. In comparison, 64.9 percent of NHW have private insurance, 20.1 percent have Medicaid or public coverage, and 10.1 percent have no health insurance.

**Life Expectancy and Overall Health**

- The 2015 life expectancies at birth for AIAN are 77.5 years, which very close to the national average of 79.8 years for NHW. The life expectancy for AIAN women is 80.3 years and 74.7 years for men. For NHW, the projected life expectancies are 82.0 years for women and 77.5 years for men.

- This is a marked improvement in the overall life expectancy compared to 1968, when President Johnson has stated that the average life expectancy of AIAN is 44 years compared to the national average of 65. 
- However, differences within different states exist.

- For example, in Alaska, a state with a 15% AIAN population, the age-adjusted mortality rate is 1222.6 per 100,000 AIAN population, which is almost 3.5 times higher than NHW (393.7 per 100,000 NHW population).
- Likewise, in Montana, where 9.3% of the population identifies itself as AIAN, the age-adjusted mortality rate is 1386.9 per 100,000 AIAN population, which is almost double compared to NHW (678.1 per 100,000 NHW population)

- The 2018 Infant Mortality rate in the AIAN population continues to be double at 8.15 per 1000 live births compared to 4.63 per 1000 live births in the NHW population. In some states, the differences in IMR are more vivid-

- For example, in Alaska, where AIAN constitutes 15% of the population, the IMR is 14.5 per 1000 live births, compared to 4.8 per 1000 live births in NHW.
- Likewise, in Montana, where 9.3% of the population identifies itself as AIAN, the IMR is 12.5 per 1000 live births, compared to 5.9 per 1000 live births in NHW.

- In 2018, 17.4% AIAN population reported being in fair or poor health compared to 10% of the NHW population.

**Chronic Health Conditions**

- 17.4 percent of AIAN reported having fair or poor health compared with 8.3 percent of NHW.

- AIAN have a rate of HIV infection twice as high as that of NHW

- In 2017, AIAN adults were almost three times more likely to have diabetes and 2.5 times more likely to die from the same than NHW adults.

- AIAN adolescents are 30 percent more likely than NHW adolescents to be obese.

**Tobacco Consumption**

- Tobacco consumption is highly prevalent in the AIAN community. This is different from the consumption of traditional tobacco that is used for ceremonial and medicinal purposes. The CDC's data alludes to the commercially produced tobacco from Tobacco companies as cigarettes, cigars, etc. The tobacco companies do NOT manufacture the 'traditional' tobacco- this is made locally within the tribes, and its use has been prevalent for centuries.

- AIAN youth and adults have the highest cigarette smoking rate among all racial and ethnic groups in the United States.

- They are more likely to have tobacco-related diseases and deaths. 

- Cardiovascular disease and lung cancer are amongst the leading causes of death in the AIAN community.
- The risk of developing diabetes is almost 40% higher amongst the AIAN community who smoke versus those who do not smoke.

- They also have the lowest motivation to quit tobacco amongst all races. An estimated 55.6% of AIAN report that they want to quit compared to 72.8% of African Americans, 67.5% of Whites, 69.6% of Asians, and 67.4% of Hispanics.

- More AIAN women smoke during their last 3 months of pregnancy—26.0% compared to 14.3% of whites, 8.9% of African Americans, 3.4% of Hispanics, and 2.1% of Asians/Pacific Islanders.

**Leading Causes of Death**

- Heart disease, cancer, and accidents are now the leading causes of death among the AIAN community.

- In 2018, chronic liver disease was listed by CDC as the fourth-leading cause of death in the AIAN community.

- Like the rest of the country, lung cancer leads the pack amongst the cancer-related deaths in the AIAN community.

- In 2017, accident, suicide and homicide were the top three reasons for death in the AIAN population between 5-34 years.

**Cancer Screening**

Cancer mortality rates for AIAN are among the highest of all racial and ethnic groups in the United States.

- In 2015, only 51.5% of AIAN women above 40 years of age received mammography compared to 65.3% of NHW women. However, one must note that where the percentage of NHW women receiving mammogram have stayed consistent since 2005 to 2015 (65-67%), the numbers have seen a sharp variation in the AIAN population (71% in 2005 to 62% in 2013 to 51% in 2015).

- In 2015, only 60.9% of AIAN women (18 years and over) received a pap smear, compared to 69.8% of NHW women. Again, a declining trend has been noted since 2005 in the pap-smear screening of the AIAN population.

**Psychiatric issues and Mental Health**

Mental health disorders are amongst the top 10 reasons for IHS hospitalizations and outpatient visits.

- Trauma and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder

- The people of the AIAN community are at a higher risk of experiencing trauma than the general population and are twice as likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder.
- The largest healthcare survey amongst the native tribes showed that two-thirds of people from the AIAN community reported levels of lifetime trauma, which is much higher than those in the general population.
- In addition to this, unintentional trauma, like a motor vehicle accident, is also higher in the AIAN community.

- Substance Abuse:

- The rate of substance abuse is also higher in the indigenous population than in the general population.
- AIAN adolescents (age 12-17 years) have a significantly higher incidence of marijuana use than NHW counterparts (6.1 to 3.3%). 
- Data from the 2007 to 2009 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) demonstrated that AIAN youth are more likely to drink alcohol, use cocaine, marijuana, or an over-the-counter prescription drug before 13 years of age compared to their NHW counterpart.

- Suicide:

- Suicide rates in the US are 33 percent higher than in 1999. However, it rose by 139 percent in AIAN women and 71 percent in AIAN men (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics).
- Native communities have a higher suicide rate compared to every other racial and ethnic group in the U.S.
- In 2017, suicide was the second most cause of death between ages 10-34 years in the AIAN community.
- For Native youth ages 15 to 19, the suicide rate is 2.3 times higher than the NHW.
- Overall the age-adjusted rate of suicide is 1.2 times higher in the AIAN community compared to NHW.

**Mental Health**

- In 2018, 4.5 percent of AIAN adults reported serious psychological distress.

- In 2018, 14.1 percent of AIAN adults received mental health services compared to 18.6 percent of NHW adults.

- 11.6 percent of AIAN adults received prescription medication for mental health services than 15.4 percent of NHW adults.

**Violence**

- Four in five AIAN women experience violence in their lifetime- Out of these, up to 56% experienced sexual violence, 55.5% experienced physical violence by an intimate partner, 48.8% experienced stalking, and 66.4% experienced psychological aggression from an intimate partner. This adds up to 1.5 million AIAN women experiencing violence in some form.

- A 2016 National Institute of Justice funded study found that AIAN women are at 1.2 times higher risk of experiencing violence than NHW women and 1.7 times higher in the previous year alone.

- The situation is no better with men either, where AIAN men are also 1.3 times more likely to experience violence than NHW men.

- AIAN women are 2.3 more likely to 'need' remedial services (like medical care, legal service, housing, advocacy) than NHW women. However, they are 2.5 times as likely to lack access to this case compared to NHW women.

- One in three AIAN women and one in six AIAN men cannot get the services they need in case of violence.

**COVID-19 and Impact on AIAN community**

Each pandemic brings an insurmountable amount of suffering in the world and exposes the fault lines in the healthcare of underserved communities. Historically all pandemics have hit the AIAN community much harder compared to other communities. For example, during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, the AIAN community had four times higher mortality rates than the general population.

The Color of Coronavirus (CoC) project looking at the racial disparities in the death toll from COVID-19 brings out the stark differences in the healthcare disparities in the AIAN community. The latest figures have reported that 1 in 475 Indigenous Americans has died (or 210.6 deaths per 100,000) through February 2021 since the start of the pandemic. This death rate is the highest amongst all racial and ethnic groups and is twice as high as NHW, which stands at 120.9 deaths per 100,000. As of Feb 2021, the CoC project has reported 4,506 COVID-19– related deaths in the AIAN community. In another study, collecting data between January to June 2020 from 14 states and representing 46.5% of all the AIAN population in the US reported that the age-adjusted COVID-19 related mortality was higher in AIAN (55.8 deaths per 100,000) compared to NHW (30.3 death per 100,000). Although the death rate amongst various age groups increased with increasing age for both AIAN and NHW, 35.1% of AIAN deaths occurred in age group less than 60 years compared to 6.3% in the NHW population. The mortality from COVID-19 on the AIAN community in different age groups is much higher compared to NHW. In the 20 to 29 year age group, the mortality is 10.5 times higher. In the 30-39 years age group, it is 11.6 times higher, and in the 40 to 49 years age group, mortality is 8.2 times higher in the AIAN community than NHW.
