Injuries to the rotator cuff (RC) range from simple contusions and tendonitis to chronic tendinopathy, partial tears, and full-thickness tears (PTTs versus FTTs). RC pathology can affect any subset of patient populations, from the casual “weekend warrior” to elite-level professional athletes. Similarly, RC pathology is seen across all ages.
