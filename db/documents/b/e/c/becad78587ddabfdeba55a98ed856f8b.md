With an average of 14 work-related deaths a day, or 5000 per year, in the United States, workplace safety should be of the highest priority for both employers and employees.

For fires to ignite, three components must be present. The first is a fuel source or something to burn, including clothes and linens, flammable gases and liquids, and human tissues, among other materials. The second is an oxidizer, which will significantly increase the combustibility of the fuel source. Oxidizers include gaseous oxygen and nitrous oxide.

The most significant issue of concern in fires is smoke inhalation. The acute danger of smoke inhalation is the effects that carbon monoxide and cyanide in the smoke may have on the binding capacity of oxygen to red blood cells. Because the affinity of carbon monoxide and cyanide to hemoglobin is higher than oxygen, the presence of these molecules can quickly lead to systemic hypoxia and death. The upper respiratory tract is especially vulnerable to the heat of the fire, given its proximity to the flames. These structures are prone to heat-related tissue injury that initiates an inflammatory cascade with molecules like substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and interleukin-8 to recruit polymorphonuclear cells to potentiate the inflammation further. Therefore, the upper respiratory tract structures become swollen and edematous, which can lead to airway compromise. The lower respiratory tract is less prone to heat injury but more susceptible to direct chemical damage from substances in the smoke such as carbon monoxide, cyanide, formaldehyde, and ammonia. Due to the lower respiratory tract injury, there is greatly increased blood flow to the lungs causing high capillary hydrostatic pressure and subsequent fluid transudation and edema.

The next issue of concern is burning. Scald injuries are the most common cause of burns in children, while open flames are most common in adults. The extent of tissue damage depends on how hot the exposure is and the duration of exposure. The burn will create a different pattern depending on the severity and depth with a central zone of coagulation necrosis, a zone of stasis that can be salvaged with rapid treatment, and a peripheral zone of hyperemia that will recover.

The total percentage of total body surface area affected by a burn is also crucial in determining the outcomes of a patient. More extensive burns that affect greater areas will require more rapid fluid resuscitation and monitoring for electrolyte imbalances due to the flux of fluids.

Other considerations include the increasing rate of wildfires that coincide with global climate change.

Considering the issues mentioned above of concern, OSHA has designated a number of requirements for hospitals to follow to ensure the safety of both patients and employees. While OSHA rules are primarily concerned with the wellbeing of workplace employees, the healthcare field is a unique exception in that fire safety rules also protect the patients receiving care from the healthcare facility. In the event of a fire, people must be rapidly evacuated to prevent fire-related casualties, so OSHA has developed many requirements to ensure hospitals have adequate exit routes from anywhere in the building. These include:

- An adequate number of exits.

- Exits must open directly outside or to an open area or walkway with direct access to outside. Importantly, these paths must be large enough to accommodate all people inside the building likely to use the exit.

- Exits must be well lit with appropriate signage indicating the exit route.

- Exits must be unobstructed and unlocked at all times while employees are present.

- In the event of construction or repairs, the exits must be unobstructed, and work must not begin until an equally accessible and safe alternative exit is made available.

Other employer requirements for fire safety include the development of both a fire prevention plan and an emergency response plan. These plans must be written and posted within the workplace when the number of employees is over 10. If there are less than ten employees, the plan may be verbalized to the group.

For the fire prevention plan requirement, the written plan must include a list of all major fire hazards, including various materials and chemicals, sources of ignition and how to control these, and the equipment needed to control the fire hazard safely. Also, other aspects of the plan include installing and maintaining safeguards on heat-producing equipment, determining the employees responsible for maintaining equipment for the prevention and control of fires, and the employees responsible for utilizing the equipment necessary to control the fire fuel source.

Specific daily tasks that must be part of the fire prevention plan include general housekeeping to store and clean up flammable materials and wastes, disposal of flammable waste, and cleaning and maintenance of heat-producing equipment. For the emergency response requirement, the plan must include evacuation procedures, procedures for employees that are actively performing rescues and medical duties, procedures to sound the employee fire alarm system, training on the emergency response plan, and reviewing the emergency response plan when an employee is hired, their responsibilities change, or the plan itself is changed.

An important hospital-specific consideration in the emergency response plan is the width of the exits. Standard doors are sufficient exits for most hospital employees, but a hospital bed can only fit through wide doors. Should a fire occur, wide doors would be necessary for evacuating patients who cannot ambulate so their beds can be wheeled through the safety door.

Additional requirements include providing proper training and safety measures for working with dangerously flammable materials like compressed oxygen, nitrous oxide, combustible liquids, electrical wiring and equipment safety measures, and placement of fire protection systems that include fire hoses, sprinklers, fire detectors, and employee alarms. These requirements are all the minimum requirements set by OSHA, so specific workplaces may exceed them but cannot fail to meet them. Checklists in the operating rooms have been used to identify fire risks and ensure plans are in place to extinguish them efficiently.

WhileÂ hospital fires are not very common, they can cause large numbers of casualties if fire safety guidelines are not followed.

Confinement is critically important to isolate the fire and prevent spread to other areas. Finally, extinguishing the fire with a handheld fire extinguisher can be done using the acronym PASS, which stands for pulling the safety pin, aiming at the base of the fire, squeezing the handle, and sweeping from side to side.
