Dermatomyositis is a rare autoimmune inflammatory myositis of unknown etiology affecting both children and adults. It involves striated muscles and skin. The juvenile form is associated with multisystemic vasculitis and a high frequency of calcinosis. However, unlike the adult form, it does not have an increased risk of malignancy. This activity explains when this condition should be considered, articulates how to properly evaluate for this condition, and highlights the interprofessional team's role in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the frequency of dermatomyositis.
- Summarize the expected pathophysiologic findings expected in juvenile dermatomyositis.
- Review the medical treatment of juvenile dermatomyositis.
- Outline the importance of enhancing care coordination among the interprofessional team to ensure proper evaluation and management of juvenile dermatomyositis.
