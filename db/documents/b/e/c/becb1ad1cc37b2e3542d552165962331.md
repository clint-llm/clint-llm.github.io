Alendronate is FDA-approved for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis, steroid-induced osteoporosis, male osteoporosis, and Paget disease of the bone. Alendronate is a bisphosphonate. Binding to hydroxyapatite crystals present in bone downregulates osteoclast-mediated bone reabsorption and decreases bone matrix breakdown. Both of these mechanisms contribute to regulating mineral reabsorption and turnover. This activity reviews the indications, target patient, administration, adverse effects, mechanism of action, and monitoring of alendronate as part of an interprofessional strategy in treating and preventing osteoporosis.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of alendronate.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of alendronate.
- Review appropriate administration for alendronate therapy to minimize some side effects.
- Summarize appropriate monitoring for patients taking alendronate.
