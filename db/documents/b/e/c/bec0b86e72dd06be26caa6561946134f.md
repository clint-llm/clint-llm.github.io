There is not a known antidote for zidovudine. Therefore, zidovudine should be stopped in cases of overdose or toxicity suspected from the use of zidovudine.

Three following case reports of zidovudine overdose:

- A patient who ingested 20 grams of zidovudine in addition to temazepam 6 hours prior to presentation complained of drowsiness but was otherwise well. His blood counts were trended, and his hemoglobin had a mild reduction to 12.5 g/dl three days after the overdose from his baseline of 14.2 g/dl.

- A patient who ingested 10 to 20 grams of zidovudine in addition to phenobarbital and triazolam 8 hours prior to presentation complained of headache and nausea. His vitals were stable, but a physical exam was significant for ocular nystagmus and upper and lower extremity ataxia. Hemoglobin was stable at 14.8 g/dl. He was given intravenous fluids and his nystagmus and ataxia resolved within 48 hours. At six weeks follow-up, his hemoglobin was 17.0 g/dl.

- A patient who ingested approximately 20 grams of zidovudine in addition to testing positive for benzodiazepines and tetrahydrocannabinol presented with baseline anemia with hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dl. At 24 hours, he was noted to be lethargic and fatigued. At 48 hours, his hemoglobin dropped to a nadir of 8.7 g/dl. The patient did well overall and was not observed to have any neurotoxicity or psychiatric disturbance.
