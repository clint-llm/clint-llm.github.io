Treatment of PG depends on the severity and the stage of the skin lesions. The main goal is to relieve itching and to avoid the formation of new blisters.

- PG is often treated with topical corticosteroids and oral antihistaminics especially in localized disease with minimal blistering. Patients that are resistant to topical treatment or have a severe form exceeding 10% of the body surface area require systemic corticosteroids. Treatment includes 0.3 mg/kg to 0.5 mg/kg (20 mg to 40 mg/day) of prednisolone, and in some cases, the addition of immunosuppressant agents such as cyclosporine or azathioprine for disease control.

- Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) have been utilized successfully in some cases. In one case of chronic gestational pemphigoid resistant to numerous treatments (corticosteroids, dapsone, azathioprine, IVIG), the disease has been controlled successfully with rituximab-anti-CD20 antibodies.

- Isolated cases of PG have been treated successfully with dapsone or sulfapyridine.
