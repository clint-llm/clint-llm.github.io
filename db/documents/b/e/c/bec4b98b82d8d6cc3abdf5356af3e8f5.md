Most cases of rectus hematomas are self-limited, non-life-threatening, and can be identified and treated successfully with minimal interventions. Even though fatalities have been reported, most of the fatalities have come to light during an autopsy. Rectus sheath hematoma mortality is higher in elderly individuals who are on oral anticoagulants. Pregnant women are at a higher risk for mortality. Anecdotal old reports reveal a mortality rate of 15% in the mother and nearly 50% in the fetus. However, it is important to know that these data were collected before the wide use of ultrasound and CT scans. Today, these imaging modalities can rapidly diagnose the condition.
