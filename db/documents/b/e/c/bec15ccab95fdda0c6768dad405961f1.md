Termination of life support is an important intervention that every physician needs to be aware of, as any patient who has reached an ‘end-of-life’ stage and consenting to it would qualify for its initiation. Providing appropriate and timely end-of-life care has been shown to improve the quality of life of the patients. When indicated and performed well, ‘termination of life support’ helps the patient achieve a ‘good death’ and provides comfort to the bereaved family. This activity highlights the significance of termination of life support for the interprofessional team.
