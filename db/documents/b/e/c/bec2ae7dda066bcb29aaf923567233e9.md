Complications of double orifice mitral valve (DOMV) include mitral valve dysfunction (mitral stenosis/mitral valve regurgitation) with resulting pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure. There have been cases of atrial arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter as a direct result of double orifice mitral valve, and as a result, patients may experience embolic strokes.
