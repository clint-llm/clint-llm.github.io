The treatment modalities of osteoma cutis depend on several factors, including its severity, extension, location, and etiology.

There are several treatment options proposed in the literature. Among the different treatment options, we can distinguish between non-invasive and invasive modalities.

Non-invasive treatment options include the application of tretinoin cream with limited results essentially in small and superficial lesions.

Invasive treatment modalities include a combination of dermabrasion and punch biopsy, erbium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (YAG) laser, scalpel incisions, curettage, and CO2 laser.

Ablative laser procedures using CO2 and erbium:YAG lasers may induce cutaneous pigmentary changes. Recently, some authors successfully performed non-ablative Q-switched neodymium:YAG laser treatments for miliary osteoma that did not induce pigmentary changes.

Concerning secondary osteoma cutis, the associated metabolic abnormalities must be investigated and treated accordingly. For instance, patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism may need calcitriol and calcium replacement therapy when hypocalcemia occurs.
