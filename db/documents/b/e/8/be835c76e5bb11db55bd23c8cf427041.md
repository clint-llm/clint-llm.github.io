A potential complication of human mAbs use against viral pathogens is that it may promote selection for escape mutants.

Since late 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has mutated drastically, with the accumulation of several mutations and deletions in the binding domains of various mAbs.

Therefore, monoclonal antibody therapy is **currently not indicated for the treatment of acute COVID-19**, even if they meet the criteria on their EUAs. This is because, as of January 2023, the dominant circulating variants and subvariants are not effectively neutralized by any of the previously authorized mAbs. The FDA and the NIH advise against their use until further notice.
