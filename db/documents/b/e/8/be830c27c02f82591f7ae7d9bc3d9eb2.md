Proper treatment should be sought out and implemented to prevent disease progression related to underlying medical conditions. The pain brought about by SFN may also cause dysfunction and inactivity in patients. For this reason, proper pain control is imperative for the continuation of physical activity to prevent complications of inactivity, including weight gain and depression.
