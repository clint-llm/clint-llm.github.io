While tick removal is generally straightforward, complications can occur.

Incomplete tick removal leaves residual mouthparts embedded in the skin. These mouthparts can cause local inflammation and serve as a nidus for infection. Signs of infection include erythema, warmth, swelling, tenderness, and purulent discharge.

Tick saliva is a known allergen. Localized and systemic reactions, albeit rare, may occur after tick removal. While a certain amount of erythema surrounding the bite site is usually expected, expanding erythema, wheal formation, urticarial reactions, and dyspnea are more indicative of an allergic reaction.

While not a complication of tick removal, tick-borne infections due to bacteria, viruses, and protozoa transmitted to humans during feeding can and do occur. The risk of disease transmission varies according to the species of tick and the geographical location.

Preventing tick bites to avoid complications includes avoiding tick-infested areas, applying diethyltoluamide (DEET) to the skin as directed on the product label, applying permethrin to clothing, and wearing clothing in a "downward cascade" configuration. For example, wearing pants that cover boot tops ensures that when ticks fall off, they do not lodge in boots.
