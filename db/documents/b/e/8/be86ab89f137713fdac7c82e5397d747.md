Enterovirus meningitis typically has a benign course, while enterovirus encephalitis can result in long-term neurological sequelae. Significant morbidity and mortality follow enteroviral meningitis in neonates and immunocompromised patients. Some subtypes of enterovirus, such as EV71 and EV68, are associated with more severe neurological disease and worse outcomes. The most common severe complications of enteroviral meningitis are meningoencephalitis, myocarditis, and pericarditis.
