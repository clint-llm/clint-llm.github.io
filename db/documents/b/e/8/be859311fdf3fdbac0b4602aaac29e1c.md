Primary teeth are relatively at a larger risk of caries than permanent teeth. They also have larger pulp with prominent pulp horns placing exacting demands on cavity design. Hence a full-coverage restoration is required. Although stainless steel crowns have an aesthetic disadvantage, they are still the treatment of choice for the following reasons:

- Durability

- Efficiency

- Longevity

- Cost-effectiveness

- Reliability

Even though other tooth-colored restorations are available in the market, they are either costly or require more tooth reduction, thereby increasing the chances of pulp exposure.
