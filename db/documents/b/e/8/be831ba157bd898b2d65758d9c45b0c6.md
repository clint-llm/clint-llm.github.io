When the embryo is no longer able to meet its respiratory, nutritional, and excretory needs, by simply spreading the nutrient fluids, it develops a system of vessels capable of distributing oxygen and nutrients to its tissues and transporting waste products.

Blood vessel formation begins with the development of blood islands or Wolff islets in the mesenchyme of the splanchnic mesoderm, before the yolk sac and later on the allantoid.

The blood vessels that develop in the wall of the yolk sac and the allantoid-chorion flow into an extra-embryonic network, which belongs to a pair of arteries and vitelline veins and a pair of allantoid arteries and veins which, through the umbilical cord, they penetrate the embryonic area.

Blood fluids are vital in the formation of the future child, as they generate valuable mechanotransductive information.
