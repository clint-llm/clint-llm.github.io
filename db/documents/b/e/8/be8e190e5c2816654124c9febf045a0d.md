Napalm burns at the same temperature as the flammable liquid used in its composition, typically gasoline, kerosene, diesel fuel, or benzene. Â Direct contact with flaming napalm results in full-thickness burns. Large surface area contact results in rapid loss of blood pressure, loss of consciousness, and death.
