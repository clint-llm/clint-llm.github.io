Evaluation of patients with cholinergic crisis involves a detailed history taking and physical examination for the toxidromes associated with the crisis.

Included in the evaluation are ancillary studies:

- **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**to check if there is an elevation of white blood cell count to rule out an infectious process.

- **Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)**to rule out electrolytes abnormalities related to organophosphate poisoning

- **Red Blood Cell Cholinesterase activity**is usually decreased, and this can help in confirming the diagnosis. Plasma pseudocholinesterase can also be used but is less accurate than red blood cell cholinesterase activity

- **Electrocardiography**to check for the presence of arrhythmia associated with organophosphate poisoning.

- **Chest X-Ray**to evaluateÂ for the presence of pulmonary edema or aspiration.

- **Head CAT scan**is indicated if the patient's mental status is altered or there are significant changes in the Glasgow Coma Scale.
