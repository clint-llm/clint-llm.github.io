Insulin is an anabolic hormone that elicits metabolic effects throughout the body.  In the pancreas, exocrine tissue known as the islets of Langerhans contain beta cells. Beta cells are responsible for insulin synthesis. By monitoring glucose levels, amino acids, keto acids, and fatty acids circulating within the plasma, beta cells regulate the production of insulin accordingly. Insulin’s overall role is to control energy conservation and utilization during feeding and fasting states.
