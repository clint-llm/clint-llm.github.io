Sucralfate administration can be via oral, rectal, and topical routes:

- **Oral forms:**
- Tablet - Sucralfate is a basic aluminum salt of sucrose octasulfate. When given orally, it disintegrates in the stomach in the presence of acid and binds to normal and damaged mucosa forming a protective layer. It releases aluminum and binds to positively charged compounds like proteins, peptides, glycoproteins, and glycolipoproteins, forming an adhesive layer, thereby protecting the mucosa. The onset of action is within 1 to 2 hours, and 1 g of sucralfate can neutralize 14 to 16 mEq of acid. The tablets are available as 1 g tablets.
- Suspension: Suspension is available as 1 g/10 mL or 500 mg/5mL.

- **Rectal:**Sucralfate tablets have been mixed with water to form a sucralfate paste enema: 2 tablets (that is, 2g of sucralfate) mixed with 4.5 ml of water and is an option in the treatment of hemorrhagic radiation proctitis. Sucralfate enema is also useful in solitary rectal ulcer syndrome and diversion colitis.

- **Topical:**Sucralfate is used topically in the treatment of skin conditions and also for mucosal ulcers.
