Job syndrome is a rare, primary immunodeficiency due to mutations in STAT3 and characterized by defects in immunity with eczematous and non-immunologic system disorders. Antenatal diagnosis is theoretically possible. However, the very low incidence and the sporadic nature in the majority of cases make this method without much interest. The treatment at the moment is purely symptomatic. A biological or gene therapy in the futureÂ could change the prognosis of this syndrome.
