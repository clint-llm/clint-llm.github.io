Botulinum toxin binds irreversibly to presynaptic nerve endings at neuromuscular junctions. Through receptor-mediated endocytosis, the toxin enters the cell and cleaves SNARE proteins, which are necessary for releasing acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft.

HBAT works by binding botulism toxin in the blood. In the Clinical Pharmacology Review submitted by Cangene, the reported that the polyclonal antibody fragments (F(ab’)2 and Fab) bind free botulinum toxin, which then prevents the toxin from being internalized at the post-synaptic cholinergic receptor. Because antitoxin only binds free botulinum toxin, it prevents the progression of symptoms but does not reverse any paralysis already present.

Prior formulations had non-fragmented antibodies derived from inoculated horses. While these are larger molecules than the new HBAT formulation, the fragmented antibody is less immunogenic and has less risk for serious adverse effects.
