Pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis represents end-stage malignancy, and the expected life span is usually poor though recent studies have noted an enhanced survival in the last two decades. The decision regarding the utilization as well as the choice of invasive diagnostic measures to achieve a definite tissue diagnosis should be decided on a case to case basis based on the nature and stage of underlying malignancy, the availability of effective and specific treatment measures, and most importantly the fitness of the patient to undergo a safe procedure. Presumptive diagnosis and palliative care need to be considered in patients with advanced underlying malignancy and in whom the life-threatening risks of invasive procedures far outweigh the potential benefit.
