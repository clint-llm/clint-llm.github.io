Fluoroscopy provides cost-effective, low radiation dose imaging that can help identify pathology and guide therapeutic interventions. Contrast agents help easily distinguish between different tissue types to aid in the accuracy of a procedure being performed. Communication between the physician performing the procedure and the fluoroscopy technician is essential to optimize viewing of the desired structures and increase the accuracy and speed of procedures being performed. Additionally, an interdisciplinary approach to contrast agents can help to reduce adverse effects associated with contrast-guided fluoroscopy.

The healthcare team needs to ask the patient about potential risks for contrast-induced acute kidney injury, such as a previous history of nephropathy, and inquire about previous adverse reactions associated with contrast administration. Such questions can be asked by nurses upon screening the patient prior to the procedure. In addition, although the physician should routinely be aware of kidney function laboratory studies before scheduling the patient for fluoroscopy with associated contrast, the whole team involved in the care of the patient can make an effort to check the medical record to see if any signs may suggest poor kidney function.
