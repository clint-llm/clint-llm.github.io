**History**

Clinicians should inquire about causative trauma, the age of the wound, the presence of a foreignÂ body, and symptoms of head trauma. They also need to assess the risk of wound contamination (e.g., bite wounds are at high risk). Further, the clinician should collect information on conditions and habits that may affect wound healing adversely, such as diabetes mellitus, history of keloids, steroid use, drug or alcohol abuse. Other important factors needed from history include allergies to local anesthetics and tetanus immunization status.

**Examination**

The wound should undergo proper assessment for length, depth, shape, contamination or foreign bodies, and skin loss.

Careful examination of the head and looking for signs of associated injuries such as skull fractures and intracranial injury is essential as they may require immediate intervention to prevent significant morbidity.
