Primary care providers are often the first to identify hypercholesterolemia in their patients and typically recommend bile acid sequestrants for their patients. Still, therapy requires an interprofessional healthcare team for optimal results. Nurse practitioners and physician assistants can be critical to ensuring proper patient follow-ups and monitoring the efficacy of treatments. Nutritionists and diabetes educators can also consult on the case to help educate patients on appropriate lifestyle modifications to support patients who need to make these changes while on bile acid sequestrants. Endocrinologists or cardiologists may offer consult when patients have a complex presentation, are unresponsive to bile acid sequestrants, or have severe complications from bile acid sequestrants. Nursing will be on hand to counsel patients, provide administration instruction, and monitor adherence and treatment results on subsequent visits. Importantly, pharmacists play a critical role in evaluating proper bile acid sequestrants administration and preventing polypharmacy in patients who are often taking multiple medications, checking for drug interactions, verifying dosing, reporting all findings to the rest of the team.

An interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, specialty trained nurses and educators, and pharmacists who are conversing across disciplines to optimize patient-specific management, is critical in utilizing bile acid sequestrants. [Level 5]
