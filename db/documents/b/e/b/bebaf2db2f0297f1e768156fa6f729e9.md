When evaluating a patient for hyperglycemia, the focus should be on the patient's cardiorespiratory status, mental status, and volume status. Bedside serum glucose can be obtained quickly. Testing includes serum electrolytes with the calculation of the anion gap, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, and complete blood count. Urinalysis by dipstick assesses glucose and ketones in the urine. Arterial blood gas or venous blood gas may be necessary if serum bicarbonate is substantially reduced.

**Blood Glucose Determination**

To determine if the patient has developed type 2 diabetes the patient needs to have the following outcomes on these tests:

- A fasting plasma glucose level of 126 mg/dL or higher

- A 2-hour plasma glucose level of 200 mg/dL or higher during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)

- Random plasma glucose of 200 mg/dL or higher in the presence of symptoms of hyperglycemia

- A hemoglobin A1c level of 6.5% or higher
