If the diagnosis is unclear from a patient’s history and non-invasive testing, a lung biopsy is an option. The histological features and distribution of fibrosis vary between types of non-IPF. However, fibrosis may be described as scarring or thickening of the interstitial tissue. In addition to fibrosis, the findings suggestive of a few subtypes of non-IPF are shown below:

Pneumoconiosis

- Peribronchiolar thickening and granulomas

- Asbestosis
- Asbestos body – iron coated asbestos fibers

- Berylliosis (chronic beryllium disease)
- Noncaseating granulomas and/or mononuclear infiltrates
- Found in samples of bronchial walls and lung interstitium
- Indistinguishable from sarcoid granulomas

- Coal mine dust lung disease
- Collections of carbon laden macrophages (coal macules)
- Coal nodules consisting of macules and fibrosis

- Silicosis
- Small fibrotic nodules present in the upper lobes
- Silica crystals may be seen under polarized light microscopy
- In acute silicosis, alveoli may be filled with lipoproteinaceous material similar to alveolar proteinosis

Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis

- Diffuse interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltrates

- Poorly formed nonnecrotizing granulomas and/or multinucleated giant cells with cholesterol clefts

- Peribronchiolar fibrosis extending to the periphery of the lobules (bridging fibrosis)

- Peribronchiolar metaplasia may be present in some cases

Sarcoidosis

- Noncaseating epithelioid granulomas with multinucleated giant cells

- Typically found in the bronchovascular bundles, septa, and pleura

- Asteroid body – stellate inclusions within giant cells

- Schaumann body – laminated calcium and protein inclusions found within giant cells
