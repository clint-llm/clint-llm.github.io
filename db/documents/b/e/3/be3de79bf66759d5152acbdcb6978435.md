Prehospital evaluation is limited to the quickly obtained history and physical, and vital signs. EMS providers can measure oxygenation with pulse oximetry. Oxygen saturation less than 90% to 94% signals hypoxia. Some EMS systems may employÂ capnography to measure end-tidal carbon dioxide to measure ventilation.
