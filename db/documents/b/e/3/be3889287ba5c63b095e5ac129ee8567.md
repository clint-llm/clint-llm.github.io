**Pregnancy**– Pregnancy is not a contraindication to cutaneous laser therapy. In the past, cutaneous or mucosal laser treatments during pregnancy were frequently postponed until after delivery, out of concern for maternal or fetal risk. However, a recent systematic review demonstrated that laser therapy in the treatment of gravid patients had not been proven as a significant risk to human fetuses in any trimester of pregnancy.

**Dark Complexions**- Darkly pigmented skin is not an absolute contraindication to laser therapy but can be a risk for worsened scarring, given the increased risk for pigmentation changes and scarring in this population. Special considerations are discussed in the "Complications" section.

**Suspicion of Malignancy in Cases of Pigmented Nevi**-  There is some controversy in treating nevi with lasers as a whole, as the disappearance of the pigment makes a nevus harder to follow in cases of unknown malignant potential. No lesion that is suspicious for malignancy should be treated with laser, and all patients with pigmented nevi should receive long-term follow up.
