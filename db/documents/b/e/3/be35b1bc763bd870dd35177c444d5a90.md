The LFCN is derived from a combination of lumbar nerve roots (posterior divisions of L2/L3 spinal nerves) and sometimes adjacent peripheral nerves. It emerges from the lateral aspect of the psoas muscle, passes under the iliac fascia, then crosses the anterior surface of the iliacus muscle as it travels toward the anterior superior iliac spine. It then passes under, through, or above the inguinal ligament and divides distally into the anterior and posterior divisions. The anterior branch provides sensory innervation of the anterior thigh to the knee, while the posterior branch provides innervation from the lateral thigh to the greater trochanter. The LFCN passes under the inguinal ligament in most patients but may enter the thigh lateral to the anterior superior iliac spine or in a more medial position near the inguinal ligament insertion on the pubis in a small fraction of patients.

Injury to the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve occurs due to external compression or from internal pressure such as from obesity, pregnancy, or tumors. Injury may also occur during surgery as the nerve enters the anterior thigh past the inguinal ligament. Metabolic causes from diabetes, alcohol, or lead poisoning may also result in an isolated nerve injury. Diabetic nerve injury of the LFCN may occur due to swelling from decreased axoplasmic transport or impaired sodium-potassium ATP activity via the sorbitol pathway activation by glucose.
