The diagnosis and management of cervical myelopathy are with an interprofessional team that consists of a nurse practitioner, neurologist, neurosurgeon, orthopedic surgeon, physiotherapist, and physiatrist. The treatment depends on symptoms and the degree of spinal stenosis.

Non-surgical management should include anti-inflammatories, physical therapy, ultrasound modalities, and at times, corticosteroid injections, but these all supply temporary pain relief. It is clear that once the symptomatology has started its progression, these short-term alternatives will not be a definitive treatment.

In the setting of progression, surgical management merits strong consideration. Surgery aims to increase the canal space, which will lessen/eliminate cord compression. It is now a general recommendation to surgically intervene earlier as opposed to a carefully waiting period. The surgical intervention can be done via an anterior or posterior approach.

The outcomes of these patients depend on the cause. Even though surgery is effective, it also has serious complications that can be life-threatening. The prognosis is good for patients who obtain symptom relief with non-surgical treatment.
