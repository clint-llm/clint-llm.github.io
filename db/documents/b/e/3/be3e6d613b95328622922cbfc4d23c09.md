The venous system approached mostly are right and left femoral veins. In the case of difficult coronary sinus cannulation, the internal jugular or subclavian vein approach may be used. Diagnostic catheters are inserted to allow pacing, stimulation, and signal recording at the high right atrium, right ventricle (apex or RVOT), His bundle, and the coronary sinus. The left side can be accessed through an antegrade transeptal puncture from the right atrium into the left atrium or a retrograde aortic approach.
