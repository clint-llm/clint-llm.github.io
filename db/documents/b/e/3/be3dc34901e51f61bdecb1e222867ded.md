While the mortality and prevalence of stroke have decreased over the past thirty years, from 40% to 33% in 2013, outcomes vary between populations stratified among race, geography, and comorbidities. Stroke is currently the third leading cause of mortality in the United States. Individuals who live in the "stroke belt," which predominately involves the Southeast United States, have a 20% higher mortality than those living outside this geographic area. Women have a higher lifetime risk and mortality than men, although stroke is more common in men. The incidence of stroke is more common in minority populations, specifically Hispanic and Black populations, with mortality occurring in younger individuals on average compared to the White population. An increased lifetime incidence of stroke is seen in those with more comorbidities listed under the etiology section above, with recurrent stroke most common in individuals with multiple uncontrolled risk factors. Posterior circulation strokes have been reported to account for as much as 20% of all strokes.
