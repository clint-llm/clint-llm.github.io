Brain magnetic resonance imaging will reveal hyperintense lesions in the midbrain tegmentum, thalamus, and basal ganglia. The changes resolve when recovery from the disease is complete.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis:

- sometimes show increased CSF protein

- negative for bacteria or virus

- oligoclonal IgG bands present

- mild/moderate lymphocytic pleocytosis

- normal glucose

Electroencephalography and evoked potentials: may present diffuse unilateral or bilateral slowing, with occasional focal sharp wavesÂ and altered evoked potential.
