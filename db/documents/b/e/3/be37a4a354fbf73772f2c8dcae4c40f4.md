The treatment of erythema annulare centrifugum is focused toward relieving any associated symptoms and resolution of the clinical lesions when no underlying disorder can be identified. If EAC is related to an underlying disorder, the cutaneous manifestations will usually resolve once the underlying process has been successfully treated. Topical corticosteroids can be applied to the advancing border of the lesions. Topical antipruritic and sedating antihistamines can be prescribed if there is associated pruritus. Some authors have advocated the empiric use of antibiotics or antifungal in the absence of an identifiable cause due to the associated with many infectious diseases. Although systemic corticosteroids can induce clinical remission, recurrences are common when the medication is discontinued. The following have been reported as beneficial based solely on case reports: topical calcipotriene, topical tacrolimus, NB-UVB, subcutaneous etanercept, oral metronidazole, and subcutaneous interferon-alpha.
