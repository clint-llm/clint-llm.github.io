To understand the drug's therapeutic index, one needs to know the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug. Regarding pharmacokinetics, the volume of distribution (Vd) of the drug is almost equal to the total body water when administered in the IV form. Vd varies with weight and age (elderly and pediatric).

The most common dose administered is 1.2 g/m²/day, given very slowly over 30 minutes for five consecutive days.

Dosing needs to be adjusted in renal impairment because the drug undergoes renal elimination.

The dose also needs to be adjusted according to the toxicity profile. Instances of severe leukopenia or thrombocytopenia require dosage reduction. More severe toxicity, such as encephalopathy, typically requires termination of therapy.
