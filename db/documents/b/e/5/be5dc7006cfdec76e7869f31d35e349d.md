Identifying a victim of child abuse, neglect, or maltreatment can be difficult, such as (1) when the child is nonverbal or too frightened or too severely injured to speak, (2) if the alleged perpetrator denies responsibility, and/or (3) if there were any witnesses. Clinicians may encounter victims of child abuse or maltreatment in many ways including:

- An adult or mandated reporter may bring the child in when they are concerned about abuse.

- A child or adolescent may come in disclosing the abuse.

- A perpetrator may be concerned that the abuse is severe and bring in the patient for medical care.

- A child may present for care unrelated to the abuse, and the abuse may be found incidentally.

**TEN 4**is a useful mnemonic device used to recall which bruising locations are of concern in cases involving physical abuse: Torso, Ear, Neck, and 4 (less than four years old or any bruising in a child less than four months old). A few injuries that are highly suggestive of abuse include diffuse retinal hemorrhages, posterior rib fractures, and classic metaphyseal lesions.

**Exclusions to Child Abuse**

Nothing in the PA CPSL requires a person who has reasonable cause to suspect a child is a victim of child abuse to consider the exclusions from child abuse before making a report of suspected child abuse. Exclusions from child abuse are considered/determined by DHS or the investigating agency after receipt of a referral/report.

**1. Environmental Factors:**No child shall be deemed to be physically or mentally abused based on injuries that result solely from environmental factors, such as inadequate housing, furnishings, income, clothing, and medical care, that are beyond the control of the parent or person responsible for the child’s welfare with whom the child resides. This exclusion does not apply to any childcare service under the CPSL, excluding an adoptive parent.

**2. Practice of Religious Beliefs:**If, upon investigation, the county agency determines that a child has not been provided needed medical or surgical care because of sincerely held religious beliefs of the child’s parents or relative within the third degree of consanguinity and with whom the child resides, which beliefs are consistent with those of a bona fide religion, the child shall not be deemed to be physically or mentally abused. In such cases, the following shall apply:

- The county agency shall closely monitor the child and the child’s family and shall seek court-ordered medical intervention when the lack of medical or surgical care threatens the child’s life or long-term health

- All correspondence with a subject of the report and the records of the department and the county agency shall not reference child abuse and shall acknowledge the religious basis for the child’s condition

- The family shall be referred for general protective services, if appropriate

- This exclusion shall not apply if the failure to provide needed medical or surgical care causes the death of the child

- This exclusion shall not apply to any child-care service as defined under the CPSL, excluding an adoptive parent

**3. Use of force for Supervision, Control, and Safety Purposes:**Subject to the "Rights of Parents" exclusion, the use of reasonable force on or against a child by the child’s own parent or person responsible for the child’s welfare shall not be considered child abuse if any of the following conditions apply:

- The use of reasonable force constitutes incidental, minor or reasonable physical contact with the child or other actions that are designed to maintain order and control

- The use of reasonable force is necessary

- To quell a disturbance or remove the child from the scene of a disturbance that threatens physical injury to persons or damage to property:
- To prevent the child from self-inflicted physical harm;
- For self-defense or the defense of another individual; or
- To obtain possession of weapons or other dangerous objects or controlled substances or paraphernalia that are on the child or within the control of the child

**4. Rights of Parents:**Nothing in the CPSL shall be construed to restrict the generally recognized existing rights of parents to use reasonable force on or against their children for the purposes of supervision, control, and discipline of their children. Such reasonable force shall not constitute child abuse

**5. Participation in Events that Involve Physical Contact with a Child:**An individual participating in a practice or competition in an interscholastic sport, physical education, a recreational activity or extracurricular activity that involves physical contact with a child does not, in itself, constitute contact that is subject to the reporting requirements under the CPSL.

**6. Child-on-Child Contact:**

- Harm or injury to a child that results from the act of another child shall not constitute child abuse unless the child who caused the harm or injury is a perpetrator.

- Notwithstanding the above bullet point, the following shall apply: Acts constituting any of the following Title 18 crimes against a child shall be subject to the reporting requirements under the CPSL:

- Rape as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. § 3121
- Involuntary deviate sexual intercourse as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. § 3123
- Sexual assault as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. § 3124.1
- Aggravated indecent assault as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. § 3125
- Indecent assault as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. § 3126
- Indecent exposure as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. § 3127

• No child shall be deemed to be a perpetrator of child abuse based solely on physical or mental injuries caused to another child in the course of a dispute, fight or scuffle entered into by mutual consent.• A law enforcement official who receives a report of suspected child abuse is not required to make a report to the department under section 6334(a) (relating to disposition of complaints received), if the person allegedly responsible for the child abuse is a nonperpetrator child.

**7. Defensive Force:**Reasonable force for self-defense or the defense of another individual, consistent with the provisions of 18 Pa.C.S. §§ 505 (relating to use of force in self-protection) and 506 (relating to use of force for the protection of other persons), shall not be considered child abuse.

**Reporting Suspected Child Abuse**Any person may make an oral (1-800-932-0313) or written report of suspected child abuse, which may be submitted electronically, or cause a report of suspected child abuse to be made to DHS, county agency, or law enforcement, if that person has reasonable cause to suspect that a child is a victim of child abuse.**Mandated Reporters**

**Confidential Communications**

General Rule: Subject to "Confidential Communications," privileged communications between a mandated reporter and a patient or client of the mandated reporter shall NOT:

- Apply to a situation involving child abuse

- Relieve the mandated reporter of the duty to make a report of suspected child abuse

**Confidential Communications - Clergy**

Confidential communications made to a member of the clergy are protected. Please note the following:

Pennsylvania courts have interpreted our clergy-communicant privilege as applying only to confidential communications between a communicant and a member of the clergy in his or her role as confessor or spiritual counselor. See, e.g., Hutchison v. Luddy, 414 Pa.Super. 138, 146, 606 A.2d 905, 908 (1992); Commonwealth v. Patterson, 392 Pa.Super. 331, 572 A.2d 1258 (1990); Fahlfeder v. Commonwealth, Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole, 80 Pa.Cmwlth. 86, 470 A.2d 1130 (1984). In summary, if the communication is in confidence and the person is seeking absolution, then it is considered privileged.

****Confidential Communications - Attorney****

Confidential communication made to an attorney is protected under Pennsylvania law SO LONG AS they are within the scope of confidentiality as per 42 Pa.C.S. §§5916 and 5928.

Relating to confidentiality in criminal proceedings neither the attorney nor the client is required or permitted to disclose confidential discussions between the two parties; unless this privilege is waived by the client

Relating to confidentiality in civil proceedings neither the attorney nor the client is required or permitted to disclose confidential discussions between the two parties; unless this privilege is waived by the client

**The Reporting Process**

A mandated reporter must immediately make an oral report of suspected child abuse to DHS via the Statewide toll-free telephone number (1-800-932-0313) or a written report via the self-service Child Welfare Portal (http://www.compass.state.pa.us/cwis).A mandated reporter making an oral report of suspected child abuse to the department via the Statewide toll-free telephone number under section 6332 (relating to establishment of Statewide toll-free telephone number) shall also make a written report, which may be submitted electronically, within 48 hours to DHS or county agency assigned to the case in a manner and format prescribed by DHS.The failure of the mandated reporter to file the written report described in the paragraph immediately above shall not relieve the county agency from any duty under the PA CPSL, and the county agency shall proceed as though the mandated reporter complied.Mandated reporters are required to identify themselves and their contact information when making a report of suspected child abuse. This provides documentation that the report was made but is also helpful so that, if clarification on the situation or additional information is needed, the children-and-youth caseworker can contact the mandated reporter.

**Contents of Report**A written report of suspected child abuse, which may be submitted electronically, shall include the following information, if known:

- The names and addresses of the child, the child's parents, and any other person responsible for the child's welfare

Law enforcement officials shall treat all reporting sources as confidential informants.

**Presumption of Good Faith**

For the purpose of any civil or criminal proceeding, the good faith of a person required to report suspected child abuse and of any person required to make a referral to law enforcement officers under the PA CPSL shall be presumed.

**Protection from Employment Discrimination**Basis for relief – A person may commence an action for appropriate relief if all of the following apply:

- The person is required to report suspected child abuse or encouraged to report suspected child abuse.

- The person acted in good faith in making or causing the report of suspected child abuse to be made.

- As a result of making the report of suspected child abuse, the person is discharged from employment or is discriminated against with respect to compensation, hire, tenure, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.

This does not apply to an individual making a report of suspected child abuse who is found to be a perpetrator because of the report or to any individual who fails to make a report of suspected child abuse as required and is subject to conviction for failure to report or to refer.

**Penalties for Failure to Report**

- A person or official required by the PA CPSL to report a case of suspected child abuse or to make a referral to the appropriate authorities commit an offense if the person or official willfully fails to do so:

**Continuing Course of Action**

If a person’s willful failure to report an individual suspected of child abuse continues while the person knows or has reasonable cause to suspect the child is actively being subjected to child abuse by the same individual, or while the person knows or has reasonable cause to suspect that the same individual continues to have direct contact with children through the individual's employment, program, activity, or service, the person commits a felony of the third degree, except that, if the child abuse constitutes a felony of the first degree or higher, the person commits a felony of the second degree.

**Multiple Offenses of Failure to Report**

A person who, at the time of sentencing for an offense under section 6319 of the CPSL, has been convicted of a prior offense under this section commits a felony of the third degree, except that, if the child abuse constitutes a felony of the first degree or higher, the penalty for the second or subsequent offenses is a felony of the second degree.

**Statute of Limitations**

The statute of limitation for an offense under section 6319 of the CPSL (described above) shall be either the statute of limitations for the crime committed against the minor child or five years, whichever is greater.
