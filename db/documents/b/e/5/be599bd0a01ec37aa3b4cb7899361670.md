Daily inspection of the access site and device patency should be performed during nursing rounds. In particular, nursing must disinfect injection ports, catheter hubs, and needleless connectors with institutionally approved antiseptics. Intravenous administration sets should be changed regularly per hospital policy. The site should be checked for bleeding, hematoma formation, and cellulitis signs, including erythema, purulent drainage, and warmth.

Dressings should be changed if visibly soiled. This must be performed with proper sterile technique. Importantly, any manipulation of the catheter site should be done using a sterile procedure. A bouffant cap, mask, and sterile gloves must be worn to minimize infection. The area should be cleaned with approved antiseptics, allowed to dry, and a sterile occlusive dressing must be replaced.

At interprofessional team rounds, there should be a daily discussion about whether or not the central venous catheter is still indicated. If deemed unnecessary for further management, the central venous catheter should be removed expeditiously.
