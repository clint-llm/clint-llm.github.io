Pancreatic ascites is due to leakage of pancreatic secretions into the peritoneum. Most often this occurs in the setting of a pseudocyst or walled off necrosis. Pseudocysts, in the setting of chronic pancreatitis, tend to have a less robust fibrinous wall and allow pancreatic secretions to leak from the disrupted duct, into the pseudocyst, and out into the peritoneum. At other times, pancreatic duct disruption without a pseudocyst will form a fistulous tract. Depending on the route of the fistula, fluid collections will manifest differently. Fistulas from an anterior pancreatic duct disruption allowÂ for pancreatic secretions to empty directly into the peritoneum leading to ascites. Posterior pancreatic duct ruptures allow for fistula formation through the aortic or esophageal hiatus or sometimes through the dome of the diaphragm leading to pleural effusions. In either case, the ascites is typically exudative with high amylase activity. Some have attributed this exudative quality to the pancreatic fluid causing an inflammatory process leading to increased vaso-permeability.
