# Introduction

Many patients are not aware of their olfactory deficits.

# Procedures

**History and Ear Nose and Throat (ENT) Exam**

Before performing the actual olfactory testing, it is important to take a thorough history and perform a physical exam.

**General Concept of Olfactory Testing**

Olfactory impairment may be quantitative (= impairment of the strength) and/or qualitative (= impairment of the quality or degree of distortion). Olfactory testing primarily provides information about quantitative impairment, while history gives crucial information on qualitative impairment (such as distortion).

The general concept of olfactory testing in the clinic is that an olfactory probe is presented at the patient’s nostrils, and the response of the patient is documented. This is also referred to as psychophysical testing.

**Odor Threshold Tests**

For odor threshold tests, probes with either phenyl ethyl alcohol or n-butanol in increasing concentration are presented sequentially and typically intermixed with probes with no odor (“blanks”).

**Suprathreshold Tests of Olfaction**

Suprathreshold tests use odor concentrations that are detectable by the patient. The most common suprathreshold tests used are odor identification tests such as the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) and the odor identification test with pen-like odor dispensing devices.

Another variant of suprathreshold tests for olfaction is a test for the hedonic value of an odor.

**Tests to Screen for Gustatory Abilities**

Patients often report impairment of taste when they have an impairment of smell.

**Subjective Olfactory Self-assessment**

We do not always become aware of olfactory signals (or their absence) and their impact on our behavior.

# Indications

Indications for olfactory testing include:

- Olfactory assessment is indicated when the patient reports on olfactory alterations.

- When the patient reports on impairment of taste and flavor but an impairment of olfaction is suspected, olfactory testing in addition to their gustatory abilities is indicated.

- Multicomponent olfactory testing may give additional information about the etiology of the olfactory decline.

- Olfactory assessment is indicated when an olfactory decline is suspected, but the patient does not perceive deficits with olfaction.

# Potential Diagnosis

**Olfactory Dysfunction Secondary to Sinonasal Disease**

This is one of the most common causes of olfactory dysfunction and often caused by rhinosinusitis (acute: < 12 weeks versus chronic ≥ 12 weeks) with hyposmia or anosmia as an important symptom besides rhinal symptoms (such as nasal discharge, pressure-like pain in the face and nasal obstruction).

**Post-infectious Olfactory Dysfunction**

This is typically caused by (severe) upper respiratory tract infection by a virus, and it is one of the most common causes of olfactory decline. The onset of perceived loss of smell and possibly loss of flavor perception may occur somewhat suddenly. Patients often report on parosmia (perception of an odor when an odor’s stimulus is present, but the perception is distorted). As with olfactory dysfunction secondary to sinonasal disease, olfactory testing with post-infectious olfactory dysfunction shows diminished odor threshold but normal odor identification.

**Posttraumatic Olfactory Dysfunction**

This may occur suddenly or with a delay after injury. Frequently patients describe phantosmia (perception of an odor when no odorous stimulus is present). Typically, olfactory tests show diminished odor threshold and odor discrimination ability, while odor identification is normal.

**Olfactory Dysfunction Associated With Neurological Disease**

Several neurological disorders are associated with olfactory decline, and thus diminished sense of smell is not specific to a distinct neurological illness.

**Olfactory Dysfunction Associated with Exposure to Drugs and Toxins**

Several drugs and toxins can cause olfactory decline.

**Congenital Olfactory Dysfunction**

This type of olfactory decline is present from birth and is severe. There is no parosmia. Besides olfactory testing, which typically reveals anosmia, information from neuroimaging is increasingly recognized as an important component in making the diagnosis.

**Olfactory Dysfunction Associated with Aging**

As with other sensory modalities, the sense of smell decreases with age. For instance, while about one-fifth of the general population has diminished olfaction,

**Other Disorders Associated With Olfactory Decline**

Several different conditions can cause diminished olfaction. These may include:

- Tumors (of nose and brain)

- Surgery of nose, sinuses, and skull (such as septoplasty or surgery of the anterior skull base)

- Disorders of the endocrine system and metabolic disorders (such as thyroid disorders and diabetes mellitus)

- Metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus

- Vitamin deficiency (such as deficiency of vitamin B12)

- Substance misuse (such as alcohol and cocaine)

- Nicotine use/tobacco use to some degree; however, this association is controversial.

**Idiopathic olfactory dysfunction:**

This diagnosis is made by carefully excluding all other causes of olfactory decline. Even though this diagnosis is the product of a comprehensive assessment, follow-up assessment with an interdisciplinary approach may be considered as the olfactory decline found could be an early sign of a neurodegenerative disorder such as Parkinson disease.

# Normal and Critical Findings

**Quantitative Olfactory Function and Dysfunction**

Normosmia: olfactory function is normal, compared to age- and sex-matched normative olfactory test values

Hyposmia: the score on olfactory tests is lower than the normal range, but the olfactory ability present is of some use for the patient in daily life (such as the ability to defect the fumes of fire and the odor of natural gas)

Hyperosmia: olfactory ability falls abnormally above the normal range.

Anosmia: no olfactory functioning is present

Functional Anosmia: the score on olfactory tests falls markedly below the normal range, but the olfactory function of the patient is not useful for daily life.

**Qualitative Olfactory Function and Dysfunction**

Parosmia: the perception of an odor when an odor’s stimulus is present, but the perception is distorted (for instance, the odor of a rose is perceived as the sulfurous odor of a rotten egg).

Phantosmia: the perception of an odor when no odorous stimulus is present (for instance, the perception of a flower fragrance but no odor stimulus such as a flower is present).

Cacosmia: when the perception of an unpleasant odor without the presence of an odor stimulus.

# Interfering Factors

Suprathreshold olfactory tests such as tests for odor identification and odor discrimination require semantic and episodic memory.

# Complications

There are no known complications of olfactory testing. However, the olfactory testing procedure may be experienced as tiring by patients as complete olfactory testing can take up to 30 minutes.

Following international guidelines, anterior rhinoscopy and nasal endoscopy should be done as part of the ENT evaluation to rule out intranasal pathology, potentially impeding the sense of smell.

# Patient Safety and Education

The patient is instructed that the olfactory tests will measure the lowest concentration of an odor the patient can detect and how well the patient can identify and differentiate odors. Furthermore, the patient has informed the tests will most likely help identify the cause of the patient’s olfactory disturbance, which in turn can lead to a specific treatment. Moreover, the patient will be educated that with some olfactory tests, an odor will not be consciously perceptible, but they will always be asked to answer, even if it is a guess.

# Clinical Significance

For several reasons, olfactory testing is of clinical significance.

In contrast, diseases of the brain which affect olfaction, such as Parkinson’s disease, negatively impact performance on suprathreshold tests while the odor threshold is normal. Thus, besides history and a physical exam, olfactory testing can be fundamental in making a diagnosis and therefore leads to proper treatment. Finally, olfactory testing is easy to do.
