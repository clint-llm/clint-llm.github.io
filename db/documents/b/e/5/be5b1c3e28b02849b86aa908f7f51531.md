The monosynaptic stretch reflex, or sometimes also referred to as the muscle stretch reflex, deep tendon reflex, is a reflex arc that provides direct communication between sensory and motor neurons innervating the muscle. This reflex begins inside the muscle spindle of the muscle, which detects both the amount and rate of muscle stretch. When the muscle experiences a stretch stimulus, sensory impulses are transmitted from the muscle spindle via Ia afferent fibers to the dorsal root of the spinal cord. Once in the dorsal horn of the gray matter of the spinal cord, the fiber synapses on the corresponding alpha motor neuron in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. This alpha efferent fiber then exits through the ventral root and courses back sends an action potential to the neuromuscular junction of the original muscle that initiated the reflex to the synapse to cause contraction. This contraction allows the muscle to resist the force that initially caused the reflex. In contrast, the polysynaptic stretch reflex involves a single sensory stimulus that synapses on interneurons within the spinal cord gray matter, which allows communication to multiple muscles for contraction or inhibition.
