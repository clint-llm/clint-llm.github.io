Management of Achilles tendinopathy can divide into conservative and surgical. Additionally, one must consider whether it is an acute or chronic condition. Finally, for those with a full rupture, the treatment is usually surgical.

**1. Conservative therapy:**It is the first line of management and includes the following

- Reduction of activity levels

- Administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

- Adaptation of footwear, manual therapy directed at local sites may enhance the rehabilitation

- Eccentric stretching exercises should comprise an integral component of physiotherapy and can achieve a 40% reduction in pain; moderate level evidence favors eccentric exercise over concentric exercise for reducing pain

- Tendon loading exercise at short- and long-term follow-up

- If unresponsive to initial management, extracorporeal shock wave therapy reduces pain by 60%, with 80% patient satisfaction, improving functionality and quality of life, with a follow-up at 4 weeks; this might be the first choice because of its safety and effectiveness

- Physiotherapy improves the pain and functionality of the Achilles tendinopathy of the middle portion; however, studies do not show preferences for any particular exercise over another - overall, use of a splint to an eccentric exercise protocol or the use of orthoses to improve pain and function are not a recommendation

- Current evidence shows a lack of efficacy on the use of platelet-rich plasma for Achilles tendinopathy

**2. Surgical therapy**is optional for 10 to 30% of patients who fail conservative therapy after six months.
