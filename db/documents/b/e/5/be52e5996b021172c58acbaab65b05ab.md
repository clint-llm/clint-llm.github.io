Rosacea is a common chronic inflammatory disease that presents with recurrent flushing, erythema, telangiectasia, papules, or pustules on nose, chin, cheeks, and forehead. Although usually limited to the skin, an association of rosacea with systemic comorbidities has been reported. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are required to prevent permanent scarring, persistent erythema, and ocular sequelae. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of rosacea and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.
