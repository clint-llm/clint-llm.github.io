Histidine is one of the nine essential amino acids humans must get from their diet and is present in most protein-rich foods such as meat, fish, eggs, soy, whole grains, beans, and nuts. Histidineâ€™s imidazole side chain is unique amongst amino acids, giving rise to its aromaticity and amphoteric properties at physiologic pH. This property makes it a key catalytic residue in many enzymes.
