MRA has the same contraindications as for the MRI exam without contrast medium. MRA does not use radiation, and to date, side effects from the magnetic fields and radio-waves have not been reported. Gadolinium-based contrast agents can cross the placenta; therefore, it should not be administered during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester.

**Non-contrast Study**

Absolute contraindication: A cardiac implantable electronic device, mechanical metallic heart valves, metallic foreign bodies, implantable neurostimulation system, cochlear implants/ear implant, non-removable drug infusion pumps, catheters with metallic components, cerebral artery aneurysm clips which are non-MRI compatible, tissue expanders with magnetic infusion ports.

Relative contraindications: Coronary and peripheral artery stents, programmable shunts, airway stents, intrauterine devices, ocular prosthesis, stapes implants, surgical clips, or wire sutures, penile prosthesis, recent joint replacement or prosthesis, inferior vena cava filter, physical limitations, and non-removable piercings.

**Contrast Medium**

Absolute contraindications: Patients who had a previous allergic or anaphylactic reaction to gadolinium, or patients who have a glomerular filtration rate below 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2.

Relative contraindications: A history of renal disease and dialysis. Patients with impaired renal function are at risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), which was previously called nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy. Pregnancy is also a relative contraindication.
