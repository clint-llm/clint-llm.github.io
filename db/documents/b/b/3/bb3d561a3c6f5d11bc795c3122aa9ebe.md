Patients typically present with anxiety, palpitations, chest discomfort, lightheadedness, syncope, or dyspnea. In some cases, a patient may present with shock, hypotension, signs of heart failure, lightheadedness, or exercise intolerance. Some may present without symptoms, and the tachycardia is discovered during routine screening, for example, at pharmacies or with fitness trackers. The onset is typically abrupt and can be triggered by stress secondary to physical activity or emotional stress.

Physical exam, aside from tachycardia, is typically normal in a patient with good cardiovascular reserve. Patients beginning to decompensated may show signs of congestive heart failure, (bibasilar crackles, a third heart sound (S3), or jugular venous distention).
