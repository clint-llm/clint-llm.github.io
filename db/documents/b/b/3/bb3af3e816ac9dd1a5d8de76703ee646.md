The clinical manifestations will be related to the pathogen. Ingestion of toxins (S. aureus) can lead to a rapid onset of nausea and vomiting within 6 hours of digestion. Patients may have fever, cramps, and diarrhea within 8 to 72 hours.

Enterotoxins like Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus cause watery diarrhea within 8 to 16 hours of ingestion. Viral infections are associated with cramps and watery diarrhea after 16 to 48 hours. Some pathogens are related to bloody diarrhea. These agents can cause symptoms up to 120 hours after ingestion. Some agents can cause manifestations within minutes, for example, copper, shellfish toxins, tin, and other seafood (pufferfish) through tetrodotoxin or scombroid with histamine release.

Overall, symptomatology is not the best way to narrow a possible etiology. Fever is not always present; although, this does not mean that there is no infection. The positive predictive value of dysentery is reduced as well. In the suspicion of acute gastroenteritis, appropriate laboratory testing is needed if the healthcare professional needs to verify the causative agent.
