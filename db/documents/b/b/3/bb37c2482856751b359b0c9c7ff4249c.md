Prostate cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in men. Worldwide, it is the second most common male malignancy (lung cancer is first). In 2018, more than 1.6 million men were diagnosed with prostate cancer globally and over 366,000 died from it.

The highest worldwide incidence of prostate cancer/100,000 population is in the following countries: France, Puerto Rico, Sweden, Norway, Estonia, Barbados, Ireland, Martinique, and Guadaloupe.

Prostate cancer incidence is 80% higher among non-Hispanic Black men compared to non-Hispanic whites. Mortality from prostate cancer among African Americans is roughly double the rate for whites. The reasons for this are unclear but appear to be at least partly related to genetic factors.

Prostate cancer is often clinically indolent, and many times no intervention is required. However, the disease can be very devastating. One of the most lethal progressions of the disease involves osteoblastic bony metastasis. The diagnosis of prostate cancer is suspected when individuals have a hard enlarged prostate or nodule on physical exam as well as an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level on laboratory analysis. The diagnosis is confirmed with a biopsy and histologic assessment. The Gleason score is the primary initial histologic assessment tool used to grade prostate malignancies and has proven to have significant prognostic value.
