Abetalipoproteinemia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder marked by low or absent levels of plasma cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins, and very-low-density lipoproteins. It should not be confused with a deficiency in beta-lipoproteins. Hallmark symptoms include fat malabsorption, spinocerebellar degeneration, acanthocytosis, and retinitis pigmentosa. This activity reviews the etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, and treatment considerations of this disease and highlights the role of the collaboration between interprofessional team members.

**Objectives:**
- Explain how abetalipoproteinemia manifests in each of the three main organ systems that it affects. 
- Describe anticipated laboratory findings of a patient with abetalipoproteinemia.
- Outline the treatment of abetalipoproteinemia.
- Review the importance of collaboration between interprofessional team members for improved recognition and treatment of abetalipoproteinemia.
