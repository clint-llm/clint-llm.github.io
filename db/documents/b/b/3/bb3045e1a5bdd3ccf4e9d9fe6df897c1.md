Enoxaparin is low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) with a mean molecular weight of 4000 to 5000 Daltons. It has a quick onset of action when given in the intravenous form. Enoxaparin is an indirect anticoagulant that binds and potentiates antithrombin III (serine protease inhibitor) through a specific pentasaccharide sequence to form a complex that irreversibly inactivates factor Xa. The primary difference between unfractionated heparin and enoxaparin is their relative inhibition of thrombin (factor-IIa) and factor-Xa. Smaller heparin fragments cannot bind antithrombin and thrombin simultaneously. Due to their smaller chain length and lower molecular weight, LMWH has better activity against factor-Xa and inhibits thrombin to a lesser degree. Thus, enoxaparin has less activity against factor IIa (thrombin) than unfractionated heparin. The anti-factor Xa-to-IIa activity ratio for the LMWHs varies from 2:1 to 4:1.

**Pharmacokinetics**

**Absorption:**Peak effect of enoxaparin is observed approximately 4 hours after administration. Anti-Factor Xa activity is detected in plasma for about 12 hours.

**Distribution:**The apparent volume of distribution of enoxaparin estimated by anti-Factor-Xa activity is approximately 4.3 Liters.

**Metabolism:**It is metabolized in the liver by desulfation and depolymerization to lower molecular weight fragments with reduced biologic activity.

**Excretion:**Enoxaparin follows first-order kinetics and is eliminated primarily in the urine. The elimination half-life of enoxaparin is approximately 3 to 4.5 hours following a single dose. Following repeated doses, the half-life of enoxaparin increases to approximately 7 hours. As enoxaparin is primarily eliminated by renal excretion, there is a concern for drug accumulation and bleeding risk in patients with renal impairment.
