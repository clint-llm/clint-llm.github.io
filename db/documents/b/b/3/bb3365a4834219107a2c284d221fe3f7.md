Cardiac valves can become fibrosed and calcific with age or disease, producing clinically significant stenosis requiring surgical or trans-catheter replacement. Similarly, valves may become incompetent, allowing backward flow called regurgitation, also necessitating replacement or repair.

Coronary arteries can become clogged with thrombus or atherosclerotic plaque, causing reduced blood supplies to cardiac muscle.Â This may result in angina or myocardial infarction and often requires revascularization.
