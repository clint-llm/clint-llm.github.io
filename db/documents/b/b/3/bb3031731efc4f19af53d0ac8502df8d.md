The major branches of the ulnar artery include the following (listed in a proximal to distal sequence):

- **Anterior ulnar recurrent artery:**proximal branch of the ulnar artery that courses superiorly and anterior to the medial humeral epicondyle.

- **Posterior ulnar recurrent artery:**This is another proximal branch of the ulnar artery that arises distal to the anterior ulnar recurrent artery. It ascends superiorly and posterior to the medial epicondyle.  The anterior and posterior ulnar recurrent arteries form arterial anastomoses around the elbow in conjunction with the inferior and superior ulnar collateral arterial branches of the brachial artery.

- **Common interosseous artery:**The common interosseous artery is a branch of the ulnar artery follows a short course before dividing into the anterior and posterior interosseous arteries. The anterior interosseous artery descends along the anterior aspect of the interosseous membrane to supply muscles of the deep, volar compartment of the forearm. The posterior interosseous artery travels posterior to the interosseous membrane to supply many of the extensor muscles of the dorsal compartment.

- **Palmar carpal branch:**The palmar carpal branch of the ulnar artery along with the palmar carpal branch of the radial artery forms the palmar carpal arch which lies on the palmar aspect of the carpus and provides blood to the carpal bones and joints.

- **Dorsal carpal branch:**The dorsal carpal branch of the ulnar artery contributes blood supply to the dorsal carpal arch in conjunction with the dorsal carpal branch of the radial artery.

- **Deep palmar branch:**The ulnar artery enters the hand through Guyon’s canal, anterior to the flexor retinaculum. The deep palmar branch of the ulnar artery gives off branches to the hypothenar muscles and contributes to the deep palmar arch of the hand which lies deep to the flexor tendons.

- **Superficial palmar arch:**The ulnar artery proceeds into the palm and forms the superficial palmar arch, an important vascular structure in the hand. The superficial palmar arch curves radially and lies deep to the palmar aponeurosis and superficial to the flexor tendons. Common digital arteries emerge from the superficial palmar arch to supply blood to the ulnar three digits as well as the ulnar aspect of the index finger.
