Normal hearing function involves sound waves arriving at the auricle, passing through the external auditory canal (EAC), causing a vibration of the tympanic membrane.

Hearing loss can be conductive, sensorineural, or mixed.

Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) usually results from problematic transmission of the stimuli at or after the cochlea.

Hearing loss that involves problematic transmission before and after the cochlea is called mixed hearing loss.

There are multiple reasons for hearing impairment. In the pediatric population, genetic causes are the most common, accounting for more than 50% of hearing loss. Genetic causes involve various syndromes that have hearing loss as one of their features; however, there is an entire entity of non-syndromic genetic hearing loss, wherein patients suffer hearing loss while the rest of their function is normal.

Age-related hearing loss involves a gradual reduction of the hearing capacity of the individual and poor speech discrimination scores, most noticeable initially in noisy environments, which is likely related to age-related degeneration of the cochlea in various sites, particularly the hair cells.
