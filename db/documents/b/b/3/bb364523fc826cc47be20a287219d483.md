Antihistamines are commonly found in many over-the-counter medications. Because there is no prescription required, consuming excess amounts is not uncommon. The key to preventing antihistamine toxicity is educating the public. This education and prescribing of antihistamine regimens require the effort of an interprofessional healthcare team. Clinicians need to exercise caution when making a recommendation or prescribing antihistamines. Nursing staff can counsel the patient and ensure they understand dosing and administration. The pharmacist is in an ideal position to educate the public about the potential dangers of these drugs, as well as verify dosing and check for any potential interactions. Those who had developed rhabdomyolysis will need a referral to a physical therapist and enter an exercise program to regain muscle function.

**Outcomes**

The outcomes of patients with antihistamine toxicity depend on many factors, such as underlying medical conditions, the amount of drug ingested, and any coingestants. The majority of patients do recover fully and are discharged. However, the elderly and children can suffer multiorgan failure from a high dose. First-generation antihistamines like diphenhydramine are more sedating than most other antihistamines. Also, there are reports that this agent is known to cause arrhythmias and seizures.
