Following good hygiene practices reduces the chance of getting this fungal infection. Regular and thorough washing of hair prevents fungi from accumulating on the hair. It is advisable to keep the comb clean and separate from other's hair brushes. Furthermore, avoidance of unhygienic hair practices, such as sharing combs, hair bands, or hair clips, will prevent the development of this disease.
