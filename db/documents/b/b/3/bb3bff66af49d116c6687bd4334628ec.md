A clinical diagnosis of vitamin A deficiency can be made in classical exam findings and confirmatory laboratory testing. The presence of xerophthalmia is nearly pathognomonic for vitamin A deficiency.

The provider can order serum retinol testing for patients with a less clear history and physical exam, with deficiency defined as less than 20 micrograms/dL.

Given the risks associated with liver biopsies, they are not routinely used for evaluating vitamin A levels outside of the research setting.
