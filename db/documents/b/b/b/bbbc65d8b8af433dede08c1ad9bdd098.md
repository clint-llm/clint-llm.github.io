Pattern dystrophies are attributed to mutations in the human retinal degeneration slow (RDS) and peripherin gene on chromosome 6 at position 21.1.

The RDS/Peripherin gene is critical for developing a protein, peripherin-2, a cell surface glycoprotein that may be involved in developing and stabilizing photoreceptor outer segment discs.

It is theorized that a mutation in the function of this protein may lead to pattern dystrophy disease by compromising the integrity of photoreceptor membranes.
