The course of systemic symptoms and skin changes varies based on the duration and level of toxic exposure. If massive exposure occurs, symptoms may appear within days. Chloracne lesions may not appear for weeks to months after exposure.

Acute, high-level exposure to halogenated aromatic compounds may cause the following systemic symptoms:

- Gastrointestinal distress (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea)

- Liver dysfunction

- Pancreatitis

- Neuropathy

- Joint pain

Skin lesions appear on the cheeks and postauricular skin and may progress into the axillae and groin. They may also involve the shoulders, chest, back, and abdomen or in very advanced cases, extend to the extremities. The skin may first appear excessively oily before the typical lesions of chloracne arise including:

- Open and closed comedones (blackheads and whiteheads)

- Nodules and cysts

- Pustules

Other cutaneous and mucosal problems seen with chloracne include:

- Palmar and/or plantar hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating of the palms and/or soles)

- Porphyria cutanea tarda (pigmentation, increased hair growth, and blisters on exposed skin)

- Hypertrichosis of body hair

- Hyperpigmentation of skin, hair, or nails

- Conjunctivitis, hyperpigmentation of the conjunctival mucosa, and enlargement of meibomian glands
