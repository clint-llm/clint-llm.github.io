Leukocytosis with neutrophilia and an elevated sedimentation rate are common. A chest x-ray may show elevation of the hemidiaphragm, pleural effusion, and lung abnormalities. Blood cultures indicating polymicrobial bacteria are highly suggestive of a subphrenic abscess. Abdominal ultrasound is the gold standard for right-sided subphrenic abscess, with high sensitivity for fluid collections. Computerized tomography (CT) scan seems better for the detection of a left-sided subphrenic abscess. CT scan is considered the diagnostic imaging of choice in any patient with suspected intraabdominal abscess.

Sagittal imaging on CT scan is best for visualizing subdiaphragmatic abscesses.Â Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and an indium-111-labeled leukocyte scan may be helpful for hidden intraabdominal or subphrenic abscesses. MR enterography is the investigation of choice in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Blood gas analysis may reveal respiratory alkalosis initially due to hyperventilation and may progress to metabolic acidosis if left untreated.
