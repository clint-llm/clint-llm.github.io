The pathophysiology behind cervical insufficiency is still not well understood but is thought to arise from a structural or functional defect of the cervix. Risk factors include any prior cervical procedures or trauma, including loop electrode excisional procedure, cone biopsy, prior cervical lacerations, and repetitive cervical dilation and/or pregnancy terminations. Other possible etiologies include maternal connective tissue diseases or abnormalities, congenital Mullerian anomalies, or maternal exposure in utero to diethylstilbestrol.
