Primary cutaneous lymphomas (CLs) are a heterogeneous group of skin-based non-Hodgkin lymphomas lacking extracutaneous manifestations at the time of diagnosis and are the second most common form of extranodal lymphomas.

In 2018, the World Health Organization–European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (WHO-EORTC) published an updated classification of CLs in the fourth edition of the WHO Classification of Skin Tumors Blue Book, which serves as the gold standard in the diagnosis.

Patients with CTCL have increased risks of secondary cancers such as other non-Hodgkin lymphomas, melanoma, lung cancer, and bladder cancer.

Cutaneous B-cell lymphomas (CBCLs) are often distinguished clinically by their indolent behavior. Prominent dermal B cell infiltrates are often present, which is remarkable in that B cell collections are not typically found in normal skin and are rarely observed in reactive conditions or other types of CL.

A complete list of both CTCL and CBCL diagnoses according to the 2018 WHO-EORTC is listed below with respective abbreviations, which will be used throughout the rest of this chapter. Provisional diagnoses are included:
