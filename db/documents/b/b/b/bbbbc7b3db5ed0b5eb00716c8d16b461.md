Eye formation in the human embryo begins approximately 3 weeks into embryonic development and continues through the tenth week. Cells from both the ectodermal and the mesodermal tissues contribute to its development. Specifically, the eye is derived from the neuroepithelium, the surface ectoderm, and the extracellular mesenchyme which is made up of both the neural crest and mesoderm. Neuroepithelium forms the retina and therefore plays a role in the formation of the fovea.
