The treatment of poikilocytosis is based on the underlying cause of the poikilocytosis. In conditions where poikilocytosis is caused by iron deficiency anemia, megaloblastic anemia due to low levels of iron, vitamin B12, or folate, respectively, is usually treated by taking supplements and increasing the levels of these vitamins in the diet and/or by treating the underlying disease (such as celiac disease or alcoholism) that have caused the deficiency.

Poikilocytocis due to inherited causes like thalassemia or sickle cell anemia may require treatment for a long duration, depending on their clinical variants (homozygous or heterozygous). Genetic diseases, generally, require lifelong monitoring with the treatment of periodic disease exacerbations. These cases may require blood transfusions, or in some cases of poikilocytosis, a bone marrow transplant may be necessary to treat their condition. People with other causes of poikilocytosis, like liver disease (with target cells or acanthocytes), should be treated accordingly. Some may require a liver transplant, while patients with sepsis or serious infections (may have schistocytes) may need antibiotics.
