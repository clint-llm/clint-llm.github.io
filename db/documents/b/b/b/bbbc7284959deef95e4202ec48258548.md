Indications for high-frequency ventilation (HFV) in adults and neonates include:

**Adults**

- It is mainly used in severe ARDS  to prevent VILI.

- Large air leak syndromes with the inability to keep lungs open  like bronchopleural fistula, pneumothorax, pulmonary interstitial emphysema

- Failure of conventional mechanical ventilation

- Refractory hypoxemia  as a rescue therapy

**Neonates**

- Persistent pulmonary hypertension

- Acute respiratory distress syndrome

- Pulmonary interstitial emphysema

- Meconium aspiration

- Pulmonary hypoplasia

There is no classic recommendation for HFOV in adults. It is mainly used as rescue therapy in severe ARDS. It is used as one of the methods to prevent VILI. It is also used in patients with bronchopleural fistula. It is considered beneficial when ventilation is difficult and lungs cannot be kept open, like pneumothorax and pulmonary interstitial emphysema. It is also used in ARDS due to inhalational injury, blunt trauma chest, and even in patients with traumatic brain injury with high intracranial pressure.
