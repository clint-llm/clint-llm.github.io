Bagassosis belongs to the group of respiratory conditions classified as interstitial lung diseases or hypersensitivity pneumonitis. It presents similarly to other forms of extrinsic allergic alveolitis, such as farmer's lung.

Historically bagassosis was first described by Jamison and Hopkins in 1941 after it was reported in a hard-board factory in New Orleans, USA.

In the past, bagasse was processed manually, in a time-consuming process, before the technological revolution in the 1950s and '60s. However, the machine-processing of bagasse led to the dispersal of particle-laden dust around the machines. Soon after introducing these machines, the first cases of bagassosis were reported, predictably in those close to the machines, such as the workers who fed the machines and the engineers who supervised them. Other workers, such as those who handled the finished products, were not affected.
