There are currently no recommendations for or evidence to support prophylaxis against Rocky Mountain spotted fever in patients with a known tick bite. Additionally, as this is not transmissible from person to person, isolation is not required. There is no vaccine against Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Prevention of infection requires careful attention to tick avoidance, including insect repellant, long clothing, and checking for ticks after any outdoor activities in endemic areas.
