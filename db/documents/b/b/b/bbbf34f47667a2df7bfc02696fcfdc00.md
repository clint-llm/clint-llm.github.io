BWS is one of the multiple overgrowth syndromes along with isolated hemihyperplasia (IH), Sotos, Simpson-Golabi-Behmel, Costello, Perlman, Weaver, NF1-microdeletion, and Proteus syndromes, among others. The diagnosis is usually achieved with a comprehensive clinical assessment, including family history detailed documentation of physical findings, and confirmation with genetic/molecular analysis if needed. A particular consideration in the differential diagnosis of BWS should be isolated hemihyperplasia since they could share similar epigenetic alterations in 11p15, but this condition should not be reclassified as BWS solely on this finding.

Many other genetic syndromes and endocrine diseases may also share features with BWS, including mosaicism for trisomy 8, congenital hypothyroidism, mucopolysaccharidosis (Hurler, Hunter, and Maroteaux–Lamy syndromes), gangliosidosis, and Pompe disease which should be included in the differential diagnosis.

In the neonatal period, the finding of macrosomia, macroglossia, and hypoglycemia, should prompt a comprehensive evaluation, including maternal diabetes mellitus.

In children considered to have BWS and developmental delay with no chromosomal abnormalities, and no history of prematurity, birth trauma, or neonatal hypoglycemia, other causes of developmental delay need to be considered.
