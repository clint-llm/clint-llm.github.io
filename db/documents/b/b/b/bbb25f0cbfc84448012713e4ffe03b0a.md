Histology of skin biopsy shows nodular or diffuse infiltrates of leukemic cells in the dermis and/or subcutaneous tissue. These lesions spare the epidermis along with a narrow band of uninvolved upper dermis known as the grenz zone. However T-cell leukemia including ATLL may show epidermotropism. The size of cells varies depending on the subtype of leukemia. CLL cells are smaller, mature-appearing cells that may show perivascular, periadnexal, or nodular distribution. Myeloid leukemia cells are larger with high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, often prominent nucleoli and involving dermis and subcutis in a diffuse pattern. Immunohistochemical staining and history remain essential to distinguish reactive from neoplastic infiltrates.
