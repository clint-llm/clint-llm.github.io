It is crucial that the patient and parents understand that the use of topical steroids should only be used for active lesions. They can also be used prophylactically by applying the topical steroid a few times a week to prevent flare-ups. Topical steroids should not be routinely used daily. Long term use of topical steroids can cause atrophy (thinning of the skin), stretch marks (striae), acne, telangiectasia and rebound dermatitis/rosacea. The strength and formulation of the topical steroid need to be carefully determined based on the location of the body affected. Less potent steroids should be used on the face and intertriginous regions.
