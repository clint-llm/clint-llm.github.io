Atherosclerosis risk factors account for atherogenesis in this category of patients. Vascular risk factors, including diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and tobacco abuse, augment cell adhesion molecules, which promote inflammatory cells to adhere to the arterial wall. This process causes remodeling of the arterial wall and lipid deposition with the tunica media. As this process evolves, the narrowing of the arterial lumen eventually follows and, in turn, causes calcification of the arterial wall.

The pathophysiology of atherosclerotic type subclavian artery stenosis has been attributed to a process of cell adhesion: inflammatory cells attachments to the vascular wall, with subsequent remodeling, lipid accumulation, and consequent calcification. However, the process is aggravated in patients with metabolic syndrome.
