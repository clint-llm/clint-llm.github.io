Phenol is a protoplasmic poison with myriad effects. Its dual hydrophilic and lipophilic properties allow it to easily break through cellular membranes, denaturing proteins along the way, ultimately leading to cell death and necrosis. A caustic effect resulting in coagulation necrosis can also occur. Phenol distributes widely and with severe toxicity, results in pathologic effects involving most organ systems.

Substituted phenol derivatives possess an additional mechanism of toxicity by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation, potentially resulting in severe toxicity manifesting as hyperthermia and acidosis.
