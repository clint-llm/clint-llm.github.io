Treating azotemia is crucial to protect patients from renal failure. Renal failure is a growing complication due to many underlying conditions, including hypertension and diabetes. Adherence to guidelines and evidence-based practice optimize renal outcomes. Targetting hemoglobin A1c less than 6.5 to 7 with lab work either twice a year if meeting goals or every three months if poorly controlled is vital from the primary care/outpatient setting. Checking urinary microalbumin helps monitor if nephrotoxic effects of diabetes have progressed to the point of proteinuria. Along with that line, blood pressure goals are just important as well, not only in keeping the BP range less than 140/90 mmHg but also in ensuring the appropriate choice of medications to reduce nephrotoxic side effects of the drugs.

In the inpatient setting, monitoring serum Cr and urine output are crucial to tracking and predicting renal outcomes. Azotemia is quite common, responsible for 8 to 16% of hospital admissions and more so associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality. An interprofessional team, including the nursing staff and physicians, has to keep an open line of communication regarding the patient's blood pressure, avoiding hypotension to preserve renal perfusion and urinary output. If a patient's urine output starts to fall below 0.5 mL/kg per hour, there is more concern for worsening renal function, likely related to the underlying condition precipitating the azotemia. It is always essential to have nephrology services involved throughout the patient's hospital course to ensure expert treatment recommendations. With this, the patient will have established care with the necessary specialty service for outpatient follow-up and care if needed.
