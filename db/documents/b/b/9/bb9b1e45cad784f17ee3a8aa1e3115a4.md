It seems redundant to speak of complications in a disease, which, in essence, is nothing but complications. HLH is, by definition, a multi-organ pathology with disease occurring indiscriminately as the result of widespread, dysregulated immune system activity. Lungs can develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, hearts can be affected by myocarditis, and its myriad complications, kidneys can suffer microangiopathies, brains can succumb to fatal meningoencephalitis, livers can acutely fail; in fact, not a single major organ system is spared the devastating effects of this disease. The majority of patients who die from the disease die as a result of hemodynamic collapse.
