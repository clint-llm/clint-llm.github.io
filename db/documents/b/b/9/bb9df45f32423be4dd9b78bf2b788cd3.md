We find that it is very helpful to show patients (and their families) illustrations when discussing interpolation flaps prior to surgery. Otherwise, it can be difficult for patients to understand what is about to happen in the surgery and in its aftermath. Serial postoperative photographs can help allay concerns and help patients understand that the final result will take time. It is also essential to explain that minor revisions or "touch-up" procedures may be indicated in the weeks or months after the initial procedure to obtain optimal results.
