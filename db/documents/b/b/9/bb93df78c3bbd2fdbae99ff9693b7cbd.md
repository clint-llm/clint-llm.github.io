There are no studies specifically examining the prevention of BPSD, although some strategies have been shown to reduce the risk of cognitive decline and the development of dementia.Â Both a dietary intervention combining a Mediterranean diet with the Dietary Approach to Systolic Hypertension (DASH) and pharmacological treatment of hypertension results in a decreased risk for incident dementia and physical exercise improves cognitive function in patients with existing dementia. Although depression is associated with an increased risk of developing dementia, there is no consistent evidence that treating it reduces this risk, nor is there yet any good-quality evidence to support cognitive training exercises as a strategy for preventing dementia.
