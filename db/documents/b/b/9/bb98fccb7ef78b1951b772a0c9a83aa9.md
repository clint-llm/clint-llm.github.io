Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (BHDS) is an autosomal dominant genodermatosis usually manifesting in the third decade of life with multiple fibrofolliculomas, trichodiscomas, and acrochordons. Patients with this syndrome have an increased susceptibility to renal cell carcinoma, lung cysts, and spontaneous pneumothorax.
