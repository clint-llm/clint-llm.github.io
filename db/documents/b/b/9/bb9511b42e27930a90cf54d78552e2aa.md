Interprofessional communication and coordination are important in the management of PCV. It is also essential for the interprofessional healthcare team to coordinate in a team effort to support the patient for the best outcomes. Maintaining accurate and updated patient records is important for the entire interprofessional team to keep updated on the case's progress. Ophthalmic nurses are significant contributors to this team concept, coordinating between specialists and family clinicians and assisting in the assessment, procedures, and patient counseling.

Patients presenting with features of AMD and showing suboptimal response to anti-VEGF drugs must be evaluated to rule out PCV. Since this is a bilateral disease, close follow-up must be ensured to clinch the diagnosis early. Physicians must educate patients to get an annual eye checkup and present to emergency ophthalmic services if features such as sudden worsening of vision ensue. A delay in treatment can lead to worse visual outcomes.
