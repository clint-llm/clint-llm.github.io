The principal differential diagnosis is anaplastic thyroid carcinoma as it clinically resembles primary thyroid lymphoma by presenting as a rapidly growing thyroid mass, which is firm and fixed to the surrounding structures. The other differentials include primary thyroid carcinomas like papillary thyroid carcinoma, follicular thyroid carcinoma, and medullary thyroid carcinoma, benign conditions like simple colloid goiter, and a benign thyroid nodule.
