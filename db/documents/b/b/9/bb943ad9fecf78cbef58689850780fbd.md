While the prevalence of PHPT is well known, the true prevalence of nPHPT is not, although it has been estimated to be from 5.5% to 17%.

The reasons behind this are:

- Different studies have used different cutoffs for 25 hydroxyvitamin D{25(OH) vitamin D} levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) when interpreting PTH values.

- The varying accuracies of PTH assays and their interpretation in the context of the varying cutoffs mentioned above

- Measurement of total corrected calcium instead of ionized calcium

- There is an inherent difficulty in ordering a serum PTH in a normocalcemic individual who is asymptomatic and does not have end-organ damage

- The lack of a large population to study the natural history of nPHPT prospectively

- A clear referral bias in studies reported from tertiary centers

Further, it must be mentioned that the normal value range for PTH in a population is a Gaussian distribution curve. Therefore, it will be evident that around 2.5 percent of the population is expected to have PTH values just outside the upper range of normal yet not have the disease.

A patient whose baseline calcium is 8.9 mg/dl may, on developing PHPT, raise his calcium by 1 mg to 9.9 mg/dl and PTH to greater than 65 pg/ml. He would still technically be in the normal range for calcium and be passed off as nPHPT as he would appear to have isolated PTH elevation. So, individual normal values have to be considered. This fact is important but practically very difficult to implement.

Some normocalcemic patients can become hypercalcemic during another measurement on a different day, which changes the classification and diagnosis.

Some studies have shown that when the total corrected calcium was normal, the ionized calcium could be elevated and insisted on its measurement to decide the final classification of hyperparathyroidism.

Another study has shown that total serum calcium varies with albumin and other serum proteins, which further confuses the diagnosis.

Even in patients with nPHPT, it is impossible to predict who will progress to classical PHPT and who will maintain their normocalcemic status and for how long; all possibilities have been observed. In addition, the longer the observation period, the greater the number of nPHPT patients who will become hypercalcemic, suggesting nPHPT may be a forme fruste or precursor of the classical variant. Older age and higher baseline serum and urinary calcium values more often progress to classical primary hyperparathyroidism.

In a recently published prospective study, nPHPT comprised 15.4 percent of all PHPT patients, with a higher female to male ratio.

Parathyroid incidentalomas were found in some patients undergoing thyroid surgery. The patients with this finding were normocalcemic before surgery. When compared to those patients who were operated on for proven classical PHPT, the normocalcemic incidentaloma patients were younger and had parathyroid glands that weighed less. Biochemically and histologically, they were less hyperfunctioning and secreted less PTH. The sex distribution, cell type, and incidence of disease in multiple glands did not differ. These findings suggest that nPHPT is an earlier form or precursor of classic primary hyperparathyroidism.
