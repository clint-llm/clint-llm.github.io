The primary differential diagnoses of PTC are:

- Reactive changes following fine-needle aspiration.

- Severe chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, where the reactive atypia attributed to inflammation results in nuclear morphology similar to that of PTC.

- Adenomatoid nodules

- Diffuse hyperplasia

- Dyshormonogenetic goiter

- Follicular adenoma

- Follicular thyroid carcinoma

- Medullary thyroid carcinoma

- Metastatic tumors
