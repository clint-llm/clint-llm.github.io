The SCN4A protein is responsible for the control of sodium influx into skeletal muscles that aid in contraction. Mutant SCN4AÂ protein channels malfunction by allowing too much sodium into skeletal muscles by staying open too long or not staying closed long enough. This additional influx of sodium triggers a release of intracellular potassium from the skeletal muscles. Subsequently, this change in ion transport impairs a muscle's ability to contract, leading to weakness or paralysis.
