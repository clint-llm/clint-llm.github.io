Etiological classification of glomerulonephritis can be made based on clinical presentation, ranging from severe proteinuria (>3.5 g/day) and edema qualifying for the nephrotic syndrome to a nephritic syndrome where hematuria and hypertension are more prominent while proteinuria is less pronounced.

**Nephrotic Glomerulonephritis**

- Minimal change disease

- Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis

- Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis

- Membranous nephropathy

- HIV associated nephropathy

- Diabetic nephropathy

- Amyloidosis

**Nephritic Glomerulonephritis**

- IgA nephropathy

- Henoch Schonlein purpura (HSP)

- Post streptococcal glomerulonephritis.

- Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease

- Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis

- Granulomatosis with polyangiitis

- Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis

- Polyarteritis nodosa

- Idiopathic crescentic glomerulonephritis

- Goodpasture syndrome

- Lupus nephritis

- Hepatitis C infection

- Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (typical presentation is with acute nephritic syndrome, however, sometimes features resembling nephrotic syndrome may occur, additionally)

A more modern and widely accepted way to classify glomerulonephritis is to divide it into five forms of glomerulonephritis based on underlying immune processes. The following is the modern classification of glomerulonephritis, including pathogenic type and the disease entity associated with it:

- Immune-complex GN - IgA nephropathy, IgA vasculitis, infection-related GN, lupus nephritis, and fibrillary GN with polyclonal Ig deposits

- Pauci-immune GN - PR3-ANCA GN, MPO-ANCA GN, and ANCA-negative GN

- Anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) GN - Anti-GBM GN

- Monoclonal Ig GN - Proliferative GN with monoclonal Ig deposits, monoclonal Ig deposition disease, fibrillary GN with monoclonal Ig deposits, and immunotactoid glomerulopathy

- C3 glomerulopathy - C3 glomerulonephritis, dense deposit disease
