Dowling-Degos disease is a rare genodermatosis that afflicts a small number of the worldwide population. While there is no significant mortality associated with Dowling-Degos disease, patients may experience significant distress and anxiety due to the skin manifestations associated with this disease, especially those who exhibit acne-like scarring. This can lead to significant psychiatric morbidity and a decrease in quality of life. In addition, the minimal efficacy of treatments in Dowling-Degos disease and medication adverse effects may further precipitate psychological stress. Thus, an interprofessional approach with collaboration between dermatologists, psychiatrists, family medicine physicians, and pharmacists is recommended to improve patient outcomes. [Level 4 and 5]
