Most infected individuals will provide a history of mosquito exposure in an endemic area. The incubation period averages 6 to 8 days but ranges from 4 to 15 days. There is often a prodromal period of nonspecific symptoms of fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and myalgias which may last for several days. Symptoms then progress to encephalitis, which is the most common neurologic manifestation.Â  Symptoms may include altered mental status, agitation, confusion, and psychosis. A headache and meningismus are frequently reported in adults while children often develop seizures. More unusual presentations include mutism and flaccid paralysis. As the disease progresses, patients may develop dystonia, choreoathetoid movements that mimic extrapyramidal symptoms of Parkinson disease.
