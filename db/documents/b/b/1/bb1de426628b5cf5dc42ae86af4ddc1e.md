**Facial MET for the TMJ**

With the patient in a supine position:

- Sit at the head of the table and instruct the patient to slowly open the mouth to observe exaggerated deviation to the side of the restriction;

- Slowly translate the mandible in neutral, flexion, and extension to identify a TMJ restriction;

- If dizziness or nausea appears, discontinue the procedure;

- With support from your hand opposite to the barrier, mobilize the lateral mandible into its flexion-extension along with restrictive barriers using the right index and middle fingers; instruct the patient to slowly open their mouth from the restriction against your equal resistance for 3 to 5 seconds;

- The patient should relax and then push the mandible to a new side-bending restrictive barrier;

- Repeat this counteractive contraction and stretch 3 to 5 times or until the barrier is engaged;

- Reassess TMJ motion to confirm the engagement.

**Direct MFR for the TMJ**

With the patient in a supine position:

- Sit at the head of the table and gently hold the mandible with one hand and the opposite mandible with your other hand;

- Gently abduct the mandible, holding a firm and static force at the barrier until tissue release finishes;

- Slowly rotate the mandible and move it into additional abduction, keeping the steady force at the barrier until tissue release finishes;

- Gently adduct the mandible while keeping external rotation, applying steady force at the barrier until tissue release finishes;

- Slowly restore the mandible to a resting position and reassess the TMJ in motion for checking engagement.

**BLT for the TMJ**

With the patient in a supine position:

- Apply the vault hold to palpate the TMJ joint to assess asymmetry of motion;

- Since this is indirect, softly exaggerate the membranous asymmetry;

- Resume exaggerating membranous asymmetry and blockading return to neutral position until the TMJ stops at a static point;

- Hold this position until the TMJ returns and then softly follow it back to the neutral position before relieving the pressure;

- Reassess the TMJ and its membranes for the return of symmetry.
