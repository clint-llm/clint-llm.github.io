The differential diagnosis for ALM is relatively broad. The differential includes other melanocytic neoplasms such as lentigo, congenital acral nevi, and acquired acral nevi. The differential for subungual ALM includes ethnic pigmentation, lentigo, and nevi. Other non-melanocytic lesions that may mimic ALM on the glabrous skin and subungual nail include fungal and bacterial infections, trauma-related hemorrhage (talon noir), terra firma-forme dermatosis, chronic wounds, verrucae, and other skin cancers which may be secondarily pigmented such as squamous cell carcinoma or porocarcinoma.
