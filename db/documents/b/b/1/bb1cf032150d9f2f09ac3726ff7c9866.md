The typical POTS patient is a young female between 15Â  and 25 years old presenting with multiple often chronic symptoms such as fatigue, lightheadedness, palpitations, cognitive impairment, and less commonly syncope.

The physical exam may reveal peripheral edema, acrocyanosis, clammy skin, joint hypermobility, and changes in peripheral sensation.
