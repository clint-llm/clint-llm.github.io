The patient should be informed the biopsy site will heal with some degree of scarring. A shave biopsy heals over weeks with crusting, eschar, and mild pain and leaves a hypopigmented or hyperpigmented scar.

Skin biopsies are usually used to assist in making or confirming a diagnosis. The intent is to characterize the nature of a skin growth or eruption and assist in the histopathologic evaluation of a tissue sample.

Because of the low risk, a skin biopsy can be safely and routinely performed in an inpatient or outpatient setting.
