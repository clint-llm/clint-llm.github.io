Clinical utilization of systemic 5-FU therapy for the treatment of visceral malignancies has been shown to have low efficacy due to various mechanisms of drug resistance. The overall response rate of advanced colorectal cancer to 5-FU monotherapy is only 10% to 15% and only 40% to 50% when combined with other chemotherapeutic agents. Many potential mechanisms of resistance to systemic 5-FU treatment have been identified. They include altering drug influx and efflux pumps, drug target mutations, and enzyme activity alterations that reduce its clinical efficacy. Alterations in enzyme activity reducing clinical efficacy include overexpression of the target enzyme TS and increased DPD activity, resulting in increased drug catabolism. Identification and targeting of genes responsible for these resistance patterns using microarray technology can help to guide future treatment strategies and improve the clinical efficacy of systemic 5-FU chemotherapy. Some studies suggest that many common mechanisms for 5-FU resistance can be overcome with new encapsulated formulation technologies that alter drug absorption and bioavailability.

Topical 5-FU has a broad array of uses in the dermatological setting to treat various skin conditions. It is best known for its use as field therapy for treating multiple actinic or solar keratoses to prevent progression to squamous cell carcinoma.

Intralesional 5-FU has been studied as an effective method for treating keloids, hypertrophic scars, and keratoacanthomas. Studies suggest that combination therapy for keloids with intralesional 5-FU and intralesional triamcinolone offers a fast and efficacious treatment with a reduced adverse effect profile compared to each drug delivered individually.

Therapy with 5-FU requires the efforts of an interprofessional team. The clinician or specialist will prescribe the drug but would do well to have an oncology board-certified pharmacist assist in therapy choices, verify dosing, check for interactions, and counsel on adverse effects. Oncology specialized nurses may administer the drug and monitor for treatment effectiveness and adverse reactions. All team members need to have open lines of communication so that any issues encountered can be shared with everyone on the team and the matter addressed promptly. This interprofessional healthcare team paradigm will lead to optimal patient therapeutic outcomes. [Level 5]
