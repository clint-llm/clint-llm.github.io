The presentation of unrepaired VSDs is largely dependent on the presence of hemodynamically significant shunt; hence it is directly related to the size of the defect. Small VSDs only lead to the minimal left-to-right shunt without left ventricular (LV) fluid overload or PAH; they are usually asymptomatic or found incidentally on physical exam. Medium size VSDs result in a moderate LV volume overload and absent to mild PAH; they present late in childhood with mild congestive heart failure (CHF). Those with large defects develop CHF early in childhood due to the severe LV overload and severe PAH. The murmur of VSD is typically pan-systolic best heard in the left lower sternal border; it is harsh and loud in small defects but softer and less intense in large ones. Handgrips increase afterload, increasing the strength of the murmur. Infundibular defects are best heard in the pulmonic area. A diastolic decrescendo murmur and wide pulse pressure can be detected in the setting of aortic regurgitation. Increased LV flow may result in the mid-diastolic rumble in the lower left sternal border. A systolic click of a septal aneurysm can be appreciated sometimes in membranous defects. Eisenmenger syndrome manifests in cyanosis, desaturation, dyspnea, syncope, secondary erythrocytosis, and clubbing; in such cases, the typical murmur of VSD can be absent and accentuated pulmonic component of the second heart sound may be heard.
