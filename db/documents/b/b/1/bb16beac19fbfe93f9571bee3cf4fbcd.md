Equipment for the mediastinotomy is the same as for the mediastinoscopy. There should be self-retaining retractors, periosteal elevators, and bone cutters to assist in removing the anterior cartilaginous portions of the ribs. Kitner dissection and blunt dissection with the finger helps guide into the appropriate area for diagnostic tissue. The mediastinoscopy can be introduced for a closer and deeper look into this small area, and biopsy forceps of the mediastinoscope are needed as well as the long Kitner dissectors.
