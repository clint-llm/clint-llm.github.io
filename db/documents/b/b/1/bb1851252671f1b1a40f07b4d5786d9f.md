Prenatal non-stress test, popularly known as NST, is a method used to test fetal wellbeing before the onset of labor. A prenatal non-stress test functions in overall antepartum surveillance with ultrasound as a part or component of the biophysical profile. The presence of fetal movements and fetal heart rate acceleration is the most critical feature of the non-stress test. It is a non-invasive test used for the surveillance of high-risk pregnancies when the fetus is judged clinically to be at risk for hypoxemia or increased risk of death. This activity reviews the prenatal non stress test, its indications, clinical relevance, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of the pregnant patient.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for a prenatal non stress test
- Describe how a perenatal non-stress test is conducted.
- Review the clinical significance of a prenatal non stress test.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients undergoing the prenatal non stress test.
