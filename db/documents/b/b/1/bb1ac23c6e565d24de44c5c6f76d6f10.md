**Interscalene Brachial Plexus Block**

The interscalene block provides analgesia or surgical anesthesia to the upper limb from the distal end of the clavicle to the shoulder joint and proximal humerus.

**Superior Trunk Block**

The superior trunk block is a potentially phrenic nerve-sparing modification of the interscalene block that provides analgesia to the shoulder capsule and proximal humerus.

**Supraclavicular Brachial Plexus Block**

The supraclavicular block provides analgesia or surgical anesthesia from the mid-humerus to the fingertips.

**Infraclavicular Brachial Plexus Block**

This block provides analgesia or surgical anesthesia from the mid-humerus to the fingertips but typically spares the intercostobrachial nerve. The infraclavicular block can be performed via a traditional approach with a steep needle angle or retroclavicular approach (RAPTIR).

**Axillary Brachial Plexus Block**

The axillary block provides analgesia or surgical anesthesia from the mid-humerus to the fingertips. This block also spares the intercostobrachial nerve, although that nerve is easily blocked within the same window.
