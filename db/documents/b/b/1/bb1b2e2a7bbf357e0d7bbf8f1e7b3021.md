Amniotomy, also known as artificial rupture of membranes (AROM), is best performed by an obstetric clinician or a midwife in the labor and delivery department. Prior to the procedure, the nurse needs to assist theÂ provider by preparing the necessary equipment, monitoring the vital signs of the patient, and reporting any untoward changes to the care provider. The nurse plays a vital role during the procedure in monitoring the mother as well as the fetus, she also notes the color of the draining amniotic fluid and documents the findings in the medical chart. After the procedure, she assesses the maternal temperature every two hours and watches out for any signs of infection. The nurse also monitors the fetal heart rate via continuous electronic fetal monitoring and communicates the findings to the provider. The nurse needs to frequently change underpads. One of the most crucial roles of the nurse is to educate the woman about the amniotomy procedure and address the patient's concerns at all times. Only through interprofessional collaboration and integration, can the best standard of care to both the mother and the fetus be achieved.
