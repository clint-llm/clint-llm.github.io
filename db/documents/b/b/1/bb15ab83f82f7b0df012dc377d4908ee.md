The differential diagnosis of postmenopausal bleeding includes both gynecologic and non-gynecologic etiologies, both benign and potentially malignant:

- Atrophy: Lack of estrogen can lead to bleeding from within the uterine cavity or from the vagina or vulva if lacerations or fissures occur

- Malignancy: Cancer may bleed from the fragility of the blood vessels within it or invasion into nearby blood vessels

- Cervical
- Endometrial
- Sarcoma
- Fallopian Tube
- Ovarian
- Vaginal
- Vulvar

- Polyps: Bleeding may be due to apical necrosis and venous stasis caused by stromal congestion inside the
- Endometrial
- Cervical

- Endometrial Hyperplasia

- Uterine Leiomyomata: Can put pressure on the opposing uterine walls or endometrial, or disrupt the normal vasculature of the uterine myometrium

- Adenomyosis: May disrupt the tissues of the myometrium and endometrium

- Infection: Can cause inflammation and irritation, leading in turn to bleeding

- Cervical
- Uterine
- Vaginal
- Urinary
- Gastrointestinal

- Endometritis: Can be infectious (see above), or noninfectious secondary to epithelial micro-erosions leading to chronic inflammation

- Medications

- Herbal Supplements: Phytoestrogens may stimulate the endometrial lining and subsequent bleeding
- Anticoagulation: Can lead to increased bleeding than would otherwise be seen in a given situation
- Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy: Estrogen may cause the proliferation of the endometrium, leading in turn to hyperplasia or malignancy. If hormone regimens include progestins, bleeding may be an intended result (cyclical therapy regimens) or a result of hormonal imbalance.

- Post-Radiation Effects: Devascularization of radiated tissues can lead to necrosis, perforation, tissue sloughing, and bleeding. Hemorrhagic cystitis or proctitis can be significant. Vaginal vault necrosis can also lead to pain or uncontrolled bleeding.

- Disease in Adjacent Organs: Bleeding from structures near the vagina can be mistaken for vaginal bleeding
