LDL receptor function is needed for the uptake of LDL from the blood into hepatocytes.

Defects in LDL receptor function can cause hypercholesterolemia, known as familial hypercholesterolemia, an autosomal dominant disorder. Because LDL receptors on the surface of hepatocytes are necessary for the binding and subsequent uptake of LDL molecules in the blood, a genetic decrease in LDL receptor number would cause a decreased ability of hepatocytes to absorb LDL and increase LDL in the blood. If this mutation is heterozygous, some LDL receptors will be present on the hepatocytes; thus, LDL is usually around 300 mg/dL. However, a homozygous mutation will result in the complete absence of LDL receptors on hepatocytes, increasing the LDL cholesterol levels to 1000 mg/dL.
