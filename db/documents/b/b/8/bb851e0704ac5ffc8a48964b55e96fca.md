Melanoma skin cancer has high metastatic spread risks as it originates from the melanocytes of the skin, which are neural crest-derived. Melanoma has a number of clinical attributes and risk factors that are well defined. Molecular genetics and next-generation sequencing have revealed that the BRAFV600E mutation plays a key role in oncogenic melanoma and that UV-induced DNA mutations result in melanoma formation. They have also uncovered many molecular events that occur throughout the development of melanoma. Immunotherapy and targeted therapies have significantly increased the cure rate for metastatic melanoma. Despite this, it remains a challenge to uncover the biology underlying therapeutic resistance and relapse.

Melanocytes are neural crest-derived cells in the basal layer of the epidermis and located in skin, hair, uvea, mucosal epithelia, and meninges. The primary function of melanocytes is to synthesize melanin within melanosomes and transfer meaning via dendritic processes to neighboring keratinocytes. Melanocytes produce two forms of melanin pigment, eumelanin, and pheomelanin, which are both derived from precursor tyrosinase.

Many factors can promote melanoma development, including exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays.

Genetic factors may influence the pathogenesis of melanoma. The BRAF mutation has been detected in patients with melanoma without chronic sun damage in 2005 by Uhara et al.
