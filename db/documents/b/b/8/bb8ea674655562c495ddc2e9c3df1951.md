The larynx is a midline structure at the level of C3 through C6 that connects the pharynx to the trachea. Its major functions include respiration, phonation, and swallowing. It is comprised of a cartilaginous skeleton, muscles, mucosal lining, ligaments, and membranes.

The thyrohyoid membrane is one of the extrinsic membranes that compose the larynx. It is a broad fibro-elastic layer named for its attachments as it attaches the upper border of the thyroid cartilage to the hyoid bone. The thicker median section of the membrane is the thyrohyoid ligament. It attaches the superior thyroid notch/laryngeal notch to the hyoid. The lateral surfaces of the membrane contain an aperture for the internal branches of the superior laryngeal nerves, the superior laryngeal artery, and lymphatics.
