Patients with astigmatism usually present with asthenopic symptoms like headache, pain, heaviness in the eyes, frontal headache, difficulty focusing, transient blurring, drowsiness, and even nausea. The patient has also presented with blurred vision, diminution of vision, and elongation of objects with the degree of astigmatism.

The patient also put objects close to the eyes while reading. History of trauma, surgical intervention, Â keratoconus, terrain marginal degeneration, pellucid marginal degeneration, pterygium, pinguecula, ocular surface squamous neoplasia, mass excision, limbal dermoid should be documented.

Detailed torch light and slit-lamp examination should be performed to rule out lid closure, head tilt, keratoconus signs, corneal scar, lid mass, lid abnormality, dry eyes, or any other condition producing astigmatism.

The lens should be carefully examined for nuclear sclerotic changes, subluxation, dislocation, microspherophakia, and traumatic cataracts. Dilated fundoscopy should be performed to rule out the oval or tilted optic disc and oblique placement of the macula.
