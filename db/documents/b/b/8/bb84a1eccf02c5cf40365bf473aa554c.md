# Continuing Education Activity

Methocarbamol is a medication used in the management and treatment of acute musculoskeletal pain. It is in the skeletal muscle relaxant class of medications. This activity reviews the indications, mechanism of action, and contraindications for methocarbamol as an option in the multimodal treatment of acute musculoskeletal pain. This activity will also underscore critical factors to consider when prescribing methocarbamol: adverse event profile, evidence of efficacy, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic considerations, and recommendations for monitoring in managing patients with musculoskeletal pain and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Review the indications for the use of methocarbamol in the treatment of musculoskeletal pain.
- Identify populations at risk for adverse effects of methocarbamol.
- Summarize different approaches for the use of anti-spastic and anti-spasmodic classes of skeletal muscle relaxants.
- Describe common adverse effects of skeletal muscle relaxants, and review methods of educating patients on how to avoid harm.

# Indications

Methocarbamol is a centrally-acting skeletal muscle relaxant (SMR) approved for the treatment of acute musculoskeletal pain. Specific FDA indications for use are vague and have not been recently reviewed. Methocarbamol has been approved for muscle spasms since 1957.

Methocarbamol was discovered in the early 1950s and was approved for use in 1957.

Despite its common use today, there are few high-quality studies and no meta-analyses comparing methocarbamol to placebo or alternative agents for muscle spasms.

# Mechanism of Action

The exact mechanism of action of methocarbamol remains unknown; similarly unknown is the relationship between musculoskeletal pain and muscle spasm.

# Administration

Methocarbamol is administered commonly via the oral route. Oral methocarbamol is available in 500 mg and 750 mg tablets. Recommended daily dosing ranges from four to six grams daily in divided doses every six hours. The maximum recommended dose is six grams daily, and up to eight grams daily have been used. However, lower doses are often used in practice. For example, in a recent retrospective study of a reasonably sized cohort, the typical dose for a hospitalized patient was 500 mg orally every eight hours.

Intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) formulations may also be used commonly in the postoperative setting.

**Pharmacokinetics**

The onset of action of oral methocarbamol is 30 minutes. The drug is completely absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract and reaches peak plasma concentrations at two hours.

**Specific Population**

**Renal Impairment:**All major metabolites of methocarbamol are excreted in the urine. Similarly, some small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol are also excreted in the urine. IV dose is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment due to the presence of polyethylene glycol excipient. The oral dose should be used with caution for patients with mild to moderate kidney conditions. Patients who are on dialysis should also be using methocarbamol with caution.

**Hepatic Impairment:**Methocarbamol is mainly metabolized via dealkylation, hydroxylation, and conjugation in the liver. However, there are no dose recommendations available in manufacturer labels.

**Pregnant Women:**It is considered pregnancy category C medicine. Some reports exist of fetal and congenital abnormalities following exposure to methocarbamol in pregnant women. Therefore, it should not be used in women who may become pregnant or are pregnant, particularly in early pregnancy, until potential benefits outweigh the risk.

**Breastfeeding Women:**There are no studies conducted to evaluate methocarbamol use in breastfeeding women. The manufacturer recommends exercising caution when methocarbamol is administered to a nursing woman.

**Pediatric:**Effectiveness and safety of methocarbamol in pediatric patients below the age of 16 have not been studied.

# Adverse Effects

Severe adverse effects documented in the methocarbamol package insert include seizure, leukopenia, and cholestatic jaundice. The incidence of these severe effects is unknown, and no case reports appear on a literature review. According to the LiverTox resource governed by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), methocarbamol has not been linked to liver or kidney injury.

According to drug monographs, there have been reports of seizures in individuals with a history of epilepsy after IV administration and cases of polysubstance toxicity; however, no published cases were available for review.

Drug monographs report neurologic adverse effects as more common, including sedation, followed by dizziness and headache. Other reported neurologic adverse effects include confusion, amnesia, falls, syncope, and diplopia.

Gastrointestinal side effects include dyspepsia, nausea, emesis, metallic taste, and cholestatic jaundice.

Methocarbamol may cause urine discoloration, which is not clinically significant; however, it may interfere with urine screening of  5-hydroxy indole acetic acid (5-HIAA) and vanillyl mandelic acid (VMA).

IV administration has been associated with phlebitis and injection site pain related to the extravasation of hypertonic solution.

# Contraindications

According to the FDA, methocarbamol is contraindicated in individuals with a history of drug hypersensitivity to methocarbamol or component products.

Importantly, IV methocarbamol is contraindicated in renal impairment due to the presence of polyethylene glycol, which independently is associated with metabolic acidosis, renal injury, and hyperosmolarity.

There have been multiple studies evaluating the abuse potential of methocarbamol. Animal studies have shown low abuse potential when methocarbamol is compared to benzodiazepines and barbiturates.

Methocarbamol should not be used in patients with myasthenia gravis taking acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. This recommendation is in the package insert and based on a case report of an exacerbation of muscle weakness and fatigue associated with methocarbamol's anticholinergic effects.

SMRs, including methocarbamol, are included in the Beers Criteria as medications that should be avoided in adults older than 65 years of age. They have been associated with a small but statistically significant increase in injury for elderly patients. This theoretical "injury" is based on retrospective case-control analyses evaluating patients who present to urgent care facilities, emergency rooms, and hospitals. The primary diagnoses of concern include fall, non-vertebral fracture, soft-tissue injury, and other cognitive or psycho-motor disruption. The absolute risk increase from methocarbamol calculated from the extant data is approximately 0.2%. All SMRs share anticholinergic properties that may contribute to sedation, falls, confusion, and polypharmacy in elderly patients, and methocarbamol is no exception.

Methocarbamol is classified as Pregnancy Category C, as it has not been systematically studied in pregnant women. In addition, based on animal studies, methocarbamol is known to cross the placenta and is excreted in breast milk. Therefore, it is not recommended for use in women who may become pregnant or who are breastfeeding.

# Monitoring

The recommended monitoring of methocarbamol is to evaluate the clinical response and mitigate risk for the emergence of adverse effects. There is no need to check blood chemistry in follow-up, nor blood levels of the drug. Specific populations at risk for toxicity include those on multiple CNS depressants, patients with cirrhosis, renal impairment, substance use disorders, and, most importantly, the elderly.

# Toxicity

Isolated methocarbamol overdose is rare and unlikely to be life-threatening in the absence of multiple drug exposures.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

SMRs, including methocarbamol, are commonly prescribed for non-specific musculoskeletal pain. In 2004, an estimated two million American adults took a muscle relaxant, the most common indication being low back pain.

Despite more than three million methocarbamol prescriptions yearly in the United States, there is limited high-quality data describing clinical efficacy.

MDs, DOs, PAs, NPs, and physical therapists should be vigilant while prescribing methocarbamol in older patients, those at risk of polypharmacy, and those with a history of addiction. Clinicians should keep in mind that there is no high-quality evidence to suggest methocarbamol is more effective than NSAIDs for acute musculoskeletal pain. Nurses and pharmacists should verify methocarbamol is used only in select patients as part of multi-modal treatment with close monitoring of efficacy, adverse effects, and polypharmacy. Additionally, extensive randomized controlled trials are warranted to guide the clinical decision-making for a drug that appears to be a popular clinical tool for prescribers without solid evidence. Integrated and collaborative work of the healthcare team could bring the best possible outcomes for patients using methocarbamol. [Level 5]
