Several paradigms may bring disadvantages to the neonate, including “all neonatal brachial plexus palsy recovers,” “wait a year to see if recovery occurs," and "do not move the  arm." These approaches, by far, lead to a 20 to 30% deficit of the total function of the nerves affected. Thus early recognition and interference are necessary, beginning with proper diagnosis and including rehabilitation and, in certain cases, surgical intervention.
