The management of nevus sebaceus remains a controversial topic. Because nevus sebaceus was previously thought to indicate a high risk for developing secondary carcinomas later in life, prophylactic excision was an acceptable treatment. However, research suggests the risk for developing secondary carcinomas is low, while the risk of developing secondary benign neoplasmsÂ is relatively high. Most secondary tumors arising in a nevus sebaceus occur in adults 40 years or older. Surgical excision is considered an acceptable treatment for nevus sebaceus as early as late childhood, once the risk from general anesthesia lessens or the patient is mature enough to tolerate the procedure with local anesthesia. Other factors to consider prior to surgery include the size and location of the lesion. Superficial procedures such as shave removal, dermabrasion, or laser resurfacing are typically unsuccessful as these do not remove the entire lesion.
