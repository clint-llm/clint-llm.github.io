Overall the finding of gastric polyps carries with it a good prognosis with some studies indicating a finding of malignancy in less than 2% of polyps investigated. Characteristics of polyps that indicate a poorer prognosis include large size, the advanced age of the patient, and the finding of multiple adenomas. It is known that the risk of finding dysplasia or malignancy increases greatly in lesions larger than 20 mm, in older patients, and that the finding of multiple adenomas may indicate the presence of FAP which has a high risk for the development of adenocarcinoma.
