The prognosis of axonotmesis relies on the underlying condition of the patient and the nature of the injury. In the best circumstances, the nerve can regenerate within a timely manner by axonal branching or through the expansion of the proximal segment of the damaged nerve.

Nerve regeneration becomes more likely with limited damage to axons and the structural units of the neural trunk. Spontaneous recovery frequently occurs, generally within days to weeks, when only the Schwann cells are damaged (neurapraxia). Complete recovery within three years is predicted for 90% of patients suffering from positional nerve injury. Spontaneous regeneration is still possible with axonotmesis if the perineurium and epineurium provide an intact tubule. Distal lesions have a better prognosis.

However, nerve regeneration does not equate to functional recovery. The function also depends on the effective communication of the regenerated axons with the end-organ. Therefore, early intervention on the damaged nerve is suggested before progressive scarring and atrophy of the end-organ renders it nonviable.

Muscle architecture and motor endplates are considered viable for up to 1-year post-injury. Merkel cells, Pacinian corpuscles, and Meissner's corpuscles may endure denervation for 2-3 years post-injury. Considering the growth of the damaged peripheral nerve at approximately 1-2 mm/day, it is prudent to intervene within the first 3-6 months of PNI without signs of spontaneous recovery. Communication with the end-organ must be re-established within a limited timeframe.

Prognostic factors for regain of function include a patient's baseline health, the mechanism of injury, the degree of injury, the length of the nerve gap (in axonotmesis and neurotmesis), the type of injury, the nerve(s) involved (the spinal accessory nerve is most robust), the location of injury along the nerve (distal injuries have a better prognosis), concomitant injuries, the timing to surgery, the type of surgery, and the patient's age.
