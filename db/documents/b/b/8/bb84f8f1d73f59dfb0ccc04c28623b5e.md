Primary polydipsia can present with various nonspecific symptoms. It is a diagnosis of exclusion. More common causes like diabetes, hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency have to be considered in the differentials. Once polydipsia is suspected, a careful historyÂ should be taken from the patient or family depending on the situation. The patient needs to be monitored in an inpatient setting to quantify the polyuria.

Necessary laboratory tests should be ordered to help in the diagnosis. Care must be taken such that the deprivation test does not dehydrate the patient. Also, serial sodium monitoring is required to prevent rapid correction to avoid central pontine myelinolysis. To identify and treat primary polydipsia requires a multidisciplinary approach. Nurses play an essential role in keeping an account of the intake and output of these patients.

Care can be coordinated by psychiatrists, internists, endocrinologists, emergency providers, and neurologists, given the different settings these patients can be seen. Behavioral therapists also can contribute, but this might become a compliance issue in the long term for the patient. There were few randomized trials done studying the pharmacological treatments for primary polydipsia. Many studies were case reports or small case series and case-control studies. In conclusion, the evidence in support of any pharmacological or behavioral treatment option is low.
