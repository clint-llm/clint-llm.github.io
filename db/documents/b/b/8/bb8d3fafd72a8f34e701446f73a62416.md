In all of these examples, arteries are comprised of smooth muscle. They are nonstriated muscles encompassing the vessels to provide support and integrity to the entire artery. This smooth muscle reacts to different signals and innervations to constrict or dilate to maintain consistent blood pressure, such as epinephrine and angiotensin II. The sympathetic nervous system can use high levels of epinephrine, which affects alpha-adrenergic receptors to cause the arteries to constrict. This increase in pressure can aid in perfusion during both trauma and hormonal imbalance.

Additionally, the kidney can indirectly affect blood pressure through its release of renin. Renin allows for the creation of angiotensin II, a powerful vasoconstrictor.

As arteries age, they harden and become less compliant, leading to an imbalance in this system that can lead to secondary hypertension due to a low glomerular filtration rate in the kidneys. Therefore through the endocrine system, different hormones are released into the blood, which is then able to signal the vascular nerves to change to maintain homeostasis.
