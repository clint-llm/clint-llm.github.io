The inferior hypogastric plexus mediates sensation, such as pain, through the sympathetic chain for the lower abdominal and pelvic viscera. It is thought to be a major structure involved in numerous pelvic and perineal pain syndromes and conditions. Multiple studies have investigated possible nerve blocks treating chronic and more acute pain in this area. Hypogastric plexus blocks relieve pelvic pain that potentially refers to the colon, lower intestines, bladder, uterus and ovaries, prostate or testicles, and other parts of the pelvis.

Surgeons performing hysterectomy must keep in mind the inferior hypogastric plexus as disruption of nerves may cause sexual, genitourinary, and colonic motility dysfunction. Radical hysterectomies may result in disruption of pelvic autonomic nerves.
