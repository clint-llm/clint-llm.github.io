All tetracyclines can cross the placental barrier and are contraindicated in pregnancy, including minocycline. Hepatotoxicity in the pregnant mother is also a risk factor to consider and another reason not to use it.

Generally, any patients under the age of 16 should avoid using minocycline as the risk of permanent teeth discoloration in unerupted teeth is present. Ideally, avoid minocycline until after all crowns are complete (13 to 19 years).

Although most tetracycline group medication should be avoided in patients with chronic renal failure, minocycline elimination is independent of renal function.
