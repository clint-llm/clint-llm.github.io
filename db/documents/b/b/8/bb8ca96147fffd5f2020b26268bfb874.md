The complications which are often seen with Morel-Lavallee lesions are either due to its delayed presentation or inaccurate diagnosis. If this lesion is not managed properly, it can result in gradual progressive expansion, leading to the necrosis of the overlying skin because of the pressure effect, which ultimately leaves underlying fractures exposed. Infection is a major concern in such lesions; multiple studies have commented on the contamination of the lesion contents, which may have resulted either due to the inadvertent entry of micro-organisms in the lesion while managing the lesion, especially with the use of sclerosing agents, or during the fixation of an underlying fracture.
