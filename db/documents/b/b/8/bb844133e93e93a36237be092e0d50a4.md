Postoperatively, a compressive dressing is applied. This is removedÂ two weeks postoperatively. If there is a concern in regards to skin quality or for injury to the extensor tendon, the finger may also be immobilized in a splint that includes the DIP joint. The splint could be applied volarly or dorsal to the DIP joint for 10 days. Volarly placed splints limit pressure on the skin incision. Generally, the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) is left free, and stretching of the PIP joint is encouraged to prevent the risk of stiffness to the PIP joint.
