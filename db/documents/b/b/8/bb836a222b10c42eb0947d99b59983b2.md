**Epidemiology**

A high concentration of cases is present in the Saguenay Lac-Saint-Jean region of Quebec, Canada, with a prevalence of 1/6,000 live births.

Worldwide, however, the prevalence is estimated to be between 1/100,000 to 400,000.

**Clinical Features**

ICD is characterized by a multisystemic involvement with prominent bony abnormalities. Table 1 shows the various manifestations and clinical features of ICD. The presence of corneal clouding is variable. When ICD was first considered in 1967 by Leroy et al., two patients did not have corneal clouding or excessive urinary secretion of acid mucopolysaccharides. The absence of these features helped distinguish Hurler syndrome from ICD. Other studies report that the corneas may be clear.

Patients with ICD often have a developmental delay, of which motor delay is more prominent than cognitive delay.

In contrast, Okada et al. reported several cases to have exceptional levels of cognitive development where children were independent, toilet-trained, had good academic performance, were able to sing songs, and recognized foreign words. Autopsy studies on patients with ICD have not revealed any brain abnormalities.

Taber et al. suggest that hepatomegaly is a feature mainly identified with Hurler syndrome. However, other reports have identified liver enlargement in patients with ICD.

**Table 1:Clinical Features of ICD**

Craniosynostosis, hip dysplasia, shoulder dislocation, congenital hip dislocation, pseudoacetabulum, rickets, thoracic deformity, kyphosis, lumbar gibbus deformity, clubfeet, premature fusion of metopic suture, multiple joint contractions, long tubular bone deformities, osteopenia, fractures, median nerve compression due to tendon nodules, restricted range of movements of shoulders, elbows, and wrists, flexed fingers (claw-like deformity), relative sparing of lower limbs (apart from skin thickening and hip dislocation)

Mucosal thickening of airways, airway obstruction, anterolaterally displaced airway, and thoracic cage stiffening contribute to respiratory insufficiency (a common cause of death), infections/bronchopneumonia

**Bony and Radiological Abnormalities**

Dysostosis multiplex is the broad term that encompasses the skeletal abnormalities of ICD. General x-ray findings are demineralization, osteopenia, coarse trabecular bones, and periosteal cloaking (predominantly long bones).

Bone dysplasia with shortened and curved bones is considered a prenatal manifestation of ICD. Deformities of the vertebral bodies may show anterior beaking, leading to abnormal spinal curvatures.

The cellular causes underlying the bony features of ICD may be due to the excessive formation of normal osteoclasts (osteoclastogenesis) and subsequent destruction of bone along with the subfunctional activity of osteoblasts. The increased osteoclasts are due to the osteoblasts producing the osteoclastogenic cytokine IL-6.

These patients had normal extracellular calcium levels with an elevated PTH, indicating that the parathyroid glands compensated to overcome the prenatal calcium deficiency.

Using a mouse model, Unger et al. suggested that a receptor other than the CASR is responsible for recognizing and coupling the signal of fetal PTHrP to the transplacental transfer of calcium.

**Differential Diagnosis**

Mucopolysaccharidoses, ML III, rickets, and osteogenesis imperfecta are other conditions to consider before diagnosing a patient with ICD.

**Treatment**

Treatment for ICD is mainly supportive and symptomatic, as there is no definitive treatment.

**Medical Management**

Bisphosphonate therapy has been used in those with profound bony involvement and decreased bone mineral density (z score <-2.5). Bisphosphonates work by reducing the activity of the numerous osteoclasts in ICD, reducing bone resorption. Bone marrow transplants affect both skeletal growth and cognitive development. A positive association between the duration of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and skeletal growth was seen in ICD. However, the benefits of ERT are limited to the viscera and are restricted in their effects on the bones and brain. The real challenge with ERT is creating multiple recombinant lysosomal enzymes already having the M6P residues.

Vitamin D supplementation may help with bone manifestations as well. Pazzaglia et al. reported two cases of ICD with radiological images of metabolic bone disease.

Genistein is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of epidermal growth factor that reduces glycosaminoglycans like heparan sulfate. Genistein usage at 5 mg/kg/day showed an improved range of motion of joints and increased elasticity. Genistein's estrogen-like effect may play a role in its benefits to bone health.****The drawback with genistein is decreased cellular growth, hypothesized to be due to its interference with cellular growth factors.

**Surgical Management**

In cases of acute airway obstruction, using a video laryngoscope may be more helpful to secure the airway, as laryngeal mask airways only provide temporal placement with questionable success.

**Other Treatment Methods**

Matos et al. devised a novel therapeutic strategy to reduce G1cNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity instead of absent enzyme activity by skipping exon 19 on GNPTAB.

**Other Disorders of Protein Targeting**

Based on previous literature, protein targeting has been implicated in neurodegeneration, several infections, and other metabolic disorders. LIMP-2 is concerned with the pathogenesis of hand, foot, and mouth disease by acting as a cell membrane receptor for entering enterovirus 71 and coxsackievirus 16.

Cholera toxin, Pseudomonas exotoxin, Shiga toxin, and ricin use the retrograde endosome-to-TGN pathway to avoid lysosomal degradation. These AB-type toxins use the B fragment to bind to the cell surface, allow the active A component to enter the cell, and use the endosome-to-TGN pathway. Manganese (specific to Shiga toxin) and Retro-1 or 2 (small molecular compounds) are protective against these toxins, as seen in cultured cells and animals.Nef, a virulence factor for HIV-1, disrupts the trafficking of MHC-I, thereby preventing the destruction of virion-infected cells by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes.

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis and COPI play roles in the infectivity of the Dengue virus. The acidic pH of the endosomes creates an optimal environment for integrating the virus with the endosomal membrane, leading to the release of the viral genetic material into the cytoplasm for further viral growth.

Neurons are susceptible to trafficking defects due to the long distances the cargo must travel and the requirement of exact localization. A unique feature of neurons is that membrane and secretory neuronal proteins often bypass the Golgi and go to the plasma membrane. Whether this feature increases the susceptibility for targeting defects remains to be known. Neuronal targeting defects cause diseases like epilepsy, hyperekplexia, and ataxia. Alpha-Synuclein, the predominant component of Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease, is responsible for inhibiting RER-to-Golgi trafficking. This leads to its toxic cellular accumulation. Increases in RAB1, a modifier of alpha-Synuclein activity, have reduced neuron loss in animal models of Parkinson's disease. Patients with developmental disorders may have mutations of TRAPPC6A, TRAPPC6B, and TRAPPC9. Mutations of TRAPPC2L and TRAPPC12 can cause encephalopathy.

Neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques characterize Alzheimer's disease. The main component of these plaques is beta-amyloid. Beta-amyloid is formed by the beta-cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE).

Other studies have shown that blocking proteolysis with protease inhibitors or removing gamma-secretase using a presenilin knock-out leads to APP collection within the lysosomes.

Sortilin is one of many trafficking proteins. One of its functions is to act as a sorting receptor for PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/Kexin type 9) in lipid metabolism. PCSK9 degrades LDL receptors and is inhibited by medications like alirocumab and evolocumab to achieve cholesterol control. The sortilin-related receptor with A-type repeats (SorLA) is associated with Alzheimer's disease. Murine models lacking SorLA will have increased levels of beta-amyloid. Overexpression of SorLA can lead to the accumulation of APP in the Golgi, impeding its further cleavage.

A mutation of SEC31A, a component of COPII, can lead to intrauterine growth retardation, developmental delay, and seizures. A receptor molecule involved with COPII functioning is cTAGE5. A proline-to-alanine replacement in cTAGE5, showing a variant known as P521A, is a risk factor for developing Fahr disease.
