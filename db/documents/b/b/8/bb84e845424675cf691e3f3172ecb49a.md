In ischemic gangrene, reduced arterial perfusion leads to arteriole dilation as compensation, resulting in distal edema and endothelial damage. This can trigger a cycle of micro thrombosis resulting in worsening tissue damage. Due to the ischemic environment, localized cellular dysregulation limits the ability to have adequate wound healing and set the tissue up for continued damage and infection.

In gas gangrene, bacteria such as C.perfringens and group A streptococcus can produce multiple exotoxins, resulting in local tissue destruction and subsequent systemic infection.
