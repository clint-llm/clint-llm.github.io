All healthcare workers including the nurse practitioner and pharmacist who prescribe/dispense penicillin must ask the patient if he or she is allergic to the medication, as part of an interprofessional team approach to patient care. Penicillin allergy can be serious and result in a life-threatening anaphylactic reaction. Patients should be asked to wear an ID bracelet about their medical health problems, including allergies. The healthcare workers must ask for allergies at each and every admission because, in the complex world of medicine, some data are omitted or forgotten and lead to serious consequences. Pharmacists should check the patient medication record, checking for agents that may have crossover allergic reaction, and assess the safety of cephalosporins in conjunction with the prescriber. Nursing staff should be vigilant on the intake so that this mistake is never made, but also should have the patient clarify any prior allergic reaction to penicillin drugs. These interprofessional steps can prevent penicillin allergy and prevention is the optimal management strategy. [Level 5]
