Cerebellar dysfunction results from a heterogeneous group of disorders and can occur in isolation or as part of a range of neurological or systemic features. There are several reasons for these defects. These can be vascular (due to stroke, hemorrhage), idiopathic, iatrogenic (drug), traumatic, autoimmune, metabolic, infective, inflammatory, neoplastic, toxic, and rare genetic disorders. We can divide this according to the involvement of one or both sides.

**A. Bilateral cerebellar dysfunctions (most important causes are):**

- Multiple sclerosis (demyelination)

- Posterior circulation stroke

- Bilateral cerebellar pontine (CP) angle lesions or space-occupying lesions, e.g., neurofibromatosis, schwannoma

- Paraneoplastic syndromes

- MSA (multiple system atrophy)

- Toxin & Drugs: alcohol, phenytoin, lithium, carbamazepine.

- Metabolic: thyroid abnormality (hypothyroid), B12 deficiency, Wilson disease, celiac disease

- Infectious: enteroviruses, HIV, neurosyphilis, toxoplasmosis, borreliosis, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease

- Inflammatory: GBS (Miller Fischer variant)

- Hereditary: ataxia telangiectasia), Friedreich ataxia, Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome), spinocerebellar ataxias)

**B. Unilateral cerebellar dysfunctions**(most important causes are):****

- Unilateral posterior circulation ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke

- Part of lateral medullary syndrome (LMS)
- Hemiparesis with ataxia (following lacunar stroke)

- Multiple sclerosis (demyelination)

- Space occupying lesions (SOL) in the posterior cranial fossa, e.g., abscess (tuberculosis, staphylococcal infection), tumor

- Unilateral cerebellar pontine (CP) angle lesions or space-occupying lesions, e.g., neurofibromatosis, schwannoma

- Multiple system atrophy

**C. Spastic paraparesis with cerebellar signs (the most important causes are):**

- Multiple sclerosis (demyelination)

- Friedreich ataxia

- SCA (Spinocerebellar ataxia)

- ACM (Arnold-Chiari malformation)

- Syringomyelia, syringobulbia
