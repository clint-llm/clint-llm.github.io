Normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism is largely asymptomatic, but a few have fractures or renal stones. Even those without symptoms may have abnormalities in DEXA (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) or renal ultrasound scans. Elevated blood pressure and neuropsychiatric symptoms may accompany nPHPT, but it is unclear if there is a direct relationship.

Rare case reports of nPHPT presenting as acute parathyroid infarction or parathyroid carcinoma have appeared.

A family history of renal stones or osteoporosis in younger relatives should prompt a search for familial PHPT.
