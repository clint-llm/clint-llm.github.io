Prophylaxis in newborns: 1 mg of vitamin K1 by intramuscular injection within 1 hour of birth. Alternatively, 2 mg of vitamin K1 orally at birth, at 4-6 days, and at 4-6 weeks. Another alternative oral administration is 2 mg Vitamin K1 at birth and a subsequent weekly dose of 1 mg for three months. Intramuscular injection is preferable for efficacy.

VKDB: 1 to 2 mg vitamin K1 by slow intravenous or subcutaneous infusion. Severe bleeding may require fresh frozen plasma at a dose of 10-15 mL/kg.

Vitamin K deficiency due to malabsorption: Dependent on the disease. Malabsorption requires daily administration of high doses of oral vitamin K1 0.3 to 15 mg/day. If oral dosing is ineffective, consideration should be for parenteral vitamin K1.

VKCFD: 10 mg vitamin K1 2-3 times per week by an oral dose by intravenous infusion. FreshÂ frozen plasma may be required during surgery or in cases of severe bleeding at a dose of 15-20 mL/kg. Prothrombin Complex Concentrates and recombinant Factor VII may also have utility during surgery or severe bleeding.

Vitamin K nutritional deficiency in adults: At least 120 and 90 ug/day for men and women respectively, by diet or oral supplementation to meet the National Academy of Science Food and Nutrition Board recommended intake.

Chronic conditions: As more research becomes available, a larger dosage of oral vitamin K1 and K2 may be beneficial. No present guidelines are available.
