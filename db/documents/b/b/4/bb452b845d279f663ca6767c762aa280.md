Volumetric variations in the caudate nucleus have been linked to many neurologic and psychiatric disorders, as outlined in the clinical significance section. Normal, nonpathological differences in the caudate nucleus occur along the lines of age and genetic and environmental exposures. No gender differences in volumes of the caudate nucleus are typically detectable in healthy adults.

The caudate nucleus of those who speak multiple languages are larger than those who speak only one language, and the left caudate nucleus changes morphologically with multilingual expertise.

Patients with prenatal methamphetamine exposure can show reduced caudate nucleus volume. This change can be detected in the neonate and remain present in adulthood.

Polymorphisms in the DRD2.ANKK1 Taq1A gene can also influence caudate nucleus volume: those with the A allele have smaller caudate nucleus volumes at advanced ages than non-carriers, which are not detectable before old age.
