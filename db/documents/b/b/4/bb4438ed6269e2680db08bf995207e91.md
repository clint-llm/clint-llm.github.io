EMZL is clinically indolent and postulated to arise from the B lymphocytes of the marginal zone, which is the external part of the secondary lymphoid follicles. It is postulated that apart from the continuous antigenic stimulation, additional oncologic events, including chromosomal abnormalities, play a role at which the lymphoproliferative process eventually becomes independent of antigenic stimulation.

MALT lymphoma presents with recurrent chromosomal translocations and more frequently with gains at 3p, 6p, 18p, and del (6q23). Recent studies in MALT lymphoma have, in fact, demonstrated genetic alteration involving the NF-kB pathway, a signaling pathway involved in many cancers.
