Atrioventricular canal defects comprise a spectrum of defects such as exclusive ventricular or atrial defects, septal defects, atrioventricular anomalies, and endocardial cushion defects. They are more commonly associated with chromosomal abnormalities, especially trisomy 21. There have also been incidences where we have seen these conditions in non-syndromic patients. Congenital heart diseases are one of the most important causes of infant mortality. AV canal defects comprise 3% to 5% of congenital heart disease (CHD). This article explains the incidence, the causes, and the pathophysiology of AV canal defects. It emphasizes the early diagnosis and management of children with this condition by the interprofessional team, to prevent potential complications in the future.

**Objectives:**
- Review the conditions commonly associated with atrioventricular canal defects.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with atrioventricular canal defects.
- Explain the complications that might arise in patients with uncorrected atrioventricular canal defects.
- Describe the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to aid in early suspicion, diagnosis, and management of atrioventricular canal defects, to prevent cardiac failure and other morbidities in these patients.
