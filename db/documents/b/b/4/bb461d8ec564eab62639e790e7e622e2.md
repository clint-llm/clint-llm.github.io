Neurologic symptoms such as claudication associated with spinal stenosis occur most commonly as a result of ischemia or mechanical compression of nerve roots.

Contributing factors disc herniation and bulge, facet joint and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy and buckling and concomitant spondylolisthesis.

Increased intrathecal (subarachnoid space) compression as a result of narrowing of the spinal canal also can lead indirectly to mechanical compression of nerve roots and cause venous congestion, diminished arterial blood flow, and resultantly decreased impulse conduction at the nerve roots. However, narrowing at multiple spinal levels may be necessary to elicit such complications.

Symptoms of spinal stenosis are caused by and become most prominent when there is a reduction of the interlaminar space; this occurs naturally with prolonged standing when the spine is in an erect position. Extension of the spine causes the overlapping of laminar edges of adjacent vertebral bodies, with resultant relaxation and inward buckling of the ligamental flavum along with the movement of the superior facets in a rostral-anterior direction. Walking may additionally exacerbate symptoms as the increase in oxygen demands of the spinal nerve roots may exceed the available blood flow, especially in the case of elevated pressures in the intrathecal (subarachnoid) space.

Neurogenic claudication results from central canal stenosis, whereas radiculopathy is the sequelae to lateral recess encroachment.
