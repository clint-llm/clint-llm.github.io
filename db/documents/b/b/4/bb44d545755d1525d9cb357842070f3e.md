Menstrual-related headaches are related to several important factors, mainly estrogen, which has actions involved in the serotonergic and glutamatergic systems of the CNS. This accounts for its association with headaches, where serotonin and estrogen levels are directly related. During the late secretory phase of the menstrual cycle, when estrogen is low, the production of serotonin decreases, leading to increased calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P from trigeminal nerves. These substances are involved in the pathophysiology of general migraines and cause vasodilation of intracerebral vessels and sensory sensitization of the trigeminal nerve. Permeability of the blood-brain barrier increases, which releases pro-inflammatory mediators in the pain-sensitive meninges.

Family history should be assessed when a patient presents to a provider with a general acute headache. Genetic differences include increased expression of membranous protein channels and receptors involved in the pathophysiology of migraines.
