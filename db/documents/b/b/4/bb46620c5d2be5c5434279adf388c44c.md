Clinicians should monitor for triptan-associated cardiovascular adverse effects in patients taking propranolol. Propranolol is often used for migraine prevention and decreases the metabolism of some triptans like almotriptan and rizatriptan by inhibiting their metabolism via the monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) pathway. For these patients, lowering the triptan dose or using a triptan that is not metabolized by the MAO-A pathway or other abortive migraine therapy is preferred.

Other monitoring parameters include the degree of response to triptan therapy, migraine recurrence, and consistent response to the same triptan. Also, patients review monitoring for nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and/or noise, which may occur during a migraine attack, and ultimately, improved ability to function.
