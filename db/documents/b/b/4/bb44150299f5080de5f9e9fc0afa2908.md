The patch has an adhesive side that contains an active ingredient that must be applied directly flat on the skin. The skin should be cleaned with water before application and allowed to dry to be free of oil and other debris.

The transdermal fentanyl patch must be removed after 72 hours and replaced with a fresh patch in a new suitable location. The fentanyl will be absorbed first through the topmost layer of the epidermis (stratum corneum) until further reaching the blood vessels to enter the systemic circulation and exert effects on the target receptors. An important consideration with the transdermal patch is the secondary reservoir of the skin. After about 24 hours, significant amounts of fentanyl transfer into the epidermis, which will act as a reservoir for fentanyl; only after the epidermis has absorbed enough drug will it enter the systemic circulation. This action provides a sustained level of fentanyl to avoid inconsistent pain control. This secondary reservoir phenomenon allows for the continual absorption of fentanyl and continues to exert effects on target receptors until the reservoir amount descends below the threshold.
