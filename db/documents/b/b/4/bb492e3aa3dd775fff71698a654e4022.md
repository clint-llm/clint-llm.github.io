**Prevention:**

Prophylactic treatment for cryptococcal infection is recommended in HIV-positive patients with a CD4 count of fewer than 100 cells/microL. Fluconazole and Itraconazole are the recommended drugs for prophylaxis against cryptococcosis.

**Current research:**

Efficacy of sertraline an antidepressant as an adjunct therapy with fluconazole is being studied in preventing cryptococcal infections in asymptomatic patients who test positive for cryptococcal antigen. A long-term prospective study is being performed to have a better understanding of the immunogenetic defects that might play a role in the pathogenesis of cryptococcal infections.
