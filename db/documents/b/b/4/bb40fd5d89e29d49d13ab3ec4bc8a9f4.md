When evaluating a person suspected of having scarlet fever, there are several things to consider. After carefully taking a history and physical, the next steps of the evaluation can be considered. In cases associated with pharyngitis, lack of a cough, exudates, cervical nodes, temperature, and age (less than 15 years) help determine the likelihood of strep throat. This is known as the CENTOR criterion.

Testing available to the clinician includes throat culture and the rapid strep test. Both test for the presence of GAS. The throat culture takes longer (days) and is more specific, and the rapid test is immediate (minutes) and less specific. The use of the rapid strep test with older persons (greater than 45 years) is controversial since they are more likely to be in a carrier state and have a lower prevalence in that age group. This combination may increase exposure to inappropriate antibiotics and increase resistance.

Therefore, in young patients with a high CENTOR score, rapid strep is recommended to confirm the infection, and treatment is initiated. Depending on your practice environment and follow-up, your decision to treat may be influenced.
