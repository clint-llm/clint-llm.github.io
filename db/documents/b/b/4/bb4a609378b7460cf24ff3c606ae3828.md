In surgery, the posterior auricular artery is important when it comes to procedures performed on the scalp and posterior region of the ear. The knowledge of the location of the artery and the anastomoses are crucial when it comes to biopsy of the superficial temporal artery. The superficial temporal artery requires biopsy in giant cell temporal arteritis". This condition is a large vessel vasculitis that affects the superficial temporal artery. The definitive diagnosis of this condition is via biopsy. After the biopsy, the posterior auricular artery will provide blood supply to the region that was predominately perfused by the superficial temporal artery.

In neurosurgery, the posterior auricular artery is grafted in rare instances to restore the blood supply in the circle of Willis. The restoration of blood supply in the circle of Willis is via bypass grafting.

In plastic surgery, the tissue and skin that is perfused by the posterior auricular artery has utility in ear reconstruction. The pedicle of tissue posterior to the ear can be dissected and rotated to reconstruct or create the ear. The rotation of the pedicle of tissue will continue to have the majority of its blood supply from the posterior auricular artery.

The posterior auricular artery can also be used as a landmark during dissection to find the facial nerve. The facial nerve exits the stylomastoid foramen. Perfusion of this foramen is via the posterior auricular artery.
