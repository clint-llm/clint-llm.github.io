Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) have been in use for decades as an integral method of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring for spinal, CNS, and vascular surgeries. In combination with other modes of neurophysiological monitoring, SEPs serve to herald potential or actual nerve injury and allow for correction to avoid the morbidity associated with the surgery. Several forms of neuromonitoring exist: SEPs, muscle motor evoked potentials, EEG, brainstem auditory evoked potentials, etc. This activity reviews somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and the role of the interprofessional interprofessional team in their correct use, interpretation, and management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify structures that can be monitored intraoperatively by SEPs.
- Describe factors that can influence SEPs, including operative changes and pharmacologic agents. 
- Review SEP interpretation and how potential changes may be managed during surgery to avoid neurologic injury.
- Explain the importance of the coordinated effort of the interprofessional team in identifying and treating alterations in SEPs to avoid surgical morbidity and improve outcomes.
