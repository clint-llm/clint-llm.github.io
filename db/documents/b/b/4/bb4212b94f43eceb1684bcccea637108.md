Ensuring that the entire healthcare team is aware of the diagnosis of pseudopapilledema is critical to avoiding morbidity or mortality associated with misguided investigations or treatments for other causes of optic disc edema or papilledema. It is not unheard of patients with headaches and pseudopapilledema to undergo invasive testing with lumbar punctures, receive unnecessary radiation during CT venogram studies, or even have surgical interventions performed, such as dural venous sinus stenting for supposed idiopathic intracranial hypertension. With proper education of the patient and others in their healthcare team can avoid these diagnostic tests and treatments.

Patients with ODD should also work with their primary care physician to optimize their vasculopathic risk factors for NAION to minimize their chances of having a catastrophic acute anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.
