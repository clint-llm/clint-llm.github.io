GHB is rapidly absorbed in the body with a quick onset of action between five minutes to 15 minutes, with users often reporting an initial period of euphoria. The clinical symptoms and duration of GHB toxicity are dose-dependent; peak plasma concentrations and clinical effects are reached between 30 minutes to 60 minutes, and duration of action is two to four hours. The elimination half-life ranges from 20 minutes to 60 minutes. Lower doses of GHB (10 mg/kg) have amnestic and variable sedative effects. Doses of 20 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg lead to cycles of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Higher doses (50 mg/kg) result in bradycardia, respiratory depression, and coma. Co-intoxicants, especially alcohol, can further augment the effects and duration of symptoms.
