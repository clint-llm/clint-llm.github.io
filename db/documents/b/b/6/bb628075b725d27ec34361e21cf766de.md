Wet age-related macular degeneration is a leading cause of severe vision loss in the elderly population, both in the United States and worldwide. Early detection is vital so that treatment can be implemented promptly, in turn increasing the potential for successful prevention of blindness. Affordable, home-monitoring techniques such as usage of an Amsler grid may help decrease the latency between onset of wet age-related macular degeneration and initiation of treatment. This activity describes who is a candidate for a home Amsler grid and reviews how to use the Amsler grid. Additionally, this activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in helping to identify patients who might benefit from this tool and educate these patients on how to use it.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for use of an Amsler grid.
- Explain how to use an Amsler grid.
- Describe how to interpret the results of an Amsler grid session.
- Review interprofessional team strategies to improve identification of patients who might benefit from the use of a home Amsler grid and to provide education to these patients.
