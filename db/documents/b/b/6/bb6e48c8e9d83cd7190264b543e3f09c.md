The significant nerves which are related to the supraclavicular lymph nodes are the phrenic and the vagus nerves which lie lateral and medial to the internal jugular vein, respectively.

The phrenic nerve arises from the ventral rami of roots (C3-C4-C5) and receives a contribution from the cervical sympathetic ganglia. The nerve forms at the superior lateral border of the anterior scalene muscle and then descends obliquely towards the medial side of the anterior scalene muscle (staying deep to the prevertebral fascia, the supraclavicular lymph nodes and the transverse cervical vessels). As the nerve approaches the root of the neck, it usually traverses between the subclavian artery and vein and descends to the mediastinum to supply the diaphragm muscle.

The vagus nerve takes its origin in the medulla oblongata from various nuclei which are out of the scope of the text. The vagus nerve then exits the skull via the jugular foramen and descends inside the carotid sheath posterior and lateral to the common and internal carotid arteries and medial to the internal jugular vein. The right and left vagal nerves then descend anterior to the subclavian arteries to the thorax and the abdomen.
