Cutaneous angiofibroma is a term used to define a group of lesions with different clinical presentations but with the same histologic findings. Both facial angiofibromas (greater than or equal to 3 needed) and periungual angiofibroma (greater than or equal to 2 needed) are 2 of the major criteria for TS. Multiple facial angiofibromas are also found in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1) and Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome. Pearly penile papules are chronic, asymptomatic, papules found on the coronal margin and sulcus of the penis. They are more common in uncircumcised men. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of cutaneous angiofribromas and highlights the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.
