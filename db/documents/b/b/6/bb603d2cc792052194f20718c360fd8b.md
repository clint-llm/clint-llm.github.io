School refusal is a challenge for children, families, and school personnel. Failing to attend school has significant short and long-term effects on children's social, emotional, and educational development. It is important to identify problems early and provide interventions to prevent further difficulties. A collaborative approach is required for the assessment and management of school refusal which includes the provider, parents, school staffs and other mental health professional. Many children often present with physical symptoms, evaluation by a physician is important to rule out any underlying medical problems. Children with school refusal are often scared to go to school, scared enough that they will not leave the house.
