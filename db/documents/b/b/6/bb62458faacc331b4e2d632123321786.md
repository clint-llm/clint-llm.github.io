Currently, only veterinary Eastern equine encephalitis virus vaccines are available, especially for use in horses. There are no licensed vaccines available or EEE at the time. There is an inactivated Vero cell vaccine for Japanese encephalitis approved since 2009. Some studies have identified cross-protection with Yellow fever, but no association has been documented with EEE.

Some researchers are currently working on a possible live-virus vaccine potentially effective against multiple mosquito-borne diseases, but more research is granted.
