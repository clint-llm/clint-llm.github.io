Pulmonary vascular dilatation resulting from an imbalance between vasodilators and vasoconstrictors is thought to be the main reason for HPS. The exact mechanism of vasodilation is not precise, and multiple studies are ongoing to elucidate the exact mechanism. Pulmonary endothelial nitric oxide synthetase (eNOS) stimulation happens in the lungs due to increased hepatic production of endothelin 1 (ET1) and pulmonary endothelin B (ETB) due to stress. eNOS stimulation causes increased nitric oxide (NO) production, which is a potent vasodilator.

Translocation of intestinal bacteria and endotoxemia in liver disease patients leads to massive accumulation of macrophages and monocytes in the lungs. These macrophages release tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in pulmonary vessels leading to inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) activation. iNOS stimulation also causes increased nitric oxide (NO) production. Bacterial accumulation and increased NO cause increased levels of heme oxygenase. Heme oxygenase causes the degradation of heme and leads to increased carbon monoxide (CO) production. Being potent vasodilators, this increased production of NO and CO plays a crucial role in pulmonary vasodilatation. Also, macrophages and monocytes, and TNF alpha activate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), leading to increased angiogenesis in the pulmonary vasculature.

Vasodilation and angiogenesis lead to arteriovenous (AV) shunt formation within pulmonary vasculature, leading to ventilation-perfusion mismatch. The pulmonary capillaries are dilated to 15-500mm in HPS as compared to a normal diameter between 8-15mm.

This pulmonary vasodilation, AV shunts, and impaired diffusion lead to ventilation-perfusion mismatch creating increased alveolar-arterial gradient and hypoxemia.

Two types of HPS have been based on the location of dilated pulmonary vessels.

- Type I HPS – dilatation of vessels at the precapillary levels near gas exchange units of the lungs. Supplemental O2 increases PaO2 in this type of HPS.

- Type II HPS – larger dilatation of vessels causing arteriovenous shunts away from gas exchange units of lungs. Supplemental O2 is not helpful.
