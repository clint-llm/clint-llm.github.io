In global ischemic injury, histologic changes become apparent within 12Â to 24 hours of injury. The first changes seen are shrinking or swelling of neurons. After that, "red neurons" may develop as a consequence of cytoplasmic eosinophilia, nuclear pyknosis, and other necrotic changes. Other findings of edema may also become apparent, such as empty areas within the parenchyma with widened pericellular and perivascular spaces.

Grossly, this may appear as irregular zones of discoloration with a blurring of the zones between gray and white matter. Over time, this evolves into the loss of neurons and gliosis. While most parts of the body affected by ischemia undergo coagulative necrosis, the brain is unique in that it undergoes liquefactive necrosis. This appears as viscous material containing numerous inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and cell debris under a microscope.
