The prognosis depends on the etiology of PRCA.

1. Inherited PRCA

- Patients who respond to and can get weaned off steroids can have a normal life span.

- Patients who do not respond to steroids and are dependent on chronic transfusions suffer from organ toxicity secondary to iron overload. Their median life expectancy is 30 to 40 years.

- Those who receive stem cell transplant (SCT) at a younger age have better outcomes compared to those who receive SCT at an older age and after chronic transfusions.

2. Acquired PRCA:

Japanese consortium reported the long-term follow-up results of patients with PRCA in their cohort of patients, which gave some insight into the long-term prognosis of patients with acquired PRCA.

- The life span of patients with acquired PRCA is significantly shorter than the general population.

- The life expectancy amongst patients with different causes of PRCA (LGL versus thymoma versus idiopathic PRCA) was not different

- Infection and organ failure were the most common causes of death rather than the progression of the underlying disease. This finding further stresses close monitoring and prompt management of infection (in patients on immunosuppressive therapy) and iron overload (in patients who receive chronic transfusions). Iron chelation in a cohort of patients with aplastic anemia showed improvement in hematopoiesis.

- Maintenance with cyclosporine is essential for most patients to prevent relapses.

- Patients who respond to steroids have a median survival of 12 years. For those who respond to cyclosporine A, their median survival has not been reached, and 95% of patients were alive at 14-year follow-up.
