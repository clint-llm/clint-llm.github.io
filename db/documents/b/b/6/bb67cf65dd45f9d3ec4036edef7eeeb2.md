A urine test may show hematuria. Urine analysis may detect cancer cells in the urine. A blood test may show anemia or high serum calcium levels.

If RCC is suspected, renal and bladder ultrasound is usually the first radiographic test. If the renal ultrasound shows a solid mass or a complex cyst with septations or nodules, the next test should be a dedicated CT scan of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder before and after IV contrast with delayed imaging of the entire abdomen and pelvis.

If the renal ultrasound is negative, but the patient has unexplained hematuria, a CT scan before and after IV contrast should be the next test as small solid renal masses can be easily missed on ultrasound and small renal stones also can be missed on ultrasound.

On CT scan, RCC will typically demonstrate significant enhancement; usually, greater than 20 Hounsfield units (HU), more after contrast. Typically, postcontrast HU of renal cancer measure about 141 HU. The subtypes papillary cell and clear cell may enhance less than RCC.

CT scan is used to stage RCC. CT scan will detect lymphadenopathy and invasion to the renal vein or inferior vena cava or invasion to adjacent organs. CT scan can detect metastatic disease to the bones of the abdomen and pelvis only. Whole body bone scan is the test of choice to detect bone metastases. Chest CT scan also should be obtained, as RCC presents with lung metastases in about 10% to 20%. The use of PET-CT is controversial but is helpful for distant metastases.

Abdominal MRI is just as good as CT scan for diagnosing and staging RCC but is more subject to limitations such as respiratory motion artifact because the images take longer to acquire.
