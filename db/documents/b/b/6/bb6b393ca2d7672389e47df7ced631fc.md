**The basics of initial therapy**for pes anserine bursitis include the usual typical recommendations for many musculoskeletal disorders, including rest, ice, and short-term nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use (unless otherwise contraindicated based on the patient’s medical history). Additionally, in the setting of obesity and deconditioning, weight loss and muscle strengthening exercises (particularly the quadriceps muscle group) can help with the long-term resolution of symptoms.

In patients with underlying osteoarthritis or occasionally associated conditions such as knee malalignment or pes planus, treatment may need to be directed at this entity as well. Steroid injections are reserved for refractory symptoms but may be used initially with severe pain or in patients with nocturnal pain symptoms. However, steroid injections risk complications such as subcutaneous tissue atrophy, skin pigmentation, and tendon tear.

Additional modalities for treatment include therapeutic ultrasound, physical therapy, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).

**Surgical intervention**is usually reserved for cases that fail conservative treatment over long periods. Incision and drainage of the bursae can relieve the symptoms, but bursal excision has also been reported in the literature. Underlying conditions should be addressed, as in cases of exostosis that should be excised.
