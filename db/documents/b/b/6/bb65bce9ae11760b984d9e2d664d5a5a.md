While there are several traditional peak flow meters of various designs on the market, they all use the same general principle. First, the patient should reset the meter by sliding the marker all the way to zero on the scale. While sitting or standing up straight, the patient should take in a full, deep breath. The mouthpiece is then placed in the patientâ€™s mouth followed by a single, fast, forceful expiration. The marker will slide outward on the numbered scale, indicating the peak expiratory flow rate for that attempt. Using the best reading from several repeated attempts is recommended; patients should not average several attempts as the lower readings usually represent faulty technique or poor effort.
