The management of chronic bronchitis is complex and lifelong. There is no cure for the disorder, and the patients are prone to many complications. Thus, the condition is best managed with an interprofessional team that consists of a primary care physician, respiratory physiotherapist, nurse practitioner, pulmonologist, infectious disease expert, radiologist, and internist. Chronic bronchitis has a significant impact on morbidity and quality of life. Smoking is a major contributor; hence smoking cessation needs to form an important strategy for prevention. Alteration in lifestyle and regular vaccination for influenza as well as pneumonia can reduce the morbidity in those who have chronic bronchitis. The overall prognosis for most patients is poor, with many patients being disabled from progressive shortness of breath.
