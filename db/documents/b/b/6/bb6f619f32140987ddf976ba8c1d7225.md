To diagnose asthma, clinicians can do a variety of tests. Tests must determine: expiratory airflow limitation, documentation of reversible obstruction, and rule out any exclusion of an alternative diagnosis. Assessing the patientâ€™s obstruction via spirometry and checking for a reversible change after a bronchodilator is suggestive for the diagnosis of asthma. By using spirometry, physicians can diagnose asthma as well as the severity of obstruction.
