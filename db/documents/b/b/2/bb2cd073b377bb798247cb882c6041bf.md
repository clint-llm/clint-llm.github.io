The ethmoidal cells, which are present in the ethmoid bone, are innervated by the anterior and posterior ethmoidal branches of the nasociliary nerve.

The ethmoid bone and ethmoid sinuses are associated with some cranial nerves. The olfactory nerve, which forms the first cranial nerve, arises from the caudal surface of the olfactory bulb and crosses the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone to reach the nasal cavity.
