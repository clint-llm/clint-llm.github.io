Hashimoto thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder of inadequate thyroid hormone production. The biochemical picture indicates raised thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in response to low free T4. Low total T4 or free T4 level in the presence of an elevated TSH level confirms the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism.

Integrative and functional medicine practitioners may also assess free T3 and reverse T3 levels, however, Western medicine does not use this approach.

The presence of anti-thyroid peroxidase and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies suggests Hashimoto thyroiditis, however, 10%  of patients may be antibody negative.

Anemia is present in 30 to 40%.

There can be decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow, and renal free water clearance with resultant hyponatremia.

Creatine kinase is frequently elevated.

Prolactin levels may be elevated.

Elevated total cholesterol, LDL, and triglyceride levels can occur.

A thyroid ultrasound assesses thyroid size, echotexture, and whether thyroid nodules are present; however, it is usually not necessary for diagnosing the conditioning the majority.
