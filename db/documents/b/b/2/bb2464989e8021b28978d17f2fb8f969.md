Increased LDL is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

For this reason, LDL is clinically significant as it is crucial to monitor LDL levels in patients with hypertension and diabetes. Lifestyle modifications are crucial in overweight patients to lose weight through both exercise and diet control. Diets with lower saturated fats and aerobic exercise can help reduce LDL for patients. Pharmacologic modalities can also be utilized to decrease LDL levels, primarily HMG-Coa Reductase inhibitors, such as pravastatin and lovastatin, help significantly decrease serum LDL levels by inhibiting the conversion of HMG Coa to Mevalonate, which is a precursor to cholesterol.
