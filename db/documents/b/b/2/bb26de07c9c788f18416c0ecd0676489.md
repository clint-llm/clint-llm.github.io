The kidneys are innervated by autonomic fibers that influence vascular, tubular, and excretory functions. Postganglionic nerves from the renal plexus travel along renal vasculature to enter the parenchyma. Sympathetic innervation comes from spinal cord levels T11-L3 and innervates the nephrons and renal vasculature completely. It is concentrated most heavily around the afferent arterioles, thick ascending limbs, and distal convoluted tubules. The vagus nerve contributes parasympathetic fibers.
