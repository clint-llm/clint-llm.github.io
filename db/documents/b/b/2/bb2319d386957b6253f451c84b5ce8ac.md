**Patient History**

A host of thoughts and behaviors are associated with self-destructive acts. Although many assume that people who talk about suicide will not follow through with it, a threat of suicide can lead to the completed act; therefore suicidal ideation should not be dismissed cavalierly as research suggests associations between suicidal ideation and attempts.

Numerous activities are associated with completing suicide, including the following:

- Making a will

- Getting the house and affairs together

- Unexpectedly visiting friends and family members

- Purchasing a gun, hose, or rope

- Writing a suicide note

- Visiting a primary care physician

With regard to the last item, a significant number of people see their primary care physician within 3 weeks before they commit suicide. They come for a variety of medical problems, but rarely will they state they are contemplating suicide. Therefore, the practitioner must pay attention to the entire person; the physician must look for factors in the patient's life beyond the chief complaint.

**Suicide-related Characteristics**

Individuals who are suicidal have a number of characteristics, including the following:

- A preoccupation with death

- A sense of isolation and withdrawal

- Few friends or family members

- An emotional distance from others

- Distraction and lack of humor - They often seem to be "in their own world" and lack a sense of humor (anhedonia)

- Focus on the past - They dwell in past losses and defeats and anticipate no future; they voice the notion that others and the world would be better off without them.

- Haunted and dominated by hopelessness and helplessness - They are without hope and therefore cannot foresee things ever improving; they also view themselves as helpless in 2 ways: (1) they cannot help themselves, and all their efforts to liberate themselves from the sea of depression in which they are drowning are to no avail; and (2) no one else can help them
