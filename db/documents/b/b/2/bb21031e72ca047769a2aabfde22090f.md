The cutaneous biopsy reveals a dense dermal lymphocyte infiltrate of evocative triangular morphology with an epidermal base seen at low magnification. The composition of the infiltrate is variable and correlates with the age of the lesion. The epidermis is frequently ulcerated. Several histologic types of lymphomatoid papulosis have been described. According to the number of lymphocytes expressing CD30 and according to their size, we distinguish type A papulosis in which the CD30 cells are numerous, type B veryÂ close to the mycosis fungoides with no or few CD30+ cells and epidermotropism, and finally, type C, with large CD30+ lymphocyte plaques. Other rare forms have been reported: forms expressing markers of cytotoxicity, CD8, TIA1, granzyme B,
