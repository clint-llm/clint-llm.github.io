The histological features of SDRIFE are not specific and very variable. Typically, a superficial perivascular infiltrate of mononuclear cells is observed. It includes in some cases, some neutrophils and eosinophils.

However, other features were also reported including subcorneal pustules, vacuolar changes and hydropic degeneration with subepidermal bullae, and necrotic keratinocytes.
