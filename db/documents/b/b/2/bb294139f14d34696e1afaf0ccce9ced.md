Acute dyspnea is usually a medical emergency and is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes the emergency department physician, internist, pulmonologist, intensivist, radiologist and nurse practitioner. The cause of dyspnea must be identified and treated, otherwise the patient may develop respiratory failure and/or death.
