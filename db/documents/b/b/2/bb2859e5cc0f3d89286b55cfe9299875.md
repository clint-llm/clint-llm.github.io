Patient safety and quality of care are essential components of nursing practice and priorities that demand consideration to enable the delivery of high-quality, patient-centered care, and overall well-being. Medical errors are unfortunately very common in clinical practice, and in addition to compromising a patient’s personal safety, they can also be extremely costly for hospitals. ADEs qualify as unintended injuries or insults directly related to medical interventions involving a drug resulting in disability at discharge, death, or extended hospital stay that is the result of health care management rather than by the patient’s underlying disease process.

In a recent 2018 study, ADEs reportedly result in more than 770,000 injuries or deaths in US hospitals each year and are responsible for an estimated hospital expense of $1.56 to $5.6 billion annually. Moreover, patients experience an additional individual cost between $2,852 and $8,116 per ADE incidence relative to increased length of hospital stay and prolonged treatment.
