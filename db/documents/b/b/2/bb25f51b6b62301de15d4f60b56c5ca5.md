- Esketamine- Intranasal esketamine is FDA approved for treatment-resistant depression in adults, in combination with an oral antidepressant. It is also indicated for treating major depressive disorder with suicidal ideation or behavior in adults.

- The FDA has approved dextromethorphan/bupropion fixed drug combination(FDC) for major depressive disorder. FDA granted dextromethorphan/bupropion breakthrough therapy designation under priority review.

- Meta-analysis of the comparative efficacy of antidepressant results indicates that sertraline and escitalopram have good efficacy with minimal adverse drug reactions than other drugs. Hence sertraline or escitalopram is the initial drug of choice for unipolar major depression.

- Antidepressants are the drug of choice for depression, but they also have FDA approval as treatments for other medical disorders. For example, antidepressants are helpful in treating obsessive-compulsive disorder, social phobia, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

- Antidepressants also have non-FDA-approved, off-label indications. For example, tricyclic antidepressants are prescribed for pain, insomnia, and migraine. Trazodone, a serotonin modulator, is used off-label for insomnia.
