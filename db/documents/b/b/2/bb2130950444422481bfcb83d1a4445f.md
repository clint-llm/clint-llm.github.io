Along with the rest of the nervous system, the embryological onset of dorsal root ganglia occurs when the neural tube has formed, and neural crest cells arise at the margins of the neural tube. Neural crest cells differentiate into the peripheral nervous system components, the dorsal root ganglia. These neural crest cells migrate to various locations and differentiate into different cell types within the embryo. DRG cells develop at about four weeks post-conception from the neural crest migration and migrate ventrally immediately after.

During the seventh to eighth weeks, early bipolar neurons begin to appear. At about 11 weeks, unipolar neurons with a single broad process and well-developed organelles start to form. The onset of reflex responsiveness from the skin of the upper limb correlates with the appearance of (pseudo) unipolar neurons.
