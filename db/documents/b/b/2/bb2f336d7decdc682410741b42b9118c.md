The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has as its primary goal the creation of value for the patients of our healthcare system. One of the main ways it accomplishes value-based outcomes is driven by incentivizing doctors, hospitals, and healthcare providers to coordinate clinically efficient patient care. The healthcare providers become eligible for various (financial and/or other occupationally-based) bonuses when clinical care is delivered effectively with quality outcomes.

The term ACO was originally coined by researchers and policy experts to describe entities that consist of responsibly integrated healthcare providers who all are working toward achieving a common clinical goal and outcome: efficient, high-quality patient care while utilizing a common clinical pathway that incorporates principles of treatment and therapeutic modalities in a multifaceted provider setting.

There are three core Accountable Care Organizations principles:

- Provider-led organizations with a strong base of primary care that is accountable for the quality and per capita costs

- Payments linked to improvement in quality and reduced costs

- Reliable and increasingly sophisticated measurement of performance to support improvement and provide confidence care is improved, and cost savings occur.
