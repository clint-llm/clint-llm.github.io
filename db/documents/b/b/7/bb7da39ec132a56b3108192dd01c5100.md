Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) is a rare form of PH that is more common in females. The incidence of the other groups is similar to the particular underlying diseases.

The prevalence of group 3 pulmonary hypertension (PH) appears to be high in older patients. However, prevalence varies among COPD patients due to genetic polymorphisms, with higher mean pulmonary pressures in COPD patients with LL serotonin transporter gene polymorphism when compared to LS or SS variants.
