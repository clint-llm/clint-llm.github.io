The human being is the only natural host of Treponema pallidum. Treponemes areÂ helical spirochetal bacteria, thin and spirally coiled. They can be seen in dark-field microscopy or immunofluorescence. Treponema pallidum infection, if left untreated or partially treated, can lead to late neurosyphilis which has two forms, general paresis (also known as "syphilitic dementia," "dementia paralytica" or "paretic neurosyphilis") and tabes dorsalis (also known as "locomotor ataxia"). Treponema pallidum can be transferred vertically from mother to fetus and through sexual intercourse.
