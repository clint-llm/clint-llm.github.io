The function of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle is to raise the upper eyelid and to maintain the upper eyelid position. The levator palpebrae superioris muscle origin is the periosteum of the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone, superior to the optic foramen. The muscle travels anteriorly along the superior aspect of the orbit superior to the superior rectus muscle. The supraorbital artery and the frontal and lacrimal nerves are superior to the levator muscle in the orbit. Distally the muscle widens and becomes a tendon sheath known as the levator aponeurosis in the region of the Whitnall ligament, which is a transverse suspensory ligament. The Whitnall ligament appears to be part of the pulley system allowing the horizontal levator muscle to become the more vertical levator aponeurosis.

The Whitnall ligament also forms part of the complex Koornneef orbital septae, which provide support to the globe and orbital components and also serve as an accessory locomotor system. The levator aponeurosis has lateral and medial wings attaching to the respective canthal tendons. The lateral horn is more robust than the medial horn.

The levator aponeurosis has multiple insertions: anteriorly into the upper eyelid skin, inferiorly on the anterior surface of the upper tarsal plate, and with indirect extensions to the superior conjunctival fornix. Posterior to the levator aponeurosis is the superior tarsal muscle (Müller muscle), which is a smooth muscle that also attaches to the superior tarsal plate. The levator palpebrae superioris is not a smooth muscle but a skeletal muscle.
