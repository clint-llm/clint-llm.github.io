Malakoplakia is a rare inflammatory condition that typically occurs in immunocompromised individuals. It was first described by Michaelis and Gutmann in 1902 after identifying the Michaelis-Gutmann bodies that are pathognomonic for this condition.

In 1903, von Hansemann coined the term “malakoplakia,” meaning “soft plaque.”

While the exact etiology is unknown, Escherichia coli is the most common organism associated with this condition, although several others have been implicated.
