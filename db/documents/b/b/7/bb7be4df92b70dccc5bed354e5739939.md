There are two broad theories as to the etiology of Kikuchi disease – infectious and autoimmune. Many infectious agents – both viral and bacterial – have been considered as possible triggers for Kikuchi disease. The viral triggers list is extensive and includes Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2 (HSV 1/2), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), human herpesvirus (HHV 6, 7, 8), parvovirus B19, human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1), rubella, paramyxovirus, and parainfluenza. However, no viral particles have ever been identified in biopsied tissue and thus a direct viral cause has never been confirmed

In terms of the autoimmune hypothesis, there has been an identification of human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) in populations more likely to get this disease. More specifically, HLA class II alleles HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 are more common in Asian populations where the disease is more prevalent. Kikuchi disease has been associated with a long list of autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjogren’s syndrome, Wegener’s granulomatosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Still’s disease, et cetera

There have also been case reports of malignancies, central nervous system infections, renal failure, interstitial lung disease, foreign body implants, and even Roun-en-Y gastric bypass surgery associated with Kikuchi disease, suggesting that various physical insults can trigger the onset of the disease
