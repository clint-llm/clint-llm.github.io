Patients usually have no symptoms until complications arise. Hematemesis from bleeding varices is the most common presentation. Melena without hematemesisÂ can also be present. As cirrhosis is the most common cause of portal hypertension, patients may present with stigmata of cirrhosis. These include jaundice, gynecomastia, palmar erythema, spider nevi, testicular atrophy, ascites, pedal edema, or asterixis due to hepatic encephalopathy.
