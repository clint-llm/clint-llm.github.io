Heat is generated on a cellular level by metabolism. The basal metabolic rate increases by thyroid hormone, sympathetic stimulation, muscle activity, and chemical activity within cells. When cell metabolism is high, there is a great demand for ATP. During hydrolysis of high energy ATP bonds, part of the derived energy dissipates as heat.
