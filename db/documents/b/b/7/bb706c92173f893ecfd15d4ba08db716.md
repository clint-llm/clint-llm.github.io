Stereocilia play an integral role in the inner ear. The core of a stereocilium consists of actin bundles. Stereocilia are linked together by linker molecules. Unconventional myosin is a subgroup of myosin that organizes and moves stereocilia with the use of transduction canals. Defects in unconventional myosin can lead to hearing loss.
