Conventionally, polypharmacy is considered something to be avoided, and there is evidence that potentially inappropriate prescribing is likely to be associated with polypharmacy. However, more recent research has identified that appropriately managing patients with targeted medications can prevent unplanned hospital admissions. For example, patients with six or more comorbid conditions on four to six medicines are no more likely to have unexpected hospital admissions than those with one to three medications. Hence clinicians need to differentiate between appropriate polypharmacy when all medicines are prescribed to achieve the specific therapeutic objective and medication therapy has been optimized to prevent adverse drug reactions.

In contrast, inappropriate (conventional) polypharmacy is when one or more medications are prescribed than clinically indicated, resulting in adverse patient outcomes and not achieving the therapeutic objective. A study concluded that it could no longer be assumed that polypharmacy was always harmful and that the clinical reasoning in which medicines have been prescribed needed to be considered. However, confirming that patients only receive the appropriate and targeted drug therapy for disease management should be the goal.
