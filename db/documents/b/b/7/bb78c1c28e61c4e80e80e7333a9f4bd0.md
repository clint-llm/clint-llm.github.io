# Continuing Education Activity

Choroid plexus papillomas (CPPs) are rare central nervous system tumors. They may be seen at any age, but are more common in infants. Their site of occurrence varies according to age. They usually present with the increasing head circumference or altered mental status in children; whereas in adults they present with signs of increased intracranial tension. Imaging shows intraventricular enhancing masses. Surgery is the therapeutic intervention of choice for these lesions. This activity describes the clinical evaluation of choroid plexus papilloma and explains the role of the interprofessional healthcare team in coordinating the care of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the presentation of choroid plexus papilloma.
- Describe the investigation of a patient with suspected choroid plexus papilloma.
- Outline the treatment of choroid plexus papilloma.
- Summarize the clinical evaluation of choroid plexus papilloma and explain the role of the health professional team in coordinating the care of this condition.

# Introduction

Choroid plexus papillomas (CPPs) are rare central nervous system tumors. They may be seen at any age, but are more common in infants. Their site of occurrence varies according to age. They usually present with the increasing head circumference or altered mental status in children; whereas in adults they present with signs of increased intracranial tension. Imaging shows intraventricular enhancing masses. Surgery is the therapeutic intervention of choice for these lesions. They have a good prognosis in spite of their size as they are benign. Improvements in surgical techniques and intensive care have improved survival.

# Etiology

Studies have shown that Simian virus (SV) 40 has an association with the occurrence of choroid plexus tumors (CPTs).

R248W mutation of the TP53 gene is one of the most common mutations in CPTs.

# Epidemiology

CPPs are rare tumors of neuroectodermal origin. In the pediatric population, they form the third most common congenital brain tumors, after teratomas and gliomas, and account for 0.4 to 0.6% of all intracranial neoplasms.

# Pathophysiology

According to the World Health Organization classification (2016),

# Histopathology

Microscopy shows papillary fronds lined by bland columnar epithelium. Mitotic activity, nuclear pleomorphism, and necrosis are typically absent.

On immunohistochemistry, tumors are positive for cytokeratin, vimentin, podoplanin, and S-100.

Genetic analyses have reported germline mutations in the TP53 gene in some patients with choroid plexus papilloma.

**Feature of atypical choroid plexus papilloma:**

The presence of more than 2 mitoses in the high-power field

**Features suggestive of choroid plexus carcinoma:**

The presence of any four of the following malignant characteristics:

- Brisk mitotic activity (> 5 mitoses per 10 high-power fields)

- Nuclear pleomorphism

- High cellularity

- The blurring of the papillary growth pattern and

- Necrosis

DNA methylation profiling has shown three distinct and molecular subgroups for CPTs

- Supratentorial pediatric low-risk choroid plexus tumors (CPP and aCPP)

- Infratentorial adult low-risk choroid plexus tumors (CPP and aCPP) and

- Supratentorial pediatric high-risk choroid plexus tumors (CPP and aCPP and CPC).

# History and Physical

Patients typically present with a history of gradual deterioration. Signs of raised intracranial tension, like vomiting, headache, lateral gaze palsies, homonymous visual field defects, reduced mentation, and so on are usually evident. Sometimes the patient may develop subarachnoid hemorrhage due to bleeding from the tumor. Infants present with increasing head circumference or poor feeding or both, along with upgaze palsy, reduced activity, and altered consciousness.

The clinical symptoms are predominantly due to hydrocephalus

# Evaluation

If fontanelles are not fused, neurosonogram (NSG) through the anterior fontanelle will demonstrate an echogenic lesion within the ventricles. This lesion continues to demonstrate bidirectional flow throughout the diastole, indicating blood flow through vessels arranged chaotically. Sometimes, the lesions are diagnosed antenatally by using ultrasound scans.

Computerized tomography (CT) shows an isodense or slightly hyperdense lesion within the ventricles along with consequent ventriculomegaly.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveals the well–defined, frond-like intraventricular lobulated masses, which are hypointense on T1WI  and hyperintense on T2WI.

# Treatment / Management

In incidentally detected tumors, there is controversy regarding the timing of surgery.

In symptomatic patients, gross total resection (GTR) is the treatment of choice as these tumors are benign. Recent advances in imaging, surgical approaches, and quality of intensive care have improved surgical outcomes with the chances of a cure reaching almost 100%.

Adjuvant chemotherapy, though limited in use, can prevent recurrence and prolong survival.

# Differential Diagnosis

Differentials for choroid plexus papilloma include

- Intraventricular tumors such as papillary ependymoma

- Central neurocytoma

- Subependymal giant cell tumor

- Subependymoma

- Choroid plexus tumors

- Medulloblastoma

- Meningioma

- Chordoid glioma

- Rosette-forming glioneuronal tumor

- Central nervous system lymphoma

- Metastasis

# Prognosis

Improvements in surgical and intensive care techniques have vastly improved the prognosis of patients.

# Complications

At presentation, children may have features of prolonged raised intracranial pressure such as papilledema, optic atrophy, and visual loss, which may not recover after surgery.

Intraoperatively there are high chances for excessive blood loss due to rich vascularity.

There have also been reports of postoperative CSF rhinorrhoea.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Any child presenting with altered sensorium has to be evaluated for an intraventricular tumor and managed with surgery to improve survival.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Management of choroid plexus papilloma requires an interprofessional team that includes the neurosurgeon, various specialists (e.g., anesthetist, pediatrician, ophthalmologist, neurologist), and neuroscience specialty-trained nurses. It is vital to educate the parents that even though these lesions are benign, complications can occur during surgery. A thorough discussion between the neurosurgeon and family should take place on the optimal procedure for the child. With adequate preparation of the child, the outcomes are excellent.
