The clinical features depend on the specific photodermatosis.

- Photodermatoses affect areas exposed to sunlight, usually the face, neck, hands, and do not affect areas not exposed to the light (covered at least by underwear), or are less severe in covered areas.

- Sometimes they spare areas that habitually are exposed to the light, for example, the face of a polymorphic light eruption.

- Sometimes they only affect certain parts of the body, for instance, juvenile spring eruption is confined to the tops of the ears.

- Photodermatoses may also occur following indoor exposure to artificial sources of UVR like fluorescent lamps or visible radiation.

- Genomic instability due to DNA repair deficiency disease causes pigmentary changes and high risk (1000 timesÂ normal) of skin tumors including basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma.

- Children with the photosensitive genodermatoses have characteristic cutaneous features and abnormalities of other organs.

Clues to photosensitivity include:

- Summer exacerbation; although, note that many photodermatoses are present year round

- Sharp cut-off between affected area and skin covered by clothing or jewellery (e.g., watch strap, ring)

- Sparing of folds of upper eyelids

- Sparing of deep furrows on face and neck

- Sparing of skin covered by hair

- Sparing of skin shadowed by the ears, under the nose and the chin

- Sparing of the web spaces between the fingers.
