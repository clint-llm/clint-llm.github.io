Electronic fetal monitoring, including identification of variable decelerations, has the ultimate goal of preventing adverse perinatal outcomes such as those listed above (hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, cerebral palsy, death). The efficacy of continuous electronic fetal monitoring, however, is debated. It has been shown to increase the rates of cesarean delivery and operative vaginal delivery and decrease neonatal seizures, but it has not been shown to reduce perinatal mortality or the risk of cerebral palsy.

Also, the intraobserver and interobserver variability of fetal heart rate tracing interpretation is high. In one study, obstetricians reviewed cardiotocographs and agreed only 22% of the time, and then two months later, they reviewed the same tracings and interpreted them differently in 21% of the cases.
