Dyspnea results from an interplay of multiple factors in a variety of patients with advanced illness and at the end of life. It has a large impact on the quality of life of patients and caregivers. Assessment is typically focused on the underlying disease process, as well as the social, psychological, and spiritual factors that may be contributing. The use of non-pharmacologic treatments should be the first step in treating patients. Such interventions include positioning, pacing, and the use of cool air and fans. Oxygen is not more useful than air in patients with normal oxygen levels. Pharmacologic treatment includes optimization of treatment of the underlying disease and opioids for symptom-based treatment. Pharmacologic strategies predominate in care at the end of life, and dyspnea is a common reason for the use of palliative sedation at this stage.

The palliative team, including nurses, should be involved in caregiver education and provide comfort measures.
