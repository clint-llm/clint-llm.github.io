Primary absorption of elemental mercury is through inhalation, which causes shortness of breath, cough, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, metallic taste, salivation, and visual disturbance. Severe exposure may lead to respiratory distress and failure. Ingested elemental mercury can be metabolized to inorganic mercury salts and can also develop those symptoms. Acute ingestion of organic salts typically will cause a metallic taste and a graying of the oral mucosa. The most common findings of significant ingestion include abdominal pain, hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, acute tubular necrosis, and shock.
