Patients should undergo a lumbar puncture if there are no contraindications to the procedure. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) should be sent for cell count and differential, glucose concentration, protein concentration, culture, and gram stain. CSF analysis will typically reveal lymphocytic pleocytosis, normal glucose, and elevated protein with a negative gram stain.

Virus-specific IgM and PCR of CSF and serum are helpful in obtaining a diagnosis when available. It is important to note that cross-reactivity has been demonstrated among flaviviruses.

Neuroimaging studies, preferably magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), should also be considered when evaluating a patient for encephalitis as distinct MRI findings can provide additional guidance in diagnostic testing. For example, MRI findings of diffusion restriction and abnormal signal intensities on T2 and FLAIR imaging can be indicative of WNV.

Electroencephalograms (EEG) are typically abnormal in patients with viral encephalitis and typically show generalized slowing. In patients with WNV encephalitis, the most common EEG abnormality include diffuse irregular slow waves.

Brain biopsy can be considered in patients with encephalitis with neurological deterioration if other non-invasive test is nonrevealing.
