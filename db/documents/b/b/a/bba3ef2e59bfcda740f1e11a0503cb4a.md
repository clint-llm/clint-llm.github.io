Sinusitis is inflammation of the sinus or nasal passage. Chronic sinusitis is chronic inflammation of the sinus or nasal passages occurring for more than 12 weeks at a time. Recurrent sinusitis is defined as greater than four episodes of sinusitis within a one-year period. The evaluation and management of acute and chronic sinusitis are similar. Chronic sinusitis may present as (1) chronic sinusitis without nasal polyps, (2) chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps, and (3) allergic fungal rhinosinusitis.
