Livedoid vasculopathy mainly presents with ulcerative lesions in both lower limbs. Local complications like secondary skin infections that show typical signs of inflammation are commonly encountered. Other manifestations like pain (due to local hypoxic damage and cytokine reaction), secondary cutaneous hyperpigmentation (due to extravasation of erythrocytes along with hemosiderin deposition in the skin), and mononeuritis multiplex (due to thrombosis of vasa nervorum) and atrophic scarring of skin are seen.
