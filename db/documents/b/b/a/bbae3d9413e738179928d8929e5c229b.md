The prevalence of cinchonism has been found to have a direct association with the dose of the quinoline drug used as well as accompanying medications used for synergy or otherwise. Thus far, no literature has described a prevalence of increased risk based on sex or ethnicity. In a study of 61 volunteers treated for P. falciparum with oral quinine and oral azithromycin, cinchonism occurred in nearly all subjects. The therapy was well tolerated and did not warrant discontinuation of treatment, but in patients taking these medications, there is near-unanimous symptomatology to some degree.
