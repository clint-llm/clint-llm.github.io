**Boundaries of the nasopharynx**

- Superiorly: the skull base.

- Anteriorly: the nasal cavity.

- Posteriorly: posterior pharyngeal wall.

- Inferiorly: the soft palate.

- Laterally: the medial pterygoid plates and superior pharyngeal constrictor muscles (surrounded by visceral fascia)

**Shape and Size**

The anterior-posterior (A-P) diameter of the nasopharynx is approximately 2 cm, and the height is approximately 4 cm.

**Contents**

- The eustachian tube opening is located at the posterolateral wall.

- The torus tubarius is located immediately posterior to the opening of the eustachian tube.

- The fossa of Rosenmuller is located superior and posteriorly to the torus tubarius.

- The adenoids (nasopharyngeal tonsils) are located in the roof and posterior wall of the nasopharynx.

**Function**

- The nasopharynx is a component of the upper airway system, connecting the nasal passages to the larynx and trachea, via the oropharynx.

- Muscles intrinsic to the nasopharynx control the opening of the eustachian tubes, which help control ventilation and equilibrium of atmospheric pressure between the middle ear cavity and nasopharynx.

- The nasopharynx contributes to voice resonance and production. Obstruction of the nasopharynx leads to voice changes (hyponasal).

- As inspired air is filtered and humidified within the nasal cavity, dust particles are trapped in nasal mucus and transported via the “mucociliary elevator,” which beats towards the nasopharynx. From there, nasal debris drains to the oropharynx.

- The nasopharyngeal isthmus blocks the nasopharynx during swallowing.
