Desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP) is a pathology characterized by extensive alveolar infiltration of macrophages followed by interstitial inflammation and fibrosis. About 90 percent of cases of DIP are related to cigarette smoking, though it can seen in non-smokers, including individuals with occupational risk factors or history of use of inhalation drugs of abuse. Although adult-onset DIP is not identified with any genetic defects, DIP in children is a distinct clinical entity with a demonstrated genetic mutation in surfactant protein B and C causing dysfunction. It usually portends a poorer prognosis. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of DIP and stresses the role of an interprofessional team approach to care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the patient history commonly associated with desquamative interstitial pneumonia.
- Describe the typical presentation of a patient with desquamative interstitial pneumonia.

- Describe the treatment options available for desquamative interstitial pneumonia.
- Employ interprofessional team strategies to improve outcomes for patients with desquamative interstitial pneumonia.
