The true incidence of neurapraxia is challenging to assess due to the following factors: It is reported as peripheral nerve injury in general, and PNI are almost always missed, underreported, and underestimated.

Neurapraxia typically results from mild traction or compression of the nerve. On the other end of the spectrum, neurotmesis result from transection injuries such as laceration, penetrating injuries, or gunshot wounds.

Based on a retrospective study, from 1989 to 2014, of 1124 patients (1418 nerve lesions), results showed the most common cause of PNI is vehicular accidents (46.4%), which affected mostly young men. Meanwhile, of the 866 cases with identified etiology, other causes are: penetrating trauma (23.9%), falls (10.9%), gunshot wounds (6.6%), car accidents involving pedestrians (2.7%), sports-related (2.4%) and miscellaneous (7.2%).

Most peripheral nerve compression injuries fall under Grade I or neurapraxia, which commonly occur in areas where the nerve passes through narrow anatomical openings. Compressions can be acute or chronic.Â Proposed mechanisms that appear to give rise to nerve compression and traction injuries include narrow openings and superficial nerve locations, which makes the nerve and its blood supply vulnerable to mechanical compression,

Patients with peripheral nerve injuries usually present with sensory or motor function disorders.

In these cases, a good knowledge of anatomy is beneficial.

Differential diagnosis includes peripheral neuropathies due to diabetes, hypothyroidism, alcohol, and malnutrition, radiculopathy, myelopathy, spinal cord trauma or infarction, muscle diseases.

The history and neurologic examination can diagnose a specific nerve involvement (PNI); however, the severity of the nerve damage is difficult to distinguish. The electrodiagnostic study, electromyography (EMG), and nerve conduction studies(NCS)), can differentiate neurapraxia, axonotmesis, and neurotmesis. It can localize the lesion and help in prognostication (Table 1).

Blood investigations (complete blood count, liver and renal function, blood glucose, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and vitamin B12) should be requested to evaluate non-traumatic causes of peripheral nerve injury.

The management in peripheral nerve injury has four goals: to identify the lesion, to correct the pathology, to alleviate the symptoms, and to inform, reassure, and support the patient.

Initial treatment includes rest, physical rehabilitation, orthotic measures (e.g., splints, foot care, limb supports), avoidance of the aggravating activity, and pain relievers for neuropathic pain (e.g., analgesics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, corticosteroids, anesthetics).

As the mildest form of peripheral nerve injury, neurapraxia has an excellent prognosis. Complete recovery due to axon remyelination is the expectation within days to weeks.
