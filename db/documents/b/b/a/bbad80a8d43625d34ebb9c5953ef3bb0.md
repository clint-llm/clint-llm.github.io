The most common mechanism is the erosion or rupture of an unstable atherosclerotic plaque in the left anterior descending artery. Erosion or plaque rupture leads to exposure of underlying thrombogenic material in the vascular bed with the blood components leading to thrombus formation or emboli of the atheromas to the distal vessels that can cause occlusion of small caliber vasculature.
