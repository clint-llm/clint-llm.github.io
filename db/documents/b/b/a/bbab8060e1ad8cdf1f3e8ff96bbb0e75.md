Cholesterol level measurement is from serum. A non-fasting lipid test can be done anytime without fasting; a fasting lipid test requires a 12-hour fast except for water. Total and HDL cholesterol are measured directly from serum. First developed in the 1960s, **Friedewald equation** has been used widely to estimate LDL-C which is (total cholesterol) – (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C]) – (triglycerides/5) in mg/dL for research as well as clinical purpose. A fixed factor of 5 for the ratio of fasting triglyceride level(up to 4.5mmol/l ) to very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol(TG: VLDL-C) is the assumption from the equation

- The estimated LDL-C level is not accurate in patients with hypertriglyceridemia(up to 4.5mmol/l or 400 mg/dL) - such a setting warrants ultracentrifugal single spin analysis or immunoprecipitation technique

- There is an underestimation of LDL-C level in patients with lower LDL-C (less than 25 mg/dL or 0.6 mmol/L)

- There is an underestimation of intermediate-density lipoprotein(IDL), and some VLDL remnants which are considered atherogenic

In an extensive cross-sectional analysis, Martin SS et al. proposed a novel calculation that is more accurate than the Friedewald equation regardless of fasting/nonfasting blood samples.**Fasting or non-fasting**While fasting LDL-C is still the standard for initiating lipid-lowering therapy, there has been a heated debate over fasting or non-fasting lipid profile among specialists. The rationale behind the discussion of fasting or non-fasting is because the triglycerides level can be affected by the last intake and the limitations of the Friedewald equation per se.****Many current guidelines propose that nonfasting LDL-C holds similar significance to that of fasting LDL-C.**Apolipoproteins**

The 2010 American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association guideline does not recommend measurement of apolipoproteins, size of lipid particles, and density for cardiovascular risk assessment. (Level III)
