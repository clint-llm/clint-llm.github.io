End-of-Life discussions or advance care planning (ACP) with family and primary care providers can be challenging, but they are necessary to maintain patient autonomy and reach a well-informed decision.  Studies have shown that less than 30% of survey participants have an advance directive. Most individuals with advance directives share similar characteristics: chronic illness, regular access to healthcare, higher income, higher education, and older age. Racial and ethnic disparities also have accounted for a lower percentage of advance directives, particularly among non-white respondents.
