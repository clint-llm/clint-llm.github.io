Calcaneus fractures have enormous morbidity and are often associated with many other injuries. Thus, the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a trauma surgeon, emergency department physician, orthopedic nurses, orthopedic surgeon, internist, and physiotherapist. All open wounds need immediate surgery. After surgery complications are common and may include compartment syndrome, osteomyelitis, wound infection malunion and subtalar arthritis. Non displaced fractures are managed conservatively.

Overall the outlook for patients with calcaneus fractures is guarded. Those with an isolated fracture do recover with time but those with a concomitant injury to the pelvis, spine, neck or head often require prolonged rehabilitation and still have residual physical deficits.

Displaced Type III fractures have a higher likelihood of resulting in subtalar fusion than lower classification injuries and patients should be counseled that further procedures may be required, including possible subtalar fusion.

Complete recovery from a calcaneus fracture may take months or even years.
