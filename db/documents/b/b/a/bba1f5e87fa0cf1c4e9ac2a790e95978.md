Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation involves the delivery of oxygen into the lungs via positive pressure without the need for endotracheal intubation. It is used in both acute and chronic respiratory failure but requires careful monitoring and titration to ensure its success and avoid complications. This activity reviews the physiology behind non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, its indications and contraindications, preparation and techniques, and highlights the role and importance of the interprofessional team during initiation and maintenance of this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the physiology of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation.
- Identify the indications and contraindications of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation.
- Summarize the technique for initiation and monitoring of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation.
- Identify the complications that can arise with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation.
