The diagnosis of iron deficiency is based mainly on history, examination, and laboratory tests. In uncomplicated cases, serum iron, transferrin, ferritin, TIBC, and TSAT should be used for evaluation. Serum iron varies during the day and is influenced by diet. A fasting sample should be obtained in the morning.

TSAT is calculated as the ratio of serum iron to TIBC. It is one of the earliest biomarkers of iron deficiency and is useful when serum ferritin is unequivocal. A decrease (less than 20%) indicates an iron deficiency, either absolute or functional.

Hemoglobin does not become low until a significant percentage of body iron becomes depleted. Hence, normal hemoglobin does not exclude iron deficiency.

Other iron studies available for the evaluation of iron deficiency are:

- Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) and sTfR-ferritin index - sTfR is elevated in iron deficiency because of the upregulation of transferrin receptors. It can help differentiate between absolute (increased sTfR) and functional ID (normal sTfR).

- Zinc protoporphyrin/heme ratio - Decreased iron supply for the formation of hemoglobin leads to increased utilization of zinc and an increase in the ZPP/H ratio; this is preferable to the invasive bone marrow aspiration.

- Reticulocyte hemoglobin content - Provides an estimate of iron availability for RBC production over a few days before the test. Thus, it is a useful indicator of early iron deficiency, and sequential measurements can also help to guide response to parenteral iron therapy. Inflammation does not influence this parameter and is useful in determining iron status in patients with CKD.
