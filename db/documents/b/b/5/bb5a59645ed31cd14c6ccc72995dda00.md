Livedoid vasculopathy is related to various underlying etiologies that lead to increased thrombosis and decreased fibrinolytic activities along with endothelial damage. Hence, identifying the underlying cause for livedoid vasculopathy and managing the patients with both early general and pharmacological measures can affect the course of the disease. The prognosis also depends on the underlying conditions that lead to livedoid vasculopathy.
