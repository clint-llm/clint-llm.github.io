Acanthosis nigricans is diagnosed clinically and confirmed with a skin biopsy. Blood tests, endoscopy, or x-rays may be required to eliminate diabetes or cancer. On biopsy, hyperkeratosis, leukocyte infiltration, epidermal folding, and melanocyte proliferation may be seen. The workup focuses on ruling out malignancy. Since the vast majority of cases are associated with insulin resistance and/or obesity, screening for diabetes and measuringÂ glycosylated hemoglobin is recommended.
