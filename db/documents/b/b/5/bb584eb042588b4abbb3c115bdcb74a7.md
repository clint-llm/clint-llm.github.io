Vitals, including blood pressure and heart rate, should be monitored before initiation and at every dose titration. Patients on treatment for heart failure require monitoring for any signs of decompensation. Monitoring the patient's renal function should be considered if there are risk factors for renal impairment. A study also indicated that carvedilol is associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia in hospitalized patients. Moreover, beta-blockers, including carvedilol, have been shown to prevent the autonomic response in the event of hypoglycemia. Hence it is essential to monitor blood glucose levels in patients treated with carvedilol therapy.

Monitor response to therapy in heart failure patients with Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire scores. In addition, predischarge NT-proBNP levels can be useful to monitor and indicate the patient's clinical course and determine a postdischarge prognosis.
