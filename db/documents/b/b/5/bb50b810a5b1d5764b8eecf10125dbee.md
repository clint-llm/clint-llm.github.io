The manifestations of intracranial meningioma are dependent on the affected site.

Upper motor neuron signs are usually reported in intracranial meningioma, including hypertonia or clonus, hyperreflexia, positive Babinski and Hoffman signs, paresis, or paralysis. Other reported symptoms include anosmia, headaches, dizziness, visual impairments, seizures, papilledema, and behavioral changes. Patients with parasagittal and brain convexity meningiomas can present with paresis or paralysis of the affected contralateral limb. Patients with sphenoid ridge meningiomas with the involvement of the supraorbital fissure or the cavernous sinus can present with cranial nerve palsies and seizures.

Cavernous sinus meningioma can present with cranial nerve deficits of the optic, oculomotor, trochlear, trigeminal, and abducens nerves.

The most common symptoms experienced in spinal meningiomas are pain and radiculopathy, followed by neurological deficits. The neurological deficits could be either upper motor or lower motor neuron symptoms depending on the location and the compression of the nerve roots. Lower motor neuron symptoms include weakness, hypotonia, muscle fasciculations, and hyporeflexia. Local spinal tenderness is sometimes found during physical examination.
