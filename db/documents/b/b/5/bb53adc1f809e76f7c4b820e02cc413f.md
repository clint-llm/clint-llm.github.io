All interprofessional healthcare team members should be familiar with the indications and contraindications of nifedipine. This includes all clinicians (including specialists, NPs, and PAs), nurses, and pharmacists. The drug can cause severe hypotension, and thus it is recommended that the dosing undergo titration from an initial low dose. Long-term patient monitoring is necessary to determine its effectiveness. Sublingual preparations are no longer recommended agents for hypertensive emergencies or urgencies due to lack of efficacy data and numerous severe adverse events such as an uncontrollable decrease in blood pressure, reflex tachycardia, and cerebral ischemia/infarction.

Given the risks, prescribing/ordering clinicians should strive to work with the interprofessional team when using nifedipine. Pharmacists should have involvement to verify dosing, particularly with the dosing differences between release formulations. They also need to conduct medication reconciliation to alert the team to any potential drug-drug interactions. Nurses will be administering the drug inpatient and are on the front lines for observing both treatment effectiveness as well as adverse events, which they should report to the clinician immediately. This collaborative interprofessional approach between clinicians, nursing, and pharmacy will better advance patient outcomes with nifedipine therapy. [Level 5]
