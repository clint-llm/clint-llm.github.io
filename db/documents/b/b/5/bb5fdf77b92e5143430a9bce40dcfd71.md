Patients on zidovudine should be monitored closely forÂ nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, myalgias, insomnia, bone marrow suppression, peripheral myopathy, lactic acidosis, elevated liver enzymes, and hepatotoxicity. Prescribers, pharmacists, nursing, and other healthcare professionals should be aware of drug interactions and take precautions to mitigate side effects. A complete metabolic panel (CMP) and complete blood count (CBC) should be monitored routinely.

Trimethoprim can inhibit renal elimination of zidovudine resulting in higher than expected concentrations of zidovudine.

Probenecid has also been reported to increase side effects of zidovudine, likely from either decreased excretion and/or metabolism.

Zidovudine should be monitored closely when using other medications that cause bone marrow suppression.

Zidovudine crosses the placenta and penetrates breast milk.
