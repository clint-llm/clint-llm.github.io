Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) may occur across all age spectrums (in adults and children) with the average age of onset in adults occurring at two separate peaks, one in the teenage and early adult years and the other occurring in the sixth decade of life. In children, the age of onset is classically in the "pre-school years" (average age of 4.5 years old). The estimated incidence ranges from 0.2 to 2.3 per 1,000,000 million per year.
