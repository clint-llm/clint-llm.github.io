Individualized treatment plans are likely required depending on the context of the patient, and discussion with at least one colleague or in an interprofessional team setting regarding the management is recommended. Collaboration and shared decision making and communication are key elements for a good outcome. The interprofessional care provided to the patient must use an integrated care pathway combined with an evidence-based approach to planning and evaluation of all joint activities. The earlier signs and symptoms of a complication are identified, the better the prognosis and outcome.
