The human crystalline lens accounts for +15 to +20 (approximately 17) diopters of the refractive power of the eye.

Aphakic spectacles were unsightly and heavy. They cause spherical aberrations and distortion in vision.

Peter Choyce and Sir Harold  Ridley formed the International Intraocular implant club in 1966. This led to the gradual acceptance of intraocular lenses. Intracapsular cataract extraction with anterior chamber IOL

Charles Kelman revolutionized cataract surgery by inventing the technique of phacoemulsification.

Intraocular lenses have transitioned from anterior chamber IOLs to posterior chamber IOLs, which have undergone further modification from rigid polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) lenses to silicone and acrylic lenses. Lens materials and designs have undergone many improvements. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic lens materials are both in vogue. Open looped, closed-loop, plate haptic, and square-edged designs are currently being implanted, each modification attempting to decrease the incidence of complications, including posterior capsular opacification. Monofocal intraocular lenses to correct distance vision are the most commonly implanted intraocular lenses.
