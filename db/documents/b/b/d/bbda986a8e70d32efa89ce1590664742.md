Clinically, microcystic adnexal carcinoma often presents as a slow-growing, firm, flesh-colored plaque, nodule, or cyst-like tumor on the head and neck of an elderly caucasian individual. It is most commonly confused clinically with basal cell carcinoma, which is often diagnosed with a simple shave biopsy. However, the definitive diagnostic pathology for MAC lies much deeper, and even a deep shave biopsy may be insufficient for adequate diagnosis. A deep punch or incisional biopsy should be considered if MAC is suspected or even in the differentia for diagnosis.
