While the majority of pemphigus cases are diagnosed clinically, a skin biopsy and serum analysis can also confirm the disease. Pemphigus patients will have a history of painful superficial flaccid bulla or erosions on the skin or mucosa following drug exposure. A skin biopsy can be analyzed by light microscopy showing the separation of keratinocytes above the basal cell layer. Anti-desmoglein 1 and 3 autoantibodies can be evaluated using the indirect immunofluorescent staining or ELISA.
