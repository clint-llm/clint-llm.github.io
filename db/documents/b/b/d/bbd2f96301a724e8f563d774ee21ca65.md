Due to the ambiguity of the etiology of PLEVA, there are various theories regarding the pathophysiology. Some patients experience deposition of IgM and C3 in the skin lesions and elevated immune complexes in the serum, indicating immune complex or hypersensitivity reaction.

Despite these findings, PLEVA is not considered a vasculitic phenomenon, as fibrin is lacking in the walls of vessels, and thrombi are not present in the lumen. Other lesions exhibit a cell-mediated mechanism with cytotoxic T-cell collections in the dermis, along with decreases in Langerhans cells and the CD4/CD8 ratio.

Additionally, amplifying T cell receptor genes via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has shown T cell clonality within the lymphocytic infiltrates, suggesting lymphoproliferation with neoplastic potential.
