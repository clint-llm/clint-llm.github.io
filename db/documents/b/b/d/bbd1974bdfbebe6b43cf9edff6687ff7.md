**Testing the Function of the Flexor Digitorum Superficialis Muscle**

Ask the patient to flex one out of the four medial fingers at the proximal interphalangeal joint against resistance, and the other three fingers are held in an extended position to inactivate the flexor digitorum profundus.

There are two methods which are more frequently used and accurate in practice for the clinical assessment to check for the variation of flexor digitorum superficialis muscle to the fifth finger. These include:

**1. Modified Baker's test:**Ask the patient to flex the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint of the little finger alone while the other fingers are held extended by the examiner. The little and ring fingers are then released to flex together to observe the proximal interphalangeal joint flexion improvement. Suppose the patient cannot flex the proximal interphalangeal joint of the little finger while other fingers are restrained in extension. In that case, however, the patient can flex the proximal interphalangeal joint of the 5th digit while the 4th digit is released, then it shows the absence of the 5th tendon of flexor digitorum superficial.

**2. Bilateral palms test:**Ask the patient to put bilateral palms and corresponding fingers face to face closely and rely on the forces of their own hands. While the little finger is ordered to flex, the adjacent fingers' influence can be observed apparently if there is a connection between the little finger and the adjacent fingers.

Other clinical relevances of the flexor digitorum superficialis muscle include the following:

**Swan Neck Deformity**is the hyperextension of the PIP joint with flexion posture of the DIP joint that most commonly occurs secondary to rheumatoid arthritis, cerebral palsy, connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, or trauma.

**Carpal Tunnel Syndrome**(CTS) is the most common peripheral nerve entrapment syndrome. This condition can occur secondary to a retracted flexor digitorum superficialis tendon that invades the tunnel. Patients with CTS will often present with intermittent numbness in their thumb, index, and middle fingers. Patients may also complain of discomfort in their wrist and palm of the affected hand that worsens throughout the night, weakness, and loss of grip strength. A common feature on physical exam is a positive Phalen's test, a sensitive and specific test for CTS, and usually present in moderate to severe cases.

Other injuries to the flexor digitorum superficialis, namely FDS belly or tendon rupture, are relatively rare but have been described occasionally by a case report.
