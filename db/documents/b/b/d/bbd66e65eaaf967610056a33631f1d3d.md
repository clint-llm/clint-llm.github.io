Without prompt treatment, there is a high chance of mortality or irreversible complications. Each year roughly 8% of those with known adrenal insufficiency have an adrenal crisis, and the rate of death is around 6%. If the Addisonian crisis is quickly identified and given prompt treatment with IVF and steroids, patients have a good prognosis and recovery. Those who present critically ill with significantly altered mental status or had advanced endocrinopathies (severe diabetes, uncontrolled thyroid disease) or multiple comorbidities had increased mortality and residual disability. The patient may need physical or occupational therapy and rehabilitation to regain independent function.
