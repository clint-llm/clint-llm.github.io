While most nodules and masses presenting in the anterior neck represent benign thyroid nodules or cysts, malignancy should still be excluded, particularly in patients at risk for thyroid cancer.

Congenital neck masses may present in the anterior neck. These are usually present at birth, but some may present in adulthood. Older age of presentation should raise concern for possible malignancy. Carcinomas of the tongue, tonsil, and thyroid cancer may present as cystic neck masses.

Inflammatory neck masses usually represent enlarged lymph nodes which may be viral or bacterial in etiology. These are commonly located superficial, deep, or posterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and anterior to the trapezius muscle.

Some non-thyroid neoplastic disorders may present as metastatic neck masses; these are most commonly associated with squamous cell carcinoma from the aerodigestive tract.
