The incidence of dyspareunia mainly depends on the definition used and, therefore, the population sampled. In the United States, the prevalence can be between 7% to 46%. Dyspareunia affects both males and females. However, it is far more common in the female population. Women with symptoms severe enough to require medical attention comprise a small subset as most patients do not seek medical attention making the true incidence rather challenging to determine.
