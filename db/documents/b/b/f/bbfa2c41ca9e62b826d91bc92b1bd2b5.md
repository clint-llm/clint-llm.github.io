The pathophysiology is based on the understanding that an acute precipitating event in a patient with a chronic liver condition that injures hepatocytes leads to the accumulation of a cascade of inflammatory cytokines and results in further hepatic injury in the presence of failure of hepatocyte regeneration. The resulting compromise in immune function and liver decompensation leads to further susceptibility to infections, multi-organ failure, and death.

Systemic inflammation with elevated leukocytosis, cytokines, and chemokines (including IL-6 and IL-8) are observed in patients with ACLF. This is usually absent in cirrhotic patients with ACLF.

Bacteria-induced pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) and virulence factors activate transcription factors are required for encoding cytokines in the inflammatory cascade. Endogenous inducers of inflammation, obtained as a result of denaturation of hepatocytes, called damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), are also responsible for activating inflammatory cascades cooperating with Toll-like receptors (TLRs). This immunopathology is responsible for tissue, organ damage, and, ultimately, organ failure.
