Management of a double orifice mitral valve (DOMV) is primarily based on whether patients are symptomatic or not, which in turn directly correlates to the degree of mitral valve dysfunction. For asymptomatic patients, interval TTE is recommended; however, there are no current guidelines specifically addressing how frequent. Management of symptomatic DOMV involves medical therapy, non-invasive intervention, or surgical approach.

The purpose of medical therapy is to treat symptoms of heart failure and pulmonary congestion until a more definitive treatment modality is sort for the mitral valve dysfunction. Medical therapy is especially important in the pediatric population as control of congestive heart failure symptoms is crucial until an infant becomes of age for specific valve intervention. In cases of DOMV with mitral valve stenosis, the use of percutaneous transcatheter balloon dilatation has been shown as an appropriate tool to relieve the obstruction. If balloon dilatation is not practicable or unsuccessful, surgical mitral valvuloplasty or valve replacement may have a role.

All symptomatic patients with a regurgitant valve should be considered for surgical repair with leaflet plication and possible division of the bridging tissue.
