Three muscles directly comprise the quadrangular space; the teres minor, teres major, and long head of the triceps brachii. The teres minor originates on the lateral border of the scapula, inserts on the greater tubercle of the humerus, and functions with glenohumeral joint external rotation. The teres major originates on the inferior angle of the scapula, inserting on the medial lip of the humerus intertubercular groove, and functions to extend, adduct, and internally rotate the GH joint. The long head of the triceps brachii muscle originates on the infraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, inserts on the olecranon process of the ulna, and functions to extend and adduct the GH joint, and extend the elbow joint.

The deltoid muscle gets innervated and perfused by the branches of the axillary nerve and PHCA, which are the primary structures of the QS. The deltoid muscle originates on the lateral third of the clavicle, acromion process, and spine of the scapula and has its insertion on the deltoid tuberosity of the humerus. The entire deltoid functions to abduct the GH joint while the anterior deltoid performs GH flexion and internal rotation and the posterior deltoid is in charge of GH extension and external rotation.
