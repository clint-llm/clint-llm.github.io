Organ transplantation is defined as removal of organ from one person ( donor) to placement into another person who is called recipient.Transplantation is performed in patients with end-stage organ failure and can increase life expectancy while also improving the patient's quality of life. The most commonly transplanted solid organ is the kidney, followed by the liver, heart, and lungs. Pancreatic and intestinal transplants are performed as well but are less common. More recently, vascularized composite allografts (VCAs, e.g., face, hand, penis) have been performed for reconstructive procedures.Non-vital tissues, such as bones, corneas, and tendons, may also be transplanted. This activity reviews the concerns and implications of organ donation, retrieval and transplantation into recipient. This activity highlights the role of inter professional team for successful organ procurement and transplantation.
