An interprofessional team approach in evaluating patients with symptoms concerning for encephalitis can help facilitate an early diagnosis as appropriate diagnostic testing can be ordered upon the first presentation. Although there are no current treatment options for arbovirus encephalitides, early diagnosis can help identify the need for supportive treatment sooner and prevent any additional invasive testing.

Additionally, it is important to note that many endemic arboviruses are nationally notifiable diseases and should be reported to the CDC via ArboNET, a national surveillance system. This will ensure that appropriate public health measures are taken to identify outbreaks and prevent additional cases of the disease. Furthermore, it provides additional information regarding these viruses in terms of their epidemiology, seasonality, and geographical distribution.
