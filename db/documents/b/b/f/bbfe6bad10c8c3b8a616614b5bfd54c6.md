A significant number of patients who present with periprosthetic fractures will sustain their injury performing activities of daily living and rarely report considerable trauma associated with their presentation. A thorough history of recent injuries often reveals a history of fragility fractures. Patient presentation is highly variable. Many patients present with intractable thigh or leg pain and an inability to ambulate, while some present to the office with vague thigh pain but still able to ambulate. The physical exam varies between patients, but visible deformity is not easily recognizable secondary to the significant soft tissue surrounding the femur. Neurovascular injury is uncommon in these fractures but is evaluated and documented in every orthopedic patient.
