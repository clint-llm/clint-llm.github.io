Lumbar disc herniation is a common pathology and leads to a significant healthcare burden. Patients with low back pain and related conditions may seek care with a diverse variety of interprofessional team members. Thus, a widespread awareness of the signs and symptoms, diagnostic workup, and treatment options is critical to providing appropriate care for patients who suffer from this pathology. For patients who have failed to respond to non-operative treatment, a lumbar discectomy is an option that interprofessional team members should be aware of. Improving health professional knowledge on the prompt evaluation and treatment of lumbar herniation, including for cases refractory to non-operative management, will improve patient outcomes. This activity reviews the evaluation and surgical management of lumbar disc herniation and highlights the interprofessional team's role in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for a discectomy.
- Describe the equipment and personnel required for performing a discectomy.
- Outline the potential complications of a discectomy.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members in assessing the need for a discectomy and performing and post-operative follow-up will enhance the delivery of care for patients undergoing discectomy.
