Radiography is the most important initial test to be performed in patients with suspected fractures. X-rays of the elbow with a perfect lateral are necessary to assess for appropriate alignment of the radial head to rule out a Monteggia fracture. X-rays of bilateral wrists are useful to assess the wrist joint, taking care to assess for ulnar positivity or negativity compared to the normal contralateral. Ensure that pronation and supination are equal bilaterally at the time of obtaining the radiograph, as pronation and supination affect ulnar positivity and negativity on radiographic views. Computed tomography (CT) scans are very rarely necessary, as any fracture not clearly elucidated on radiograph could be safely managed non-operatively. Thus, advanced imaging such as CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should only be used to rule out other suspected pathology.
