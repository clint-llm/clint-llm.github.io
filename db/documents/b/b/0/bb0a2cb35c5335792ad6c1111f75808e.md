Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) is an insoluble polymer cation-exchange resin. After ingestion of the oralÂ formulation or application through the rectal route, this resin exchanges sodium with potassium ions from the intestinal cells. Then the potassium binds with SPS, continues to move through the gastrointestinal tract, and is finally eliminated in the feces.
