Elbow trauma is a common occurrence in children and athletes and can cause a broad array of injury patterns ranging from mild soft tissue injuries and contusions to complex osteoligamentous injuries. Interprofessional team members must be familiar with elbow anatomy since elbow trauma puts a large number of neurovascular structures at risk. Thorough examination and workup of elbow trauma will allow for proper management, which will lead to better patient outcomes. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of elbow trauma injuries and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of elbow trauma.
- Describe the common presentation of a patient with elbow trauma.
- Identify management options for patients with elbow trauma.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to optimize outcomes for patients with elbow trauma.
