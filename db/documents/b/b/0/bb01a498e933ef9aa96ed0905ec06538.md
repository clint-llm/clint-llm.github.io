The peripheral smear demonstrates normocytic normochromic anemia with reticulocytopenia. The white cell count and platelet count are normal in number and morphology. The histological picture seen on bone marrow examination depends on the cause of PRCA. Complete absence or near absence of erythroblasts (less than 1% erythroblasts on marrow differential count) from an otherwise normal marrow is a characteristic of autoimmune PRCA. Rarely, a few erythroblasts or basophilic erythroblasts are present, but their number never exceeds 5% of the differential count.
