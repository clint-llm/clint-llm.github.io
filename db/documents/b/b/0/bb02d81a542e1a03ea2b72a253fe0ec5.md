Pinguecula is a benign, common degeneration of the conjunctiva. It appears as a grey white-yellow mass on the bulbar conjunctiva. It presents in people exposed to wind, dust, ultraviolet light, and working outdoors for a long duration. Usually, it causes cosmetic complaints. Mild symptoms such as foreign body sensation and itching are treated with artificial tears. Surgical excision may be rarely considered for cosmetic reasons. This activity reviews the cause, evaluation, and treatment of pinguecula and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of pinguecula.
- Describe the histopathology of pinguecula.
- Outline the treatment of pinguecula.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients with pinguecula.
