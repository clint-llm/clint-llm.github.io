Delusional disorder is relatively rare, has a later age of onset as compared to schizophrenia, and does not show a gender predominance. The patients are also relatively stable. The exact cause of the delusional disorder is unknown.

Many biological conditions like substance use, medical conditions, neurological conditions can cause delusions. The delusional disorder involves the limbic system and basal ganglia in those with intact cortical functioning.

Hypersensitive persons and ego defense mechanisms like reaction formation, projection, and denial are some psychodynamic theories for delusional disorder. Social isolation, envy, distrust, suspicion, and low self-esteem are some of the factors which when becoming intolerable leads to a person seeking an explanation and thus forming a delusion as a solution.

Immigrants with language barriers, deaf and visually impaired persons, as well as the elderly, are special populations who are more vulnerable to delusions.
