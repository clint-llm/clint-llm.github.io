**Usefulness of Vocal Fremitus and Vocal Resonance in Daily Clinical Practice**

The reliability of findings obtained using these maneuvers are controversial, and they are not frequently used by physicians in daily practice. However, undergraduate and postgraduate students are frequently required to perform these maneuvers during clinical assessments. A study among 100 general practitioners in the Mackay region of Queensland in Australia was conducted to assess how frequently they performed vocal fremitus (VF) and vocal resonance (VR) and their opinions of the value of this procedure. Majority (65.7%) rarely performed VF/VR as a routine during chest examination and more than half (53.7%) did not hold that routine VF/VR examination is desirable.

Studies have shown variable inter-rater agreement for vocal fremitus assessments with some studies showing good and others showing poor inter-rater agreement.

On the other hand, it has been suggested that artifacts produced by vibrations of the thorax on color doppler sonographic examinations of breast tissue can be useful in differentiating benign and malignant mammary tumors. These artifacts are in the form of small color pixels which can be brought about by vocal fremitus. In benign tumors, color pixels are found only in surrounding tissue, whereas in malignant tumors, artifacts can be found within the tumor and the surrounding tissue. Power Doppler Vocal Fremitus can be used as an adjunct tool to B mode ultrasonogram for identification of breast lesions.

**Examination Method**

Before palpating the posterior chest for tactile fremitus, the patient is asked to fold his or her arms across the chest wall to displace both scapulae. The patient is asked to repeat “ninety-nine” or “one, two, three” in a constant tone while the practitioner simultaneously palpates the chest wall on both sides, using the ulnar border of the hand or the palmar base. Palpation begins with the lung apex and moves to the same location on the opposite side of the chest wall. The perceived vibrations on both sides are compared while moving hands from the apex to the base of the lung, covering the entire posterior chest wall. The same maneuver is repeated on the anterior and lateral chest walls.

**Interpretation of Examination Findings**

Integration of history and physical findings of the respiratory system are important for formulating a differential diagnosis and planning further management. As discussed earlier, an increase in vocal fremitus indicates denser lung tissue, which can be caused by consolidation in diseases such as pneumonia. A decrease in vocal fremitus suggests air or fluid in the pleural spaces or a decrease in lung tissue density, which can be caused by diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma.

**Pneumothorax**

Inspection: Diminished chest movements on the affected side.

Palpation: Diminished chest movements on palpation. Decreased vocal fremitus on the affected side.

Percussion: Tympanic note on percussion of the affected side.

Auscultation: Diminished breath sounds and vocal resonance on the affected side.

**Pleural effusion**

Inspection: Fullness of intercostal spaces and diminished chest movements on the affected side. The apical impulse may not be visualized.

Palpation: Diminished chest movements on palpation of the affected side. Decreased vocal fremitus on the affected side. Trachea may be shifted to the opposite. The apical impulse may not be palpable.

Percussion: Stony dullness on percussion of the affected side.

Auscultation: Diminished breath sounds and vocal resonance on the affected side. Egophony may be present on the upper border of the effusion.

**Consolidation**

Inspection: Diminished chest movements on the affected side.

Palpation: Diminished chest movements on palpation of the affected side. Increased vocal fremitus on the affected side.

Percussion: Dullness on percussion of the affected side.

Auscultation: Bronchial breathing sounds may be present. Increased vocal resonance on the affected side may be associated with bronchophony and whispering pectoriloquy.
