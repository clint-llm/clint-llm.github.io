Severe pain sensation and light sensitivity prevent those afflicted with ocular neuropathic pain from performing activities of daily living and is associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression—even suicidal thoughts in extreme cases.

Treatment strategies encompass several approaches

Ocular surface treatment:

- Copious lubrication with artificial tears decreases the hyperosmolarity of tears and halts over-stimulation of corneal nociceptors. Preservative-free tear supplements are preferred if frequent instillation is needed.

- Topical and/or systemic antibiotics along with dietary supplements (omega3 fatty acids) to treat evaporative dry eye and blepharitis

- Bandage contact lenses

- Scleral lenses provide a cushion of fluid over the entire cornea, while some patients experience immediate relief, for some patients, the lenses can trigger pain due to severe hyperalgesia

- Compounded lacosamide 0.1% may combine with preservative-free saline inside the bowl of a scleral lens

Anti-inflammatory

- Soft steroids such as fluorometholone or loteprednol to dampen surface inflammation

- Topical or oral NSAID agents

- Topical immunomodulators such as cyclosporine 0.5% or lifitegrast 5% is also an option, but their therapeutic effects are not immediate

- Tacrolimus 0.03% eye drops have been shown to improve tear stability and have an anti-inflammatory effect

- Topical or oral antibiotics such as doxycycline or azithromycin are useful adjunct therapy when meibomian gland dysfunction is present

- Amniotic membranes provide anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and neurotrophic effects; since not all patients can tolerate the polycarbonate ring of self-retained tissues such as PROKERA, the corneal amniotic membranes can be placed underneath a bandage contact lens

Neuroregeneration:

- Autologous serum tears (20%)- Serum contains various growth factors which play a crucial role in neuroregeneration and healing - these factors include nerve growth factor, transforming growth factor beta, insulin-like growth factor 1, epidermal growth factor, fibronectin, and substance P

Others

- Systemic analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants (10 to 15 mg  at bedtime), and antipsychotics to treat associated non-ocular pain

- Anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine (200 mg/day), gabapentin (300 to 900 mg/day) or pregabalin (150 mg/day), which are also used to treat trigeminal neuralgia

- Low dose naltrexone (1.5 mg at bedtime), an opioid antagonist used off-label

- Opioid agonists such as tramadol  (50 mg/day) may provide acute relief but require caution due to the potential for dependence

- Vitamin B has proven effective in herpes, diabetic neuropathy, and neuropathic pain

- Also assists with re-innervation and re-epithelization of the corneal surface - specifically, B12 increases serotonin levels and inhibits nociceptive neuronal activity

Alternative therapies

- Acupuncture treatment semi-weekly

- Electrical neurostimulation to treat chronic intractable pain with central sensitization

- Invasive neuromodulation therapies such as deep brain stimulation and Intrathecal analgesic infusions may provide relief for severe, intractable cases of neuropathic pain
