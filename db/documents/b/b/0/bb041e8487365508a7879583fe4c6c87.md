The trapezius is innervated for motor functions by the spinal accessory nerve (cranial nerve XI). Shoulder range of motion (ROM) with cephalad motion of the shoulders - shrugging -  is a common physical exam maneuver to test CN XI.

**Spinal Accessory Nerve**

The spinal accessory nerve is a cranial nerve arising from the ventral roots of upper cervical spinal nerves to the level of C6. It then passes through the foramen magnum to enter the cranium. It then passes through the jugular foramen, where it accompanies the internal jugular vein and vagus nerve to lie medial to the sternocleidomastoid, which it innervates.
