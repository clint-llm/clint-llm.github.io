The general population with frequent VPCs defined as the presence of at least one VPC on a 12-lead EKG or greater than 30 VPCs per hour is usually associated with increased cardiovascular risk and mortality. The cardiac MRI and methods used to suppress the VPCs aid in reversing the LV dysfunction. Therefore, differentiation of primary cardiomyopathy from VPC-mediated LV dysfunction is of prime importance.

A detailed cardiovascular risk assessment and management is necessary for the clinical finding of VPCs on EKG of even healthy patients.
