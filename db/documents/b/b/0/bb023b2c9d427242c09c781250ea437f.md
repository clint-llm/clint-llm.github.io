The diagnosis and management of olecranon bursitis is with an interprofessional team that consists of a primary care provider, nurse practitioner, orthopedic surgeon and an infectious disease expert.Â Absent the presence of severe sepsis, or septic shock, patients with olecranon bursitis, are best managed on an outpatient basis. Referral to an appropriate orthopedic surgeon is appropriate when surgical excision of the bursa or underlying bone spur is being considered. Consideration of possible neoplasm should likewise be referred to an appropriate surgeon or oncologist. Otherwise, simple olecranon bursitis is managed and followed by the primary care provider.
