Assembling all the appropriate equipment is often all that is needed and extra staff to hold the extremity and place the splint.

Extra preparation is needed if placing invasive pins for traction immobilization. The skin should be carefully cleaned using sterile technique. A sterile field should be created if possible, and analgesia and sedation should be administered.

Document the neurovascular exam before any immobilization device is placed and any time the limb is manipulated, or the immobilization is changed to a different device.
