Increased intracellular calcium from the poisoning of the Na-K transporter and AV nodal blockade from increased vagal tone are the primary causes of digoxin toxicity. The former leads to increased automaticity and inotropy; the latter leads to decreased dromotropy. Hyperkalemia can be a marker of severe toxicity in acute poisoning. The role of potassium is less clear in chronic toxicity, although it has been linked to higher mortality despite traditional teaching that hypokalemia worsens the dysfunction at the Na-K transporter.
