The literature documents anatomical and biomechanical variations of the gluteus maximus. For example, one study focused on the muscleâ€™s variability regarding its movement arms (the length between the joint axis and line of force acting on that joint) in a sample population. The study demonstrated high variability in the gluteus maximus muscle and attributed these results to the variation in insertion points along the iliotibial tract and gluteal tuberosity.

Variation of the gluteus maximus also involves physiological differences. In athletes, the gluteus maximus muscle is among the most important to train due to its action of extension of the hip joint, which translates to explosive movements. A 2018 study examined the correlation between the gluteus maximus muscle to quadriceps femoris ratio in faster and slower athletes. Results yielded that the larger the ratio, the faster the athlete.

Another 2018 study suggests that associated hip muscles may become more atrophied after hip arthroplasty, but larger cohorts would be needed to clarify the results.
