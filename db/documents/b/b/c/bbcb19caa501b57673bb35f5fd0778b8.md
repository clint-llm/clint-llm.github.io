In a human body, pain is an inbuilt alarm that goes off when there is potential or actual underlying damage to shift the person's attention towards the problem.

The search for an ideal medicine for pain relief has been in progress since ancient times, as there are no certain drugs for a few types of pain. Several strategies mitigate intractable pain refractory to therapy, with opioids being the mainstay in many pain management protocols, and recently, cannabinoids have shown some promise.
