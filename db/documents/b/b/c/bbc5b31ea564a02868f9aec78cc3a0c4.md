Tumors of the lacrimal gland fossa account for about 10% of all biopsied orbital masses.

Proptosis is not always seen but can be present if the posterior growth of a mass pushes the eye forward. Most malignant lesions grow quicker than benign lesions, averaging less than six months from onset to diagnosis compared to 1Â to 2 years for benign lesions.
