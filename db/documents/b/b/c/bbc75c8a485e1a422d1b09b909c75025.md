A feeding jejunostomy is a vital technique to achieve enteral access when a contraindication to the placement of a gastrostomy tube is present. It is sometimes also a part of a more extensive surgical procedure such as esophageal or gastric resection. Multiple techniques exist to place a feeding jejunostomy; however, minimally invasive methods are preferred. Complications are related to the type of feed used or mechanical causes. The feeding jejunostomy is a relatively simple procedure that can be performed by general surgeons.
