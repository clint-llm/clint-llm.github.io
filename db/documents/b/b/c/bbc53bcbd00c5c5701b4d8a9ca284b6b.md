Gardner syndrome has no cure and is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes the pharmacist and nurse practitioner. The key is patient education once the diagnosed is made.

Prevention is the most common approach to treatment for those individuals who are aware of the respective familial inheritance or once this is discovered. This type of treatment protocol can include a healthy diet, the use of NSAIDs such as sulindac, or a COX2 inhibitor like celecoxib which can aid in the stifling of the growth of polyps in the colon, especially since it is well known that Gardner syndrome patients are at a greater risk for developing colon cancer. Surveillance via lower GI endoscopies is also recommended to monitor polyp growth and development and to ascertain their transformation into malignant tumors. If more than 20 or more polyps are present, removal of the colon is recommended to reduce the risk for colon cancer development.
