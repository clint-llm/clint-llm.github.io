- Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 is characterized by a triad of disorders chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, hypoparathyroidism, and adrenal insufficiency. It is due to mutations in the AIRE gene and inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Over 60 mutations have been reported to cause APS-1.

- It is a rare disease; however, it is more common in Sardinians and Iranian Jews.

- AIRE encodes for a protein named autoimmune regulator. Defects in the autoimmune regulator result in escape of autoreactive T-lymphocytes.

- Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis is usually the first manifestation followed by hypoparathyroidism and adrenal insufficiency. Besides this triad, there are reports of a host of other autoimmune disorders in association with APS-1

- APS-1 is potentially underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed due toÂ the rarity of the disease and the variability in its presentation.

- Management of APS-1 includes treating the manifesting disorders. Genetic counseling is needed to evaluate the risk of transmission to offspring.

- Referral to a center with experience in the treatment of APS-1 is recommended.
