The primary locations of hematopoiesis change throughout life. At the beginning of the fetal period, it begins in the yolk sac and aorta-gonad-mesonephros, eventually transitioning into liver, spleen, and finally the bone marrow and lymph nodes. It is maintained in these final locations for the duration of adult life except in pathological cases where it can return to its former sites.

Hematopoiesis in bone marrow takes place in islands of hematopoietic tissue surrounded by vascular sinuses and is interspersed with trabecular bone. Hematopoietic tissue contains a spectrum of blood cells, adipocytes, endothelial cells, and adventitial cells. As cells develop and mature, they enter the circulation through venous sinuses. The specific cells which are predominant in each microscopic area of the bone marrow are largely dependent on the niche of signaling cells at that site, which can include mature HSC, osteoblasts, macrophages, stromal cells, endothelial cells, and adipocytes among others. The location of hematopoiesis for certain cells can be tied to their function. For example, megakaryocytes, which are very large and bulky, are formed right next to the marrow sinuses into which they shed platelets.

**Regulation**

Our understanding of the transcription factors and growth factors that govern hematopoiesis has continued to demonstrate the complexity of the system. Particular interest has been paid in determining the genes and factors that influence a malignant transformation. Selected examples of known important transcription factors include:

- T-cell acute leukemia-1 (TAL-1) which is necessary to keep multipotent stem cells multipotent and quiescent and is an essential regulator of hematopoiesis.  TAL-1 complexes with a variety of other transcription factors (E47/E2A, LMO2, GATA1–3, Ldb1/2, Ldb1, ETO, Runx1, ERG, FLI1) to determine differentiation into myeloid or lymphoid cells.

- Bcl11a has been demonstrated to play an important role in the regulation of hematopoiesis both in the decision to proliferate and the specific cells to be made. Lack of Bcl11a expression was found to produce a signature of myeloid cells while reducing the signature genes associated with lymphoid development. It was also found that lack of expression was associated with cells in the S and G2/M phase, suggesting increased growth.

- c-MYB: Primarily expressed in immature HSC, this helps to regulate fetal hemoglobin and consequently is a disease modifier of hemoglobinopathies and sickle cell. Dysregulation can lead to a variety of leukemias and lymphomas as well as solid tumors.

- GATA-1: A zinc finger transcription factor that promotes the proliferation and differentiation of erythropoiesis both in the embryonic stage and the later definitive stages of production. Congenital disruption of this factor produces ineffective erythropoiesis.GATA-1, GATA-2, and GATA-3 are important in hematopoiesis.

Other transcription factors such as Erg, Fli1, Tal1, Lyl1, Lmo2, Runx1 and Gata2 have been shown to work together as a complex to give rise to pre-HSC. Runx1, TEL/ETV6, SCL/TAL, and LMO2 mutations account for the majority of known leukemia-associated translocations.
