Inverted nipple correction is normally a very safe procedure. Patients most often experience swelling and sensitivity in the immediate postoperative period, which resolves uneventfully. Bleeding and wound infection are the most common surgical complications, though both are rare. Recurrence of nipple inversion is the most significant complication, and the greatest risk of recurrence is seen at 6Â to 12 months postoperatively.
