Atypia, anaplasia, microscopic proliferation, and necrosis are the histological features used to differentiate low-grade from high-grade tumors. Well-differentiated and hypercellular glia with nuclear atypia and rare mitotic activity are the histological features of LGGs. The type of tumor can be differentiated based on the appearance of cells, e.g., fried egg appearance and pleomorphic giant cells are present in oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas, respectively. Therefore, histological classification is possible for these tumors.
