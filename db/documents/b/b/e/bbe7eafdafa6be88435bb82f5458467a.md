The structure of voltage-gated sodium channels consists of one pore-forming alpha subunit through which the sodium will pass and one to two beta subunits.

Alpha subunits: The alpha subunits are made up of four transmembrane domains, with each domain consisting of six segments. The voltage sensory component is on the fourth segment of each alpha domain.

Beta subunits: The genes SCN1B–SCN4B encode five identified beta subunits. Interestingly, the beta subunits are actually a part of the Ig superfamily of cell adhesion molecules due to their large, extracellular V-set immunoglobulin (Ig) domain.
