The liver is a common location for both primary and metastatic malignancies, which often result in significant morbidity and mortality. Traditional surgical resection provides excellent outcomes, but surgery is not an option for many patients due to extensive tumor burden, underlying hepatic disease, and other comorbidities. The evolution of image-guided technology has provided safe and effective alternatives for definitive and palliative treatment.
