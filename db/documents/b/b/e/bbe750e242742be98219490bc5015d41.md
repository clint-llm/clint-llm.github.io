The trachea receives parasympathetic innervation from branches of the vagus nerve (CNX). After exiting the skull, the bilateral vagus nerves travel along the posterolateral aspect of the common carotid arteries until entering the superior mediastinum. The right recurrent laryngeal nerve branches first, passes underneath the right subclavian artery and travels superiorly along the right tracheoesophageal groove. The left recurrent laryngeal nerve branches underneath the aortic arch, lateral to the ligamentum arteriosum, and travels superiorly in the left tracheoesophageal groove. As these nerves ascend, they give off branches that provide parasympathetic, somatic, and motor innervation to the trachea. Both the left and right recurrent laryngeal nerves then enter the larynx through the inferior constrictor muscles of the pharynx. Damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerves during surgery can cause vocal cord paralysis, leading to hoarseness or complete loss of voice. Sympathetic innervation of the trachea is provided by the middle cervical ganglia bilaterally.

Various anatomical variations of the recurrent laryngeal nerve have been identified and can pose challenges during surgery. A rare but serious variation is the non-recurrent right laryngeal nerve that passes directly from the vagus nerve toward the larynx. This anomaly generally occurs in the presence of an aberrant right subclavian artery that arises directly from the arch of the aorta after the left subclavian artery. In this case, the right laryngeal nerve does not pass underneath the right subclavian artery, making it susceptible to injury during surgical dissection.
