CPA tumors should be evaluated using a multi-specialty team comprising neurotologist, neurosurgeon, oncologist, radiologist, and a radiation oncologist (Level 3).

Team approach and intra-operative neuro-monitoring help to improve the outcomes and reduce the incidence of nerve injury (Level 3).

The choice of surgical approach is influenced by the size of the tumor, its extent, and hearing status.

Post-operative changes should be evaluated carefully to differentiate them from tumor recurrence.
