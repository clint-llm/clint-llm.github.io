The IC receives information from the lateral lemniscus, which contains neurons from the cochlear nuclei and superior olive relaying auditory information from the cochlear nerve.

However, the IC also receives input from and sends output to the retina and superior colliculi, which receive visual information through the optic nerve, CN II. As mentioned above, these connections may aid in the creation of a mental map of physical space. Additionally, multiple spinal somatosensory nerves, mostly from the dorsal column of the spinal cord and peripheral nerves, also input to the IC to allow coordination of movement in response to different behaviorally relevant auditory stimuli, including a startle response away from unexpected noises. The IC is sensitive to inputs from the trigeminal nerve, CN V, and its associated ganglion.
