**Forensic Anatomy of the Hyoid**

The forensic profile of the hyoid related to forensic anthropology primarily includes estimation of age and determination of sex. Fusion of the hyoid is especially useful to predict age in adulthood. The bone density of the hyoid is a valuable predictor of both age and sex

**Forensic Significance of Hyoid Fracture**

Trauma to the hyoid and laryngeal cartilages (thyroid cartilage and cricoid cartilage), is one of the significant signs of manual strangulation or throttling discovered during a forensic autopsy. Fractures of the hyoid-laryngeal complex are present in cases of death due to a constricting force around the neck. Forensic pathologists have intensively studied traumatic lesions of the hyoid-laryngeal complex in strangulation, including manual strangulation and ligature strangulation, and hanging. Other forms of blunt force impact to the neck can also cause fracture of the hyoid.

The damage commonly affects the greater horns or the region between the body of the hyoid and the horns. Injuries are mainly in the form of vertical or oblique fractures. Displacements of the fracture segments are also observed. Bilateral fractures of the hyoid and double fractures of one of the greater horns are not uncommon.
