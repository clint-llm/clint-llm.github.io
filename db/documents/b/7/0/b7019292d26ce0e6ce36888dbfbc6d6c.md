Acute kidney injury, previously known as acute renal failure, denotes a sudden and often reversible reduction in the kidney function, as measured by increased creatinine or decreased urine volume. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of acute kidney injury and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients affected by this condition.

**Objectives:**
- List the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) criteria for diagnosing acute kidney injury.
- Explain how to evaluate a patient with acute kidney injury.
- Contrast pre-renal, renal, and post-renal etiologies of acute kidney injury.
- Outline the need for a well-integrated, well-coordinated interprofessional team approach when caring for patients with acute kidney injury.
