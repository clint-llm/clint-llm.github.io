The trigeminal nerve is the fifth cranial nerve. It is responsible for the sensory supply of the face and the motor and sensory supply to the muscles of mastication. The trigeminal nerve starts at the pons and divides into three branches

- Ophthalmic (V1): Supplies the eye, upper eyelid, and the forehead

- Maxillary (V2): Supplies lower eyelid, cheek, nostril, upper lip, and upper gum

- Mandibular (V3): Supplies the lower lip, lower gum, jaw, and the muscles of mastication

The trigeminal nerve starts at the pons. Most cases of trigeminal neuralgia are due to the compression of the trigeminal nerve root within a few millimeters of its entry into the pons. Between 80% and 90% of the cases of TN are caused by compression by an adjacent artery or a vein.

Some of the other causes of nerve compression include meningioma, acoustic neuroma, epidermoid cyst, and rarely an arteriovenous malformation or a saccular aneurysm.

Multiple sclerosis is a risk factor for TN, and it is reported in about 2% to 4% of patients with TN. This is secondary to the demyelination of the trigeminal nerve nucleus by multiple sclerosis.
