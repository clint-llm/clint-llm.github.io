Cannabis has been shown to have beneficial effects in treating certain types of pain. Studies have shown that the type of pain dictates the response to treatment. In a randomized, double-blinded study of 40 patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy, patients were subjected to two groups: one receiving 5 mg of oral THC and placebo. Pain reduction was examined postoperatively and revealed no analgesic effects.

Although medicinal cannabis hasnâ€™t shown efficacy in treating acute pain, it has shown benefit in treating chronic pain. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted involving 43 randomized control trials, which revealed pain reduction in patients with chronic pain with inhalational cannabis (p < 0.0001). The study also concluded medicinal cannabis might be effective for specifically chronic neuropathic pain.

Another systematic review involving 18 trials was performed for cannabinoids in treating non-cancer pain. In greater than 80% of the trials, there was a significant analgesic effect and in four of the trials studied, smoked cannabis for neuropathic pain with benefit.

Several clinical trials were conducted studying smoked cannabis specifically for pain. One clinical study evaluated 56 patients with fibromyalgia and results revealed pain reduction on the visual analog scale before and after two hours of self-administered cannabis.

A clinical trial involving 28 HIV-positive patients with chronic neuropathic pain smoked cannabis five days a week for two weeks or placebo. There was a significant difference in pain relief with the cannabis group versus the placebo group (p = 0.016).
