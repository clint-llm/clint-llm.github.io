Gastric cancer is the fifth most frequently diagnosed cancer and the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, albeit there has been a global decline since the last mid-century. In the United States, gastric cancer incidence has decreased during the past few decades, although the incidence of gastroesophageal cancer has concomitantly increased. There are two distinct types of gastric adenocarcinoma, intestinal (well-differentiated) and diffuse (undifferentiated), which have a distinct morphologic appearance, pathogenesis, and genetic profiles. The only potentially curative treatment approach for patients with gastric cancer is surgical resection with adequate lymphadenectomy. Current evidence supports perioperative therapies to improve a patient’s survival. Regrettably, patients with an unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic disease could solely be offered life-prolonging palliative therapy regimens.
