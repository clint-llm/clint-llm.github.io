A pudendal nerve block aims to block the nerve as it enters the lesser sciatic foramen, 1 cm inferior and medial relative to the attachment of the sacrospinous ligament to the ischial spine. Different anatomical approaches are utilized to achieve successful pudendal nerve blocks. They may be unilateral or bilateral. The syringe is not attached until the needle has reached its final position immediately before the injection of the anesthetic agent.

**The transvaginal approach**to a pudendal nerve block is common for obstetric and gynecological procedures. Typically, 10 mL is used per side, but this is variable.

- The female patient is placed in the lithotomy position, and the vaginal area is prepped.

- The ischial spines can be identified by palpation along the posterolateral vaginal sidewalls. If for any reason, the ischial spines cannot be palpated directly, the firm band of sacrospinous ligament should be identified. This can be followed laterally from the sacrum to the respective ischia spine.

- A needle guide is gently introduced, so it lies on the vaginal mucosa along the sacrospinous ligament, approximately 1 cm medial and inferior to the ischial spine. Using a needle guide such as the Iowa Trumpet is recommended to limit the depth of penetration and minimize tissue injury.

- The sacrospinous ligament is punctured.

- Injecting 3 mL of a local anesthetic directly into the sacrospinous ligament near its ischial insertion before advancing the spinal needle to its final position is optional but suggested to minimize patient discomfort.

- The needle is passed 1 cm caudal from the ischial spine until noticing a loss of resistance or confirmed by imaging.

- Upon negative aspiration, the local anesthetic is injected just posteriorly to the ischial spine at the attachment of the sacrospinous ligament.

- Alternatively, the injection can be performed just medial to the ischial spine.

- Aspiration to confirm positioning outside a vascular space is again performed as the inferior gluteal and pudendal vessels are immediately adjacent to the pudendal nerve.

- A pinprick or similar sensory test in the anogenital area is performed to ensure adequate anesthesia in the region.

- The procedure is repeated on the opposite side to achieve a bilateral block.

**The transperineal approach**is used for anorectal and urological procedures as well as for pudendal neuralgia in males. Imaging guidance, such as ultrasound, is recommended for this approach.

- The male or female patient will be placed in the lithotomy position.

- The skin is prepped.

- The clinician's index finger will be inserted into the rectum (or vagina) to palpate the ischial spine.

- The skin entry point is selected 1 inch (2.5 cm) posteromedial to the ischial tuberosity as determined by palpation or imaging.

- After identifying the ischial spine, the needle will puncture the skin transperineally, medial to the ischial tuberosity.

- The needle is advanced lateral to the clinician's finger in the posterolateral direction until it reaches the ischial spine.

- Injecting 3 mL of a local anesthetic directly into the sacrospinous ligament near its ischial insertion before advancing the spinal needle to its final position is optional.

- The needle is then advanced through the sacrospinous ligament 1 cm medial and inferior to the ischial spine.

- The final position of the needle can be identified by imaging or by the loss of resistance to advancement of the needle as the ligamentous tissue is completely penetrated.

- After negative aspiration, the local anesthetic of choice is injected.

- A pinprick or similar sensory test in the anogenital area is performed to ensure adequate anesthesia in the region.

- The procedure is repeated on the opposite side to achieve a bilateral block.

**A perirectal approach**to a pudendal nerve block has also been described using a nerve stimulator to elicit contractions of the external anal sphincter.

- The patient is positioned in a recumbent position.

- The skin is prepped.

- The clinician's index finger will be inserted into the rectum (or vagina) to palpate the ischial spine.

- The needle is advanced lateral to the rectum and the clinician's finger in the posterolateral direction until it reaches the ischial spine.

- Injecting 3 mL of a local anesthetic directly into the sacrospinous ligament near its ischial insertion before advancing the spinal needle to its final position is optional.

- The needle is then advanced through the sacrospinous ligament 1 cm medial and inferior to the ischial spine.

- The final position of the needle can be identified by imaging, by maximal anal sphincteric tone on nerve stimulation of the needle, or by the loss of resistance to advancement of the needle as the ligamentous tissue is completely penetrated.

- After negative aspiration, the local anesthetic of choice is injected.

- A pinprick or similar sensory test in the anogenital area is performed to ensure adequate anesthesia in the region.

- The procedure is repeated on the opposite side to achieve a bilateral block.

A transgluteal approach has also been described and is similar to the techniques reviewed above.

A pudendal block test injection directly into Alcock's canal is sometimes performed using contrast under image guidance to help indicate if surgical decompression surgery is likely to be successful.

The effect of a pudendal nerve block is usually immediate, within 5 minutes, but it may take up to 20 minutes to be fully effective.

The most common cause for failure of the pudendal block is not giving the anesthetic sufficient time. If a bilateral block is only effective on one side, an additional 5 mL of anesthetic can be administered to the unaffected side. Up to 50% of all pudendal nerve blocks may fail on at least one side, although the median failure rate averages about 20%.

Pudendal nerve blocks can effectively anesthetize the posterior perineum, the anus, the lower vagina, the vulva/scrotum, and the penis.

Upper vaginal, cervical, and lower uterine sensation is through the ureterovaginal plexus, which can be anesthetized through a paracervical nerve block.

Long-term use of intermittent (typically monthly or as-needed) pudendal nerve blocks can be successfully used to relieve pudendal neuralgia. Still, there is evidence that it may lose efficacy after two years.
