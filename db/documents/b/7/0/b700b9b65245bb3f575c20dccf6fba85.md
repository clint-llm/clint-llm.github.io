It is essential to rule out secondary causes of low HDL cholesterol levels before looking for a genetic syndrome. A thorough medical history will help rule out secondary causes such as inflammatory conditions, monoclonal gammopathies, or medication use (beta-blockers, benzodiazepines, testosterone replacement therapy). A complete lipid panel can distinguish isolated HDL deficiency from other hereditary lipid disorders, such as familial combined hyperlipidemia. Genetic causes of HDL deficiency, such as Tangier disease, ApoA-I deficiency, and LCAT deficiency, will have decreased HDL levels with normal or reduced LDL levels. In contrast, familial combined hyperlipidemia will have decreased HDL with increased LDL levels.
