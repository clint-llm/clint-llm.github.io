The first peak observed in a normal jugular venous pulse wave tracing, the "A" wave, represents the contraction of the atria (atrial systole). Therefore, in patients with atrial fibrillation, the "A" wave is often attenuated due to the absence of atrial contraction.

The chronological sequence of the atria contracting before the ventricles is important for the shuttling of blood through the circulatory system. When this sequence becomes asynchronous, such as what is seen with third-degree atrioventricular heart block, this can cause the atria and ventricles to contract at the same time.

Tricuspid regurgitation occurs during systole, as a portion of blood is inadvertently sent back to the atrium through an incompetent tricuspid valve, rather than through the pulmonary arteries.

The "Y" descent can also be significantly attenuated because of the inability of the right atrium to relax during ventricular diastole.
