The splanchnic nerve divides into multiple different sections. These divisions are useful during treatments and surgical procedures for various aspects. The greater thoracic splanchnic nerves can be a target when trying to treat chronic upper abdominal pain.

In patients who suffer from right-sided flank pain, it is common to see transection of the right greater thoracic splanchnic nerves, to get the pain under control and manage it.

Because many branches of the splanchnic nerves control bowel movement, any iatrogenic error during the surgical transection of the splanchnic nerves, there can be loss of bowel control.

Splanchnic nerve blocks are commonly used to manage pain when a celiac plexus block has not been successful in doing so. The two nerve blocks are very similar but differ in where the needles are aimed, with the splanchnic nerve block occurring in the anterolateral margin of the T12 vertebral body. To do so, the patient is in a prone position with their thoracolumbar spine flexed. The clinician then locates the margins of the twelfth ribs and identifies the spinous process of the vertebral body (L1). It is also important to note thatÂ when treating chronic abdominal pain, research shows that splanchnic nerve blocks provided better pain relief than celiac plexus blocks had and lasted an average of 35 days longer. The splanchnic nerve block lasted 56 days, on average, as where the celiac plexus block lasted 21 days.
