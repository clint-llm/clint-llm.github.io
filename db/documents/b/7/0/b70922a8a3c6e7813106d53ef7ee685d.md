Evaluation of patients toÂ diagnose SAN injury entails a clinical examination in an organized manner followed by electrophysiologic studies of nerves and muscles.

Pain may be radiating to the upper back and neck and infrequently to the ipsilateral arm. This pain has a multifactorial etiology and may include the straining of involved muscles with subsequent stretch on the brachial plexus.

Pain around the shoulder joint and neck area can be assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) comprised of 10 points.

The most common sign is the noticeable asymmetry on inspection of the shoulder and upper back. The patient would present with a diminished ability to hold the shoulder in abduction, shoulder drooping, and ipsilateral scapular winging (in which the medial side of the scapula is more prominent than the unaffected side).

Restriction in the range of motion (ROM) is observed as follows:

- Active abduction - 30 to 140 degrees

- Active forward flexion - 50 to 180degrees
