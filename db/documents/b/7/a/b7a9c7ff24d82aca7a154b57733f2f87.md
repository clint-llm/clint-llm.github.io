- Successful diagnosis is dependent on early screening with serum or urine ketones, even when serum glucose is normal, whenever EDKA is suspected.

- After volume expansion with crystalloid, the foundation of therapy is a combination of dextrose (5 to 10%) and insulin (0.05 to 0.1 u/kg/hr) infusion until acidosis resolves.

- Insulin infusion should not be avoided due to normal glucose levels but insteadÂ is essential to successful treatment.

- Ketosis does not resolve with intravenous crystalloid hydration alone.

- SGLT2 inhibitor treatment should be discontinued as soon as EDKA is diagnosed.

- Sodium bicarbonate infusion is not indicated.
