Primary care physicians (including gynecologists)are usually the first level of evaluation. They are in a position to obtain a thorough history and focused physical exam on initiating the patientâ€™s treatment to include physical therapy. With complex and interrelated complaints, referrals to appropriate specialists are indicated. Physicians with added training for PFD include urologists, urogynecologists, and colon and rectal surgeons.

The involvement of a sex therapist is essential, particularly for dyspareunia with long-standing personal or relational distress or unresponsive to physical therapy.
