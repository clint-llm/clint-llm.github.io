FMD is best managed by an interprofessional team that consists of a cardiologist, vascular surgeon, interventional radiologist, and an internist. The follow up of these patients is usually done by the primary care provider and nurse practitioner. Because of the diverse presentation, the treatment of FMD varies from angioplasty with stenting to open repair. Because the disease has no cure and is progressive, life long follows up is recommended. Often patients require multiple procedures to dilate the blood vessels, but eventually, some patients do develop end-stage renal disease, stroke, and manifestations of peripheral vascular disease.
