Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is best managed by an interprofessional team that consists of an orthopedic surgeon, rheumatologist, physical therapist, dietitian, pain specialist, internist, nursing staff, physical therapist, and pharmacist. The disorder has no cure, and thus attempts should be made to prevent the progression of the disorder. The patient should be referred to a dietitian for weight loss and physical therapy to regain joint function and muscle strength. Treatment for knee osteoarthritis begins with conservative methods and progresses to surgical treatment options when conservative treatment fails. The pharmacist should look at the patient's medications to ensure there are no interactions and that the dosing and indications are all correct. While medications can help slow the progression of RA and other inflammatory conditions, no proven disease-modifying agents for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis currently exist. [Level 2]

Employing interprofessional collaboration and information sharing regarding the patient's case will drive better outcomes and increase the chances of avoiding TKA. [Level 5]
