Trigeminal neuralgia is usually diagnosed based on the history and the description of the symptoms by the patients. For patients with clinically suspected TN, it is recommended to have neuroimaging studies to distinguish classic TN from secondary TN. MRI of the brain is preferred over CT, as the MRI helps in evaluating small adjacent lesions as well.

There are certain diagnostic criteria established by the ICHD-3, which can help in the diagnosis of TN. These criteria are as follows

A) Recurrent paroxysms of facial pain unilaterally in the distribution of trigeminal nerve and fulfilling criteria B and C.

B) Pain has the following characteristics:

- Pain lasting a fraction of a second to about 2 minutes

- Pain with severe intensity

- Electric-shock like or shooting pain with sharp quality

C) Innocuous stimuli precipitate the pain in the affected distribution

D) No alternative ICHD-3 diagnosis better explains the symptoms

The subtypes of TN are defined by ICHD-3 as follows

- Classic TN: This is secondary to neuromuscular compression and fulfilling the criteria above. This requires demonstration of the compression on an MRI or during the surgery for neuromuscular compression, with associated morphological changes in the trigeminal nerve root.

- Secondary TN: This is defined as TN secondary to an underlying disease. Some of the reported causes are multiple sclerosis, arteriovenous malformation, and cerebellopontine angle tumor.

- Idiopathic TN: This is defined as TN with no abnormalities seen on MRI or electrophysiological tests.

Neuroimaging studies like MRI Brain or CT Head can help in identifying causes like cerebellopontine angle tumor or multiple sclerosis, which can cause secondary TN.

Hence, though TN is a clinical diagnosis, an MRI of the brain with and without contrast is recommended to rule out a structural brain lesion in all patients with clinically suspected TN. It is also important to note that patients less than 40 years of age, patients with bilateral symptoms, and with sensory loss on physical examination are at a higher risk of secondary trigeminal neuralgia.
