Keeping up with daily functions is often challenging for individuals with different degrees of intellectual disability. They may have difficulty feeding themselves, going to the bathroom, and dressing. They also may have difficulty getting along with their family and friends because of a problem with communication as well as poor impulse control. They may have trouble excelling academically and socially at school.

Concerning clinical history, symptoms of intellectual disability usually begin during childhood or adolescence. Moreover, delays in language or motor skills may be observed by age two. Nevertheless, a significant number of children with mild levels of intellectual disability may not get identified until school age.

A comprehensive history of patients with intellectual disability must include the following:

- Information about the mother’s pregnancy, labor, and delivery

- Mother’s use of substances or medications during pregnancy

- Mother suffered any uncontrolled medical condition

- Was delivery pre-term?

- Was there any issue with delivery?

- Patient’s sensory, social, language, and motor developments to detect any developmental delay

- Patient’s exposure to infection, trauma, and toxin

- Patient’s medical conditions

- Patient’s psychiatric conditions

- Medications that the patient is taking

- Patient’s family history of psychiatric and medical conditions

- Patient’s living situation, caretaker

- Patient’s behavior toward caretaker, parents, and siblings

- Patient’s academic performance at school

- Patient’s behavioral disturbance reported at school

Physical examination is vital to differentiate intellectual disorders from other conditions. A full neurological exam should be performed to identify any deficit that may mimic intellectual disability and comorbid symptoms. Visual and hearing tests are particularly important as abnormal vision or hearing causes difficulty with communication, leading to a delay in developing language and social skills, closely mimicking intellectual disability. Motor dysfunctions such as spasticity, hypotonia, hyperreflexia, and involuntary movements are commonly present in individuals with intellectual disabilities.

Some physical characteristics are closely associated with a specific diagnosis as follows:

- Down syndrome: slanted eyes, flat nasal bridge, protruding tongue, small chin, and single crease palm

- Fragile X syndrome: long and narrow face, prominent forehead and jaw, large ears, and large testicles in male

- Fetal alcohol syndrome: smooth philtrum, thin vermilion, and small palpebral fissures

- Prader-Willi: obesity secondary to compulsive eating behavior, hypogonadism, small hands, and feet

- Cat’s cry (Cri-du-chat) syndrome: microcephaly, hypertelorism, low-set ears, and micrognathia

- Phenylketonuria: bizarre movements such as twisting hand mannerisms, poor motor coordination, and perceptual difficulties
