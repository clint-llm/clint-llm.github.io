Educating patients at risk for coronary artery disease and making a closed-loop communication between them and their cardiologist for primary and secondary prevention can further improve the management of patients at risk of these CTO lesions. Collaboration with shared decision making (between primary care physician, cardiologist, and interventionist) and communication are vital elements for good outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease and CTO lesions.

The interprofessional team care provided to the patient must use an integrated care pathway combined with an evidence-based approach to evaluating CTO lesions. The earlier angiographic and demographic predictors of failure to revascularize are identified in CTO lesions; the better is the prognosis and outcome.
