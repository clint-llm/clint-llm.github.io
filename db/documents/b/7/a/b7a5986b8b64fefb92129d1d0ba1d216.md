Netarsudil is a medication used in the treatment and management of glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Netarsudil is classified as a rho-kinase inhibitor. Primary open-angle glaucoma is characterized by progressive and irreversible optic neuropathy with a loss of optic nerve fibers. In patients with glaucoma, visual field loss can be minimized with accurate treatment regimens, regular follow-up, and enhanced patient compliance. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, adverse events, and other key elements of netarsudil therapy for clinical management of glaucoma and ocular hypertension pertinent to interprofessional team members.

**Objectives:**
