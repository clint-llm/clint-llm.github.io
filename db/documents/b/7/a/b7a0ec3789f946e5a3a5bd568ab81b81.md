Management of metastatic melanoma to the CNS is complex and needs a multidisciplinary team approach involving surgical oncologists, neurosurgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, dermatology, pathologists, and radiologists. It is recommended these complex patients discussed in a multidisciplinary tumor board for a consensus treatment plan. This approach will facilitate optimal patient care, individualized treatment decisions, and also improve enrollment in the clinical trials. Medical oncology and radiation oncology play a critical role in the management of CNS metastases. Appropriate histopathologic diagnosis with associated harboring mutations helps direct targeted therapies to control the disease/ Medical oncologists make treatment decisions and oversee the administration of systemic medications like immunotherapy and targeted therapies.

Radiation oncologists use WBRT or SRS to help manage the symptoms as well as control the growth of the BM. Oncologic pharmacists review medications, verify doses and play a very important role in the administration and side effect management. Oncology nurses staff the infusion center to administer the systemic medications and closely monitor for any associated side effects. The decisionÂ on when to stop treating a patient with CNS metastases as well as metastatic melanoma can be difficult, and this decision should involve the patient, family, friends, and the healthcare team. Extensive communication of interdisciplinary teams with the patient and families improve the outcomes of patients with metastatic melanoma to the CNS.
