**Cerebral Aqueduct of Sylvius**

The midbrain connects at its posterior aspect to the cerebellum via the superior cerebellar peduncles. On its anterior surface, it is recognizable the crus cerebri, which carry fibers such as motor cortical spinal fibers and fibers from the nuclei found within the pons. The midbrain contains the centrally located cerebral aqueduct. Through the aqueduct, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) passes from the third ventricle into the fourth ventricle.

In practical terms, the midbrain a distinguishable into tegmentum, the ventral part, and tectum, the dorsal part. The former includes different structures, such as the cranial part of the reticular formation, cranial nerve nuclei (which control eye movements,) the periaqueductal gray (PAG) matter, the red nucleus, the substantia nigra, and the ventral tegmental area (VTA). On the other hand, the midbrain tectum consists of the corpora quadrigemina and is responsible for auditory and visual reflexes.

**Midbrain Tegmentum**

The midbrain reticular formation

This term indicates several phylogenetically old nuclei located throughout the brainstem. These nuclei form numerous networks related to visceral (e.g., cardiovascular control) and movement functions and implicitly play a role in the state of consciousness and the waking and sleeping rhythms. This system is also involved in the mechanism of pain modulation.

Periaqueductal gray (PAG)

Around the aqueduct, there is a grey matter called the PAG matter, which is the primary control center for descending pain modulation and consists of neurons containing neurotransmitters such as enkephalin, dynorphin, and serotonin. Because the instinct to avoid painful situations is essential to guide behavior, it plays a pivotal role in autonomic function, motivated behavior, and behavioral responses to threatening stimuli. Thus, PAG is the region where the discrepancy between the amount of expected pain and actually perceived becomes elaborated. In practice, the PAG matter receives and elaborates information on the pain perceived directly from the spinal cord, while those on the expected pain sensation come from other brain regions, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. This arrangement is a survival strategy that allows inhibition of behaviors considered dangerous.

Cranial nerves nuclei

The nuclei of two pairs of cranial nerves are at the ventral side of the PAG. These nuclei are the oculomotor nuclei which through the oculomotor nerve (III) is****responsible for the control of the pupil and is involved in the control of most eye movements, and trochlear nuclei from which emerges the trochlear nerve (IV), which is the only pair of nerve to emerge from the midbrain in a dorsal position. It is a motor nerve that innervates the superior oblique muscle of the eye. The location of the Edinger-Westphal nucleus (a parasympathetic pre-ganglionic nucleus that innervates the iris sphincter muscle and the ciliary muscle) is between the oculomotor nucleus and the Sylvius aqueduct.

Ascending and descending pathways

One major ascending pathway that crosses the midbrain is the spinothalamic tract, which carries pain and temperature sensation and passes through the midbrain on its way to the thalamus. The major descending motor pathway is the corticospinal tract, which descends through the crus cerebri on its way to the anterior pons, and eventually to the medullary pyramids where they cross. Another descending tract is the rubrospinal tract, which originates within the midbrain in an area known as the red nucleus and inhibits other motor pathways.

The midbrain also contains many nuclei such as the red nucleus and the substantia nigra, which play a role in multiple pathways and disease processes.

Red nucleus

The red nucleus (so-called because of the reddish color due to the iron content) divides into a caudal (magnocellular) portion and a rostral part (parvicellular). The magnocellular portion originates the rubrospinal bundle, which constitutes the tegmental decussation and descends along the brainstem and spinal cord, ending in the laminae V, VI, and VII of the spinal cord. The rubrospinal tract seems to be useful for guiding the movements of the lower limbs and for restraining those of the upper limbs. For example, the movement that takes place when we move our arms when we walk depends on this modulation. They are automatic movements that we also do to help our balance. The red nucleus receives afferents from the telencephalic cortex (in particular from the areas responsible for motor control) in addition to the afference coming from the contralateral cerebellar nucleus interpositus. The parvicellular component, more important in humans, is involved in the motor control exercised by the cerebellum. It receives afferents from the dentate nucleus of the contralateral cerebellum and sends efferent fibers to the inferior olive nucleus (ION) following the path of the central tegmental tract. The neurons of the ION project to the contralateral cerebellum through the climbing fibers. Therefore, a cerebellum-red nucleus-ION circuit forms. Red nucleus lesions usually cause a disorder characterized for the most part by a contralateral tremor of the lesion and deficits in motor coordination.

Sommering's substantia nigra

The Sommering's substantia nigra is a lamellar structure that, like the red nucleus, is located in an intermediate position between the midbrain and the diencephalon and, although its rostral extremity goes deep into the subthalamus, it is conventionally assigned to the midbrain.

The substantia nigra, whose name is due to the presence in the neurons of high amounts of melanin pigment, contains dopaminergic neurons which either inhibit or increase the release of dopamine to control movements in association with the basal ganglia. The functionality of Sommering's substantia nigra is distinguished by its two parts, pars reticulata and pars compacta. The pars reticulata contains GABAergic neurons, and together with the globus pallidus (paleostriatum), it constitutes one of the two output nuclei of the basal nuclei. Pars reticulata and paleostriatum send inhibitory impulses on thalamic motor activity. This action is under the regulation of the inhibitory activity of the striatum. The afferent fibers to the reticulated substantia nigra come from the caudate nucleus and from the putamen (which together make up the striatum). In contrast, it sends efferents to the anterior and lateral thalamic ventral nuclei (via nigro-thalamic), and other fibers go to the superior colliculi. The pars compacta of the substantia nigra projects above all to the basal striatum through the nigrostriatal pathway. This route constitutes the so-called diffuse projection dopaminergic system, which has a crucial modulatory role. This system contains D1 and D2 receptors. The former are exciters on the neurons involved in the direct pathway, while the latter (D2) are inhibitors on the neurons involved in the indirect pathway and on the cholinergic interneurons of the activating system of the nuclei of the base. In this way, the nigrostriatal pathway can excite the neurons of the direct pathway and inhibit those of the indirect pathway, with a global meaning of movement facilitation. The afferent fibers to the pars compacta come from the striated body and the globus pallidus. Other projections come from the cortex. The efferent fibers get directed to the striatum.

Ventral tegmental area

This term, also called the VTA of Tsai, indicates a group of neurons found close to the midline on the midbrain floor. This neuronal aggregate is the origin of the dopaminergic cell bodies of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system and other dopamine-based circuits. The distinctive morphofunctional characteristics of these cells are manifold. For example, research has shown that VTA has a vast network of GABAergic neurons that interconnect via gap junctions, which feature a very fast, although poorly controlled, conduction. This structure, thus, is the subject of numerous studies as it is involved in the mechanisms of drug and the natural reward circuitry of the brain.

**Midbrain Tectum**

Corpora quadrigemina

On the posterior surface of the midbrain, there is a structure called the corpora quadrigemina. It is composed of superior and inferior colliculi. Superior colliculi are two multilayers structures located below the thalamus and around the pineal gland and involved in processing visual information. Inferior colliculi are smaller than superior and divided in a central nucleus and dorsal and external cortex. Functionally inferior colliculi are involved in the processing of auditory information. The raphe nuclei which contain serotonergic neurons are at the ventral side of the PAG at the level of the inferior colliculus.
