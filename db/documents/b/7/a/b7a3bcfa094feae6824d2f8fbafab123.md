Complications associated with rotator cuff syndrome (RCS) are best broken down into nonoperative- versus operative-related complications:

**Nonoperative Management**

- Persistent pain/recurrent symptoms

- In the setting of PTTs, there is at least a theoretical risk of tear propagation, lack of healing, fatty infiltration, atrophy, and retraction.

- 
              
- Overall a controversial topic, a 2017 study analyzed independent risk factors for symptomatic RC tear progression over a 19-month period of nonoperatively managed shoulders; risk factors for tear progression included:
              
              
- 
                  
- The initial presence of an FTT
                  
                  
- Medium-sized cuff tears (1 to 3 cm)
                  
                  
- Smoking
                  
                  
- While PTTs were included in the study, the presence of a PTT was not a risk factor for cuff tear progression

- In the setting of chronic/atrophic tears, especially with RC tear propagation, degenerative joint disease and RCA ensue

**Surgical Management**

- Surgical treatment tends to be most effective in patients that have failed or reported persistent or worsening symptoms despite at least 4 to 6 months of exhaustive nonoperative treatment modalities

- The standard risks of surgery, including recurrent pain/symptoms, infection, stiffness, neurovascular injury, and risks associated with anesthetic use

- SAD/acromioplasty

- 
              
- Deltoid dysfunction: can occur secondary to failed deltoid repair following an open acromioplasty or excessive debridement during arthroscopy
              
              
- Anterosuperior escape: occurs secondary to aggressive CAL release – the coracoacromial arch and suspensory system becomes compromised, and with CAL release in the setting of massive, retracted, and irreparable RC tears, the humeral head migrates superiorly and anteriorly to compromise patient functional outcomes
