There are patient risk factors associated with the development of DILI, which include female sex, older age, and increased body mass index (BMI).

Intrinsic DILI is most commonly caused by acetaminophen, while it is less often seen in aspirin, tetracycline, and vitamin A

Idiosyncratic DILI cases are caused by:

- Antibiotics (45.4%): amoxicillin-clavulanate (most common), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin, isoniazid (INH)

- Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

- Herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) (16.1%): green tea extract, anabolic steroids, multi-ingredient nutritional supplements

- Cardiovascular drugs (10%): statins, amiodarone

- Central nervous system (CNS) agents: valproate, phenytoin

- Antineoplastic drugs: tyrosine kinase inhibitors, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, alpha inhibitors, methotrexate
