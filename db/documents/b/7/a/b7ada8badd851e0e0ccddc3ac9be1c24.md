One study reported that in 56 eyes with infectious scleritis, the median time from the inciting event was 1.9 months. Patients with a history of pterygium surgery had a median time of 49 months (range 0-183 months) after surgery before developing infectious scleritis. This duration is significantly longer than those with glaucoma, cataracts, and retinal surgery (median 1.0 to 1.6 months). The study also noted a median age of 70, suggesting that age might be a factor in developing this condition.Pseudomonas aeruginosa in developed countries and Nocardia or fungi in developing countries.
