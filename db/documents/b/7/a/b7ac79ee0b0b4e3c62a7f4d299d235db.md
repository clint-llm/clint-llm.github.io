Peters anomaly is a rare congenital disorder characterized by central corneal opacity with a relatively clear peripheral cornea. It can have associated systemic abnormalities like cleft lip, cleft palate, short stature, abnormal ears, and intellectual disability. The definitive treatment for the Peters anomaly is penetrating keratoplasty, but there are high chances of graft failure. A significant number of patients develop glaucoma and amblyopia. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the diagnosis and management of patients with a Peters anomaly.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of the Peters anomaly.
- Explain how to manage the Peters anomaly appropriately.

- Outline the differential diagnosis and staging of the Peters anomaly.
- Summarize the role of interprofessional collaboration in ensuring optimal outcomes in the Peters anomaly.
