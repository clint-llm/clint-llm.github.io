Simulation program leaders have not only the facility but access to many strategies to support a multi-modal approach to physician leadership development.

Cognitive biases can influence medical decision making as well, thus creating a more error-prone environment. Specific curricula can be designed to target heuristic clinical decision-making throughout the continuum of healthcare provider development. These can be used either as initial teaching strategies or as the platform on which to provide remediation. One study incorporated the evaluation of trends in "bias–prone" versus "bias–resistant" cognitive frames. Scenarios were designed to highlight a participants' diagnostic decision-making model, allowing for the identification and categorization of these biases. Facilitated debriefing prompted reflection on these observed biases, as well as potential mitigation strategies that could serve as countermeasures. In this psychologically safe environment, participants were able to observe, practice, and apply techniques to prevent further incorporation of biases.
