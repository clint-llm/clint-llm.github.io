With a long axis parallel to the cellular surface, juvenile chondrocytes are elliptic in shape at the periphery of cartilages. As the frame shifts inward, the shape takes a round form. Chondrocytes may also appear in isogenous groups of up to eight cells. Mitotic cell division of individual chondral cells leads to cellular grouping. During histological development, chondrocytes and their matrix shrink, which retracts the cells from the capsule and produces the irregular shape present within cartilage. Chondrocytes uniformly fill the oblong spaces, lacunae, within tissues and act as factories of collagen production.

Chondrogenesis initiates in early development. Bone morphogenic proteins, GDF5 (growth factor), HOX gene proteins, beta transforming growth factors (TGF-b), and some other signaling molecules contribute to the endogenous development of chondrocytes. Beta-catenin levels dictate the portions of lineage commitment to endogenous chondrogenesis and osteogenesis. Specialization and development of chondrocytes are further driven by beta-catenin in the canonical Wnt signaling process.
