Laryngeal surgery presents its unique challenges for anesthesiologists, including coordination among the surgeon and other allied health providers. The airway must be shared between the anesthesiologist and the surgeon, for instance. The treatment of common laryngeal pathology limits neck mobility and increases tissue friability. A thorough history and physical must be performed to evaluate for changes to airway friability. (For example, from radiation.)

The pathology itself (e.g., vocal cord tumor) may provide challenges to airway management and often requires visual assessment preoperatively. Numerous ventilation options exist depending on the length and unique demands of the case and the patient. Additionally, the use of lasers during laryngeal surgery presents a significant fire risk, and this must be mitigated as much as possible.
