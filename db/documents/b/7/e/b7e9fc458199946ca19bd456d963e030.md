Calcineurin is a complex of phosphatases composed of a 61-kDa calmodulin-binding catalytic subunit (calcineurin-A) and a 19-kDa calcium-binding regulatory subunit (calcineurin-B). This protein participates in a wide range of cellular processes and calcium-dependent signal transduction pathways, including T cell activation.

In general, calcineurin inhibitors bind with high affinity to specific cytoplasmic receptors termed immunophilins, including cyclophilin and FK binding protein.

Cyclosporine acts by binding to cyclophilin-1 inside the cells to form the cyclosporine-cyclophilin complex. Subsequently, this complex inhibits calcineurin, which stops the activation and dephosphorylation of NF-AT, which is responsible for causing inflammatory reactions.

Voclosporin is similar to cyclosporine in its chemical structure with a difference in one amino acid, making it more effective in calcineurin inhibition. Moreover, voclosporin inhibits calcineurin and inhibits p-glycoprotein, organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1, and organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B3. All of these actions make voclosporin a promising immunosuppressant.
