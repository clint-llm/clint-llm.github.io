Out of all the known causes forÂ wide QRS complex tachycardia, there are two etiologies (VT, VF) that account for the most cardiac deaths in the U.S. It is estimated that there are 300,000 deaths per year due to these cardiac dysrhythmias. Between these two ventricular etiologies, VT tends to be the most common cause, accounting for approximately 80% of WCTs. This is especially true in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease (i.e., myocardial infarctions, coronary artery disease) and increases the likelihood to 90%. SVT is the third most likely cause of WCT, although it occurs less frequently. Out of the different causes of SVT, conduction with aberrancy appears to be the most likely cause of WCT. SVT with aberrancy accounts for approximately 21% of WCTs.
