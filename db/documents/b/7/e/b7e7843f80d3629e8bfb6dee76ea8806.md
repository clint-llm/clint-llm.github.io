A pulmonary contusion is an injury to the lung parenchyma in the absence of laceration to lung tissue or any vascular structures. It usually results from blunt chest trauma, shock waves associated with penetrating chest injury, or explosion injuries. These injuries can lead to pulmonary failure and death. The pathophysiology of pulmonary contusions remains poorly understood. They were first described by Morgagni, an Italian anatomist, in 1761, and the term pulmonary contusion was coined in the 19th century by French military surgeon Dupuytren.

Widespread use of explosives in World War 1 and 2 led to increased recognization of pulmonary contusion due to blast injuries. Many soldiers with blast injuries developed pulmonary bleeding without apparent external injuries.
