Trichinosis is a difficult diagnosis, especially in areas where the infection is not endemic, and there has been no outbreak. In the first 3 to 4 weeks, patients present with nonspecific symptoms. These symptoms appear to be gastroenteritis, influenza, serious bacterial infection, heart failure, or acute coronary syndrome, leading to delayed diagnosis.

It is vital for nurses and clinicians to not neglect detailed dietary and travel history, especially meat ingestion within the five weeks before symptoms began. Improvement in agricultural and food processing standards has minimized the risk of infection in commercial meat. Populations at the highest risk are those that consume undercooked or raw wild game meat or noncommercial sources of pork. In the US, recent outbreaks have been associated with wild boar, bear, walrus, and unspecified pork.

Early diagnosis and treatment will reduce disease severity, but delay reduces the efficacy of antihelminthic drugs as larvae enter striated muscle. Trichinella larvae can survive in muscle tissue for many years so long-term follow-up may be necessary.
