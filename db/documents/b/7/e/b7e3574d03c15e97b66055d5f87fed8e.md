Acquired perforating dermatosis often demonstrates severe pruritus and can have a significant impact on the patient’s quality of life. Therefore, physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants should be aware of this characteristic dermatosis in patients with diabetes or CRF receiving hemodialysis given that early diagnosis and treatment can prevent the progression of the disease which results in an improvement of prognosis.

Also, more studies on the clinical and histological features of APD are still needed to enlighten the etiopathogenesis of this condition as the current literature remains poor and centers on case reports or small case series.

The optimal approach to addressing this rare condition involves an interprofessional team approach consisting of physicians, mid-level providers (NPs and PAs), nurses (particularly with specialty training in dermatological care) and pharmacists; this approach to caring for these patients will yield the best results.
