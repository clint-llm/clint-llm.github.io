Mucormycosis is a life-threatening infection that is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a pathologist, laboratory specialist, internist, infectious disease expert, ICU nurses, and a surgeon. These patients need immediate treatment and debridement of the necrotic tissues. HBO is used but only in stable patients. Antifungal agents need to be administered intravenously for weeks but despite optimal treatment, the infection carries a mortality of more than 50%.
