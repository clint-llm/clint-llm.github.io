The semitendinosus muscle accompanies the biceps femoris muscle and the semimembranosus muscle in the posterior compartment of the thigh. These three muscles compose the hamstring muscle complex. The semimembranosus muscle lies deep to the semitendinosus muscle and is the most medial muscle of the posterior compartment of the thigh.

The semimembranosus muscle originates from the superolateral aspect of the ischial tuberosity and inserts into the medial tibial condyle, posterior oblique ligament, the posterior joint capsule, and arcuate ligament.

The biceps femoris muscle is the most lateral muscle in the posterior compartment, with the long head originating from the ischial tuberosity and the short head rising from the lateral lip of the linea aspera of the femur. The biceps femoris then inserts into the head of the fibula and lateral condyle of the tibia.
