Collaborative care between an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals is paramount in the process of involuntary hospitalization. Once the physician initiates the civil commitment, he or she then relies upon the rest of the healthcare team to complete the process. Social workers are needed to follow up with litigious aspects of the case; psychiatric technicians are required to help redirect and monitor patients once admitted; nurses not only provide first-hand care to patients but also act as liaisons between patient and doctor; and finally, pharmacists monitor medication management, to ensure appropriate treatment protocols are followed. An interprofessional team of healthcare providers works best when all members of the teamwork synchronously and collaboratively.
