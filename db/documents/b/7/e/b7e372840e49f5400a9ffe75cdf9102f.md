The alveoli can be flooded or collapsed due to fluid or debris in various conditions mentioned above and allow no inspired gas to enter through the alveolar-capillary membrane. Despite increasing the FiO2, the blood perfusing these alveoli tend to remain at the mixed venous oxygen content. As a result, there will be a constant mixing of deoxygenated blood into the pulmonary vein, which causes arterial hypoxemia. This is more pronounced in the dependent lung regions of patients with ARDS.

The physiological causes of refractory hypoxemia can be from 1) intrapulmonary right-to-left shunting due to acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary edema, 2) ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch due to atelectasis, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary edema, and infiltrates in the lung such as pneumonia, 3) hypoventilation from machine failure, leak, or calibration error, and 4) other causes such as anemia, intracardiac shunts, decreased cardiac output and increased demand states.
