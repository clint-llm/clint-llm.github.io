When the leg veins clot, thrombosis can result with a potential for pulmonary embolus. If the lower leg arteries are stenosed or occluded, a cold ischemic leg can occur which requires immediate intervention to salvage the leg. If nerve injuries occur, the patient may be left with various types of neurological deficits. Compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency and requires prompt fasciotomy. Compartment syndrome results when the increased pressure within the compartment causes the tissues to be hypoperfused. Since the fascia that surrounds the compartment does not stretch, any swelling of the muscles or bleeding within the compartment can cause an increase in the pressure within the compartment.
