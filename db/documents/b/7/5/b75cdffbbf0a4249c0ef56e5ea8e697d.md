No single pathognomonic test exists for the diagnosis of MS. Diagnosis is made by weighing the history and physical, MRI, evoked potentials, and CSF/blood studies and excluded other causes of the patient's symptoms. Clinically a diagnosis can be made with evidence of two or more relapses: this is possible through objective clinical evidence of two or more lesions or objective clinical evidence of one lesion with reliable historical evidence of a prior relapse. Dissemination in space (DIS) and dissemination in time(DIT) are two hallmarks of the accurate diagnosis of MS. DIS is assessed using information from the history and physical and understanding in determining the location of CNS involvement. MRI and evoked potentials have vital roles in also establishing DIS. DIT is established by charting the disease course with a thorough history and documenting the presence of multiple exacerbations.Â The 2010 McDonald criteria determined that DIT can be demonstrated by new lesions on a follow-up MRI when compared to a baseline scan.

Evoked potentials are useful to demonstrate slowed conduction indicative of subclinical involvement. Of note, these findings are often asymmetric. MRI, CSF, and blood studies are essential in ruling out other etiologies. All patients should obtain an MRI when possible. Specific blood studies to include CBC, TSH, vitamin B12, sedimentation rate, and ANA should also be obtained in all patients.

The chief characteristics of MS lesions on MRI can be summarized as the following:

- Lesions are T2 hyperintense, T1 isointense/hypointense.

- Lesions are classically oval or can be patchy.

- A high predilection for periventricular white matter

- Lesions are perpendicular to the ependymal surface(Dawson's fingers)

- Gadolinium enhancement with active lesions noted as classically diffuse or rim enhancement.

- Thinning of the corpus callosum and parenchymal atrophy

- Cord lesions classically involve the cervical or thoracic cord

The classic abnormal CSF findings in MS are as follows:

- Elevated protein and elevated myelin basic protein

- Leukocytes(occasionally seen, and typically mononuclear cells)

- Increased total IgG, increased free kappa light chains, oligoclonal bands
