Less than 1% of thyroglossal duct cysts develop into a carcinoma. Papillary carcinoma is the most common malignancy found (92.1%) followed by squamous cell carcinoma (4.3%). Thyroglossal duct cyst carcinoma typically presents with an asymptomatic midline neck mass. 73.3% of these types of carcinomas were diagnosed as an incidental finding on final pathologic analysis. Patients diagnosed with thyroglossal duct cyst carcinoma tend to be adults and have an older average age than the typical thyroglossal duct cyst patient. Treatment of thyroglossal duct cyst papillary carcinoma involves a Sistrunk procedure followed by evaluation of lateral neck lymph nodes and thyroid. Total thyroidectomy, lateral neck dissection and/or radioactive iodine may be indicated depending on the extent of disease. Overall prognosis is excellent, with a survival rate of 99.4% and a recurrence rate of 4.3%.
