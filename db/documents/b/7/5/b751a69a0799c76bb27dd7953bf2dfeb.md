Surgical procedures for TMJ are performed for various medical reasons: local and/or systemic disease; trauma; alteration of joint morphology and loss of function. The surgical approach depends on the present problem, on the anatomical physiology, the psycho-emotional need of the patient, the experience of the surgeon, and the pre-surgically pre-established objectives.

Orthognathic surgery in the presence of aesthetic/functional problems, for example, mandibular advancement or to increase the function of the joint in opening the mouth, or to avoid joint dislocation, do not give definitive conclusions in the benefit-side effects relationship. Probably, postoperative functional results are more effective if TMJ itself is free of concomitant pathologies (arthritis, arthrosis, etc.).

We know little of what happens after the surgical approach in the presence of synovial plicae to TMJ, and often, the presence of this functional alteration may not give symptoms. The plica is discovered only after an instrumental examination.

Total joint reconstruction interventions or with alloplastic joint replacement appear to have good post-surgical results in the presence of idiopathic condylar resorption.

Approaches with arthroscopic seem to achieve good results regarding the repair or removal of the joint disk.
