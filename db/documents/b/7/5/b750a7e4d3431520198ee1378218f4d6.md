In current practice,Â multigated acquisition (MUGA) scans have fallen out of favor compared to the more readily available echocardiogram. Newer technologies have offered providers the ability to carry ultrasound probes and connect them to mobile phones and view the ultrasound image on their cellular devices. This provides a quick assessment of LV function. There are, however, areas where noninvasive tests like MUGA can provide meaningful diagnostic and prognostic information before necessitating invasive cardiac evaluation.

The most common use of MUGA scanning is to evaluate patients on cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic regimens serially. Anthracyclines are common chemotherapeutic medications used to treat carcinomas, lymphomas, and sarcomas. Anthracyclines, including doxorubicin and daunorubicin, have been shown to cause a dose-dependent and cumulative anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (AIC) and, ultimately, congestive heart failure. This is thought to be due to topoisomerase-2-beta inhibition in cardiac myocytes, resulting in cell death pathways. The hazard ratio for AIC is 1.26 for patients receiving it for chemotherapy and carries an incidence of 65% at higher doses of 550mg/m.

The risk is even greater for pediatric populations, as they may develop congestive heart failure decades after chemotherapy.

An echocardiogram is the preferred imaging modality for pediatric patients due to the absence of radiation; current practice recommendations are to perform a MUGA scan every five years in survivors of childhood malignancies as AIC has been reported from two to 15 years after completing chemotherapy. Although transthoracic echocardiogram can help track left ventricle EF, LV diastolic dysfunction is optimally assessed with nuclear ventriculographic tests like MUGA.

Another area where the MUGA scan can be of clinical benefit is in cases of systolic heart failure. In such cases, the precise determination of LVEF is crucial in the decision-making process of whether to proceed with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) or not; this is achieved with minimal variation via MUGA scan. Besides, the class 1 indications for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) include an LVEF of less than 35%, a new left bundle branch block (LBBB) with a QRS duration of more than 150ms, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade-3 or ambulatory grade-4 heart failure.

Regional EF can help assess the health of the myocardium after a myocardial infarction (MI). MUGA can be greatly beneficial in this way. The change in radioisotope levels in one area of the LV can indicate how the blood pool behaves in that area. This can be tracked across various time points in the cardiac cycle and compared to other areas of the LV. A graphical representation of the regional function can be generated from this data and using the resulting curve, a provider can identify hypofunctioning myocardium areas. This becomes useful in tracking the progression of ischemic disease. Another nuclear imaging modality used in this scenario is the myocardial perfusion scan (MPS), in which areas of unsalvageable myocardium appear darker compared to well-perfused and healthy myocardium. In comparison, MPS can more accurately determine which areas of the myocardium are healthy and which are not. The drawback is that they take approximately 2 hours to perform, nearly 2 to 4 times as long as a MUGA scan.

A developing application of MUGA scans is for the routine assessment of diastolic dysfunction. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction occurs due to the ventricles' failure to relax and fill adequately with blood. This type of heart failure accounts for approximately 50% of all heart failure cases, and the incidence of diastolic dysfunction is increasing yearly. One of the parameters obtained via the MUGA scan is the left ventricle time-activity curve (LVTAC), which reflects the radioisotope behavior, and therefore blood pool behavior at different time points in the cardiac cycle.

Diastolic dysfunction is characterized by a prolonged isovolumetric relaxation phase, delayed rapid filling, and an increased atrial kick

In summary, with the widespread use of echocardiography and the increasing use of magnetic resonance imaging for assessing LVEF and diastolic function, the MUGA scan is not very commonly applied. However, it still retains a place in assessing myocardial function in patients on cardiotoxic chemotherapy and in cases when precise, reproducible, and interpreter-independent assessment of LV function is desired.
