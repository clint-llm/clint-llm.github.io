In addition to a detailed medical history and physical examination to support the etiology of vertebral pain as the source of the patient's chronic axial LBP, the physician must document radiological evidence of type 1 or type 2 Modic changes on MRI and complete treatment history to support the rationale behind the procedure, including longstanding debilitating LBP with functional impairments greater than 6 months unresponsive to at least 6 months of conservative care.

The BVN ablation procedure utilizes a similar transpedicular approach to the vertebral augmentation procedure. Although there is no consensus on perioperative management before BVN ablation, it is reasonable to follow a similar standard of care to other percutaneous spinal interventions. In preparation for the procedure, the following should be obtained: complete metabolic profile (CMP), complete blood count (CBC), and a coagulative profile to assess bleeding risk and rule out underlying infection, severe thrombocytopenia, anemia, or metabolic disorders.

It is also highly recommended to follow guidelines on blood transfusion, discontinuation of anticoagulation, which are variable based on the anticoagulant in question, and perioperative intravenous (IV) antibiotics, such as 2 grams of cefazolin (or 600 mg clindamycin if penicillin allergy) 60 minutes pre-procedure, as a prophylactic measure standard of care to interventional spinal procedures. Based on the patient's comorbidities and physician's judgment, the procedure may be performed under general and monitored anesthesia care (MAC) sedation.
