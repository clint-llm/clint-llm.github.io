The vallecula is an infolding of mucosa to form a pouch. The mucosa is often lined by epithelium, which is the case with the vallecula as well. The vallecula, as well as the rest of the pharynx and larynx, are derived from ectoderm embryologically. The vallecula derives from the third branchial arch along with other structures including the stylopharyngeus, the body of the hyoid bone, and the glossopharyngeal nerve.
