The most common indications for thymectomy are thymoma and myasthenia gravis. Less common indications for thymectomy include malignant tumors such as thymic carcinoma, neuroendocrine tumors, and benign tumors like thymic cysts. Ectopic parathyroid glands may also be present in the thymus and require resection. Indications for minimally invasive techniques such as video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and robotic-assisted are similar to the open procedure.
