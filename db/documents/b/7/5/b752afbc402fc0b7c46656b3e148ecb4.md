The pathophysiology of paraproteinemic keratopathy, including how immunoglobulins reach the cornea, is currently poorly understood. One study measured an increase in the densitometry of the anterior and central parts of the cornea compared with the posterior aspect of the cornea. This study suggests that the immunoglobulin light chains in these cases may be washed over the cornea while dissolved in tears and subsequently diffuse into the tissue of the cornea itself from the epithelial side.

Other studies found deposition affecting the posterior cornea as well, emphasizing the high degree of variability that characterizes this disease. Other mechanisms also have been studied, including deposition from limbal vasculature and immunoprotein production by keratocytes.
