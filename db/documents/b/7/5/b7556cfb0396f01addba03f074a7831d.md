Nickel, a transition element, is a durable, shiny metal with a silvery-white appearance. Discovered by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt in 1751, it has been utilized in metal alloys for over 1700 years. Nickel occurs naturally in soil and bodies of water; it can also be synthetically produced for industrial applications. Its resistance to oxidation makes it commonly used in plating, stainless steel, alloys, and rechargeable batteries.

Nickel is naturally present in the atmosphere, groundwater, and soil, and its concentration can vary based on factors such as rock degradation, atmospheric conditions, and potential industrial contamination. It is also ingested through food and drinking water. Current research indicates that typical levels of nickel ingestion do not pose a toxicity concern due to low absorption. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency does not have specific regulations regarding nickel levels. Nickel can be found in various food items like cereal, chocolate, teas, and legumes. Leaching of nickel from kitchen utensils and pipes can also contribute to its consumption. Nickel is considered nonessential and does not have any specific dietary recommendations. Its biological role remains unclear.

**Acute**nickel toxicity can occur through various routes, including parenteral administration, ingestion, inhalation, and dermal absorption. The most dangerous form is nickel carbonyl, commonly associated with occupational exposure, which can cause respiratory tract irritation and other nonspecific symptoms.

**Chronic**nickel toxicity can manifest as sinusitis, occupational asthma, and dermatitis. Prolonged exposure to nickel has also been linked to lung and nasal cancer development.
