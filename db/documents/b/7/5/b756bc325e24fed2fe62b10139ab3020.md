The Eustachian tube (ET), named after Italian anatomist Bartolomeo Eustachio, is a fibrocartilaginous duct connecting the middle ear (posterior to the eardrum) to the nasopharynx. Also known as the pharyngotympanic tube, the Eustachian tube is approximately 36 mm long, 2-3 mm wide, and functions primarily in optimizing middle ear sound transmission and equalizing pressures within the ear. Normally a closed structure, the Eustachian tube opens in response to movement of the mandible and pharynx, such as during chewing or swallowing.

Structurally, the Eustachian tube has osseous (anteroinferior) and cartilaginous (posterosuperior) portions, is comprised of cartilage and mucosa, and is supported by surrounding soft tissue, the sphenoid sulcus, and peritubal muscles (tensor veli palatini, levator veli palatini, salpingopharyngeus, and tensor tympani).
