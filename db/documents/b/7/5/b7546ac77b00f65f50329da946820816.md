Contact lens (CL) use has increased tremendously owing to different indications and varied benefits.

Contact lenses act as a foreign body over the ocular surface and, despite their numerous benefits, are known to cause many complications.

The various corneal complications are epithelial edema, microcysts, abrasions, superficial punctate keratitis, contact lens-related peripheral ulceration, peripheral corneal staining, sterile corneal infiltrates, corneal neovascularization, microbial keratitis, bacterial keratitis, fungal keratitis, acanthamoeba keratitis, warpage, and endothelial changes.

The conjunctival complications include allergic conjunctivitis, giant papillary conjunctivitis, and superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis. The other listed complications can be physical damage to the lens and discoloration. CL-related complications have decreased with CL materials, manufacturing techniques, and ocular hygiene advances. This activity focuses on various problems and complications associated with contact lenses and the necessary interventions to safeguard the patient from irreversible changes.
