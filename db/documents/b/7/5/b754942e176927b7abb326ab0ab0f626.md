About 95% of the cases of acromegaly and gigantism are secondary to aÂ GH-secreting adenoma in the pituitary gland. Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) secretion from a hypothalamic adenoma or ectopic GHRH secretion from lung or pancreas neuroendocrine tumors can also cause acromegaly. Rarely, ectopic growth hormone secretion secondary to abdominal and hemopoietic malignancies can cause acromegaly. Genetic syndromes associated with GH hypersecretion are multiple endocrine neoplasia-1 (MEN-1), neurofibromatosis, Carney complex, and McCune-Albright syndrome. Familial idiopathic pituitary adenomas (FIPA), due to aryl hydrocarbon protein-interacting (AIP) mutations, can be associated with familial acromegaly. About 25% of the cases with familial acromegaly usually present as teenagers with gigantism.
