The atlas is a ring-shaped structure devoid of a vertebral body, consisting of anterior and posterior arches bridged by two lateral masses.

The cruciate ligament is composed of a transverse axial ligament that runs horizontally between the lateral masses of C1 (considered the strongest ligamentous attachment in the cervical spine), posterior to the odontoid process and a vertical ligament extending from the basion to the C2 vertebral body. Additional stability is provided by paired alar ligaments running from the tip of the odontoid process to the foramen magnum and the apical ligament connecting the tip of the odontoid process to the basion. Finally, the anterior longitudinal ligament, the rostral extension of the posterior longitudinal ligament (tectorial membrane), facet joint capsules, and the posterior myoligamentous complex complete the cohesive occipitoatlantoaxial junction. The list of etiologies associated with atlantoaxial instability includes the following

- 
**Traumatic**

- **Congenital**: Down syndrome, skeletal dysplasia, congenital osseous abnormalities

- **Inflammatory:**rheumatoid arthritis.
