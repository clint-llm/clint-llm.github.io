Patients should be counseled and educated about the PFT and the prognosis. The health care professional should use precise and nonmedical terminology to explain the necessity of the treatment and potential complications as a part of the informed consent. It is essential to make a clear statement that this condition is considered an emergency and necessitatesÂ urgent treatment to preserve the involved finger and hand viability and function. The patient may be warned about the possible significant complications resulting from the infective process, mainly the restricted motion and the risk of amputation. Patients who have an infection in the dominant hand will need extra support during the rehabilitation process and may need longer to recover.
