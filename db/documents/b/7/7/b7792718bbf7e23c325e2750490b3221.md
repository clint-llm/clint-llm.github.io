At 4 to 12 weeks post-partum, the recommendation is to perform a 75g oral glucose tolerance test to rule out the possibility of the development of type 2 diabetes, impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance test.

ADA and ACOG recommend repeating testing every 1 to 3 years for women who developed GDM and had normal postpartum screening results.
