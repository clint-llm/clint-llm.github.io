Macular edema can be caused by several other conditions including but not limited to hypertension, retinal vein occlusion, ruptured microaneurysm, radiation, Irvine-Gass syndrome, and subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation. A good clinical history can help to elucidate the underlying cause of the macular edema. Questions about the patient's onset of diabetes, hemoglobin A1C trending, diet, and presence of other diabetic complications are critical.
