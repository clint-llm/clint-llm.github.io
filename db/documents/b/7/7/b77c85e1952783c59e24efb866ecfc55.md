In addition to having a strong conceptual understanding of ICS/NIMS, medical providers must participate in active training and exercises in order to enhance their ability to implement the system. Medical personnel may be involved in ICS at a number of levels. Depending on the type of event, they may function in the role of incident commander. Physicians and EMS providers may also need to act as a safety officer or a technical specialist depending upon the nature of the incident. Healthcare providers may be utilized in the operations section or logistics section. ICS Form 206 is the Medical Plan for the incident which will need to be completed by a medical specialist. Even when a healthcare provider is not directly involved in the ICS, he or she should be familiar with the structure and functioning of the system in order to interact with other personnel during an actual event. Hospital employees also need to review the Hospital Incident Command System, which is a framework for addressing an incident specific to the healthcare setting.
