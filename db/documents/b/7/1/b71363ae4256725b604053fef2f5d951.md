Post-transplant complications are broadly divided into early and late complications.

**Early Complications**

They occur in the immediate postoperative period within days of transplantation.

**Primary Graft Dysfunction (PGD)**

Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is defined as the failure of graft function within the first 24 hours after transplantation in the absence of hyperacute rejection, pulmonary hypertension, or known surgical complications such as bleeding or tamponade. The International Society of Heart and Lung Transplant (ISHLT) reported the PGD incidence to be 33% in all cardiac transplant procedures. In some case series, patients with severe PGD, have shown to have a survival of 44% at one year.

**Rejection**

Rejection occurs as a result of interaction between the recipient's immune system and the allograft. It may be categorized by the type of immune response (cell-mediated vs. antibody-mediated) and by severity (ranging from mild rejection without allograft dysfunction to severe rejection with hemodynamic compromise). The incidence of rejection requiring augmentation of immunosuppression has fallen from 23.5% (2004–2006) with contemporary rates approximately 13% (2010–2014) between discharge from hospital and one year. Surveillance endomyocardial biopsies (generally 10 to 12 in the first year) are performed to look for evidence of rejection. Grading is standardized according to the 2005 revised ISHLT nomenclature, which includes the use of immunohistochemistry.

**Infection**

The use of immunosuppression inevitably increases the risk of infection. The risk of death due to infection is greatest in the first year post-transplant when maximum immunosuppression is being used. Patients should be vaccinated for influenza and pneumococcal infections. Live vaccines are contraindicated. Routine prophylaxis for pneumocystis jerovecii, cytomegalovirus, candida, and in some cases, herpes is given to these patients.

**Delayed Complications**

They occur late in the transplantation period after months or years of transplant.

**Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy**

Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a process that leads to the narrowing or occlusion of the coronary arteries of the allograft. CAV is a significant cause of death late post-transplant, and its incidence increases with the time elapsed since transplant. It is a combined immunological and non-immunological insult. Intimal hyperproliferation due to smooth muscle cell hyperplasia and accumulation of lipids and inflammatory cells is the hallmark of the pathology of a biopsy specimen. Both epicardial and endocardial vessels are involved. Most patients may not have any symptoms and may be detected on routine biopsy surveillance. Some patients may have angina or heart failure symptoms at presentation. Due to the diffuse nature of the disease, outcomes of revascularization are not good. Post-transplant use of statins and rapamycin, when given early in the post-transplant period, may delay the development of CAV. Common risk factors for developing CAV can include immune-mediated (mismatch between donor and recipient including HLA and DR) and non-immune mediated (increased age, recipient coronary artery disease, or risk factors like smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity). This vasculopathy can present as heart failure and needs to be monitored using regular echocardiographic examinations and hemodynamic measurements.

**Malignancy**

New onset of solid malignancies occurs in around 10% of transplant patients after 1 to 5 years of transplant.

**Immunosuppression Related Side Effects**

Human papillomavirus (HPV) related squamous cell cancer is the most common malignancy reported. Avoiding sun exposure is recommended in these patients. Ebstein-Barr virus-related post-transplantation lymphoproliferative (PTLD) is also common in these patients from immunosuppression. Other toxicities related to tacrolimus or sirolimus use include renal disease, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and metabolic derangements (hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia).
