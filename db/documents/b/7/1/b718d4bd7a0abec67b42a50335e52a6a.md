Erysipelas is a skin infection involving the dermis layer of the skin, but it may also extend to the superficial cutaneous lymphatics. It is characterized by an area of erythema that is well-demarcated, raised, and often affects the lower extremities, with the face being the second most commonly affected site. Erysipelas is also referred to as “St. Anthony’s Fire” due to its intense fiery rash. Its diagnosis can overlap with cellulitis, and often a definite diagnosis cannot be made. Cellulitis has ill-defined borders and is slower to develop, while erysipelas has better-defined borders and faster development. Erysipelas can be serious but rarely fatal. It has a rapid and favorable response to antibiotics. Local complications are more common than systemic complications.

The most common cause is group A streptococci.
