It is an aseptic procedure and follows all the guidance as standard abdominal surgery. Once the patient arrives in the theatre, the WHO theatre checklist should be started and all the aspects completed for each step.  Anesthesia may be general or regional as appropriate and is administered in the induction room.

On the operating table, the patient is positioned supine, routine cleaning is done with antiseptic solution from the nipple line to the mid-thighs and draped to isolate the sterile zone. A transverse groin skin crease incision yields the best cosmetic result post-op. Dissection is carried down through the layers of the anterior abdominal wall to the external oblique aponeurosis, which is opened along its fibers to gain access to the inguinal canal. Care is taken at this point to prevent injury to the ilioinguinal nerve just lying beneath the aponeurosis.

The cord contents are identified, and a Penrose drain wrapped and clamped tightly around the cord to prevent hematogenous micro-metastases. The testis is delivered along with its coverings from the scrotum through the inguinal wound. The distal gubernaculum is clamped and divided while the proximal cord is then clamped as close to the internal ring as possible, ligated preferably with a non-absorbable suture and divided.

Ligating the testicular vessels in continuity will prevent potentially life-threatening retroperitoneal bleeding from a slipped ligature. It is essential throughout the procedure to avoid any breach of the scrotal skin, as this may alter the lymphatic drainage of the tumor. To achieve this, gentle blunt dissection to free the testes from the scrotal skin is helpful. Hemostasis is achieved with the use of bipolar electrocautery. A testicular prosthesis is then inserted and anchored at this point if agreed earlier. The wound is then closed in layers and dressed with a sterile dressing.
