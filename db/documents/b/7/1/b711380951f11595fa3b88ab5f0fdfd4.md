The overall prognosis remains relatively poorÂ and worsens with the progression of symptoms. Overall mortality ranges from 20%-40%, particularly if gangrene is present.

Despite prompt treatment in patients who develop acute DVT or phlegmasia, a significant percentage of patients will develop venous valvular insufficiency and post-thrombotic syndrome. Valvular incompetence has been reported as high as 20% and 44% at 5 and 10 years respectively.
