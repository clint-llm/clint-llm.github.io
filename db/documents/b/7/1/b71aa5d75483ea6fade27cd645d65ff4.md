Alcohol and its metabolites are cardiotoxic. Myocardial depression secondary to alcohol is initially reversible however prolonged sustained alcohol use leads to irreversible dysfunction.

Dilated cardiomyopathy secondary to alcohol use does not have a pre-defined exposure time. Daily alcohol consumption of 80 g per day or more for more than 5 years significantly increases the risk, however not all chronic alcohol users will develop Alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy.

There is neither a certain amount of alcohol known to be toxic to myocardial cells nor is there a specified period of exposure time to develop ACM. Alcohol consumption of 80 g per day for at least 5 years significantly increases the risk of developing ACM but, not all chronic alcohol abusers develop ACM.

Drinking habits and echocardiogram evaluation were studied in (CARDIA) in 2368 adults in a long follow up. Increased alcohol intake had a direct inverse adverse association with ventricular structure. Increase alcohol consumption had greater indexed left ventricular mass and increased left ventricular end-diastolic volume after 20 years. Alcohol consumption did not show any association with systolic dysfunction.
