The ulnar nerve innervates the hypothenar. If the ulnar is damage or compromise, the muscles in the hypothenar eminence will atrophy. The atrophy of the hypothenar eminence can indicate a compromise of the ulnar nerve proximal to the hand.

As the ulnar nerve passes between the hook of the hamate and pisiform bone (Guyon's canal), it can become compressed. Individuals that apply direct pressure to the Guyon canal such as cyclists can damage the ulnar nerve. Damage to the ulnar nerve will manifest as atrophy, numbness, tingling, and pain in the hypothenar eminence along with the fourth and fifth digits. This condition is the same as "carpal tunnel syndrome," but it affects the ulnar nerve.

The hypothenar eminence can become damaged if the ulnar artery is compromised, and there is insufficient collateral blood flow. This condition is called the "hypothenar hammer syndrome: This condition tends to affect individuals that work with tools that need tight gripping and repetitive pounding of the tool. The tight grip and pounding of tools will cause a recoil impact on the vascular blood supply in the hypothenar eminence. If the blood supply becomes compromised, there will be necrosis of the hypothenar eminence.
