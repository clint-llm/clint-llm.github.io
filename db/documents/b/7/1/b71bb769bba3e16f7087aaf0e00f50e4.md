Nausea is a commonly encountered symptom in healthcare, one that is difficult for any patient. Causes may be as simple as the body's defense against an ingested toxin, to a complex association set of signals activated by motion, medications, anesthesia, position, stress, pregnancy, psychiatric disorder, and/or fear. Multiple or single neurohumoral pathways may be involved. Indications for the treatment of symptoms require astute evaluation by the treating provider. Therapy to treat chronic nausea stemming from chemotherapeutic agents and doses will vary from the treatment of postoperative nausea (a relatively common side effect of general anesthesia) and vomiting.
