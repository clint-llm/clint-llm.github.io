Myofibroblastoma is a relatively newer diagnosis. There is a lack of information regarding the epidemiology of this entity. Myofibroblastoma is managed by an interprofessional team consisting of an internist/general practitioner, breast radiologist, anatomic pathologist, and breast surgeon. Nursing staff help to round out the interprofessional team, assisting at all phases of diagnosis and treatment.

Given that myofibroblastomas are benign lesions with no risk of local recurrence or transformation to malignant potential, surgical excision is curative but not compulsory.
