Pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is a rare inflammatory papulosquamous disorder of unknown etiology. There are 6 distinct subtypes which occur in both children and adult which occur striking variation. Fundamental elements noted across all subtypes include distinct, well-demarcated plaques of various sizes with characteristic reddish-orange hue, may have varying degrees of the scale. More generalized subtypes often demonstrate intervening areas of unaffected skin, known as "islands of sparing," which is a signature characteristic of PRP. There is a broad spectrum of presentations from mild disease isolated to extremities to severe disease at timesÂ evolving into diffuse erythroderma.
