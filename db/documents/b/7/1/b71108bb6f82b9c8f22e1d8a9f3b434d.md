It is critical to educate patients with microtia on the myriad treatment options available. Patients will need multidisciplinary care to include an otologist, plastic surgeon, audiologist, speech pathologist, and possibly an anaplastologist as well as a pediatrician if they have other associated syndromic complications. Discussion regarding the timing of interventions is crucial and the need for surgical intervention for comorbid conditions, such as aural atresia, must be taken into account.

Maternal prenatal counseling regarding the avoidance of teratogens should be performed as well.
