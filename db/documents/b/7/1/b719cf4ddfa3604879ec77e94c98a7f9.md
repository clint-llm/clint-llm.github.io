There are three known systems to stage gestational trophoblastic diseases, these are:

- The World Health Organization (WHO) prognostic index score

- The Clinical Classification system by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and

- The FIGO staging system, which was revised and edited in 2000

The current clinical classification system that is mostly used in the United States is seen in (Table 1), which originated from the analyses of patients with metastaticÂ gestational trophoblastic neoplasia who were treated at the NIH. The system separates the patients to those with nonmetastatic disease and those with metastatic disease, as all nonmetastatic disease patients can be cured with initial single-agent chemotherapy. On the other hand, metastatic disease patients are further subdivided according to the presence or absence of factors associated with response to initial single-agent chemotherapy. Patients with no high-risk clinical factors are likely to benefit from initial single-agent therapy and are labeled as good-prognosis metastatic GTD. Meanwhile, patients with a single high-risk clinical factor are labeled as poor-prognosis GTD. These patients are at increased risk of experiencing failure to single-agent chemotherapy and also death if treated with single-agent therapy followed by multiagent regimens.

WHO prognostic index offers precise information regarding the prognosis of the disease, yet, the clinical classification system is successful at identifying patients for whom initial single-agent chemotherapy is likely to fail, as well as, it is easy and less complicated than WHO's.
