Important risk factors for tricuspid valve infective endocarditis (TVIE) include:

Intravenous drug users (IVDU): Infections resulting from IVDU involve 30% to 40% of all TVIE cases.

Cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) Infection: TVIE is considered device related if there is evidence of valvular vegetation and tricuspid regurgitation in the presence of positive blood cultures.

Indwelling catheter: hemodialysis, parenteral nutrition, and chemotherapy requiring long term central venous access.
