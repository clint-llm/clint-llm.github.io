Uremic encephalopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion. The following should be considered in the differential diagnosis:

- Wernicke-Korsakoff encephalopathy

- Hypertensive encephalopathy

- Hyperosmolar coma

- Disequilibrium syndrome

- Metabolic encephalopathy

- Sepsis

- Fluid and electrolyte disturbances, such as hyponatremia and hypermagnesemia

- Drug toxicity

- Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome

- Osmotic demyelination syndrome

- Hepatic encephalopathy

- Hypoglycemia

A mnemonic to remember a set of conditions that lead to diffuse cortical injury on MRI is “CRUMPLED.” In this mnemonic, C is for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, R stands for reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, U is for uremic encephalopathy, M is for mitochondrial cytopathy/encephalopathy, P stands for prolonged seizure/posterior reversible encephalopathy, L is for laminar necrosis hypoxic-ischemic injury, L stands for liver disease, E is for encephalitis (infectious), and D is for diabetes mellitus - hypoglycemia.
