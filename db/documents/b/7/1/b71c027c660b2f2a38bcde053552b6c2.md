Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is a prevalent condition in the United States, affecting 2% of its population. The treatment of PUD has evolved in the last century. Surgical vagotomy has historically played a major role in PUD treatment as it was considered the gold standard in the late 1940s. The treatment of PUD was drastically altered with the introduction of acid-reducing medications in the late 1970s and early 80s, and medical treatment was further supported in 2005 when Drs. Barry Marshall and Robin Warren won the Nobel Prize for their research in implicating Helicobacter pyloriÂ as the etiology of PUD.

There are 3 types of vagotomy described in the literature: truncal vagotomy (TV), selective vagotomy (SV), and highly-selective vagotomy (HSV). All have advantages and disadvantages.

Although uncommon, surgical vagotomy may still play a role in the treatment of complicated PUD. Clinicians should be familiar with the surgery and its potential complications to treat patients in the modern age effectively.
