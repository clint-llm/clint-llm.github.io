Both divisions of the ANS are comprised of a complex network of pathways responsible for maintaining the physiologic integrity of organs, tissues, and cells. They are composed of pre- and postganglionic neurons that act on effector organs.

The PNS uses acetylcholine as its neurotransmitter for both pre- and postganglionic neurons activating muscarinic receptors. This differs from the SNS, which uses norepinephrine, which acts on adrenergic receptors, as the primary neurotransmitter for most postganglionic neurons. The primary exception is sweat glands stimulated by the SNS, which have cholinergic postganglionic neurons.

Actions of the PNS are listed below:

- In the male reproductive tract, parasympathetic stimulation of M3 receptors causes smooth muscle relaxation in the helicine arteries of the penis, allowing blood to fill the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum, causing an erection. The PNS also gives excitatory signals to the vas deferens, seminal vesicles, and prostate.

- In the eye, parasympathetic stimulation of M3 receptors causes contraction of the sphincter muscle of the iris leading to constriction of the pupil (miosis). Additionally, it causes contraction of the ciliary muscle improving near vision.

- In the heart, parasympathetic stimulation of M2 receptors causes decreased heart rate and velocity of conduction through the AV node.

- In the vasculature, parasympathetic stimulation of M3 receptors leads to vasodilation.

- In the lungs, parasympathetic stimulation of M3 receptors leads to bronchoconstriction. It also increases bronchial secretions.

- In salivary glands, parasympathetic stimulation of M1 and M3 receptors leads to high volume secretion of potassium ions, water, and amylase.

- In the stomach and intestines, parasympathetic stimulation of M receptors leads to increased motility and relaxation of sphincters. Stimulation of M receptors also increases gastric secretions to aid in digestion.

- In the gallbladder, parasympathetic stimulation of M3 receptors stimulates contraction to release bile.

- In the pancreas, parasympathetic stimulation of M3 receptors leads to the release of digestive enzymes and insulin.

- In the kidneys and bladder, parasympathetic stimulation of M3 receptors stimulates peristalsis of ureters, contraction of the detrusor muscle, and relaxation of the internal urethral sphincter aiding in the flow and excretion of urine.

After being released from cholinergic neurons and acting on muscarinic receptors, acetylcholine is quickly inactivated or removed from the neuroeffector junction to allow new signals to come through. In cholinergic synapses, this action is primarily performed enzymatically by acetylcholinesterase. It hydrolyzes acetylcholine into choline and acetate in less than one millisecond, making it one of the fastest enzymes in the body.
