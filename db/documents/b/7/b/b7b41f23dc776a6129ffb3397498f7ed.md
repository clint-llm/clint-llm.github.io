The intercostobrachial nerve (ICBN) is a cutaneous nerve that provides sensation to the lateral chest, medial aspect of the upper arm, and the axilla. It is of particular surgical significance as a lesion of this nerve during surgical procedures can disrupt sensation and adversely affect the patient's post-operative course. Surgeons, radiologists, and anesthesiologists perform procedures such as axillary surgery, breast surgery, and regional nerve blocks involving the brachial plexus or the axilla, in which knowledge of this nerve's course is important.Â This article will discuss the anatomy and surgical significance of the ICBN.
