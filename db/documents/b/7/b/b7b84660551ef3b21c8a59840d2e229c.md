The primary care provider and nurse practitioner may come across a patient with a renal cyst detected on an incidental imaging study. These patients should be referred to a urologist and radiologist for management. Most small asymptomatic cysts do not need treatment. Large cysts that affect renal function may be aspirated or removed via laparoscopic surgery. The outlook for most patients is excellent.
