Currently it is not recommended to provide prophylaxis for GAS to household contacts despite the increased risk of developing GAS. However, it is important to educate close contacts regarding the symptoms of GAS, and to recommend they seek care immediately should they develop.

At a minimum, standard precautions should be used in the hospital setting to prevent transmission to patients and staff. The CDC has recommendedÂ for the first 24 hours of effective antibiotics to have the patient in both contact and droplet isolation.
