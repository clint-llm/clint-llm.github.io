Generally, once identified as a typically benign breast calcification, no further action is required. However, the difficulty arises in the overlap between calcifications that are typically benign and those of suspicious morphology. In other words, a calcification that will evolve into a typically benign calcification may look suspicious in the beginning stages and may necessitate a biopsy for tissue sampling.

Although benign in the sense of unrelated to breast cancer, breast arterial calcifications have been associated with systemic diseases such as diabetes, coronary artery disease, or chronic kidney disease.
