Myocarditis is a significant cause of sudden death and nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, especially in the young. It has a very diverse and sometimes, nonspecific presentation, and can mimic various disease entities. Although viral myocarditis is the most common type, nonviral myocarditis also must be considered. Nonviral myocarditis comprises several infectious and autoimmune etiologies that should not be overlooked; recognition is critical for a timely intervention. This activity describes the etiology, evaluation, and management of nonviral myocarditis and highlights the role of interprofessional teams in improving outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of nonviral myocarditis.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with nonviral myocarditis.
- Summarize the management of nonviral myocarditis.
- Explain the importance of coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients with nonviral myocarditis.
