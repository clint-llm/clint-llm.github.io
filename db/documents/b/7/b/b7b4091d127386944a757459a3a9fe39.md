A significant proportion of the distal humerus is cartilaginous in children. Although the ossification centers appear predictably around the elbow, there may be diagnostic uncertainty in very young children. Differential diagnoses include

- Radial head fractures

- Distal humeral medial or lateral condyle fractures

- Transphyseal fractures of the distal humerus are another differential diagnosis,Â and non-accidental injury should be excluded in such cases.

- A pulled elbow is usually indicated from the history, and radiographs are rarely performed in these cases.
