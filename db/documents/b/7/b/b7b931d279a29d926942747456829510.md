Renal Doppler ultrasound is routinely performed because it is a useful technique for evaluating a wide range of various renal pathologic conditions. An understanding of normal anatomy, as well as important anatomic variants, as well as basic physical concepts, are necessary for correct interpretation. This activity outlines the vascular anatomy, imaging indications, and technique and briefly reviews some of the common pathologies where it may be used by an interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the common renal vascular anatomy.
- Summarize the common indications for a renal Doppler ultrasound examination for native as well as transplant kidneys.
- Describe classic imaging findings associated with renal artery stenosis, renal artery thrombosis, renal vein thrombosis, and pseudoaneurysms/arteriovenous fistulas.
- Explain the typical equipment required for a renal Doppler ultrasound used by an interprofessional team.
