Hydrocarbons are organic compounds consisting of carbon and hydrogen atoms. Toluene and benzene can be found in products such as gasoline, nail polish, hair dye, acrylic spray paint, airplane glue, plastic cement, cleaning products, and paint thinners. The hallmark complications of toluene toxicity are renal tubular acidosis and hypokalemic paralysis. Benzene is known to cause hematological disorders. Rarely, both can result in death. This activity describes the evaluation of patients with benzene toxicity and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Discuss the pathophysiology of hydrocarbon toxcity.
- Describe the history and physical exam findings commonly seen in patients aromatic hydrocarbon toxicity.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for aromatic hydrocarbon toxicity.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with aromatic hydrocarbon toxicity.
