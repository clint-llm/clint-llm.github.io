Metoclopramide works by antagonizing central and peripheral dopamine-two receptors (D2) in the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone in the area postrema, usually stimulated by levodopa or apomorphine. It achieves this by decreasing the sensitivity of visceral afferent nerves that transmit from the gastrointestinal system to the vomiting center in the area postrema in the chemoreceptor trigger zone.

**Pharmacokinetics**

**Absorption:**Metoclopramide is rapidly and well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and peak plasma concentrations are attained about 1 to 2 hours after the oral dose. Metoclopramide is lipid-soluble, giving it a large half-life and a large volume of distribution. Its half-life can range from 4.5 hours to 8.8 hours.

**Distribution:**The volume of distribution is high (approximately 3.5 L/kg), which suggests the extensive distribution of drugs to the tissues.

**Metabolism:**Metoclopramide is metabolized by oxidation primarily via cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), glucuronide, and sulfate conjugation.

**Excretion:**In a study, approximately 85% of the radioactivity of an orally administered dose is recovered in the urine, and half of it is present as a parent or conjugated metoclopramide. Around 18–22% of the dose is recovered as free metoclopramide in urine. Metoclopramide's elimination half-life in adults with normal renal function has been reported to be ~ 6 hours. In adults with severe renal impairment, there is a reduced metoclopramide clearance, increasing the elimination half-life (7.7 to 17.8 hours).
