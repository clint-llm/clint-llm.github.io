The care of an amputee involves an interprofessional approach in which nursing staff plays a key role. Monitoring in the post-operative setting includes obtaining and recording vital signs, pain scores, and laboratory values. Serial wound assessments allow for early detection of post-operative bleeding and will also allow the nurse to perform temporizing maneuvers (digital pressure, dressing reinforcement) while a medical provider is alerted. Pain scores are diligently obtained to titrate the patients' pain medication accordingly and provide the best condition for early mobilization. Close communication between the medical providers and nursing staff is necessary to provide the patient with individualized care based on their needs.
