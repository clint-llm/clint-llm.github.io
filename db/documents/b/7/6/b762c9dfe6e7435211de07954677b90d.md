Transcatheter closure of the ASD can be performed for only the secundum type of ASDs. The other ASD types are repaired surgically because of their location and associated abnormalities of atrioventricular valve defects (primum type) and anomalous pulmonary vein connections (sinus venosus type).

Current indications for ASD closure by a transcatheter approach include:

- Symptomatic ASD causing functional impairment (Class I)

- Symptomatic (Class I) or asymptomatic right atrial and or right ventricular enlargement (Class II)

- Symptomatic (Class I) of the asymptomatic hemodynamically significant defect without symptoms (Ratio of pulmonary to systemic flow greater than 1.5) (class II)

- Paradoxical embolism
