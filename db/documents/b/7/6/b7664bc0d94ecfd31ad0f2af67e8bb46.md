Wilson Disease should be suspected in all patients with the following:

- Kayser–Fleischer rings detected on routine eye exam

- A sibling or parent with a diagnosis of Wilson disease

- Unexplained and acquired Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia

- Neurological symptoms of unexplained origin

- Psychiatric disease with signs of hepatic or neurologic disease

- In persons between ages three and 55 years with unexplained serum aminotransferase elevation, chronic hepatitis with steatosis, poorly responsive autoimmune hepatitis, cirrhosis, or acute liver failure.

Age alone should not be used as a criterion to disregard a diagnosis of Wilson disease. A few patients older than 55 years present with neurologic symptoms of Wilson disease, particularly when such symptoms were overlooked.
