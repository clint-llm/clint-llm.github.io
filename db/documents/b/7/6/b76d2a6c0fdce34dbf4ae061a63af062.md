There are multiple organizations such as the International Urogynecological Association (IUGA) and the American Urogynecologic Society (AUGS) that have premade patient education pamphlets. These include printable information about different urogynecological testing and surgical procedures that may be necessary. Written instructions given about pessary information along with face-to-face consultations improved the confidence of patients to self-manage their pessaries.
