Traditional treatment of opioid/opiate addiction focuses on self-help in the setting of counseling and mentorship by addicts already successfully in recovery, with a focus on drug-free living. "Drug-free" in the minds of many in both recovery and treatment involves an absence of any chemicals including those prescribed by a medical provider. In the 2010s the concept of harm reduction became increasingly accepted by the mainstream of addiction treatment providers, which allowed for ingested medications to be taken, with an increased focus on objective patient outcome optimization. Chronic treatment of addicts with methadone (a full mu receptor agonist), buprenorphine (a partial agonist of mu receptors and Kappa antagonist), and Naltrexone (an opioid receptor antagonist) became more accepted. Increasing numbers of studies comparing various strategies of recovery and relapse suppression were seen in the literature. Concurrently, depot naltrexone injection for the enhancement of complete opioid avoidance became available. Each naltrexone injection lasts approximately 30 days. During that time, opioids are rendered ineffective by the effect of the naltrexone on the target receptors.
