- Cottonmouth snakes are venomous pit vipers with a range throughout the Southeast United States.

- Their venom contains enzymes that cause local destruction of tissue through the metabolism of cellular membranes and causing an inflammatory response.

- Systemic effects and coagulopathy from cottonmouth envenomation are uncommon. The most common symptoms are pain, ecchymosis, and edema.

- Crotalidae polyvalent immune Fab antivenom should be administered for patients exhibiting progressive signs of proximal edema, significant hematologic abnormalities, or severe systemic symptoms.

- Patients with early signs of envenomation require admission for observation. Those that do not have symptoms after eight hours can be discharged.
