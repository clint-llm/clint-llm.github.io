The OBGYN generalist holds a vital role as a patient counselor at yearly regular well-women exams. This counseling should include general ways to optimize fertility, including maintaining a healthy weight and upholding a healthy lifestyle, including smoking cessation and reduction of alcohol intake.

Cultural factors of the twenty-first century have led women to not only have fewer children but also begin procreating much later than women of prior generations. Additionally, once infertility is established as a patientâ€™s diagnosis, the treatment options are not often available to all due to high costs and the lack of insurance, which often prohibits access for patients.
