The incidence and prevalence of Turcot syndrome are difficult to ascertain considering the rarity of the condition and that it has had a shifting definition over the years. However, it is usually an inherited disease in an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant fashion, and that it can also arise sporadically.

There have been 148,900 new cases of inherited colorectal cancers in 2008. Of all the colorectal cancers diagnosed, up to 10%, at most, are inherited.

In patients with FAP, the relative risk of developing medulloblastoma is 92%. As a result, one APC mutation is present, by default, in FAP. APC mutations are not found in sporadic medulloblastomas; therefore, medulloblastoma presenting in a patient with an APC mutation is most likely Turcot syndrome.
