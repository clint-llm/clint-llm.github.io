The differential diagnosis for anal cancer is broad and dependent upon its clinical presentation. Bright red blood per rectum may also be the result of hemorrhoids, polyps, diverticulosis, anal fissures, ulcers, abscess,Â or proctitis. A sizeable malignant mass at the anus may also originate from the rectum, bladder, prostate, or vagina.
