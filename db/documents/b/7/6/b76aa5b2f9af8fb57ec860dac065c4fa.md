Diphtheria initially presents with nonspecific flu-like symptoms like fever, sore throat, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Generally, the average incubation period is 2 to 5 days (ranges between 1 to 10 days). In most of the cases, the history of the patients points toward travel from an endemic region with no vaccination records. In such cases, the provider should be aware of the most prominent features of the diseases, i.e., the thick, gray, adherent pseudomembrane over the tonsils and throat. Respiratory tract involvement is a common feature of the disease. It begins with mild erythema, which later changes into coalescing pseudomembrane.

Pseudomembrane consists of red blood cells, white blood cells, dead cell debris, and organisms. This pseudomembrane often bleeds if attempts are made to scrape it off from the adhering surface. Typical symptoms and signs of diphtheria include low-grade fever, sore throat, malaise, cervical lymphadenopathy, headache, and dysphagia. In a study by Pancharoen C et al., the most common manifestations of diphtheria included patch followed by fever and upper respiratory tract infection.

In the case of cutaneous diphtheria, ulcerating skin lesions are present, which are covered with a gray membrane. These lesions do not spread or invade the surrounding tissues. The site for the cutaneous lesions are previously injured tissues from trauma or previous dermatologic lesions.
