The interscalene block allows for coverage of the lateral two-thirds of the clavicle, shoulder, and proximal humerus. When attempting a blockade of areas in the arm and forearm, it is important to keep in mind that the inferior trunk (C8-T1) is often inadequately blocked and additional blockade of the ulnar distribution may be required. It traditionally has not been reliable for surgery on the hand. The interscalene nerve block is commonly used alone or in conjunction with other forms of anesthesia for pain control during surgery or in the perioperative period.
