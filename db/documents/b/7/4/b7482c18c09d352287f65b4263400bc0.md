An electrocardiogram is paramount in the diagnosis of Torsades de Pointes. The characteristic finding is a twisting of the QRS complexes around an isoelectric line. Torsades de Pointes is triggered by a PVC occurring on a preceding T wave. The onset of Torsades de Pointes is often preceded by a run of short-long-short R-R intervals. A QT nomogram can provide a sensitive and specific assessment of the risk of Torsades de Pointes in drug-induced QTc prolongation. Any value plotted above the line on the nomogram puts the patient at risk of Torsades de Pointes.
