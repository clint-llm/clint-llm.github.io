Delayed effects of radiation therapy can include radiation necrosis of the brain, which generally occurs in the area of the brain where the tumor was radiated. Radiation-induced brain tissue necrosis can occur anywhere from 6 months to several years after the radiation treatment, but it usually occurs within the first 1 to 2 years. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of radiation-induced brain necrosis, reviews available therapy, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the pathophysiology of radiation-induced brain necrosis.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with radiation-induced brain necrosis.
- Identify treatment options for radiation-induced brain necrosis.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by radiation-induced brain necrosis.
