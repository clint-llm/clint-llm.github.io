Appropriate hyperbaric patient selection will include patients that will follow all safety protocols, patients with approved indications, confirmation of diagnosis, no contraindications and minimal to no relative contraindications to hyperbaric oxygen treatment, a chamber and crew that is suitable to the patientâ€™s clinical needs, and consent to treatment from the patient or a legal representative. The healthcare team, including clinicians and nurses, must educate the patients on the risks and benefits of hyperbaric therapy, maintain safety during treatment, and provide coordinated care.
