The normal aortic valve consists up of three leaflet cusps.

- Right coronary cusp

- Left coronary cusp

- Non-coronary cusp

It named like this as they overlie on the sinuses from where the coronary artery arises with the same name.

The bicuspid aortic valve comprises two cusps and a majority of the time it is unequal, rarely they are symmetrical which is a pure bicuspid with no raphe. Mostly, it is due to the fusion of the right and left coronary cusp, and this anomaly associated with coarctation of the aorta. It could be due to the fusion of the non-coronary cusp and right coronary cusp which associated with valvular abnormalities like aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation.
