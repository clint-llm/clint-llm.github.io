Saliva provides lubrication and keeps the oral cavity moist and clean, protecting the oral mucosa fromÂ mechanical injury. Salivary amylase helps to initiate the digestive process. Mucin and immunoglobulin in saliva protect the oral mucosa from microbial infection. Therefore, xerostomia can adversely affect oral intake leading to poor nutrition, gingivitis and periodontitis, dental caries, halitosis, fungal infections (candidiasis), and accelerating enamel erosion. Chronic discomfort from dry mouth can contribute to symptoms of anxiety and depression.
