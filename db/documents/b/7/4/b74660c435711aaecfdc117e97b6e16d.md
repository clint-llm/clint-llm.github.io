**External Reduction Fixation**

Surgical repair of the odontoid process, or dens, fractures are often an immediate necessity. Type I fractures are extremely rare and are usually stable, not needing any surgical fixation. Type II fractures, however, are unstable and need stabilization either by external fixation education and immobilization or internal fixation. Without surgical stabilization, the potential risk of nonunion with non-surgical intervention. There are certain nonunion risk factors to consider before opting out of surgery. These include but are not limited to age greater than 50 years old at the time of injury, displacement of the dens is greater than 6 mm, and if moderate fracture comminution is present. It is shown that with an anterior approach to fixation, there are higher success rates of surgical repair.

**Halo Immobilization**

This nonsurgical approach carries a lesser risk of nonunion if the patient is younger than 50 years of age at injury, has minimal dens displacement, and has no comminution.Â This technique can be achieved using a halo vest immobilizer (HVI), which functions to provide an extremely rigid external support for the immobilization of the upper cervical spine, including the atlantoaxial joint. It restricts C1-C2 joint flexion by 75%.
