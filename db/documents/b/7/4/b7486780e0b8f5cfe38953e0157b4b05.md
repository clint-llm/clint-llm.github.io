**Preoperatively**

- Alcohol solution or pad (cleanse and degrease skin prior to marking the planned flap)

- Surgical marker (for marking planned flap)

- Local anesthesia (such as lidocaine 0.5% with epinephrine 1:200,000 buffered with sodium bicarbonate in a 1:10 ratio)

- Topical antiseptics, such as chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine

- Surgical drape

**Intraoperatively**

- Scalpel (#15 blade)

- Forceps

- Shea scissors (or other dissecting scissors)

- Iris scissors, preferably serrated (thin fat from flap if indicated)

- Gauze

- Electrocoagulation/electrocautery device

- Skin hooks

- Needle driver

- Normal saline (keep tissue clean and moist)

- Suture (absorbable and nonabsorbable)

**Postoperatively**
