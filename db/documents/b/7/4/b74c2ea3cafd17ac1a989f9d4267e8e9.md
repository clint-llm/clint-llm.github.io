Tay Sachs disease has no curative treatment, and it is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. The newborn screening for Tay Sachs is not universally available currently. Early recognition of the disease is clinically very challenging, especially with the juvenile-onset and late-onset forms. A high index of suspicion is important when evaluating a patient from a high-risk group. Since Tay Sachs disease is a prototype of degenerative disease of the grey matter of infancy, any infant with developmental delay or rapid regression Tay Sachs disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis. In addition, the onset of psychiatric symptoms in clusters with neurological findings should prompt further testing for adult-onset Tay Sachs disease.

Tay Sachs disease is managed by a multidisciplinary team approach, including a neonatologist, pediatric neurologist, geneticist, nutritionist, physiotherapist, and occupational therapist. Genetic counselors play a significant role in providing parental reproductive risk counseling and prenatal diagnosis. Tay Sachs families need medical, educational, psychosocial, and financial support services in their local communities.
