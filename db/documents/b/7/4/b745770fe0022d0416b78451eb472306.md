an interprofessional approach to aortic rupture

The majority of people who suffer an aortic rupture die at the scene of the trauma. For the few who doÂ arrive in the emergency department, an interprofessional approach to diagnosis and treatment can be lifesaving. Patients who suffer blunt injuries to the chest should be suspected of having an aortic injury and prompt imaging studies should follow. Once the diagnosis is made, the key is to lower the blood pressure and consult with a cardiac surgeon and/or interventional cardiologist. Placement of a stent can be lifesaving and avoids the morbidity of open surgery. The outlook for untreated patients is grim as the potential for a full rupture is always present; and once it occurs, the patient is not salvageable. For those who undergo treatment, the prognosis is good. However, paraplegia still is a feared complication when repairing an aortic rupture.
