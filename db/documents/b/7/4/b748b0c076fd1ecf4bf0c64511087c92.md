LMAs have been shown to be as effective as other airway management strategies in patients receiving CPR.

LMAs may be used appropriately and successfully in pediatric patients.

Success rates for blind intubation through an LMA range from 60% to 99%, depending on the device and skill of the operator. Blind intubation rates are highest for the Fastrach LMA (ILMA) as compared to other supraglottic devices but should best be facilitated by flexible fiberoptic guidance whenever possible.

LMAs should not be the final secured airway solution in a failed airway rescue. They can become displaced when changing from a temporarily stable situation to another airway emergency and should be used as a conduit to a secure airway with an endotracheal tube.
