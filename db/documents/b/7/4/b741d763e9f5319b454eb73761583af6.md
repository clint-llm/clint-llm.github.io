Ectodermal dysplasias are single-gene disorders with a variable mode of inheritance. Mutations in cell signaling processes involved in the induction and development of ectodermal structures and their interactions with mesodermal structures are central to the clinical manifestations of ectodermal dysplasias. For example, spontaneous mutations in the genes that affect the ectodysplasin signal transduction pathway resulting in signaling errors. This results in aplasia, hypoplasia, or dysplasia of epidermal appendages. This is classically observed in hypohidrosis ectodermal dysplasia.
