Amphetamine is a widely abused agent and toxicity is not uncommon. Because of its very high morbidity and mortality, amphetamine toxicity is best managed by an interprofessional team. The triage nurse must be aware of the signs and symptoms of amphetamine toxicity and expedite the admission. Patients may present with diverse psychiatric and medical problems ranging from seizures, arrhythmias and extreme psychosis. These patients need aggressive supportive care in a quiet environment with close monitoring. The outcomes after amphetamine toxicity depend on the number of organs affected, the concentration ingested, any potent decongestants and patient comorbidities. Even though patient education is recommended to deter use of amphetamine, most of these patients are non-compliant with any type ofÂ outpatient intervention. Eventually, they suffer a catastrophic medical problem or get involved with the law and remain incarcerated.
