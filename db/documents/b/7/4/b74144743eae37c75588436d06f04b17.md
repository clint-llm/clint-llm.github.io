Insufficient sleep is due to an inadequate opportunity for sleep manifested by a reduced time in bed (number of hours) and/or poor sleep quality (depth of sleep or having sufficient restorative deep stages of sleep). Reduced sleep subsequently affects daytime wakefulness, performance, quality of life, accidents, hypertension, and cardiovascular morbidities.

The current ICSD-3 definition of insufficient sleep syndrome requires the sleep pattern to be present for at least three months.
