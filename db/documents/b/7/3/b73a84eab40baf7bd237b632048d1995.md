The evaluation of hypertelorism entails specific and precise measurements. Bony inter-orbital measurements from radiograph or computed tomography are the most accurate measurements,

**Inner Canthal Distances in Centimeters by Age: Mean (2SD)**

Premature newborn 1.6 (0.4)

Full-term newborn 2.0 (0.4)

1-6 months: 2.2 (0.5)

7-12 months: 2.5 (0.5)

13-18 months: 2.5 (0.6)

19-24 months: 2.5 (0.4)

25-30 months: 2.6 (0.6)

**Outer Canthal Distances in Centimeters by Age: Mean (2SD)**

Premature newborn 5.8 (0.7)

Full-term newborn 7.0 (0.8)

1-6 months: 7.5 (1.0)

7-12 months: 7.8 (1.4)

13-18 months:  8.5 (1.0)

19-24 months: 8.2 (1.0)

25-30 months: 8.6 (1.1)

Evaluation of a patient with hypertelorism, or pseudohypertelorism is not complete without a full head to toe for dysmorphology exam. Exam findings may offer clues to an underlying syndromic diagnosis. A complete dysmorphic exam may include the following evaluation, adapted from Smith.

- 
**Craniofacial**

- Flat or prominent nasal bridge

- Small mandible

- Flat or prominent occiput

- Metopic ridge Low-set ears

- Large posterior fontanelle

- Malar hypoplasia

- Anteverted nose

- 
**Ears**

- Preauricular tags or sinus

- Large or small ears

- Asymmetric size

- Posterior rotation

- Lack of usual fold of helix

- 
**Mouth**

- Bifid uvula

- High-arched palate

- Wide alveolar ridges

- Large tongue

- Thin upper lip

- Flat philtrum

- 
**Eyes**

- Synophrys

- Epicanthal folds

- Hypo- and hypertelorism

**Skin/hair**

- Low hairline

- Frontal upsweep/aberrant hair whorl

Following classification is used based on inner canthal distance for hypertelorism in adults:

Tessier Classification

1st degree 30 – 34 mm ICD

2nd degree 35 – 40 mm ICD

3rd degree > 40 mm ICD

CT scan classification "Munro" based on the orientation of orbital walls :

Type I - parallel medial orbital walls more common

Type II - wedge-shaped posteriorly

Type III - oval widest dimension

Type IV - wedge-shaped anteriorly post to globe; difficult to correct
