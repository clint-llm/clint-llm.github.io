Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infection is usually self-limited. More toxic presentations, including septic syndromes or severe dehydration, may require hospitalization. General supportive care is needed.

Though antibiotics are not required for a mild illness, serious manifestations like sepsis occurring in a patient with immunosuppression or chronic liver disease warrant the usage of antibiotics.

The fluoroquinolone group of drugs was found to be the most effective in the treatment of Y. pseudotuberculosis as per in-vitro and in-vivo murine studies. Antibiotics belonging to other classes were unable to inhibit the bacterial growth to a significant extent as compared to fluoroquinolones.Y. pseudotuberculosis and its complications following previously documented case reports.

Exploratory laparotomy may be warranted in patients with complications such as severe GI bleeding, and intestinal obstruction. However, this intervention is not common.
