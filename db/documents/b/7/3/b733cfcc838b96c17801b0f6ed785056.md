The syndrome of headache with neurological deficits and elevated CSF lymphocytes (HaNDL) is a rare, benign, and self-limiting condition. It is predominant in young adults and characteristically present with migraine-like headaches, transient neurologic deficits such as hemiparesis, hemiparesthesia, and dysphagia, and lymphocytic pleocytosis in the CSF. This syndrome is grossly underrecognized and underreported.
