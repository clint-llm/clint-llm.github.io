The frontal scalp swelling with edema is caused by underlying osteomyelitis of the frontal bone with an associated subperiosteal abscess, which, if not treated, leads to severe complications.

- **Hematogenous spread**:

- **Direct extension**:

The development of the subperiosteal abscess can be explained with the pneumatization process of the frontal and ethmoid sinuses. This process allows sinus mucosa communication with trabecular bone by a local venous system favoring the development of osteomyelitis.

Morphological anomalies during the pneumatization process, such as overpneumatized ethmoid bullae, extensively pneumatized middle turbinate, or enlargement of agger nasi cells may lead to frontal sinus obstruction by the anatomical anomalies or inflamed mucosa leading to dysfunction of the normal ciliary action and stagnation of mucus resulting in an anaerobic environment that stimulates bacterial growth.
