Treatment is predominantly symptomatic and depends on the patientâ€™s age and presentation. Infants should be monitored in the intensive care setting to manage dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and cutaneous superinfection. Sepsis treatment should be with broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics. Topical emollients and protective padding should be used for skin protection and to heal denuded areas.

The goal of therapy in children and adults is a reduction in hyperkeratosis. Topical emollients and keratolytic agents containing glycerin, lactic acid, urea, and a-hydroxy acids have demonstrated improvement in hyperkeratosis but are often not well tolerated due to burning and stinging. Clinicians should avoid widespread use of higher concentration salicylic acid topical preparations because of the risk of systemic salicylism.
