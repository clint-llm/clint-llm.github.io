Facial rejuvenation techniques have increased in number and complexity over the past several decades, with demand for these procedures steadily increasing since the early twentieth century. Since 2016, rhytidectomy (facelift) has been in the top five most commonly performed cosmetic surgical procedures in the United States, along with breast augmentation, blepharoplasty, liposuction, and rhinoplasty. Patients request facelifting because, with advancing age, loss of collagen decreases skin turgor and chronic sunlight exposure contributes to decreased skin elasticity. In the third to fourth decades of life, soft tissue brow descent begins, with buccal fat pad descent and atrophy, as well as resorption of facial bone occurring in the sixth to seventh decades of life and beyond.

Patients desiring improvement in skin smoothness and jaw contour and those with unilateral flaccid facial palsy may benefit from facelifting. For less invasive rhytidectomy techniques, such as superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) plication approaches, ideal patients are thin and possess mild to moderate skin laxity and jowling without major ptosis of the malar fat pads or deep nasolabial folds. Thicker-skinned and overweight patients tend toÂ have less than optimal clinical outcomes with these more conservative procedures.

The SMAS plication facelifting technique evolved to provide an effective means of suspending the soft tissues of the face beyond simply tightening the skin. Developed by Swedish plastic surgeon Tord Skoog in the 1970s, it has become increasingly popular as a facial rejuvenation option.
