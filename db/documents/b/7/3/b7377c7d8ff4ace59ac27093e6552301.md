HPNS is a significant limitation for deep dives.

**Reduction of the Speed of Compression**

Slowing the overall speed of compression or inserting stops during compression to allow for acclimatization can improve or even prevent the symptoms of HPNS.

**Modification in the Breathing Gas Mixture**

Nitrogen has been used to oppose some of the HPNS symptoms due to its narcotic effect.

**Drugs**

In general, there is no pharmacologic treatment for HPNS although anesthetics, barbiturates, and anticonvulsants have been studied to prevent the clinical manifestations of HPNS.

**Diver Selection**

Selecting the least susceptible diver may be another solution.

Some issues have been discussed in controlling HPNS. First, these approaches may be effective only in some manifestations. This may create a new problem where the first signs of HPNS may be more severe. Secondly, delaying the development of HPNS in baboons may cause new symptoms which can involve brain damage. Finally, there might be a risk of symptom-free development of pressure-related tissue injury, which may cause long-term injuries.
