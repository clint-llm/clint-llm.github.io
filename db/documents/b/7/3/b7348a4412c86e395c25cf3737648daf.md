Nummular dermatitis is a clinical diagnosis based on its classical presentation of pruritic coin-shaped erythematous and eczematous plaques symmetrically distributed in a person with diffusely dry skin. A dermoscopic evaluation may assist with the diagnosis; other laboratory tests are not generally necessary.
