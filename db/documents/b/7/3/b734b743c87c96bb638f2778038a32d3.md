Genitourinary syndrome of menopause, a group of chronic, progressive, hypoestrogenic conditions, includes vulvovaginal atrophy, atrophic vaginitis, and bladder and urethral dysfunctions. Urogenital tissues, derived from similar embryologic tissues, develop and mature in response to estrogen. In hypoestrogenic states, these tissues undergo physiologic change. Atrophic vaginal changes are caused by thinning vaginal epithelium, decreased vaginal rugae and elasticity, and decreased vaginal secretions. Atrophic vaginitis is a symptomatic inflammatory process involving the thinned vaginal epithelium affecting some pre-menopausal and up to 50% of post-menopausal women.
