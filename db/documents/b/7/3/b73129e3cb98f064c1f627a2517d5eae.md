Microcystic adnexal carcinoma (MAC) is a rare cutaneous neoplasm of follicular and sweat gland differentiation. The locally aggressive nature and deep infiltration make complete excision of the tumor with margin control a crucial part of management. In contrast, MAC is reported to have a relatively high recurrence rate with standard-wide local excision (60% in some case series). More favorable cure rates with lower recurrence rates are reported with Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS). This activity reviews the clinical diagnosis and treatment of microcystic adnexal carcinoma and highlights the critical role of early diagnosis and treatment.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the clinical presentation of a patient with microcystic adnexal carcinoma.
- Explain the common physical exam findings and histopathologic findings of microcystic adnexal carcinoma.
- Describe the importance of early diagnosis with an appropriate biopsy technique.
- Summarize Mohs micrographic surgery's role in the management of microcystic adnexal carcinoma.
