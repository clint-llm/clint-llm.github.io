Acute traumatic facial palsy is best managed by an interprofessional team, ideally coordinated by a plastic or facial plastic surgeon familiar with emergent, acute, and long-term surgical options and medical management. Because other early interventions may include electrodiagnostic testing and corneal surface evaluation, the inclusion of a neurologist or electrophysiologist and an ophthalmologist or optometrist on the team is essential. In the case of temporal bone fractures, particularly with other sequelae like cerebrospinal fluid leak and hearing loss, a neurosurgeon and/or a neurotologist may be needed. The interprofessional team may also require a speech therapist or physical therapist in the long term to support the patient's rehabilitation of facial function, and a behavioral health specialist may be necessary to manage the patient's reaction and adjustment to facial paralysis from the immediate post-injury period for months to years afterward.
