TSH is a peptide hormone produced by the anterior pituitary. It consists of two chains: an alpha chain and a beta chain. It has a molecular mass of approximately 28,000 Da. The composition is very similar to other glycoprotein hormones made by the anterior pituitary. Luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) very much resemble TSH. Specifically, they all have the same alpha subunit as TSH, but different beta chains that confer biological specificity. Since TSH, LH, FSH, and HCG share the same alpha subunit, they all function through the same cyclic adenine monophosphate (cAMP) second messenger system. The cAMP second messenger system entails adenine monophosphate (AMP) conversion to cAMP. In addition to cAMP, TSH also activates the IP3 signaling cascade. The IP3 second messenger system involves calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Both cAMP and IP3/Ca2+ cascades lead to downstream physiological effects that enhance thyroid hormone synthesis and thyroid gland growth.
