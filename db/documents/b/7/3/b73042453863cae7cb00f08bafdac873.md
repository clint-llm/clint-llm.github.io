In regards to a THA (total hip arthroplasty), there are certain internervous planes that a surgeon dissects through in order to visualize the ball and socket joint of the hip. There are multiple approaches to the hip for a THA, but the anterior and anterolateral approaches of the hip directly involve the fascia lata and the TFL. With the anterior approach to a THA, the TFL and its associated fascia lata are retracted laterally to increase exposure to the hip joint. This lateral retraction allows for the TFL to maintain its abduction abilities without injury to the muscle. The anterolateral approach violates the patient's abductor mechanism to dissect down to the hip joint. The TFL and fascia lata is retracted anteriorly in this approach to avoid any injury to this structure.

The lateral intermuscular septum formed by the fascia lata is of surgical importance as it offers an internervous plane that is needed for dissection to obtain a wide exposure of the femur. This lateral septum allows separation of thigh musculature that is innervated by the sciatic nerve and the femoral nerve.

The fascia lata is widely used in surgery for several reasons, from the repair of the dura mater to the reconstruction of the brachial triceps tendon, as well as the repair of the Achilles tendon to the use for a surgical facial reanimation. The fascia lata is an extremely malleable fabric for multiple surgical purposes.
