Infantile botulism is caused by Clostridium botulinum, which is an anaerobic spore-forming, gram-positive bacillus. It can be found in the soil, water, and air with a lethal toxin dosage as low as 1 mcg/kg. Botulism infection can occur in five different ways. This activity reviews the causes, pathophysiology, and presentation of infantile botulism and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the presentation of infantile botulism.
- Outline ways in which infantile botulism can be acquired.
- Summarize the treatment of infantile botulism. 
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by infantile botulism.
