In the hospital setting, exposure to infectious blood and body fluids with subsequent risk of infection remains a major concern for health care workers. Health care workers in contact with blood, body fluids, or who perform invasive medical procedures are particularly at risk.

Bloodborne pathogen transmission risk can be minimized or reduced by strict adherence to the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens Standard. OSHAâ€™s Bloodborne Pathogens Standard applies to and protects workers who are at risk of exposure. Specifically, this standard is a regulatory guide that includes provisions for employers for post-exposure control, engineering and work practice controls, immunization schedules, and mandates for communication, employee training, and documentation. Both employers and health care workers should know the key elements and approaches to infection control to minimize the risks associated with exposure to bloodborne pathogens.
