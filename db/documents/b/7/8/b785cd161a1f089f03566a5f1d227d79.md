The diagnosis and management of GAS are optimized with an interprofessional team that can include a primary care provider, emergency department physician, otolaryngologist, nurse practitioner, infectious disease consultant, and an internist. The goal of treatment for GAS is to lower the patient’s duration and severity of symptoms, preventing acute and delayed complications, and preventing the spread of infection to others. The outcome of patients treated promptly with antibiotics is excellent, with recovery in a few days. It is important to educate the patient on proper hand hygiene to prevent the spread of infection to others. Patients should be informed that there is a small risk of developing glomerulonephritis or rheumatic fever.
