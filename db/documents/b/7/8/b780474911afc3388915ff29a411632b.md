The principle presenting symptoms are a weakness in glenohumeral abduction with or without numbness to the lateral shoulder area. Patients may also present with weakness in glenohumeral external rotation; however, this may not be apparent due to the ability of the infraspinatus. In patients presenting after dislocation or fracture, signs of trauma will be evident on physical exam. During external rotation and abduction, one may note the weakness of the deltoid and teres minor muscles.

Nevertheless, patients may not report muscle weakness or paresthesia due to acute pain and limited range of motion.
