Substernal goiter is defined as thyroid tissue in the thoracic cavity and is caused by an enlarging thyroid gland passing through the thoracic inlet. Substernal goiter can be diagnosed incidentally during an unrelated imaging test. Patients may be asymptomatic or symptomatic. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of substernal goiter and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with substernal goiter.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the presentation of a patient with substernal goiter.
- Review imaging findings for patients with substernal goiter.
- Outline management options for patients with substernal goiter.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to ensure the appropriate selection of candidates for surgery and appropriate type of surgery for patients with substernal goiter.
