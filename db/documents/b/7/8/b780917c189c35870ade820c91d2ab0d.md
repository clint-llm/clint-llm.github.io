Talocalcaneal coalition or peroneal spastic foot or subtalar coalition is an anomalous connection between the talus and the calcaneum that can present with painful and rigid flat-foot in older children and adolescents. The talocalcaneal coalition is part of a spectrum of tarsal coalitions that causes rigid flat foot. The talocalcaneal coalition can be fibrous, cartilaginous, or bony. Although the anomaly is present at birth, it becomes symptomatic only when the abnormal fibrous connection matures into a stiff cartilaginous bar, which later ossifies to become a rigid bar. This activity will discuss the epidemiology, the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of the condition, and also highlights the critical role of the an interprofessional team in managing this complex problem.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of a talocalcaneal coalition.
- Outline the varied presentation of a patient of the talocalcaneal coalition in the clinic and describe the typical imaging findings. 
- Review the non-operative and operative treatment options for the talocalcaneal coalition.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and coordination among the an interprofessional team that can enhance patient outcomes for patients with a talocalcaneal coalition.
