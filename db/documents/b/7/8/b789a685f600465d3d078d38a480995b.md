A complete history and physical examination are crucial in the diagnosis of these patients.Â Some of the more common etiologies with similar presentations include atherosclerotic mesenteric ischemia, infections, malignancies, adverse medication effects, and other vessel occlusive processes. In patients with a known diagnosis of vasculitis who present with abdominal symptoms, the approach should be ruling out other causes and then focusing on treating the underlying vasculitic disorder. The diagnosis is more challenging in patients without an established diagnosis of vasculitis. Symptomatology suggesting the involvement of other organ systems or symptoms of bowel ischemia in patients without the risk factor profile of atherosclerosis should prompt investigations on the lines of mesenteric vasculitis.
