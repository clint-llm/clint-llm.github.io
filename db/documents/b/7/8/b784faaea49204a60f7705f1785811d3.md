Dermatofibromas are slow-growing lesions that can affect any part of the body but have a predilection for the extremities. Clinically these lesions are firm, non-tender cutaneous nodules, with or without overlying skin changes (such as tan-pink to reddish-brown discoloration, depending on the age of the lesion) with a smooth surface. Dermoscopic evaluation of these lesions will most commonly exhibit a central white patch with a peripheral pigmented network. Dermatofibromas are usually less than or equal to one centimeter in diameter. Patients are usually asymptomatic but will relate a history of local trauma at the site of the lesion, such as vaccination or an insect bite in approximately one out of five cases. A thorough full-body skin exam is important as these lesions may be subtle and are multiple in 10% of cases. The “dimple sign” is a characteristic finding where lateral inward digital pressure of the skin produces a central dimpling over the lesion.
