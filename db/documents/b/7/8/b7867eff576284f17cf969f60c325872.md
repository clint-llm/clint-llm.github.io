**1. Ultrasound examination:**Tracing the nerve starting from the psoas major border is difficultÂ because of the small size of the nerve and the depth of the nerve, especially in obese patients. It is easy to trace the nerve at the iliac crest down to the superficial inguinal ring and see the cause of the entrapment (for example, the scar of surgery). An ultrasound-guided block can confirm a diagnosis of the ilioinguinal neuralgia.

**2. Electrophysiologic studies:**The benefit of the electrophysiologic examination for the diagnosis of the ilioinguinal nerve injury is questionable. Electrophysiologic studies are more directed to exclude lumbar radiculopathy and plexopathy.

**3. Magnetic resonance imaging:**performed on the lumbosacral spine to exclude lumbar radiculopathies.

4. A common method of confirming the diagnosis is by infiltrating the area with a local anesthetic and determining if the patient has relief from pain.
