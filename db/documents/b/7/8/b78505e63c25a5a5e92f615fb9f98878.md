The primary blood supply for the peripheral vestibular system is the labyrinthine artery, which comes from the anterior inferior cerebellar artery. The utricle, small part of the saccule, and superior and horizontal semicircular canals receive supply by the superior vestibular artery, which bifurcates with the anterior inferior cerebellar artery. The cochlea, rest of the saccule, and most of the posterior semicircular canal get supplied by bifurcation of the common cochlear artery. The superior vein drains the horizontal and superior semicircular canal and utricle. The inferior vein is responsible for draining the posterior semicircular canals and saccule.
