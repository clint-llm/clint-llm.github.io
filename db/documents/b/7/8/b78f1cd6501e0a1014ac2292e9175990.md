Oral ingestion of antihistamines is the primary cause of toxicity. Anticholinergic drugs act by competitively inhibiting the binding of acetylcholine to muscarinic receptors, hence the term antimuscarinic. Within two hours of ingestion, the peak serum concentration is reached, and the maximum antihistaminic effect occurs several hours later. Outside of ingestion, there are some rare incidences of topical exposure causing anticholinergic toxicity. With the peak therapeutic concentration being 0.06 mg/L, many patients with anticholinergic symptoms will have concentrations above the therapeutic levels. Antihistamines, in general, are highly lipid-soluble, with approximately 98% binding to a protein and their volume of distribution ranging from 0.5-30 L/kg. The metabolism of antihistamines is mainly via the hepatic route, except for fexofenadine, levocetirizine, and cetirizine, which are renally excreted and eliminated.
