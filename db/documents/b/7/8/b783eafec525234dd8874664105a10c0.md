The differential diagnosis for unilateral low lung volume on thoracic imaging include:

- Scimitar syndrome: Hypoplasia of the right lung with anomalous venous drainage of the right lung to the inferior vena cava.

- Congenital pulmonary airway malformation: Cystic structure arising from the trachea or bronchi with mediastinal shift to the opposite side.

- Bronchopulmonary sequestration: Absent connection of the sequestrated segment to the tracheobronchial tree and blood supply is from the systemic artery instead of the pulmonary circulation. The mediastinal shift is to the affected side.

- Congenital lobar emphysema: Hyperinflation of the involved pulmonary lobe with mediastinal shift to the contralateral lung.

- Swyer James or Macleod syndrome: Post-infectious bronchiolitis leading to hyperlucent lung.

- Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN).
