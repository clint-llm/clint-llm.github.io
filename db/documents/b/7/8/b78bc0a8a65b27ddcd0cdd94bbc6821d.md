Signs and symptoms may initially be nonspecific and may not prompt evaluation in a sick patient with metastatic cancer. Of note, a minority of patients may be diagnosed incidentally and may be asymptomatic at diagnosis. However, some signs and symptoms may indicate the location of the involvement.

A wide range of signs and symptoms have been reported, including but not limited to the following:

**Cerebral:**headache, confusion, cognitive impairment, psychiatric disorders, seizures.

**Posterior fossa:**cranial nerve (CN) deficits, especially CN VI, VII, and VIII (diplopia, facial weakness, hearing loss), ataxia.

**Vascular:**ischemia and infarction.

**Spinal cord:**limb weakness, dermatomal sensory loss, radicular pain, bladder, and bowel dysfunction.

**Inflammatory reactions:**Tumor cells may lead to inflammatory reactions and disrupt CSF flow causing obstructive or communicating hydrocephalus and presenting as nausea, vomiting, positional headaches, and somnolence.
