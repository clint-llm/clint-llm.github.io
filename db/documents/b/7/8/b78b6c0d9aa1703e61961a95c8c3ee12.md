The differential diagnosis of breast cysts includes a wide variety of both benign and malignant disease processes. Larger papillomas can be seen within a cystic structure, which is essentially a very dilated duct and can be confused for a complex cyst. Papillomas do not carry an increased risk of breast cancer. An abscess can also present similar to a cyst. However, due to the infectious nature, it is a very different etiology than the simple cyst. While phyllodes tumors are typically solid, they can have cystic components which can confuse the diagnosis. Radial scars as well can have microcystic components.

It is very rare to have an intracystic carcinoma, with some studies reporting them making up less than 0.1% of all breast malignancies. A study by Rosemond reported that only three cancers were identified in more than 3000 cysts aspirated and studied. ACC, or adenoid cystic carcinoma, is actually derived from a salivary gland tumor and can occur in the breast. It accounts for 0.1 to 1% of all breast malignancies. While the malignancy is triple-negative and has a high recurrence rate, it very rarely metastasizes or travels to surrounding lymph nodes. Because of this, ACC has an excellent survival rate provided that the cancer is low-grade.
