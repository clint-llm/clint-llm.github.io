**Visual Acuity Testing**

Snellen's distant uncorrected and best-corrected visual acuity assessment will document the visual potential. The near visual acuity must be separately tested with Snellen's chart or jaeger's chart. The visual acuity should be tested in an undilated state because the visual acuity may improve in the dilated state in the posterior subcapsular cataract. In the case of a mature and brown cataract with visual acuity of hand motion or less, the perception of light and projection of rays should be documented to assess the visual potential of the eye.

**Refraction**

Careful retinoscopy and refraction must be performed for all the patients requiring cataract surgery. Refraction is necessary to know the required IOL power and assess if any myopic shift has occurred postoperatively. If the other eye lens is clear and has high refractive error, targeting emmetropia may result in the problem of postoperative anisometropia. In such scenarios, the patient should be explained the need for refractive surgery or the use of a contact lens.

**Glare Testing**

Glare testing help to assess the degree of the visual impairment of a patient with the use of a light source located in the visual field.****

**Contrast Sensitivity Testing**

Contrast sensitivity may be diminished even in patients with Snellen visual acuity of 6/6. Contrast sensitivity can be tested with various specialized charts available.

**IOL Biometry**

**Conventional SRK Formula**

**P=A-2.5L-0.9K**

where

- P= power of the lens in dioptres

- L= Axial length in mm

- K- Average keratometry reading in dioptres

- A – Constant of implant

Recently available biometry instruments are IOL master 500 and 700 to determine the IOL power.

The other available biometry formulas are Hoffer Q which is more suitable for short axial lengths, while SRK/T and Haigis formula for longer axial lengths. The recently introduced 4th generation formulas like Holladay 2, Haigis, Barrett, True-K and Olsen and Hill-RBF. Many surgeons use multiple formulas to finalize the final IOL power. The American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons (ASCRS) also provides an open free IOL power calculator online for the benefit of surgeons.

**Special Tests**

**Potential Acuity Meter**

This method can assess vision loss due to cataractous changes. This method is helpful in patients with visual acuity of more than 6/60 without any ocular pathology. In this test, the patient is told to read the brightly illuminated near card through a pinhole. The other available meter is the Retinal Acuity Meter. In some cases, PAM can be misleading with pre-existing pathologies like age-related macular degeneration, amblyopia, secondary glaucoma, macular pathologies like scar and edema, and retinal detachment.

**Visual Field Evaluation**

It is imperative to screen visual fields with confrontation testing in all patients planned for cataract surgery. The visual field evaluation is not mandatory in all patients. Visual field testing is indicated in patients with pre-existing glaucoma, optic nerve abnormality, or retinal pathology. This testing modality can pick up early field loss and vision loss due to abnormalities other than cataracts. Filed loss induced due to cataract improves after cataract removal.

**Specular Microscopy**

A clinical picture of cornea guttae (Fuch dystrophy) in a cataract patient mandates specular microscopy to assess the endothelial status. The other indications for specular microscopy can be endothelial dystrophies, trauma, previous intraocular surgery, and patients planned for combined surgery like DSEK with cataract extraction. This helps in counseling the patients regarding the risk of corneal decompensation. Cataract surgery results in endothelial cell loss. Hence patients with low endothelial cell count should be operated on with soft shell technique under guarded prognosis.

**Pachymetry**

Pachymetry is an indirect way to assess the corneal endothelial status. Patients with a higher central corneal thickness of more than 640 um are at increased risk of corneal decompensation.

**Macular Function Tests**

Optical coherence tomography helps assess macular statuses like edema, holes, vitreomacular traction, and adhesions. Various surgeons are increasingly using it before putting the patients for cataract surgery.
