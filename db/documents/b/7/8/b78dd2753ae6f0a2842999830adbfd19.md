The nurse, pharmacist, and physician all have an important role to play when it comes to anticoagulation. An under therapeutic dose may mean a stroke or an embolus but a high dose may lead to bleeding complications. To avoid these issues, all healthcare workers who prescribe anticoagulants need to educate the patient and the family.

The interprofessional team can include specialist physicians, primary care providers, hospitalists, nurse practitioners, specialty care nurses, and pharmacists. Anticoagulation and cardiac nurse specialists are involved in patient monitoring, patient and family education, and feedback to the team. Pharmacists should evaluate drugs prescribed, drug-drug interactions, and educate patients. [Level V]

**Patient Education**

- Education of patients on oral anticoagulants is vital for the prevention of adverse complications. The following should be told to the patient at the time of initiating treatment.

- Teach the patient about the oral anticoagulant, how they work and what they do in the body.

- Teach about dosing and the need for compliance

- Teach about not initiating therapy with other drugs (prescribed or over the counter) without first speaking to the healthcare provider- this may help prevent adverse drug reactions

- Remind patients that they should have close follow up

- If the patient is unable to afford the drug, then compliance can decrease. Hence support services must be provided to the patient so that he or she does not forego treatment

- Teach about dietary factors that can interfere with the actions of warfarin

- Develop a case management service that sees all patients on oral anticoagulants who are not able to pay for their medications

- At discharge remind the patient of the need for testing and follow up

- Start teaching several days before discharge so that the patient has ample time to ask questions.

- Inform the patient about the signs of oral anticoagulant toxicity such as bleeding, skin hemorrhage, bleeding per rectum, headache, weakness, etc.

**The Pharmacist and Monitoring of Adverse Drug Events**

- The use of oral anticoagulants should be monitored for adverse drug events. When an error occurs, there should be an investigation and the data should be shared with other healthcare workers to create awareness of the issues that surround oral anticoagulants.

- All near misses and harmful events need to be reported, documented so that one can help identify the source of the error and develop means to prevent it from happening again

- Develop triggers for adverse drug events like an INR of 5, a sudden drop in renal function, bleeding, hypercoagulable state to help monitor patients.

- Develop a reporting system when reversal agents like protein and vitamin K are used. This can help develop additional triggers that can be used to monitor patients.

**Evidence-based Outcomes**

The prognosis of patients who are bleeding following the use of oral anticoagulants depends on the comorbidity, age, and level of INR. Fatalities are not uncommon if the patient develops an intracranial bleed. If the bleeding is minor from the mucous membranes, hematuria, epistaxis or ecchymoses, recovery is common with few complications. However, if the bleeding is severe, it can result in catastrophic gastrointestinal or intracranial hemorrhage. Others may develop hemorrhage in the pleural, pericardial, and abdominal cavity.

For those who develop prosthetic valve thrombosis, the prognosis is guarded. If thrombolytic therapy fails to dissolve the thrombus, emergent valve replacement surgery is required- which also carries significant morbidity.
