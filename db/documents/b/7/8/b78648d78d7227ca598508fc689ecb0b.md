**Sphenoid Sinusitis:**

The sphenoid sinuses can become infected, resulting in acute and chronic sinusitis. It is relatively uncommon for the sphenoid sinuses to be involved in isolation, usually occurring along with frontal and ethmoidal sinusitis. Symptoms will include fever, weakness, and a post-nasal drip. If not treated promptly, it can result in such devastating complications as meningitis, brain abscess, and involvement of cranial nerves.

**Sphenoid Fractures:**

Fractures of the sphenoid occur in cases of trauma to the orbit or the base of the skull. These fractures may present with multiple neurological sequelae as the sphenoid is closely associated with numerous nerves that pass through it. Loss of vision and ocular damage is closely related to these fractures. Signs and symptoms include Battle sign, hemotympanum, and cranial nerve palsies, among others.

**Sphenoid wing dysplasia:**

Sphenoid wing dysplasia in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 may result in challenging and significant changes, including, ultimately, vision loss.
