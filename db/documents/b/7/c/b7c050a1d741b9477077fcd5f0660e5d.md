A thorough understanding of the patient’s medical history and state of health is needed before the transfusion is started. Vital signs are monitored and typically recorded at 15-minute intervals. A small amount of change in vital signs during transfusion may be considered “normal.”  These changes may include the following: plus or minus 0.5 C in temperature, plus or minus 5 respirations per minute, plus or minus 10 beats per minute in heart rate, and plus or minus 20 mm Hg in blood pressure.  It is important to note that changes greater than these parameters do not mean that there is a transfusion reaction, it suggests that the bedside nurse should be extra vigilant in monitoring for a reaction. Abnormal responses include hives, itching, fever greater than 1 C above the temperature at the start of transfusion, chills, hypotension, and dyspnea.
