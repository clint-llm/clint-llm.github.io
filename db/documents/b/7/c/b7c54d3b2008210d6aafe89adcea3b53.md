Initial management strategies aim to reduce cardiac ischemia and prevent death. Oxygen, aspirin, and nitrates are administered based on initial concern for ACS and prior to a definitive diagnosis. Subsequent treatment depends on confirmation of diagnosis or a high index of suspicion with or without a definitive diagnosis.

Oxygen was previously recommended for all patients presenting with concern for ACS, but newer data suggests this strategy may be harmful in patients who otherwise do not warrant supplemental oxygen. Supplemental oxygen is now recommended in patients with oxygen saturation less than 90%, those with respiratory distress, or when high-risk features of hypoxemia are present.

Chewable, non-coated, aspirin 324 mg should be given to all patients who present with concern for ACS unless otherwise contraindicated.  Patients who cannot take aspirin may be given prasugrel 60 mg PO.

Patients with ongoing symptoms should receive 0.4 mg sublingual nitroglycerin every 5 minutes for up to three doses or until the pain is relieved, unless otherwise contraindicated. Contraindications include the recent use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors and hypotension. Nitrates should be used with extreme caution in patients with concerns for right-sided infarction. Continuous intravenous nitroglycerin should be considered in patients with persistent signs of heart failure or hypertension.

Many patients will present with concern for ACS but will not have positive findings of ischemic ECG changes or positive troponin on initial workup. These patients may be observed with serial ECG and troponin measurements every 3 to 6 hours. Patients also may undergo provocative testing such as the treadmill stress test or myocardial perfusion imaging prior to discharge or within 72 hours. Low-risk patients often may be discharged with a referral for further outpatient testing after initial ACS is ruled out.

In patients where NSTEMI has been definitively diagnosed or is highly likely, anticoagulation should be initiated. Protocols will vary by institution, so cardiology consultation should be obtained if readily available. This is especially true when there is the possibility of percutaneous intervention, as this may change anticoagulation strategies. Unfractionated heparin with bolus dosing and a continuous infusion is commonly used, with most institutions having protocols available. Other strategies may include the use of enoxaparin, bivalirudin, fondaparinux, and dual antiplatelet therapies. Fibrinolytic therapies should not be used in NSTEMI.

When NSTEMI has been diagnosed, patients should be admitted to cardiac care units for further management. Beta-blocker therapy should be started within 24 hours after the presentation in patients who do not have a contraindication. Contraindications include signs of heart failure, hypotension, heart conduction block, or reactive airway disease. Unless otherwise contraindicated, ACE Inhibitors should be initiated in patients with an ejection fraction less than 40%, hypertension, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease. High-dose statins should be initiated for cholesterol management. Invasive and non-invasive testing strategies are employed. Both early intervention strategies with diagnostic angiography and intervention are applied as indicated, and conservative medical management strategies are employed. The rationale for choosing one strategy over the other is often patient and institution-specific and beyond the scope of this review.
