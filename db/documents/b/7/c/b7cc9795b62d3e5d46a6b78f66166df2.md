Acute bacterial parotitis is uncommon, has a similar male-female ratio, but is more common in the elderly, and accounts for an estimated 0.01 to 0.02% of hospital admissions and occurs in 0.002 to 0.04% of postoperative patients.

Chronic parotitis occurs equally in males and females. Sjogren syndrome is nine times more common in women than men, whereas recurrent parotitis of childhood is more common in males. Sarcoidosis is most common in African American adults with onset in the 20 to 40-year age range.

Parotitis occurs with equal frequency in all races. However, Benaim et al. conducted a retrospective study which observed that in a pediatric hospital, juvenile recurrent parotitis was observed more commonly in Black males aged 2 to 8 years.
