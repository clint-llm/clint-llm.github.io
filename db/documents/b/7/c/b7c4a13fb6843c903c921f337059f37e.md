Complaints can vary from mild to moderate severity and with early symptoms of soreness at the base of the thumb close to the MCP joint. Progression of symptoms includes pain and stiffness when flexing the thumb, swelling, or a tender lump on the head of the metacarpal on the palmar side of the hand. Locking of the thumb in the flexed position can be seen in severe cases. The patient must gently straighten the thumb with the help of their other hand. When the thumb releases from the locked position, there can be a snapping or popping sensation. Other complaints include the inability to extend the thumb fully.

On examination, patients are tender at the MCP joint and are reluctant to allow the examiner to extend the digit. A popping sensation is felt with an observed snap into extension. Trigger thumb can be classified based on Quinnell grading system for flexion and extension.
