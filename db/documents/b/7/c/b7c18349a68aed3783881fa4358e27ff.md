HypoalphalipoproteinemiaÂ is a deficiency of high-density lipoprotein. These diseases correlate with a mild increase in triglycerides and are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Defects in the lipid pathways that lead to hypoalphalipoproteinemia included problems with APOA1, ABCA1 (Tangier disease), and LCAT (Fish Eye Disease). In Tangier disease, functional mutations in ABCA1 reduce the ability of ABCA1 to lipidate newly secreted Apo-AI in the liver and intestines, leading to rapid catabolism and clearance of Apo-A1 and low HDL levels. In mice, an 80% reduction in HDL occurs with ABCA1 knockout in the liver, and a 30% reduction in HDL occurs with ABCA1 knockout in the intestines. In Fish Eye Disease, LCAT deficiency leads to reduced HDL cholesterol and Apo-AI levels, resulting in a higher percentage of small HDL particles but an overall reduction in the level of HDL. In CETP deficiency, humans have high HDL cholesterol levels and large HDL particles. Here, CETP if not able to exchange cholesterol for triglycerides between HDL and VLDL and LDL, leading to the reduced breakdown of HDL and increased HDL size.

Elevated HDL levels are associated with a decreased risk of coronary heart disease and are thought to play a role in predicting cardiovascular risk. However, cholesterol ester transfer protein deficiency, primary familial hyperalphalipoproteinemia, and endothelial lipase deficiency result in extremely high levels of HDL, which may mitigate the protective effects and even, paradoxically, increase cardiovascular risk.

Studies are ongoing on the relationship between HDL and cardiovascular risk as mixed reports have been reported. One study reported a 22% decreased in cardiovascular risk with each 15 mg/dl increase in HDL. However, CETP inhibitors, which can increase HDL levels by 100%, lead to a 60% increase in cardiovascular events.
