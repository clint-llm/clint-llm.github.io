Ramipril is an ACE inhibitor that is used for several indications. These include hypertension, prevention of heart failure progression post-myocardial infarction (MI). It is also used to reduce the risk of MI, stroke, and death in patients more than 55 years old with a high risk of atherosclerotic disease and major adverse cardiac events. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring of ramipril which will help members of the interprofessional team manage patients with hypertension and cardiovascular disease.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of ramipril.
- Summarize the various indications for initiating therapy with ramipril.
- Outline the potential adverse event profile associated with ramipril.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients who can benefit from therapy with ramipril.
