The nerve block is performed in the following steps:

- Place the ultrasound probe on the ventral fold of the ankle in a transverse orientation of the leg about 1 to 2 cm proximal to the level of the medial and lateral malleoli

- Identify the anterior tibial artery and track along both distally and proximally to ensure this is the correct vessel

- The deep peroneal nerve will be the white honeycomb-like structure lying lateral next to the anterior tibial artery

- Insert your needle in-plane and parallel to the probe surface

- Advance your needle until it is just superficial to the deep peroneal nerve, making sure you always visualize your needle tip as you advance

- Aspirate the syringe to ensure you are not in a vessel

- Inject 1 to 2 mL of local anesthetic while visualizing the spread of the fluid around the nerve

- Repeat steps 1 to 7 with slight adjustments to the needle to coat the entire nerve until you achieve a satisfactory level of anesthesia
