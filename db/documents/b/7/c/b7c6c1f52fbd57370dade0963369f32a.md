Accurate demographics and disease prevalence are unclear due to previous underreporting and under-diagnosis. Estimates range from 5% to 70% with more recent data suggesting a prevalence of 20% to 35%.

A rare form of the disease, termed juvenile cystic adenomyosis, is characterized by more extensive hemorrhage within myometrial cysts and is typically seen in women younger than 30. Symptoms are typically refractory to medical therapy and require surgery, either myomectomy or hysterectomy.

Risk factors for adenomyosis include conditions leading to increased estrogen exposure (increased parity, early menarche, short menstrual cycles, elevated body mass index, oral contraceptive pill use, tamoxifen use) and prior uterine surgery (dilation and curettage, cesarean section, myomectomy, etc.).
