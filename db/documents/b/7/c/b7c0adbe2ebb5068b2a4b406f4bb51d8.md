Development of the skeletal muscles comes from the mesoderm, one of the 3 germ layers. In the fourth to eighth weeks, the paraxial mesoderm is organized alongside the neural tube in blocks of tissue called somites. The somites have 2 subpopulations of cells:Â the dorsolateral dermomyotome and the ventromedial sclerotome. The dermomyotome goes onto form the skeletal muscle. The sclerotome forms the axial skeleton at this level. Within the dermatomyotome, the anterior muscles of the embryo are formed from the hypomere cells.
