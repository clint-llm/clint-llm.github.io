Chlorine gas poisoning is usually self-limited and mostly requires supportive treatment. Physicians and other health professionals, including nurses, EMS workers, and physician assistants, can play a vital role in educating the patient on the prevention of a future episode in household cases of accidental exposure resulting from mixing chlorine/bleach with other cleaning products. Although rare, if the poisoning was because of a suicide attempt, evaluation by a mental health professional should proceed discharge. An interprofessional team approach to decontamination and treatment is required for best patient outcomes. Specialty care nurses in emergency, prehospital, and flight are involved in triage, patient monitoring, and patient education. They monitor and provide updates to the team. Pharmacists review prescribed medication and drug-drug interactions. [Level V]
