The etiology for transposition of the great arteries is unknown; however, it is presumed to be multifactorial. Currently, there are two main theories regarding the embryological mechanisms of TGA development:

- De la Cruz proposed the theory that the aortopulmonary septum fails to spiral at the level of the infundibulum thus causing a linear development of the septum and TGA.

- The second theory, proposed by Goor and Edwards, suggests that TGA is caused by abnormal resorption or underdevelopment of the subpulmonary conus, with persistence of the subaortic conus.
