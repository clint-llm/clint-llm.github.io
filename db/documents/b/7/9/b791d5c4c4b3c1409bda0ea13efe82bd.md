There are no specific clinical signs or physical exam findings that can suggest lung torsion as the diagnosis. Non-specific clinical signs range from fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, and cough. Most of these symptoms appear 4 to 14 days after having a thoracic procedure or trauma or any other triggering effect. Some patients were even asymptomatic and showed no clinical signs.

Physical exam findings will reveal hypoxia, dyspnea, productive cough, and hemoptysis. Respiratory discomfort and tachypnea can also be seen. Lung torsion is diagnosed with radiological imaging.
