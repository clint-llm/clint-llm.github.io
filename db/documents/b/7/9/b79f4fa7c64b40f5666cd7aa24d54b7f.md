Tracheostomy is a safe, effective procedure that can be performed via an open or percutaneous technique. Indications include relief of airway obstruction, secretion management, and secure access for prolonged mechanical ventilation. The precise timing of tracheostomy remains controversial, but most centers proceed within 5-14 days, depending on the prognosis of the patient and the cause of initial intubation. Complications can be categorized as intraoperative, early, and late. The most devastating complication is that of a tracheoinnominate fistula. Post-operative management is best carried out by a multidisciplinary team.
