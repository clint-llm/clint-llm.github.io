A definitive diagnosis of berylliosis is based on the history, positive blood or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test (BeLPT), and granulomatous inflammation on lung biopsy

Chest radiography findings of berylliosis are non-specific. Early in the disease, radiography findings are usually normal. In later stages, interstitial fibrosis, pleural irregularities, hilar lymphadenopathy, and ground-glass opacities have been reported. Findings on CT are not specific for berylliosis. Findings that areÂ common in CT scans of people with berylliosis include parenchymal nodules in early stages. One study found that ground-glass opacities were more commonly seen on CT scan in berylliosis than in sarcoidosis. In later stages, hilar lymphadenopathy, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, and pleural thickening are found.

Other tests include:

- Arterial blood gas

- Pulmonary function tests

- Spirometry

- DLCO levels
