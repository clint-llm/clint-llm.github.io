Sebaceous adenomas are well-demarcated proliferations displaying numerous lobules comprised of sebaceous cells surrounded by basaloid cells. The proliferation often is incorporated into the epidermis. The number of differentiated (sebaceous) and undifferentiated (basaloid) cells is approximately equal. Three histologic variants have been described including solid, cystic, and keratoacanthoma-like. Sebaceous epitheliomas share the same architectural features as sebaceous adenomas; however, the number of undifferentiated cells accounts for more than half of the cells seen in the proliferation. Sebaceous carcinomas display a proliferation of basaloid cells and sebaceous cells arranged in sheets and with features of malignancy such as mitotic figures, hyperchromatism, necrosis, cellular pleomorphism, and occasional pagetoid spread.

Keratoacanthomas observed in Muir-Torre syndrome not only appear clinically like the sporadic variant, but the histologic appearance is similar as well. Occasionally some sebaceous differentiation can be observed within a keratoacanthoma. When these features are seen, it should be considered a marker for Muir-Torre syndrome, and appropriate testing for mismatch repair genes should be performed.
