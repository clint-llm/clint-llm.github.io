Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) refer to an autoantibody directed at material within the nucleus of a cell. ANAs are typically classified into two groups, antibodies to DNA and histones and antibodies to nuclear material. Antibodies to DNA and histones include anti-dsDNA antibodies and anti-histone antibodies. The remaining category includes an additional targeted nuclear antigen. The first to be identified in this category was the anti-Smith antibody.
