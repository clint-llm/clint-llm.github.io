Dental caries is a dynamic process that involves susceptible tooth surfaces, cariogenic bacteria, mainly Streptococcus mutans, and a fermentable carbohydrate source. Sucrose is the most common dietary sugar and is considered the most cariogenic carbohydrate.

Other factors, including poor oral hygiene, salivary gland hypofunction, socioeconomic status, parenting practices, and genetics, also play a significant role. This article discusses the role of sugar in developing dental caries and provides concise dietary guidelines for expecting mothers, children, and adults.
