Benzodiazepines are organic bases with a benzene ring and a 7-member diazepine moiety, with variable side chains that determine the potency, duration of action, metabolite activity, and rate of elimination. Benzodiazepines exert their effect via modulation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA-A) receptor, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. The GABA-A receptor, depending on various arrangements of its subunits, determines its affinity for various agents that bind to the receptor. Benzodiazepines bind at the interface of the GABA-A receptor and subsequently lock the receptor into a configuration that increases its affinity for GABA. Benzodiazepines do not alter the production, release, or metabolism of GABA but instead potentiates its inhibitory actions by augmenting or enhancing receptor binding. This binding ultimately increases the flow of chloride ions through the GABA ion channel, causing postsynaptic hyperpolarization, which decreases the ability to generate an action potential. The low incidence of respiratory depression with benzodiazepines, which differentiates it from barbiturates, is related to the low density of binding sites in the brainstem, which houses the respiratory center.
