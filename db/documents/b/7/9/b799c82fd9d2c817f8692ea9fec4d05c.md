The radius is one of two long bones that make up the human antebrachium, the other bone being the ulna. The radius has three borders, three surfaces, and has a prismoid shape in which the base is broader than the anterior border. The radius articulates proximally at the elbow with the capitulum of the humerus and the radial notch of the ulna. It articulates at its distal end with the ulna at the ulnar notch and with the articular surfaces of the scaphoid and lunate carpal bones.

The most proximal segment of the radius is the radial head. The head is cylindrical and contains the articular disc which articulates with the humeral capitulum and radial notch of the ulna. Distal to the radial head is the neck of the radius and radial tuberosity - an oval prominence that is the site of attachment of the biceps brachii muscle. Distal to the radial tuberosity is the shaft of the radius where multiple muscles attach, including the pronator teres, pronator quadratus, supinator, and extrinsic hand muscles.

Fractures of the distal radius account for some of the most common low-energy fractures seen in ambulatory orthopedics accounting for between 8% and 15% of all bone-related injuries in adults.
