Awareness of risk factors for developing DVT is important for early recognition and prevention of the progression of symptoms. The following are risk factors: previous diagnosis of DVT or PE, a family history of DVT or PE, hypercoagulable disorders, a diagnosis of venous stasis or insufficiency, May Thurner syndrome (left iliac vein compression by the overlying right iliac artery), recent major surgery, trauma, pregnancy, obesity, the use of hormonal replacement therapy or oral contraceptives, prolonged immobilization, inflammatory bowel disease, heart failure, and central venous catheterization.

If patients experience pain, limb swelling, skin changes or discoloration, or motor and/or sensory loss in the setting of the above-mentioned risk factors, they should seek a prompt medical evaluation with concern for deep venous thrombosis.
