ECMO has allowed many patients to have life-saving care, which will ultimately give them time to heal their own hearts or lungs. The entire initiation of ECMO with cannulation, day-to-day management, and weaning requires a vast team of professionals with direct lines of communications. Patients who are on ECMO should have daily discussions regarding their potential for possible weaning trials.

All members of the interprofessional healthcare team (clinicians, mid-level practitioners, nurses, respiratory therapists) caring for the patient must be aware of attempted trials and be ready for any possible trial, whether it is successful or not. Incorrect or improper communication between theÂ team members could lead to morbidity or mortality when weaning patients from ECMO. When teams are in constant communication, this will enhance patient care and provide better outcomes. Having a detailed plan for weaning and alternative plans if the patient fails the wean or emergently needs to go back on ECMO should have been discussed in depth with all team members with open communication lines to provide the best care. Being prepare for the weaning trials will provide the patient with the best possibility for weaning and decrease morbidity and mortality. [Level 5]
