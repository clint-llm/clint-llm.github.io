Indications of myocardial protection include open-heart surgery, e.g., aortic valve replacement, mitral valve repair. The term 'open' refers to the ability to access the heart chambers' inside and address intracardiac pathologies, which is only possible after arresting the heart using cardioplegia. In other words, if the heart is not arrested, this doesn't qualify as open-heart surgery; instead, it used to be called closed heart surgery.

The term closed heart surgery has been replaced by others, such as beating heart surgery or bypass surgery. Also, arresting the heart alone is considered an 'open heart ' even if the chambers are not breached, such as coronary artery bypass grafts.
