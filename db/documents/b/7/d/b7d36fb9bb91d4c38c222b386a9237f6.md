After the initial history and physical examination, further workup should be done as warranted. The extent of evaluation for intracardiac shunts depends on a case-by-case basis and could include blood testing, EKG, echocardiogram, chest x-ray, CT scan, and cardiac catheterization. EKG could indicate signs of pulmonary hypertension from right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), right axis deviation, and right atrial enlargement. RVH shows tall R wave in V1, dominant S wave in leads V5 and V6 and can also produce p pulmonale and right ventricular strain pattern on EKG that could be evidenced by ST depressions and T wave inversions in the right precordial (V1-V4) and inferior (II, III, aVF) leads.

A chest X-ray could show characteristic heart shapes in different defects. TOF could make the heart boot-shaped on CXR, TAPVR could show a snowman-shaped heart, and TGA could give an "egg-on-string" appearance to the heart.
