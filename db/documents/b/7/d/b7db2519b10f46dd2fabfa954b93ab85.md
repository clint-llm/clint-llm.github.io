A mycotic aneurysm is a rare disease with a fulminant course. Although considered rare, the incidence has never been accurately studied, and data comes primarily from case series and summaries. There is evidence thatÂ incidence is increasing in the last two decades due to an increase in risk factors of atherosclerosis and immunosuppression.

Management is demanding due to the kind of invasive surgical interventions involved and patient comorbidities that predispose to the infection. Medical therapy alone is associated with 50% mortality, and most experts recommend surgical intervention in combination with prolonged antimicrobial therapy. All vascular procedures are considered high risk for vulnerable patients and require a high degree of skills and care coordination among different team members. Most cases present to the hospitalist or general surgeon, but it is advisable to involve the vascular surgeon and infectious disease physician early to minimize any delay in intervention. Postoperative care relies heavily on nursing care, pharmacy, physical and occupational therapy.

The vast majority of mortality and morbidity with the aneurysm is associated with extensive infection by the time of diagnosis. Therefore, having a high index of suspicion and early diagnosis may improve patient outcomes. Lack of standardized definition and criteria for diagnosis and management also contributes to variability in outcomes in different studies, and a consensus statement from professional societies may alleviate this concern.
