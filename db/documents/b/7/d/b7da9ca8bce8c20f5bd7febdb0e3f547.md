Cardioselective agents are either administered orally or intravenously. Bisoprolol fumarate is administered only orally as 5 or 10 mg tablets once daily. Bisoprolol has low lipophilicity, so it does not cross the blood-brain barrier with a high amount. Bisoprolol fumarate has a long half-life that extends from 9 to 12 hours. It also has high bioavailability, reaching 80 % compared to most beta-blockers with lower bioavailability since they have high first-pass metabolism in the liver.

The dose of bisoprolol fumarate should be tailored to the patient's individualized needs. The usual starting dose is 5 mg once daily. If the 5 mg dose does not produce a desired antihypertensive effect,  the dose should be gradually increased to 10 mg and then, if needed, to 20 mg once daily.

**Specific Population**

**Hepatic Impairment:**According to the manufacturer's prescribing information in patients with hepatitis or cirrhosis, the initial daily dose should be 2.5 mg and, if needed, should be titrated upward slowly.

**Renal Impairment:**According to the manufacturer's prescribing information in patients with creatinine clearance, less than 40 ml/min starting dose should be 2.5 mg per day and titrate upwards slowly. Since limited data suggest that bisoprolol fumarate is not dialyzable, dose adjustment is unnecessary for dialysis patients.

**Geriatric Patients:**The dose needs to be adjusted in the elderly only if there is significant hepatic or renal dysfunction.

**Pediatric Patients:**Product labeling has no information on pediatric experience with bisoprolol fumarate.

**Pregnant Women:**Bisoprolol is a pregnancy category c medicine and should be used only if there are no other alternatives to its therapy. Other beta-blockers might be preferred over bisoprolol to treat maternal cardiovascular complications.

**Breastfeeding Women:**There is limited experience of bisoprolol during breastfeeding; other agents are preferred, especially if nursing a newborn or preterm infant.
