Cystitis cystica is a chronic reactive change of the urinary bladder mucosa, most probably due to chronic urinary tract infection or mechanical irritation. It is a benign and very commonly encountered condition. There are often invaginations of hyperplastic urothelial extensions into the superficial lamina propria, called von Brunn's nests. These inflammatory projections are considered reactive but benign and non-malignant. However, it should be promptly diagnosed to exclude malignant conditions with morphological similarities. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of cystitis cystica and emphasizes the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with cystitis cystica.

**Objectives:**
- Identify cystitis cystica and its possible causes.
- Summarize the differential diagnosis of cystitis cystica.
- Outline the management of cystitis cystica.
- Explain the significance of interprofessional team coordination to diagnose cystitis cystica and exclude malignancy for improved outcomes.
