Some authors advocate for dermoscopy and reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) to aid in the diagnosis of these lesions. On dermoscopy, one can see finely branching short vessels as well as punctate vessels around the periphery. If a polarized light source is used, short, white streaks called crystalline, or chrysalis structures can be seen. In pigmented lesions, dermoscopy can reveal gray-brown areas and/or gray-blue dots, which suggests FEP.
