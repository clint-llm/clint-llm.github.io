Even though there are no lymphatics directly associated with the pterygoid plexus, the superficial cervical lymph nodes follow the external jugular vein, which is the vein into which the pterygoid plexus eventually drains. The superficial cervical lymph nodes divide to the superficial anterior and posterior-lateral superficial cervical lymph nodes. The posterior lateral lymph nodes are near the external jugular vein. Finally, the parotid group of lymph nodes is in close relation to the infratemporal fossa and the pterygoid plexus.
