This table summarises the types of equipment required to perform various steps to implant a toric IOL.

Computing total corneal astigmatism

Schiempflug imaging devices, scanning slit devices, anterior segment optical coherence tomography, and ray tracing devices

Manual Reference marking: Weighted thread, Geuder-Gerten****pendulum marker, Nuijts-Solomon bubble marker, or  tonometer marker



**Manual Marking**

Intraoperative axis marking: Mendez gauge, beveled degree gauge

Marking of the desired axis: Nuijts Solomon bubble marker, Cionni toric marker

**FLACS guided marking**

A Femtosecond laser can mark the axis in patients undergoing FLACS.

**Image-guided marking systems**

Various image-guided marking systems like Verion, iTrace, true guide, Callisto, and Z aligns.

**Toric IOL design**

They are single-piece hydrophobic acrylic IOLs with dot or line axis markings on their posterior surface. These markings indicate the flatter axis and must be aligned with the pre-operative markings. They are more stable when compared with silicone IOLs.

With greater than 5-degree misalignment seen in only 6.9% of the cases. Silicone IOLs with C-shaped haptics had a rotation in an anticlockwise direction within two weeks of the postoperative period.
