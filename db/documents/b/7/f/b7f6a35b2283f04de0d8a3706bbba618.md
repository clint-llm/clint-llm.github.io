Diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is typically suggested clinically and confirmed by obtaining a vaginal swab of the cervical region or discharge and creating a wet mount slide to review under a microscope.

In clinical practice, bacterial vaginosis is often diagnosed by the Amsel criteria.

Alternatively, a gram-stain of the vaginal fluid can be done to examine the predominant strain of bacteria. This technique is referred to as the Nugent process.
