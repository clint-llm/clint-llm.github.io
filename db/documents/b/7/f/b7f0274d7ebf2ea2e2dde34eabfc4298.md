Three main methods are available for calculating the CAC score; Agatston Method, Calcium Volume Score, Relative Calcium Mass Score. The Agatston Method is most utilized, thus the one discussed here. It is calculated by the sum of the area of calcium (sq mm) multiplied by a factor of related plaque attenuation, as described below. A computer software system computes this data to calculate a CAC score. Example 300HU occupies 30 sq mm = CAC of 90.

**Normal Plaque Attenuation**

calcium deposits <130 HU

**Abnormal Plaque Attenuation**

calcium deposits >130 to 199 HU, factor 1; 200 to 299 HU, factor 2; 300 to 399 HU factor 3; 400 to 499 HU factor 4.

**Coronary Arterial Calcium Score Scale**

- No evidence of CAD: 0

- Minimal evidence of CAD: 1 to 10

- Mild evidence of CAD: 11 to 100

- Moderate evidence of CAD: 101 to 400

- Severe evidence of CAD: >400
