Angiokeratoma circumscriptum is usually suspected based on clinical presentation and confirmed histopathologically. Histologically the disorder is defined by ectatic thin-walled vascular channels in the papillary dermis with acanthosis and hyperkeratosis of the epidermis. Thrombosis of these vascular channels is common, which is demonstrated by the vessels being packed with erythrocytes histologically. Upon physical examination, a plaque of angiokeratoma circumscriptum may closely resemble melanoma when the vessels become thrombosed due to the darker appearance of the lesion.

Ultrasonographic evaluation of angiokeratoma circumscriptum would reveal a linear hypoechoic soft tissue mass, with mild vascularity, without any relationship to the underlying bone.

Further investigation is usually not necessary, but if multiple lesions are present in the lumbosacral area overlying the spine of a newborn or an infant, an MRI of the spine is needed to rule out spinal dysraphism or Cobb syndrome.
