The definition of a bulla is an air-filled space of 1 cm in diameter within the lung which has developed because of emphysematous destruction of the lung parenchyma. Emphysema is a limitation in airflow associated with a loss of the distal lung architecture with permanent enlargement of the alveolar space distal to the terminal bronchiole. Eighty percent of patients presenting with bullae have associated pulmonary emphysema, and this entity, therefore, is referred to as bullous emphysema. It is a subset of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), an obstructive airway disease, associated with high mortality. This activity describes the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of bullous emphysema and stresses the importance of an interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of bullous emphysema.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with bullous emphysema.
- Summarize the treatment options for bullous emphysema.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by bullous emphysema.
