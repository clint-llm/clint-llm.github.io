Mitochondrial dysfunction can result from an excess of calories introduced through food; the Krebs cycle can no longer find a balance between the molecules to be degraded and the number of molecules available. Obesity shows a mitochondrial alteration, with an increase in oxidative stress and the production of reactive oxygen species, inflammation, and apoptosis.

Mitochondrial dysfunction can also mean overwork compared to normal values. In Duchenne pathology (in an animal model), an increase of mitochondrial metabolites is present in different tissues, such as the diaphragm and peripheral muscles, the central nervous system. The reasons are probably related to oxidative stress.
