Once an SVT is identified, the next objective is to assess for hemodynamic instability. Signs of hemodynamic instability include hypotension, hypoxia, shortness of breath, chest pain, shock, evidence of poor end-organ perfusion, or altered mental status.

If a patient is unstable, consider immediate synchronized cardioversion. It is important that the defibrillator is placed in a sync mode, typically indicated by a marker on the defibrillator screen noting each QRS complex. This mode allows the defibrillator to deliver the shock synchronized with the QRS complex, to prevent the shock from being delivered during the T-wave, while the heart is depolarized. The R on T phenomenon can cause polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. In adults, the starting dose for synchronized cardioversion is 100 joules to 200 joules and can be increased in a stepwise fashion if unsuccessful at lower doses. In children, the first dose for cardioversion is 0.5 J/kg to 1 J/kg and can be doubled to 2 J/kg on subsequent attempts.

In a stable patient, attempted vagal maneuvers while preparing for chemical cardioversion, including the Valsalva maneuver and carotid massage. Both of these act to stimulate the parasympathetic system. This slows impulse formation at the sinus node, slows conduction velocity at the AV node, lengthens the AV node refractory period, and decreases ventricular inotropy.

The Valsalva maneuver is performed expiring against a closed glottis, and needs to be held for 10 seconds to 15 seconds. Patients can achieve this by bearing down as if they are going to have a bowel movement. Younger children can blow out through a syringe or straw. In infants and toddlers, ice packs applied to the face can cause a similar vagal reaction. Although ocular pressure can cause a vagal reaction, it is not recommended as it can lead to a ruptured globe if excessive force is used.

Carotid massage involves placing the patient in a supine position with the neck extended, and applying pressure to one carotid sinus for approximately 10 seconds. Carotid massage is contraindicated in patients with carotid bruit, or who have had a prior transient ischemic attack or cerebral vascular accident in the last three months. Carotid massage is not indicated in children or infants.

The REVERT trial demonstrated that a modified Valsalva maneuver, with the traditional Valsalva maneuver being held for 60 seconds at a 45 degree recumbent position, then being switched to a recumbent position with the legs held at 45 degrees angle for 15 seconds, was more efficacious than the standard Valsalva maneuver.

If vagal maneuvers are ineffective, treat with adenosine. Adenosine is rapidly metabolized in the periphery, and therefore must be given as a rapid push through a large, ideally peripheral, intravenous route. The initial dose is 6 mg intravenously (IV) (pediatric dose 0.1 mg/kg, maximum dose 6 mg). If the initial dose is ineffective, adenosine may be dosed again at 12 mg IVP (pediatric dose 0.2 mg/kg, maximum dose 12 mg). The second dose of adenosine 12 mg IVP may be repeated one additional time if there is no effect. Each dose of adenosine needs to be flushed rapidly with 10 mL to 20 mL normal saline. Often two person administration, with one person administering the adenosine at a proximal IV port, and a second person flushing the IV line via a distal port immediately after adenosine administration, is required to adequate flush in the adenosine.

Consider reducing the adenosine dose to 3 mg IVP if the patient is currently receiving carbamazepine or dipyridamole, is the recipient of a heart transplant, or adenosine is being given through a central line.

In the event of a patient with a misinterpreted rhythm, the administration of adenosine can help slow down the heart rate long enough to determine if the cause of the patient’s tachycardia is due to a different narrow complex tachycardia (e.g., atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter).

If adenosine fails, second line medications include diltiazem (0.25 mg/kg IV loading dose followed by 5mg/hr to 15 mg/hr infusion), esmolol (0.5 mg/kg IV loading dose, then 0.5 mg/kg/min up to 0.2 mg/kg/min, will need to repeat bolus for every up-titration), or metoprolol (2.5 mg to 5 mg IV every two to five minutes, not to exceed 15 mg over 10 to 15 minutes).

These measures still prove ineffective, overdrive pacing, or pacing the heart at a faster rate than its native rhythm, can help discontinue SVT. However, there is an increased risk of ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, and therefore should be used with caution and with cardioversion immediately available.

Patients with recurrent SVT without a pre-excitation syndrome may require long-term maintenance with oral beta-blockers or calcium to maintain sinus rhythm. They may also require radio-frequency ablation if an accessory pathway is identifiable. Patients should be counseled on how to perform vagal maneuvers on their own for long-term management of recurrent SVT.
