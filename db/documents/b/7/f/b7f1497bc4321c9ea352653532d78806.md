The pathophysiology of HV is complex, but the general assumption is that an imbalance exists between the extrinsic and intrinsic muscles of the foot with the involvement of the ligaments also. Maintenance of the first metatarsal alignment is by the tension created by the peroneus longus laterally and the abductor hallucis muscle medially. Collateral ligaments prevent movement along the transverse plane at the first MTP joint. If there is increased pressure at the head of the first metatarsal, the metatarsal will begin to move medial-dorsally. This force increases the hallux angle, which is also worsened by muscle stabilization while walking. As these forces push the first metatarsal medially and the hallux laterally, the medial collateral ligament and the medial capsule become strained, eventually rupturing. Without stabilizing structures medially, the lateral structures (adductor hallucis muscle and collateral/lateral joint capsule ligaments) exacerbate this deformity.
