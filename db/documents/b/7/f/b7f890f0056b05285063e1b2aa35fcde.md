The jugular vein has significant clinical importance for physicians and nurses. It not only offers a way to monitor the fluid status of a patient but is a convenient method of administering fluids and medications. The jugular vein is often a site for cannulation for TPN, temporary hemodialysis, and administration of chemotherapeutic medications. Following the insertion of the cannula, the nurse is responsible forÂ maintaining the site clean and observing for signs of infection.
