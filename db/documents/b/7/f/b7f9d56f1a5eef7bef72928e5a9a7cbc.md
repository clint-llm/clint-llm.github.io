Patients presenting with signs or symptoms of neurologic deterioration require a thorough history taking and physical examination. The history may raise suspicion of intracranial lesions that might lead to neurological deficits. A head computed tomography (CT) scan is the preferred imaging study in TBI. If there is a suspicion of a brain tumor, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without contrast enhancement is preferred as it shows the lesion with better anatomic and spatial details and can also exclude other non-tumoral etiologies. All patients with neurological deficits require frequent re-evaluation. If any significant findings raise the suspicion of intracranial herniation, a non-contrast CT brain scan should be ordered immediately. The CT scan detects acute hemorrhagic lesions and subtle concurrent midline shifts.Â It is readily available in most trauma centers and provides rapid results which help improve patient prognosis and clinical outcome.

MRI is not always available, and imagings take significantly longer than CT scans. While CT scans are the gold standard for immediate neuroimaging and evaluation for herniation syndromes, other assessment methods such as non-invasive ICP monitoring and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography have the advantage of bedside evaluation of probable herniation, exposing patients to fewer risks of radiation hazards.
