The dexamethasone suppression test (DST) is used in the evaluation of endogenous Cushing syndrome (CS) by assessing for the lack of suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by exogenous corticosteroids.

Dexamethasone is a potent synthetic corticosteroid (dexamethasone 0.75 mg = prednisone 5 mg = methylprednisolone 4 mg = hydrocortisone 20 mg) with high affinity for the glucocorticoid receptors and long duration of action (biological half-life 36 to 54 hours; plasma half-life 4 to 5 hours).

The dexamethasone suppression test is also used to investigate mild autonomous cortisol excess (MACE) in patients with incidentalomas. For the diagnosis of CS and also MACE, a serum cortisol concentration of 1.8 µg/dL (50 nmol/L) is the widely recommended cut-off that increases the diagnostic sensitivity of the test to approximately 95%.
