Burn sepsis is the number one cause of death in patients with extensive burns.

Because of the threat of disease, topical antibacterial therapy is an important part of wound care in burn patients. Silver sulfadiazine is a sulfa-derived antibiotic medication approved by the Federal Drug Administration to prevent and treat wound infection in patients with 2nd and 3rd-degree burns. The drug was approved for this use in 1973 and has been at the forefront of burn treatment since that time. Clinicians sometimes use this drug is sometimes used in the treatment of other skin infections not related to burns, such as ulcers. These uses do not have approval by the Federal Drug Administration and are “off-label.”

Medical professionals recommend its use once or twice daily, with reapplication as needed to prevent wound-sepsis in the treatment of burns. Topical antibacterial prophylaxis intends to control microbe colonization in the wound and prevent the development of wound-sepsis while also maintaining a low level of systemic absorption. Silver sulfadiazine is the most commonly used topical antibiotic medication in burn patients because of its affordability, ease of use, and tolerability.

Silver sulfadiazine is a broad-spectrum bactericidal antimicrobial effective against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, as well as some yeasts. Of note, it is active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common cause of infection in burn patients.
