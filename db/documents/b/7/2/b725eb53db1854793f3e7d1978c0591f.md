Burning mouth syndrome symptoms mayÂ correlate with certain medications, specifically angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin blockers, resulting in increased bradykinin in a similar mechanism to the development of secondary angioedema. Although the mechanism is not well understood, increased kallikrein levels (an active molecule in the kinin pathway) may be elevated in the saliva of patients with burning mouth syndrome and lead to inflammation.

Other drugs that were linked to burning mouth syndrome include antiretrovirals such as efavirenz and nevirapine, and also levothyroxine, and topiramate. However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Irritation to tissue and nerves via contact dermatitis or direct nerve irritation may partially explain the mechanism.
