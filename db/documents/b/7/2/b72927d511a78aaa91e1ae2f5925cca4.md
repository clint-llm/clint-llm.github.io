Listed below is a diagnostic approach that mayÂ help clinicians evaluate lymphadenopathy:

1. Laboratory evaluation: blood chemistries including complete blood count with differential, complete metabolic panel, lactate dehydrogenase, fungal serologies (histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis), laboratory evaluation of Syphilis, HIV, CMV, EBV, HSV, HBV, QuantiFERON for tuberculosis.

2. Imaging: Computed Tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis can be used to further substantiate the location of lymphadenopathy, pattern, and size. This can also guide a biopsy if needed.

3. Lymph node biopsy: The need for a lymph node biopsy depends on the etiology of lymphadenopathy. An excisional node biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis.
