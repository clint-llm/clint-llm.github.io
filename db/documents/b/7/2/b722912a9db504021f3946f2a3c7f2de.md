The purpose of the human airway is to allow airflow during spontaneous and mechanical ventilation. It is divided into two main portions: the upper and lower airways. The upper airway includes the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and hypopharynx. The lower airway consists of the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. The upper and lower airways are divided by the larynx, which is a key portion involved in sound production. The larynx includes two fundamental structures, namely the epiglottis and vocal cords.

During endotracheal intubation, the proceduralist aims to pass the endotracheal tube through the upper airway and vocal cords into the trachea. When attempting an orotracheal approach to intubation, the endotracheal tube must pass through the structures in the oropharynx, including the base of the tongue, the palatine tonsils, tonsillar pillars, and uvula. If these structures are relatively large, the proceduralist may experience difficulty in laryngoscopy or intubation.

The Mallampati score is one assessment to describe the relative size of the base of the tongue compared to the oropharyngeal opening in hopes of predicting the difficult airway.
