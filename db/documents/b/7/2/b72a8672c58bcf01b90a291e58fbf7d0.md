An extended rehabilitation is likely dependent on the severity of the patient's organ ischemia and residual deficits. Patients should remain alert to the return of their thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura signs and symptoms. Laboratory data should be monitored closely once the plasma exchange and corticosteroids have been tapered. Relapse, if it occurs, may resume quickly. Rituximab is available for secondary prevention in a select group of patients (as outlined above), and caplacizumab is also available as a prophylactic agent.
