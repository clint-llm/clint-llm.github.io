Roux-en-y gastric bypass is a restrictive-malabsorptive operation performed for weight loss in individuals with a BMI of 40 or greater, or in those BMI of 35 or greater with obesity-related comorbidities. Gastric bypass can be performed via open, laparoscopic, or robotic techniques. The general steps of Roux-en-Y-gastric bypass (RYGB) include 1) gastric pouch creation, 2) creation of biliopancreatic limb, 3) jejunojejunostomy creation, and 4) creation of gastrojejunostomy. This activity reviews the indications and details of this procedure as well as the role of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the rising prevalence of obesity and its implications on our healthcare system as well as the role of bariatric surgery in the treatment of obesity and its comorbidities. 
- Outline an interprofessional approach to preoperative evaluation of roux-en-y gastric bypass and the indications/contraindications of the operation. 
- Review the technical steps of a roux-en-y gastric bypass and the resultant mechanical and physiologic changes that result in weight loss and improvement in obesity-related comorbidities. 
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to ensure appropriate selection of candidates for roux-en-y gastric bypass surgery and to enhance postoperative management.
