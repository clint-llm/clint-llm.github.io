Mesoderm cells are induced to form hemangioblasts, a common precursor for vessels and blood cell formation. The definitive hematopoietic stem cells derive from mesoderm surrounding the aorta called aorta-gonad-mesonephros region. These stem cells colonize the liver and after that are actively produced by the bone marrow by the seventh month of gestation.
