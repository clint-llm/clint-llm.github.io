Urate Overproduction

- Purine rich diet

- An error of purine metabolism: hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) deficiency, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) synthetase over activity

- Cell breakdown or turnover: lymphoproliferative diseases, myeloproliferative disease, polycythemia vera, Paget disease, psoriasis, tumor lysis, hemolysis, rhabdomyolysis, exercise

Decreased Uric acid Excretion

- Acute or chronic kidney disease, acidosis (lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis), hypovolemia, medication/toxin (diuretic, niacin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, cyclosporin, beryllium, salicylates, lead, alcohol), sarcoidosis, hyperparathyroidism, hypothyroidism, Bartter syndrome, Down syndrome
