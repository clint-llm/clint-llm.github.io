Broadly defined, the scope of practice defines the healthcare services that a pre-hospital provider is authorized to perform by virtue of professional licensure. The scope of practice in Emergency Medical Services (EMS) is under the regulation of state-level licensure. To become licensed, an EMS provider must provide evidence of satisfactory completion of an accredited education program, a certification examination, and state licensure. For clarity, certification verifies a knowledge or experience base. Licensure bestows permission to perform specific duties/skills.

Each level of EMS provider has a defined scope of practice that gets delineated in the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), The National EMS Scope of Practice Model. This scope was developed based on a uniform educational curriculum and included knowledge and skills critical to each level of care, meaning any provider with that level of certification and licensure should be equipped to perform these skills. The formal definition given by NHTSA of the scope of practice is as follows, “Defined parameters of various duties or services that may be provided by an individual with specific credentials. Whether regulated by rule, statute, or court decision, it represents the limits of services an individual may legally perform.”

However, states may choose to expand or limit the scope of practice regarding specific skills. This expansion would require additional training and certification beyond the standard curriculum before licensure. Other training courses may be completed for certifications that allow for expanded scope of practice as well, although this is still often regulated by states individually.
