Polymyxins comprise a class of antibiotics targeting gram-negative bacterial infections. Polymyxin B and Polymyxin E (colistin) are the two drugs within this antibiotic class used primarily in clinical practice. They are FDA approved for serious infections with multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria, especially those caused by Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Polymyxins are often the only effective antibiotic agent against multidrug-resistant organisms, particularly carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. They have become the last line of treatment for infections that are resistant to other antibiotics.Acinetobacter baumannii.

Polymyxin B is available topically in combination with neomycin plus hydrocortisone for the treatment of otitis externa to cover for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Polymyxin B is also indicated for topical use in combination with trimethoprim in treating bacterial conjunctivitis.

Off Label Use: Adult

Polymyxins are used off label in adults via an inhaled form for patients with cystic fibrosis who have chronic pulmonary infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Also, aerosolized polymyxins have been used as adjunctive antibiotic therapy for the treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by multidrug resistance organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
