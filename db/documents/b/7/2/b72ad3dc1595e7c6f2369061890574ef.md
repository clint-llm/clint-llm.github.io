Ventricular hypertrophy results in a dynamic pressure gradient across the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), which is associated with further narrowing during systole. During this cardiac cycle, the mitral valve is pulled towards the septum by several proposed mechanisms: contraction of the papillary muscles, abnormal location in the outflow tract, and low pressure that occurs as blood is ejected at high velocity through a narrowed outflow tract (Venturi effect).
