For the Tillaux fracture pattern to occur, portions of the distal tibial physis should have closed. This occurs in adolescent children who are within the last year of physeal closure. Before this time, the physis is completely open, and this pattern of fracture will not occur. Tillaux fracture is more common in females. However, there is some increased occurrence in adolescents who participate in sports activities because of the increased stress these activities place on the ankle. Because of the earlier closure of physeal plates in females as compared to males, the injury pattern most frequently occurs at an earlier age in girls than in boys.
