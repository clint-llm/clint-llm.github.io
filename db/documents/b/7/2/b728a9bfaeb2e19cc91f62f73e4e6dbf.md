**Antibiotic Resistance and Infection Control**

Bacteriophages are drivers of bacterial evolution in the human microbiome (Level II evidence). Prophage can be induced to switch to the lytic replication cycle by host cell stress, including antimicrobial drugs. Therefore, antibiotic treatments, especially those targeting gut microbial flora, can be expected to alter the viral (phage) microbiome as well. Bacteriophages are not as easily inactivated as vegetative bacterial cells, but they are vulnerable to UV inactivation, autoclaving, and standard hospital disinfection procedures.

**Bacterial Toxin Mediated Disease**

It is important for all team members caring for a patient with a phage-borne toxin-mediated disease, such as cholera or shigella, that disinfection procedures should be chosen for their ability to inactivate viruses as well as for bacteria. Even though the bacteriophages do not infect human cells directly, they can mediate virulence gene transfer from pathogenic to non-pathogenic bacterial strains.
