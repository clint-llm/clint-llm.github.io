Measurements of plasma glucose levels are essential for screening metabolic dysregulation, pre-diabetes, and diabetes. Evidence finds that the onset of type 2 diabetes can occur as early as 4 to 7 years before clinical diagnosis. Additionally, plasma glucose levels can monitor diabetes, screen for hypoglycemic episodes, guide treatment or lifestyle interventions, and predict risk for comorbidities, such as cardiovascular or eye and kidney disease.

In a 15-year study of 1939 patients with type 2 diabetes, patients with fasting plasma glucose equal to or greater than 140 mg/dL showed a significantly increased risk of death.
