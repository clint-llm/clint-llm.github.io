Patients with LTS tend to require several specialists depending on the clinical stage in which they present. In the acute setting, for example, when a patient is noted to have post-extubation stridor, an intensivist is usually the primary consultant on the case with additional help from an anesthesiologist in the event that the patient requires reintubation of a difficult airway. Ear nose and throat (ENT) specialists, trauma surgeons, and interventional pulmonologists (IP) may need to intervene as well. IP specialists would be essential for the placement of stents, whereas cardiothoracic surgeons may be necessary for surgical approach in chronic or recurring cases. Whenver such patients are undergoing interventional procedures, coordination with the anesthesiology team is essential, as advanced airway management such as apneic technique or jet ventilation are routinely required.
