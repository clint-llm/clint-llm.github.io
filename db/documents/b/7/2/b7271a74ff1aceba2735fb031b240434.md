For patients who use ibuprofen, appropriate monitoring should seek to minimize the possibility of common and uncommon adverse effects. Pain relief and gastrointestinal symptoms should be included in a patientâ€™s clinical evaluation because they may suggest desensitization to the analgesic effect of ibuprofen or emerging gastritis or GI bleed. Blood pressure should also be monitored, especially in the elderly or hypertensive population.

Liver function is typically not monitored in patients who use ibuprofen, but cases of NSAID-induced livery injury in pediatric populations may suggest the need for monitoring in individuals with high-risk factors or at-risk populations. Though much less frequent than acetaminophen, cases of NSAID-induced liver damage have occurred in past reports; unlike acetaminophen-induced liver injury, there is no antidote for liver damage due to NSAID use.
