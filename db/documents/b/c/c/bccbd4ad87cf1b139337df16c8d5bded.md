As the most common cause of respiratory distress in premature infants, RDS occurs in about 24,000 infants born in the United States annually. It is also the most common complication of prematurity leading to significant morbidity in late preterm neonates and even mortality in very low birth weight infants. The exact definition of RDS is imprecise, thus requiring a careful analysis of statistical data. The most important risk factors are prematurity and low birth weight. Other risk factors include white race, male gender, late preterm delivery, maternal diabetes, perinatal hypoxia and ischemia, and delivery in the absence of labor.
