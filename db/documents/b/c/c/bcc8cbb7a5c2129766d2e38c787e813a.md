On the history, there will be evidence of longstanding coronary arterial disease (CAD) and possibly previous myocardial infarctions. It is also important to consider the patient's family and social history. Delineating risk factors (as mentioned above) for CAD from a complete history is essential. Signs and symptoms may vary between patients and their degree of physiological compensation. Some patient may be asymptomatic or present with mild anginal chest pain and dyspnea on exertion whereas some patients may present with overt heart failure symptoms which include dyspnea, orthopnea, poor exercise tolerance, and increased fatigability. Physical evaluation can reveal bibasilar crackles, S3 gallop (found when the left ventricle is dilated), displaced PMI, carotid bruits, JVD, hepato-jugular reflex and bilateral lower extremity edema.
