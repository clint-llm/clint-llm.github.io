Most perineal lacerations are sutured, but there is limited evidence to support this practice for first and second-degree lacerations.

When repairing second-degree lacerations, continuous or running suture should be used over interrupted suturing to decrease post-partum pain and the possibility of the patient requiring suture removal.

Third- and fourth-degree lacerations are repaired in a stepwise fashion. In a fourth-degree laceration, the rectal mucosa is reapproximated starting at 1 cm above the apex of the laceration. Care is taken to not penetrate through the rectal mucosa. The anal sphincter is then reapproximated with attention paid to include the fascial sheath of the muscle with the repair. The internal anal sphincter should be repaired separately from the external anal sphincter when possible.

A single dose of a second-generation cephalosporin can be given after any OASIS repair to decrease the patientâ€™s risk of infection and wound breakdown.

Care after any perineal laceration repair, but especially after an OASIS injury, should include pain management, laxatives or stool softeners to avoid constipation and monitoring for signs of urinary retention.
