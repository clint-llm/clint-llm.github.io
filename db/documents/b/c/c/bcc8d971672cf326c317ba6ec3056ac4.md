In general, laboratory or imaging studies are not required, especially for self-limiting localized symptoms.

However, if systemic symptoms are present or there is a known exposure to New World caterpillars (such as Lonomia species) then the following studies should be considered:

- Complete blood count (CBC)

- Coagulation studies: prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT), fibrinogen level, fibrin degradation products

- D-dimer

- Basic metabolic panel (specifically BUN and creatinine)

- Urinalysis (to evaluate for blood and/or protein)

- Chest X-ray if significant respiratory symptoms are present

- EKG for tachycardia or dysrhythmias
