Renal artery thrombosis is a rare pathology that may be overlooked when evaluating impaired renal function. It is the formation of a blood clot in one or both of the arteries supplying blood to the kidneys. This results in decreased renal perfusion and may result in kidney injury or failure. There appears to be a correlation with traumatic injury, particularly with blunt abdominal trauma, but an embolic event emanating from the heart remains the most common cause. In the appropriate clinical context, renal artery thrombosis should be evaluated early on with both laboratory testing and imaging studies to prevent permanent renal impairment.

Renal artery thrombosis has gained renewed attention in the recent global pandemic as it has been associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). It is reported in some studies that renal artery thrombosis can present itself secondary to coronavirus infection, along with the usual association of thromboembolism in major blood vessels and stroke.
