- Methanol is metabolized to its toxic metabolite, formic acid/formate.

- Formic acid is responsible for metabolic acidosis and end-organ toxicity.

- End-organ toxicity includes primarily retinal damage, and possibly basal ganglia damage.

- Methanol is osmotically active.

- An osmolar gap cannot be relied upon to rule out toxic alcohol poisoning.

- A normal osmolar gap is not reassuring and should be expected in the presence of an anion gap acidosis believed to be related to toxic alcohol poisoning.

- The mainstay of treatment is fomepizole, supportive care and resuscitation, and dialysis.

- Dialysis indications include the presence ofÂ end-organ toxicity.

- In the absence of end-organ toxicity, methanol toxicity often benefits from dialysis, unlike ethylene glycol toxicity, due to its very long elimination rate once alcohol dehydrogenase is blocked with fomepizole.
