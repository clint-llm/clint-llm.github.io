Laparoscopic adjusted gastric banding has the lowest mortality of all the bariatric procedures, ranging from 0.02% to 0.1%.

**Early Complications**

- Deep vein thrombosis: Pulmonary embolism is the leading cause of death following laparoscopic adjusted gastric band surgery in many series.

- Esophageal or gastric perforation: The most common location for this is the retro gastric space. It is usually associated with an undiagnosed hiatal hernia. If a perforation occurs and is close to where the band will be placed, the procedure should be aborted.

- Esophagogastric obstruction: This can be an immediate postoperative obstruction caused by a tight gastric band. It is not typically seen due to the larger diameter of later band designs. This can be prevented by removing the perigastric fat pads to allow for adequate room for the gastric band.

**Late Complications**

- Gastric prolapse, or a “slipped band,”: Is characterized by the lower stomach herniating superiorly through the device. It can be classified as an anterior or posterior slippage of the fundus past the band; the anterior is more common. The patient will experience sudden-onset food intolerance or reflux symptoms. Diagnosis begins with a plain abdominal radiograph. Normally the band is oriented diagonally from 2 to 8 o’clock and points towards the left shoulder. A slipped band will appear oriented more horizontally from a 10 to 4 o’clock position and will point towards the left hip. Confirmation is generally done with an esophagram. Treatment should be initial deflation of the band to temporarily alleviate the patient’s symptoms. Definitive management includes a reoperation and one of the following techniques: laparoscopic band repositioning, removal with or without replacement of the band, and conversion to another bariatric procedure such as sleeve gastrectomy or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.

- Band erosion: The incidence of band erosion into the stomach wall increases with time but remains between 1% and 2% in the literature.

- Device malfunctions: These can be characterized by various complications, including device leaks leading to failure of band adjustment, tube kinking, port dislodgment, and port site infection. Leaks can occur via tubing disconnection, port puncture, or band puncture. The port may become dislodged from the fascia and flip, rendering the port inaccessible.

- Band obstruction: This can be secondary to an overinflated band, which is most common, or a low band placement due to technical errors or a missed hiatal hernia. This will lead to a gastric pouch and esophageal dilation with esophagitis that can result in esophageal dysmotility, such as megaesophagus or pseudo-achalasia, in chronic cases.
