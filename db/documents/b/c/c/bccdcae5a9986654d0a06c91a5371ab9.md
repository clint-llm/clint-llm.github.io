Indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) is used to image the choroidal circulation and its abnormalities.

As its absorption and emission spectrum is of a higher wavelength than that of fluorescein, the infrared rays to and from ICG can penetrate better through the RPE, macular xanthophyll pigments, and media opacities. Also, 98% of ICG in serum is protein-bound, allowing only limited diffusion through the fenestrations of the choriocapillaris, whereas FA diffuses quickly, blurring the anatomy of the choroid.

ICG was approved for human use by Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the USA, in 1956.

Still, ICGA continues to be an important imaging modality in clinical practice in evaluating various disorders, including idiopathic polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (IPCV), retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP), central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR), ocular inflammatory conditions including sympathetic ophthalmia (SO) and Vogt Koyanagi Harada syndrome (VKH); and ocular tumors.
