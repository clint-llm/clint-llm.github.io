Interestingly, while a common belief is that repetitive forward flexion actions correlate with a disc injury, no studies correlate to a dose-response relationship between physical loading and disc injury. It is now thought that the literature on intervertebral disc disease once associated with these heavy physical loading in occupations may be confounded by correlations with a lower socioeconomic status or lifestyle factors seen in this cohort.

Recent research has shown that there is a very significant genetic component to disc injuries and degeneration of the spine. Supporting studies of monozygotic twins with disc injuries support the importance of genetic predispositions. For example, in a study of the MRIs of 115 monozygotic twins, 34% of the variability in disc degeneration could be explained by genetics (versus 2% for the physical loading, 7% for age) at the L4-S1 region.
