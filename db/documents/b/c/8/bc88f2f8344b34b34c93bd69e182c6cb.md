To ensure better clinical outcomes and to prioritize patient safety by minimizing complications, there need to be mandatory patient safety checklists to be implemented by the health care team involved in the process. The following guidelines have to be adhered to:

- Valid treatment order sheet

- All reportable limits clearly specified

- EVD drainage point at a prescribed level with theÂ transducer leveled to the tragus of the ear

- The EVD column is oscillating

- Monitoring for normal ICP waveform

- ICP waveform is pulsatile on the monitor

- No soakage in the wound site or any junctions within the monitor set

- Judicious assessment of drained CSF volume

- Stringent evaluation of the neurological status of the patient

- Coordination between monitoring specialty trained nurses and clinicians

- Family education by nursing staff and clinicians; providing strong family support.

Intracranial pressure monitoring requires an interprofessional team approach, including clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), specialists, and specialty-trained nurses, collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. The critical care nurse is essential for close monitoring of intracranial pressure and communicating any change to the medical team. The neurology and critical care nurse assists the medical team with hourly neurological and hemodynamic evaluations to ensure prompt intervention when needed. An interprofessional team working in unison with collaboration can significantly enhance patient outcomes in patients undergoing intracranial pressure monitoring.
