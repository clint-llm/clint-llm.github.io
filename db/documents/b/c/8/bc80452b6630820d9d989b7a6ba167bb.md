A patient with familial hypertriglyceridemia will not typically have symptoms. However, when exacerbating the disease through another stressor or in exceptional cases, the presentation could be more prominent. In hereditary lipid disorders, a patient may present with the variants of cutaneous xanthoma. A xanthoma is a collection of macrophages that are “lipid-laden.” These macrophages have accumulated excessive amounts of free lipids and become coined “foam cells.” More commonly, the eruptive xanthoma variant can be indicative of hypertriglyceridemia. However, it should be noted that triglyceride levels necessary to present with these lesions are well above the typical blood levels of familial hypertriglyceridemia patients. The formation of eruptive xanthomas is commonly less than 5 mm and in a crop formation on the extensor surfaces.
