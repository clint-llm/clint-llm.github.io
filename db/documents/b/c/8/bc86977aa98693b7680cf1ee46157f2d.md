**Measurement of Growth**

Anthropometry is the gold standard by which clinicians can assess nutritional status. The major anthropometric measurements for age up to 2 years are weight, length, weight for length, and head circumference. The major measurements used for children above two years are weight, height, body mass index (BMI), and head circumference for the 2-3 years age group.

- **Length or height:**For children less than two years or children with severe cerebral palsy, the length is the ideal way of measuring stature. Length is measured by placing the child supine on an infant measuring board. For children aged more than two years, standing height is measured in the stadiometer after removing shoes. The supine length is usually 1 cm higher than standing height. Length and height can be documented to the closest 0.1 cm. For children with severe cerebral palsy or spinal deformities, upper arm length, tibial length, and knee height can be useful to assess stature.

- **Weight:**The kids below one year are weighed on a scale after removing the clothes, shoes, diaper, and documented to the closest 0.01 kg. The kids outside the infancy phase should be measured without shoes, with little or no outer clothing, and documented to the closest 0.1 kg.

- **Head circumference or occipitofrontal circumference:**Head circumference is assessed by measuring the largest area from the prominent site at the back (occiput) to the frontal prominence above the supraorbital ridge. Brain growth is maximum in the first three years of life, so head circumference is used in children less than three years.  It is measured as the maximum diameter through the supraorbital ridge to the occiput and documented to the closest 0.01 cm. Microcephaly is more than two standard deviations below the mean. Macrocephaly is more than two standard deviations above the mean.

- **Measure of adiposity:**
- Body mass index (BMI) is a useful predictor of adiposity. BMI is calculated with formula,weight (kg) / height (m) squared. BMI is the single best indicator for detecting overweight or obesity

- < 5th percentile - underweight 
- 5th to 84th percentile - normal 
- 85th to 95th percentile - overweight 
- 95th to 98th percentile - obesity 
- More than 99th percentile - severe obesity


- The weight to length ratio is an alternative for body mass index in predicting adiposity in less than two years. 
- Self-assessment of the hip to waist ratio can help to guide the measure of central adiposity,
- Triceps and subscapular skinfolds can also be a useful measure of adiposity.

- **Body proportions**
- The upper segment to lower segment (U/L) ratio is 1.7 at birth, 1.3 at three years, and reaches 1.0 at greater than seven years. A higher U/L ratio is a feature in short-limb dwarfism.
- Arm span to height ratio is a fixed ratio across all ages. The ratio of more than 1.05:1 is suggestive of Marfan syndrome.

- ****Sexual maturity:****Tanner's stage can be used to assess sexual maturity.

- **Skeletal maturity:**Bone age can be determined by doing Hand & Wrist radiographs from 3 to 18 years of age.

- **Dental assessment:**Primary tooth eruption begins with the central incisors at six months. No single tooth by 13 months of age is of concern. Permanent tooth eruption starts at six years of age and continues up to 18 years of age.

**Growth Velocity**

The growth velocity is different at different stages of life. Also, different tissues grow at different rates at the same stage of life. The lymphoid tissues can exceed adult size at six years of age. Girls are taller than boys at 12 to 14 years, but later they will not grow taller than their boy's counterpart. Growth velocity is maximum during infancy and adolescence. The head circumference reaches closer to adult size by six years of age. The prepubertal height velocity of less than 4 cm per year is of concern. During puberty, the height velocity is 10 to 12 cm per year in boys and 8 to 10 cm per year in girls. The prepubertal weight velocity of less than 1 kg per year is of concern. Weight velocity is highest during puberty, up to 8 kg per year.

**Stages of Development**

Development is a continuous process from neonatal to adulthood. Though the growth ceases after adolescence, adolescence is not the end for development. Each developmental stage has a new set of challenges and opportunities.

- **Infancy**: Development progress in cephalo-caudal direction and also from the midline to the lateral direction.  A three to four-month variation can be there in achieving the developmental milestone. Social development is a cortical function that develops earlier than motor skills. Lack of social smile by four weeks is of concern. At birth, the infant is equipped with primitive reflexes. Certain primitive reflexes help in the normal physiology of infants. Sucking and rooting reflex helps inefficient feeding. Most of the primitive reflex disappears to facilitate the mature development process. For example, the grasp reflex disappears by six months, and the child develops mature grasp development from 6-12 months.

- **Early and late childhood:**Between ages 1 and 3 years, locomotion and language are crucial. The best predictor of cognitive function is language. Fine motor skills are related to self-help skills. The most common development in early childhood is to establish self-identity. A child may have independent existence by three years of age. The kids learn independent existence skills like feeding behavior, toilet training, and self dressing during this stage of early and late childhood. Questioning skills develop during early childhood development.

- **Adolescence:**Adolescence is hallmarked by puberty changes, which occur two years earlier in females than in males. Puberty changes are assessed using the Tanner staging. Acceptance of a new body and separation from home, and establishing oneself as an independent adult in society are the significant challenges in puberty.

**Psychosocial Development**

Erikson has postulated eight stages of psychosocial development.

- **Trust and mistrust in infancy (< 1 year):**Infants develop trust with a warm response from the caretaker.

- **Autonomy and doubt in the toddler age group ( one to three years):**Children feel autonomous if caregivers encourage independence. Otherwise, they will doubt their abilities.

- **Initiative and guilt in the preschool age group (three to six years):**By imaginative play, kids experiment with their ambitions. If parents do not encourage their initiative, the kids will feel guilt.

- **Industry and inferiority in early school years:**In school, children learn to work as a group. They will have inferiority feelings if the peer environment is hostile.

- **Identity and role confusion in adolescence:**Self-identity is a significant development during adolescence.

- **Intimacy and isolation in early adulthood:**Those who cannot establish relationships or intimacy are prone to be socially isolated.

- **Generativity and stagnation in middle adulthood:**Parenting is the best example to guide the younger generation.

- **Ego integrity and despair in late adulthood:**People who are not satisfied with what they did during their lifetime will be in despair.
