On histopathological examination, the esophageal leiomyomas appear as circumscribed lesions composed of intersecting fascicles of bland spindle cells with abundant cytoplasm. These well-differentiated smooth muscle cells which are of the spindle type are arranged as braids. These bundles are demarcated by adjacent tissue or a definite connective tissue capsule. The spindle cells intersect with each other at varying angles. The tumor cells have blunt elongated nuclei and display minimal atypia and very few mitotic figures. Hence, this tumor is thought to have a low malignant potential. These cells, when evaluated with immunohistochemistry, is found to stain positive for Desmin, alpha-smooth muscle actin while staining negative for the CD34, CD117, and S100 protein.
