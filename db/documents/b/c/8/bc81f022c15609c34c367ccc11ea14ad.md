Patients typically present with symptoms four to ten days after exposure to the Rickettsia via tick bite. Patients may or may not recall the tick bite, as the tick does not need to have prolonged contact with the host to cause infection. A detailed travel history is important to identify any outdoor activities in endemic areas and areas with other endemic Rickettsia, as symptoms overlap between the various Rickettsial infections. Symptoms classically include the triad of fever, headache, and a petechial or maculopapular rash but may also include lymphadenopathy, central nervous system changes such as confusion or nuchal rigidity, myalgias and arthralgias, hepatitis, vomiting, and cardiovascular instability. The rash often begins as a maculopapular rash around the wrists and ankles that progresses to petechia. It is essential to have a high index of suspicion for rickettsial infection when patients present with these "influenza-like" symptoms during the summer months, regardless of known tick or insect exposure.
