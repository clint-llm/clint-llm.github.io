Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty are the most common forms of vertebral augmentation. They can be defined as the injection of bone cement, often under fluoroscopy, into a fractured vertebra percutaneously. This activity describes vertebral augmentation and highlights the role of an interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients who undergo vertebral augmentation.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures related to, indications, and contraindications of vertebral augmentation.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regard to vertebral augmentation.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and clinical significance of vertebral augmentation.
- Summarize inter-professional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance augmentation and improve outcomes.
