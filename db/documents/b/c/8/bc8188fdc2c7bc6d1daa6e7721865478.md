Traditionally, when patients were scheduling for cholesterol testing, they needed to fast for more than eight hours.

- Non- fasting blood lipid profiles are acceptable in several conditions, i.e. :
- Initial risk estimation of an untreated primary prevention patient
- To clarify the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome.

- Fasting blood lipid profiles are preferred or even mandatory in several conditions, i.e. :
- For screening and following patients with a family history of genetic hyperlipidemia or premature ASCVD (Fasting is mandatory)
- Establish the diagnosis of hypertriglyceridemia
- Residual risk estimation of treated patients
- Assessment of patients with or at risk for pancreatitis

Then, patients will undergo a venous blood sampling of 0.5 to 1 mL, mostly through their antecubital vein. The container for the specimen must be a gel-barrier transport, green-top (heparin) tube, or lavender-top (EDTA) tube. Then, the serum must be separated from other blood components within 45 minutes of collection. Samples should be stored at room temperature.
