The superior intercostal artery, which branches off the costocervical trunk, supplies the upper intercostal spaces. It passes inferiorly between the pleura and the necks of the first and second ribs, where it divides into two posterior intercostal arteries. The upper two intercostal muscles receive vascular supply from the superior intercostal artery and its branches. The deep cervical artery, which is another branch of the costocervical trunk, passes inferiorly above the eight cervical spinal nerve between the transverse process of the seventh cranial vertebra. From there, it ascends to the deep muscles of the neck and the back. It gives off muscular branches to supply the deep muscles in the neck and upper back.
