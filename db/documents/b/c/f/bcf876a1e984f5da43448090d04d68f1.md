In myelophthisic anemia, the peripheral blood smear will show characteristic leukoerythroblastic reactions with the presence of immature myeloid and nucleated erythrocytes, including abnormal erythrocytes such as schistocytes, and dacrocytes (teardrop) and anisopoikilocytosis cells. These are secondary to extramedullary hematopoiesis and the disruption of marrow sinusoids. Since there may be a dry tap during bone marrow tap owing to fibrosis, bone marrow biopsy is essential for the diagnosis along with the visualization of underlying etiologies such as metastatic cancer cells or granulomatous lesions.
