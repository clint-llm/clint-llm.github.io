**Renin**

The juxtaglomerular (JG) cells, present within the afferent arterioles of the kidney, contain prorenin. Activation of JG cells causes the cleavage of prorenin to renin. The activation of prorenin occurs in the kidney by enzymes like proconvertase 1 and cathepsin B.

- Changes in renal perfusion perceived by the pressure transducer mechanism in afferent arterioles (sense stretch from the mechanoreceptors of the arteriolar wall)

- Delivery of sodium and chloride to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) that is sensed by the macula densa

- Increased beta-sympathetic flow acting through the beta-1 adrenergic receptors, particularly in the upright posture

- Negative feedback from humoral factors like angiotensin I, potassium (renin release is increased by hypokalemia and decreased by hyperkalemia), and ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide)

Therefore, conditions leading to decreased renal perfusion and reduced tubular sodium content lead to renin enzyme release into the bloodstream. The half-life of renin activity in circulation is 10-15 minutes.

**Angiotensinogen**

This molecule is primarily synthesized and constitutively secreted by the liver. Renin cleaves the N-terminal of angiotensinogen and leads to the formation of angiotensin I.

**Angiotensin I**

This peptide does not have any known biological activity.

**Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE)**

This enzyme is expressed on plasma membranes of vascular endothelial cells, primarily in the pulmonary circulation.

**Angiotensin II**

ACE generates angiotensin II by cleaving the two amino acids at the C-terminal of angiotensin I. Angiotensin II is the primary mediator of the physiologic effects of RAAS, including blood pressure, volume regulation, and aldosterone secretion.

The physiological effects of angiotensin II on extracellular volume and blood pressure regulation are mediated in five ways:

- Vasoconstriction by contraction of the vascular smooth muscle in the arterioles

- Aldosterone secretion from the adrenal cortex in the zona glomerulosa.

- Increase sodium reabsorption through increased activity of the Na-H antiporter in the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT)

- Increasing sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system

- Release of vasopressin from the hypothalamus

Angiotensin II is also implicated in many pathophysiological states and is known to induce oxidative stress, vascular smooth muscle contraction, endothelial dysfunction, fibrosis, and hypertrophic, anti-apoptotic, and pro-mitogenic effects.

The physiological and pathophysiological effects of angiotensin II are mediated by two types of receptors: type 1 and type 2.

**Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor (AT1-R)**

AT1-R is a G-protein coupled receptor.

**Angiotensin II Type 2 Receptor (AT2-R)**

AT2-R is a G-protein coupled receptor.

**Aldosterone**

Aldosterone is synthesized primarily in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex. The synthesis and secretion of this hormone are primarily regulated by angiotensin II, ACTH, and extracellular potassium concentration.

Aldosterone mediates its effects on electrolyte and renal homeostasis by binding to the MR receptors on principal epithelial cells in the renal cortical collecting duct. Sodium is reabsorbed via the ENaC (epithelial sodium channel) on the apical membranes of principal cells in the collecting tubules. Aldosterone leads to increased concentrations of ENaC channels at the apical membrane, resulting in increased sodium reabsorption.
