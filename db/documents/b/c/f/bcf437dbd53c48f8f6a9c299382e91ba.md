The femoral triangle includes the inguinal ligament and the following muscles:

Adductor Longus - forms the medial border as well as a portion of the medial floor of the femoral triangle. Its origin is the superior ramus of the pubis, and its insertion is on the linea aspera of the femur.

Sartorius - is the longest muscle in the body, and it makes the lateral border of the femoral triangle.

Pectineus - forms a portion of the medial floor of the femoral triangle. It is a quadrangular muscle that originates from the pectinate line of the pubis and inserts on the pectinate line of the femur.

Iliopsoas - forms the lateral floor of the triangle. Iliopsoas refers to the two muscles, iliacus, and psoas, that originate as separate muscles in the abdomen and join into one in the hip to serve as the most powerful flexor of the thigh at the hip.
