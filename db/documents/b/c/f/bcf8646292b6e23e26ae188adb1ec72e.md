- Mycoplasma is a diverse bacterium that is not only limited to respiratory infections but may cause an array of different symptoms clinicians must consider in their differential.

- Mycoplasma species have newly arisen as a sexually transmitted infection that if left untreated may lead to complications in pregnant women.

- The primary treatment for mycoplasmal infections include macrolides, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones. Macrolides provide the only choice for children because of potential toxic profiles of tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones.

- Although rare, serious and potentially fatal complications may arise from Mycoplasma if disseminated to other organs including the central nervous system and heart.
