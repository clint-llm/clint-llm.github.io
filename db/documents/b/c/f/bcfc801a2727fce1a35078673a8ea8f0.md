Clinical manifestations differ widely among patients with NCS, but the most common complaint is hematuria with or without flank pain. Presentation in children is usually asymptomatic hematuria. In the female, it often presents with pelvic congestion syndrome with associated symptoms of dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dysuria, lower abdominal pain, post-coital pain, varices (gluteal/thigh) and emotional disturbance.

Hematuria occurs in the background of rupture of thin-walled varices into the collecting system secondary to venous congestion and hypertension. Hematuria can be macroscopic or microscopic which can lead to resultant anemia. Pain is part of the pelvic congestion syndrome and can be aggravated by sitting, walking or riding in a vehicle. Sometimes, Left flank pain could be due to the passage of blood clots in the ureter leading to ureteric colic. Orthostatic proteinuria occurs more in puberty. Increased LRV pressure along with subclinical immune injury is thought to be the mechanism behind it. Left-sided varicoceles secondary to the Left renal vein hypertension occur in males.
