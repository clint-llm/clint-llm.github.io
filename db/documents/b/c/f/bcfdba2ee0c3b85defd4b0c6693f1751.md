Gitelman syndrome is a salt-losing tubulopathy caused by mutation of genes encoding sodium chloride (NCCT) and magnesium transporters in the thiazide-sensitive segments of the distal nephron. It is characterized by renal potassium wasting, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, hypocalciuria, hypomagnesemia, and hyperreninemic hyperaldosteronism. Gitelman syndrome is also referred to as familial hypokalemia-hypomagnesemia. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with Gitelman syndrome to provide the best patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Review the genetic mutations in the etiology of Gitelman syndrome.
- Describe the pathophysiology of Gitelman syndrome.
- Identify the correction of electrolyte abnormalities in the treatment of Gitelman syndrome.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance outcomes for patients affected by Gitelman syndrome.
