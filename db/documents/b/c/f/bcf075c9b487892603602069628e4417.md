Bronchoalveolar Lavage or BAL is a minimally invasive procedure that involves instillation of sterile normal saline into a subsegment of the lung, followed by suction and collection of the instillation for analysis. This procedure is typically facilitated by the introduction of a flexible bronchoscope into a sub-segment of the lung. The procedure was popularized in 1974 by the work of American physicians, Reynolds and Newball, in Maryland. Today, it serves predominantly as a diagnostic tool for the evaluation of lower respiratory tract pathology and in some uncommon conditions, it also has therapeutic utility. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of bronchoalveolar lavage and stresses the role of an interprofessional team approach to the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the reasons for undertaking bronchoalveolar lavage.
- Explain which patients may benefit from bronchoalveolar lavage.
- Summarize how bronchoalveolar lavage is evaluated.
- Describe the modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients receiving bronchoalveolar lavage.
