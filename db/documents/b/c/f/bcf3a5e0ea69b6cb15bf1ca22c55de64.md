**Cyanide Poisoning**

Cyanide is a rapidly acting, potentially fatal substance if ingested. Most commonly, cyanide toxicity is the result of smoke inhalation during domestic fires. Toxicity is due to the cessation of oxidative phosphorylation (the production of ATP via the use of oxygen).

**Heavy Metals**

Metals such as mercury, cadmium, and lead can all lead to poisoning in humans.

While the implications of noncompetitive inhibition in metal poisoning are still under study, their use as therapeutic agents outside of anticancer drugs is just beginning. Research has recently demonstrated that copper and mercury as potent noncompetitive inhibitors of a light-chain protease in botulinum neurotoxin poisoning. They were found to delay botulinum neurotoxin poisoning-mediated lethality in rodents via their noncompetitive inhibition of enzymes within the neurotoxin.

**Chronic Disease**

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most common chronic diseases plaguing the healthcare system with high morbidity and mortality. While vast sums of time and money have gone towards developing safe, effective medical therapies for T2DM, these medications are not without side effects and are tolerated differently on an individual basis. Research continues to investigate “less invasive” means of controlling blood sugar. Inhibition of intestinal enzymes responsible for the breakdown of dietary sugar (such as alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase) has been found to be effective in preventing postprandial hyperglycemia in the diabetic population. Rosha grass (Cymbopogon martinii) has shown activity as a noncompetitive inhibitor of alpha-glucosidase, explaining its effectiveness as a traditional Indian treatment for T2DM.

Also, pharmacological companies have emphasized the need to explore new molecular targets for novel drug development in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Increased glucose production via gluconeogenesis is a well-defined problem in all Type 2 diabetics, yet not a single medication addresses this route of hyperglycemia. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase is the rate-controlling enzyme in gluconeogenesis, and recent insight has suggested noncompetitive inhibitors of the enzyme may be a useful therapy in T2DM.

Finally, implications point to noncompetitive inhibition in disulfiram's inhibition of pro-hepatocellular carcinoma enzymes,
