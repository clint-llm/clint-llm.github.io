CMTs are insidiously progressive disorders. Patients develop increasing weakness and wasting of extremities that interfere with mobility and activities of daily living. The rate of progression varies among various CMTs. Life expectancy is usually not affected, but the disease may be severe when the onset is very early.  Periodic evaluation and interventions by an interdisciplinary rehabilitation team are essential for the maintenance of independence, safe ambulation, and functional activities.
