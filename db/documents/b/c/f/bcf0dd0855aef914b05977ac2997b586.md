Fetal development occurs in three separate and distinct phases. The first is the pre-differentiation period in weeks 1 and 2, the second is the embryonic period that occurs during weeks 3 through 8, and the last is the fetal period from week 9 onward. During the embryonic period, differentiation of the upper limb morphology begins with the upper limb bud around the fifth week. The collection of cells located at the distal ridge of the limb bud, defined as the apical ectodermal ridge, mediates the differentiation and maturation process for the upper extremity. Mesenchymal condensation leads to the formation of cartilaginous analogs of the shoulder, the arm, the forearm, and ultimately the hand. These analogs ossify into bones around week 6 of gestation. The primary centers of ossification begin to form long bones as early as the 12th week. The sequential formation of the cavities in the joints, the condensation of the ligaments, and differentiation of the muscles begins first in the shoulder girdle and proceeds distally to the hand during the 6- to 8-week time frame. After 9 weeks, the bones, joints, ligaments, and muscles undergo further maturation.
