When diagnosed prenatally, congenital pulmonary airway malformation can be managed before delivery if there is a risk for fetal hydrops. If the clinician identifies this risk in the prenatal period, interventions such as fetal surgery, corticosteroids, or drainage can be done to prevent fetal demise. In the postnatal period, if the infant is symptomatic with respiratory distress, then surgical resection is the management of choice. Additionally, surgical resection is the recommendation for an infant with a lesion occupying more than twenty percent of the hemithorax, bilateral or multifocal cysts, pneumothorax (in context of CPAM), or a family history of pleuropulmonary blastoma. Often in older children with minor symptoms, resection is done as well to prevent recurrent infections or the potential for malignancy, especially if it is a known Type 4 lesion. For asymptomatic patients, there is a debate about whether the patient should have the lesion electively resected versus taking the conservative approach and observing for symptoms. Either option is viable, and the decision can be made at the discretion of the provider as well as discussion with the family about the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.
