The mesenchyme of the head, including the orbit and its structures, primarily arises in mesoderm and neural crest cells. The extraocular muscles originate from the mesoderm, but the satellite and connective tissue of the muscle derive from neural crest cells. Most of the remaining connective tissue of the orbit is also derived from neural crest cells.
