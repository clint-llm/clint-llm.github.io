Gastrointestinal lipomas can cause obstructive symptoms and bleed secondary to ulceration. Cardiac lipomas may cause embolism if they interfere with the anatomy of the cardiac chamber. Although rare but local lipomas may cause nerve compression. As these lipomas enlarge, they can compress the adjacent nerves and local structure. The majority of lipomas have a benign course and do not recur after surgical removal. It is advisable to completely excise the capsule to minimize the risk of reoccurrence.
