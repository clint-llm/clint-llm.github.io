The prevalence of cardiac cirrhosis is hard to determine because this condition can be asymptomatic, or the diagnosis can be missed because of other causes of liver injury. Usually, in cardiac cirrhosis, mortality is related to the underlying cardiac disease rather than the hepatic congestion and injury. The age of presentation for cardiac cirrhosis is unclear as it depends on the onset of decompensated heart failure. As for cardiac diseases, the risk of cardiac cirrhosis increases with age. Similarly, it is more frequent in males as they also have an increased risk of developing heart failure and subsequently cardiac cirrhosis.
