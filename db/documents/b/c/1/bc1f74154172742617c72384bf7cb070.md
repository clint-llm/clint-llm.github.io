A skin biopsy can be done if genetic testing is inconclusive, particularly in males with suspected incontinentia pigmenti where mosaicism may be present. Histopathologic features can differ based on the stage of skin involvement:

- Stage 1 (Vesicular): Eosinophilic spongiosis with intraepidermal blister formation.

- Stage 2 (Verrucous): Hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, papillomatosis with dyskeratotic keratinocytes.

- Stage 3 (hyperpigmented): Abundant melanophages with pigment incontinence, and

- Stage 4 (hypopigmented/atrophic): Atrophic epidermis with loss of rete ridge pattern and adnexal structures; and reduction in melanocytes in the basal layer.
