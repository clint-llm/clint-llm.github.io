Children must be able to participate in the planned testing method, or results will not be valid. Cooperation can be optimized by ensuring that older children are well-fed, well-rested and that hygiene such as diaper changes are performed just before testing where applicable. Newborns should not be fed or rested before arriving for evaluation, especially for a non-sedated ABR; at the time of assessment, monitors will be connected to the patient, after which point the patient will be fed and allowed to sleep during the examination. This maximizes the chance of appropriate behavior and accurate results from testing.
