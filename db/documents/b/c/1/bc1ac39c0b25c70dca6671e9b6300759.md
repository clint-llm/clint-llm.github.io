Cellulitis of an affected extremity due to stasis and the lymphatic leak can lead to sepsis from neglected skincare. Severe stasis from venous and lymphatic abnormalities leads to an increased risk of localized coagulopathy with elevated D-dimer levels in patients with KTS. Bleeding from GI tract vascular malformations can be chronic and occult, requiring multiple transfusions and iron supplementation, or bleeding may be life-threatening with associated disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). Recurrent pulmonary embolism secondary to deep venous thrombosis can cause chronic changes in the small vessels resulting in pulmonary hypertension. Limb hypertrophy may require de-bulking surgeries for mobility and ambulation.
