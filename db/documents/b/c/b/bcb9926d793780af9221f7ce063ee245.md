Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy characterized by the loss of retinal ganglion cells and subsequent progressive degeneration of the optic nerve. It is the most common cause of irreversible blindness in the world. The most significant modifiable risk factor is the control of intraocular pressure (IOP).

Cannabis plants have been used as a therapeutic agent for many centuries, as early as the fourth century AD.

Cannabinoid (CB) receptors are G protein receptors with an affinity for the agonists THC and CBD. Two types of CB receptors are described: CB1 and CB2. CB1 receptors are mostly limited to the central nervous system, where they modulate neurotransmitters, while CB2 receptors are confined to the immune and peripheral nervous system and are involved in cytokine signaling.
