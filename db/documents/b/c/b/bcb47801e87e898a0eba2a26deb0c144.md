Chronic alcohol consumption can have deleterious effects on the central and peripheral nervous systems. One of the most common adverse effects seen in patients with chronic alcohol use disorder is alcohol neuropathy. This commonly presents with pain, paresthesias, and ataxia in the distal lower extremities. The exact number of people affected by this condition is not known, but studies have shown that up to 66% of patients with chronic alcohol use disorder may have some form of the disease. The cause is multifactorial, from both nutritional deficiencies and alcohol metabolism's direct toxic effects on neurons. History and physical exam can help to differential this condition from other forms of neuropathy. No specific lab test is available for diagnosis. Treatment should be focused on alcohol sobriety and replacement of key nutrients.
