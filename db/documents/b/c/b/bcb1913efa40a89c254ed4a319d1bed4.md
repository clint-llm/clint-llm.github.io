A careful history and physical exam are crucial. Patients that meet the criteria of CRS should always receive an endoscopic exam in the clinic. If nasal polyps are present, the endoscopic exam will reveal either unilateral or bilateral, mobile, smooth, grey, and semi-translucent masses originating from the middle meatus or sphenoethmoid recess. Unilateral "nasal polyps" should **always**raise the suspicion of an alternate diagnosis. Inflammatory polyps are almost universally bilateral. While there are benign unilateral polyp etiologies such as an antrochoanal polyp, the suspicion for malignancy should be high and a referral to an otolaryngologist is indicated for a biopsy.

Usually, the diagnosis of CRSwNP is confirmed at this time, and the patient should be directed towards adequate medical management. Patients whose symptoms do not improve with adequate medical therapy will need further evaluation with a PNS CT scan. Furthermore, patients with unilateral symptoms or findings should be evaluated with imaging studies as soon as possible. Surgery is considered an alternative for patients with an established diagnosis of CRSwNP who are refractory to medical management.
