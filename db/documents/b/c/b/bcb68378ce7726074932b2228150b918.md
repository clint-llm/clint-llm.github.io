Spinocerebellar ataxia is a genetic disease that has no definitive cure. Treatment is mainly symptomatic to alleviate symptoms like seizures, tremors, depression, ataxia, and eye symptoms. Antiepileptic drugs for seizures, botulinum toxin injections for dystonia, beta-blockers, and primidone for tremors, antidepressants for depression, and levodopa in parkinsonism, etc. can be utilized for symptomatic treatment. The use of N-acetyl cysteine in neurological disorders and SCA showed some benefits. Citalopram benefits by decreasing the level of ataxin-3 and improves the behavioral status of patients. Dantrolene inhibits the release of calcium from its stores and protects the Purkinje cells. Chlorzoxazone is the FDA approved activator of calcium-activated potassium channels, which normalizes the electrophysiology and action potential firing of Purkinje cells.

But any therapeutic procedure that clears the accumulated misfolded mutant protein can be a potential treatment option.

Use of antisense oligonucleotides in patients demonstrated a decrease in cerebellar ataxin expression below 75%, delayed the onset of SCA, increased firing frequency of Purkinje cells, and improvement in motor function.

NeurorehabilitationÂ and physical therapy for improving motor functions have a crucial role in the management of SCA.
