It is important to recall that patients presenting with "baggy lower eyelids" will always have worse swelling the first hour or so after waking up when they are tired and after salty meals. The rest of the time, the degree of "puffiness" or "bagginess" will vary. Therefore, there is no distinct degree of procedure that may be necessary.

**Markings**

Patients should be marked sitting up. The outlines of the three fat pads are marked, and a topographical marking is made over the individual pads, together with notes if one pad or side needs more or less attention. Careful attention is paid to the nasojugal groove and the malar groove. In most patients undergoing straight transconjunctival blepharoplasty, these grooves will not be prominent. The presence of prominent nasojugal and malar grooves indicate different surgical procedures. Sometimes, subtle grooves may be present: these should be marked in case they need filling with the patient's own fat or fillers, during or after a transconjunctival lower blepharoplasty.

**Anesthesia**

Transconjunctival blepharoplasty may be performed under local anesthesia injections or with the use of sedation or even general anesthesia. The local anesthetic injection should be in the region of the lateral canthus, the lower eyelid, and transconjunctivally into the three fat pockets. About 2 ccs of 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine per side is appropriate.

**Retraction and Incision**

A plastic corneal shield should be placed over the cornea to protect the cornea, maintain ocular surface moisture, and also prevent bright lights from distressing the patient. The lower eyelid is retracted using the smallest available Desmarres retractor: this allows the surgeon access to the inferior fornix. Under traction, an incision is made in the conjunctiva about 6 mm below the inferior tarsal border. However, other levels of making incisions have also been presented.

We have shown that the lower conjunctiva and retractors may be placed on traction using a 4-0 silk suture on a hemostat when performing this surgery: it helps expose the fat pads better and protects the cornea.

**Removal of Fat**

Again, pressure on the upper eyelid and globe will make each fat pad more prominent. The medial, central, and lateral fat pads are opened via the transconjunctival approach, and judicious removal of the fat is carried out with careful attention to obtaining hemostasis. Although some surgeons clamp the fat in a hemostat and excise the fat, others prefer to remove fat using an "open sky" technique and cauterize vessels as needed. There are prominent vessels in the orbital fat but especially so in the medial fat pad. These require careful cauterization. No forward traction is placed on the fat as this runs the risk of over-excision of the orbital fat.

The central fat pad is deeper (more inferior) than a surgeon may think. It is often necessary to palpate the inferior orbital rim and incise the tissues just above to obtain access to the central fat pad.

The lateral fat pad is the one that is most frequently inadequately removed by inexperienced surgeons. Furthermore, the lateral fat pad needs to be exposed with proper lateral lower eyelid traction and may have a firmer fascia over it than the medial fat pad. Again the relevant fat pad reductions are performed based upon the preoperative assessment. Where necessary, pedicles of fat or free fat grafts may be used during surgery if the nasojugal and malar grooves require attention.

When assessing the degree of fat reduction, it helps to have iced gauze, which may be used to press on the eyelids to reduce edema related to surgery and local anesthetic injections. By balloting the globe, one can get a dynamic impression of the prominence or otherwise of the lower lid fat. Of course, it need not be stressed that lower eyelid fat pads tend to be more apparent when the patient is sitting up and when tired or first thing in the morning. With the patient lying down, the fat "falls back," and therefore, surgical judgment is needed when performing this surgery. Conservative removal of fat and repositioning, sometimes with a septal release, to treat associated grooves is a useful technique.

**Closure**

The traction suture is removed, and the area of surgery is examined once more, looking for any bleeders. One or two buried 6-0 catgut sutures may be used to close the conjunctiva, although it is also acceptable to leave the wound open to allow the egress of any fluids. The wound closes very nicely with or without sutures. It is important not to apply ointment into the inferior fornix as granulomas may occur if the lanolin in the ointment gains access to the deeper tissues.

**Patching**

Some surgeons prefer not to patch the eyes after transconjunctival blepharoplasty. Ice packs are placed over a moist gauze or face cloth. Topical antibiotic ointment may be applied to the outer and inner corners of the eyes.

**Postoperatively**

It is common to observe the patient for a minimum of 30 minutes after surgery and examine the surgical site for any hematoma or bleeding as well as assess the patient's vision before considering discharge to home.

**Postoperative Instructions**

The patient is discharged with instructions to ice the eyelids on-and-off for the following 24 to 48 hours. Topical antibiotic eye ointment is prescribed and applied twice a day. If laser or a TCA peel has been used on the skin, appropriate moisturizing is instituted. The patient is asked to sleep with two to three pillows for the first two to three nights. The patient may bathe/wash the next day but is informed that there will be some blurry vision, especially when using the ointment. Artificial tears may be used as needed. Strict instructions are given to the patient to call the emergency number of the surgeon if there is any undue pain, bleeding, or change in vision.
