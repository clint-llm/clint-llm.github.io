Reticulocytes are immature red blood cells (RBCs) produced in the bone marrow and released into the peripheral blood, where they mature into RBCs within 1 to 2 days. An increase or decrease in reticulocyte count can be an indicator of erythropoiesis activity or failure, especially relative to anemias and bone marrow dysfunction.
