Pseudogenes play an essential role in comparative studies regarding genomics as they can provide a record of ancient genes. They are used to determine the rate of gene duplication and follow the evolution of sequence changes in organisms. Thus, pseudogenes are unique and helpful for phylogenetic studies.

Additionally, pseudogenes play essential parts in gene regulation. Research has shown that pseudogenes code for RNA transcripts that can regulate their respective parental copy genes. Through this level of regulation, pseudogene products can increase or decrease the level of expression of these parental genes and their protein products.
