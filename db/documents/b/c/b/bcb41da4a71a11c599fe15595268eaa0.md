The ameba enters the central nervous system (CNS) via the nose when freshwater enters the nasal cavity under pressure like swimming or diving. Individuals have also become infected after using a neti pot with contaminated water. Once nasal inoculation has occurred, the ameba penetrates the respiratory epithelium and olfactory mucosa. It then migrates through the cribriform plate into the CNS.N. fowleri causes extensive cortical hemorrhages, tissue necrosis, and edema in the brain tissue. Olfactory bulbs, a basilar portion of the frontal cerebri, and cerebellum tend to be the most severely affected.

N.Â fowleri elicits a significant innate immune response. Its virulence depends on the protein Nfa1, nitric oxide production, and pore-forming proteins. Nfa1 mediates amebic attachment to target cells. Feeding cups on its structure which it uses to ingest bacteria and fungi in the environment help the organism directly phagocytose the brain cells. Extensive necrosis is mediated by the secretion of cytolytic molecules like cysteine proteases, phospholipases, and phospholipolytic enzymes. The combination of the intense immune response and virulence of this organism lead to the significant destruction of brain parenchymal tissue seen in primary amebic encephalitis.
