The history and physical exam should be tailored to the age of the victim. ****

**Common Findings in Child Abuse**

The most common injuries are fractures, contusions, bruises, and internal bleeding. Unexpected injuries to pre-walking infants should be investigated. The caregiver should explain unusual injuries to the ears, neck, or torso; otherwise, these injuries should be investigated.

Children who are abused may be unkempt and/or malnourished. Some display inappropriate behavior such as aggression, while others are shy, withdrawn, and have poor communication skills. Some children may also be disruptive or hyperactive. School attendance is usually poor.

Specific injuries and associated findings include:

- Bites

- Chipped teeth

- Cigarette or cigar burns

- Craniofacial and neck injuries

- Friction burns

- Injuries at different stages of healing

- Injuries to multiple organs

Human bites can be differentiated from animal bites in that an animal bite will have torn flesh. In a human bite, the intercanine distance is usually greater than three centimeters.

Approximately one in three women and one in five men will be victims of abuse. The most common sites of injuries are the head, neck, and face. Clothes may cover injuries to the body, breasts, genitals, rectum, and buttocks. One should be suspicious if the history is not consistent with the injury. Defensive injuries may be present on the forearms and hands. The patient may have psychological signs and symptoms such as anxiety, depression, and fatigue.

**Abuse during Pregnancy
**

Abuse during pregnancy may cause as many as 10% of hospital admissions in this population. There are a number of historical and physical findings that may help the provider identify individuals at risk.

- The abuser, if present, may be overly solicitous, answering questions, being hostile, refusing to leave the bedside, and correcting responses to questions.

- Anxiety or depression

- Chronic unexplained pain

- Distrust

- Flat affect

- Fright

- High parity

- Substance abuse

- Suicide attempts

- Late prenatal care

- Multiple emergency department or office visits

- Overcompliance

- Post-traumatic stress symptoms

- Prior history of abuse

If the examiner encounters these signs or symptoms, she should make every effort to examine the patient in private, explaining confidentiality to the patient. Be sure to ask caring, empathetic questions and listen politely without interruption to answers.

**Same Sex Abuse
**

Same-sex partner abuse is common and may be difficult to identify. Over 35% of heterosexual woman, 40% of lesbians, 60% of bisexual woman experience domestic violence. For men, the incidence is slightly lower. In addition to common findings of abuse, perpetrators may try to control their partners by threatening to make their sexual preferences public.

The provider should be aware there are fewer resources available to help individuals that are victims; further, the perpetrator and victim may have the same friends or support groups.

**Abuse in Men
**

Men represent as much as 15% of all cases of domestic partner violence. Male victims are also less likely to seek medical care so the incidence may be underreported. These victims may have a history of child abuse.

**Abuse in Elders**

Health professionals should ask geriatric patients about abuse, even if signs are absent.

Risk Factors

- Dementia

- Pathologic characteristics of perpetrators including dementia, mental illness, and drug and alcohol abuse

- A shared living situation with the abuser

- Social isolation

Healthcare providers should always maintain a high index of suspicion.

When evaluating a patient for elder abuse ask simple questions in a non-threatening manner. Interview the patient and caregiver separately to detect disparities. Documentation should be accurate and objective. Be aware documentation may be used in criminal trials or guardianship hearings. Documentation should be accurate, complete, legible, and thorough. Quoting direct patient statements is helpful.

As part of the examination, disrobe the patient to evaluate for injuries. Make sure to evaluate for back injuries, contusions, bruises, and decubitus ulcers.

The following clinical findings should prompt more investigation:

- Agitation

- Bruises

- Burns

- Decubitus ulcers

- Dehydration

- Depression

- Injuries in various stages of evolution

- Lacerations

- Unexplained injuries

- Treatment delays

- Inconsistent injury to the history

- Poor hygiene

- Contradictory caregiver and patient explanations

- Laboratory findings indicating not taking, underdosing, or overdosage of medications

- Rope marks

- Venereal disease

- Welts

During the physical examination, document the size, shape, and injury location. Take pictures or draw sketches.

The health provider should be that aware elder abuse by caregivers is a common problem that can occur in both home and institutional settings. Factors that increase the risk of elder abuse by caregivers include poor training, stress, burnout, a heavy workload, low pay, and low job satisfaction.
