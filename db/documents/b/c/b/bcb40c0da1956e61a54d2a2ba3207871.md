Since carotid vessels are superficial, a high-frequency linear transducer operating between 5.0 to 7.5 MHz is used. This is because the frequency of the ultrasound probe is inversely proportional to the depth of insonation. Doppler US is usually performed in combination with grayscale imaging. Grayscale images are obtained with a 5.0 to 12.0 MHz transducer.
