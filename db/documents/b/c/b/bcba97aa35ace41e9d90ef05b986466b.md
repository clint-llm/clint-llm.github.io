The diagnosis of myelomeningocele is possible in the first trimester of pregnancy. Amniocentesis is helpful and usually favored for high-risk patients. For instance, there are reports of elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein in amniotic fluid samples in patients with anencephaly and myelomeningocele.

Various signs can be detected through ultrasound and can be seen in spina bifida, especially in Arnold-Chiari II malformation such as banana and lemon signs. Banana sign is usually seen at the posterior fossa when the cerebellar hemispheres are elongated, compressed, and displaced downward resembling the shape of a banana. This sign can also be associated with obliterated cisterna magna. However, the lemon sign refers to an abnormal convexity and indentation of the frontal bones correlated with ventriculomegaly.

Other cranial features of spina bifida that are visible through ultrasound include hydrocephalus, microcephaly, small-shaped cerebellum, and abnormal cranial bones. The presence of chromosomal anomalies, as well as dilated renal tract or talipes, are other associated conditions that might be detectable through an ultrasound. Fetal karyotyping and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could also be an option if the tests were not sufficient for the diagnosis.
