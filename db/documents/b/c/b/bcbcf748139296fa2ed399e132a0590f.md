Stroke is the world's second-largest cause of death and a major cause of disability. There are almost 800,000 patients in the United States who suffer from an acute stroke every year. Of these strokes, 83 percent are ischemic strokes. 20 to 25% of ischemic strokes occur due to vertebrobasilar artery occlusion (posterior circulation). A variety of neurological syndromes can occur in posterior circulation stroke, medial medullary syndrome is one of them and is a rare cause of ischemic stroke. Approximately 1% of cerebral infarction is due to medial medullary syndrome.
