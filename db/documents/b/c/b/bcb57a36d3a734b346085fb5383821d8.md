Individuals should communicate to their primary care provider when taking Bacopa monniera. The provider may need to discuss this with a pharmacist regarding other medications the patient is taking. Bacopa has cholinergic properties and may increase the chance of side effects with cholinergic drugs (acetylcholine, methacholine, bethanechol) due to an additive effect. Bacopa may also decrease the effectiveness of anticholinergic medications such as atropine or belladonna alkaloids.

Bacopa is known to cause non-competitive inhibition of several cytochrome P450 enzymes (1A2 (CYP1A2), 2C19 (CYP2C19), 2C9 (CYP2C9), 3A4 (CYP3A4)).

T4 concentration was increased with the use of Bacopa extract. Consuming Bacopa concomitantly with thyroid hormone may result in too much thyroid hormone and increase the potential for adverse effects.
