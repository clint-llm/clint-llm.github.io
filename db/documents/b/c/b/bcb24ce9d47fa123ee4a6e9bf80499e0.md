Shoulder pain remains one of the most common outpatient musculoskeletal complaints with a prevalence of between 7% and 26% at any one time.

Amongst the different clinical indications for a steroid injection, the particular usefulness of its application in the treatment of adhesive capsulitis is important. Adhesive capsulitis or so-called "frozen shoulder" is a self-limiting clinical entity with a benign and self-resolving course.

Fluoroscopic guidance for injections described in this article helps in avoiding critical structures of the shoulder girdle with enhanced needle guidance through the rotator cuff interval. Image guidance helps avoid the labrum, long head of the biceps tendon, the subscapularis tendon, and the supraspinatus tendon. Thus, potential morbidity associated with the procedure without image guidance is avoidable.
