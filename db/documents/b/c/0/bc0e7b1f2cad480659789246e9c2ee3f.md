Good management and outcome of PDS rest on multidisciplinary and interprofessional collaboration and a team-centered approach. It is the moral responsibility of ophthalmologists and glaucoma specialists to timely treat and counsel patients. The nursing team plays a crucial role in outpatient management, operating room management and assistance during filtration surgery, counseling patients regarding medication use, and regular follow-up. Additionally, pharmacists play a crucial role in arranging antiglaucoma drugs and explaining the need for regular topical drug application.

Any cataract or retinal complications should be managed with a cataract and IOL surgeon and a retinal surgeon, respectively. The internists or the clinician play a key in the systemic management of these patients concerning diabetes mellitus, hypertension, renal disease, or cardiac issue. It is the responsibility of the internist or the physician to monitor the systemic parameters while the patient is undergoing filtration surgery for a safe outcome. So, in summary, a good outcome of PDS and PG is dependent on anÂ interprofessional approach.
