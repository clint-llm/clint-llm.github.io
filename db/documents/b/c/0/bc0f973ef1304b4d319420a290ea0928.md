Having a thorough understanding of the complexity of anesthesia breathing systems should be perfected by all anesthetists and members of the anesthesia care team. Attending anesthesiologists, anesthesia residents, certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNA), certified anesthesiologist assistants (CAA), and anesthesia technologists/technicians should be knowledgeable regarding the function, performance, technique for use, and disadvantages for each system.

Each of these anesthesia providers must be held accountable for this knowledge as anesthesia is consistently delivered to patients by a team of providers rather than individual clinicians. At any point in delivering an anesthetic, all anesthetists should have a comprehensive understanding of the anesthesia breathing system to ensure proper function, troubleshoot errors, and employ alternative breathing systems as needed to guarantee the safety of each patient is made a priority. This is vital to enhancing patient-centered care and improving perioperative medicine outcomes for patients.
