Cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) is a rare, life-threatening disorder that can complicate facial infection, sinusitis, orbital cellulitis, pharyngitis, or otitis or following traumatic injury or surgery, especially in the setting of a thrombophilic disorder. Early recognition of cavernousÂ sinus thrombosis which, often presents with fever, headache, eye findings such as periorbital swelling, and ophthalmoplegia, is critical for a good outcome. Despite modern treatment with antibiotics and anticoagulation, the risk of long-term sequelae, such as vision, diplopia, and stroke, remains significant.
