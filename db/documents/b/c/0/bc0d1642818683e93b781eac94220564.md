Over the past two decades, simulation has moved into the forefront of medical education. Top healthcare systems and schools are seeking simulation center managers for their expertise in simulation, not only for the training of staff within the walls of the simulation lab, but for the identification of latent safety threats within the health system (in situ simulations), testing preparedness for rarely used equipment and protocols, translational outcomes improving patient care, improving patient safety, decreasing medicolegal risk, improving recruitment and retention of staff, and the development of novel educational methods.

There are many different roles and responsibilities of a simulation center manager.  These leaders provide leadership to carry out the overall institution’s strategic mission and goals focused on improving the knowledge, skills, and abilities of healthcare professional learners and, ultimately, patient care. They must maintain simulation best practices such as the International Nursing Association for Clinical Simulation in Learning (INACSL) standards.
