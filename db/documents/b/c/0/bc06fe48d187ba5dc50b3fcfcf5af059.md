Alopecia areata is commonly encountered by the primary care provider and nurse practitioner. Beause there is no good treatment, it is important to educate the patient that leaving it alone is as good an option to any treatment. If the patient prefers treatment, then a referral to a dermatologist is highly recommended. The outlook for most patients is good with or without treatment. However, because of the poor cosmesis, some people may become withdrawn and depressed.
