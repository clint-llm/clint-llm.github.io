The mainstay therapy for Wilson disease is copper chelation therapy with penicillamine and trientine. Trientine is preferred because of fewer side effects. Oral zinc also may be given as it competes for absorption with copper at metallic ion transporter. It is vital to educate the patient on the adverse effects of chronic chelation therapy which can make symptoms worse. D-penicillamine can be used during pregnancy and does not pose any risk to the fetus

If the patient develops liver cirrhosis and its associated complication, Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt(TIPS) can be offered for recurrent variceal bleed. Liver transplantation is curative.

For muscle rigidity, spasticity, and parkinsonian features, baclofen, anticholinergics(trihexyphenidyl), GABA antagonists, and levodopa may be used.

Liver transplantation seemed to have been beneficial in improving neurological dysfunction in some patients not responding adequately to medical therapy in a French study

A diet low in copper-containing foods is recommended with avoidance of mushrooms, chocolate, nuts, dried fruit, liver, and shellfish.

Physiotherapy and occupational therapy are beneficial in the neurologic form of the disease. The copper-chelating treatment takes up to six months to start working, and these therapies can assist in coping with ataxia, dystonia, and tremors as well as preventing contractures that can result from dystonia.
