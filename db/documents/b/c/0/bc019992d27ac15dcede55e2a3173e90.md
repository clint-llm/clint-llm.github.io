The majority of patients with a pneumothorax first present to the emergency department and hence the triage nurse, emergency room nurse and physician need to know about its presentation and treatment. The majority of simple and small pneumothorax can be managed conservatively without any treatment, as long as they are reliable in follow up. Repeat chest x-rays are required to ensure that the condition is resolving. Unlike the past, today, there are small portable pneumothorax kits which can be used to treat the disorder-the small size tubes are easy to insert and much less painful, compared to the chest tubes. When chest tubes are inserted, patients do not need admission. With spontaneous pneumothorax, there is a recurrence rate of 14-30% over three years. Recurrences are most common in smokers, patients with COPD and AIDs. In most patients, recurrences are treated with video-assistedÂ thoracoscopy. Tension pneumothorax can occur in some patients and if not recognized can lead to death. Patients with a spontaneous pneumothorax should be urged to quit smoking and avoid air travel or travel to areas where medical care is not readily accessible.
