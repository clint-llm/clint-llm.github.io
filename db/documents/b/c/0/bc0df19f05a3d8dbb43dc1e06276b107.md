PPI contraindications include patients with known hypersensitivity to that class of drugs, and their use requires caution in patients with severe hepatic disease. As mentioned above, PPIs undergo metabolism by the cytochrome P450 system of the liver, mostly by CYP2C19; hence, any severe dysfunction in this metabolization serves as a relative contraindication. That said, clinically, clinicians often use PPIs in patients with severe liver disease with increased monitoring.Â PPIs can also alter the activity of specific cytochrome enzymes and delay the clearance of certain drugs such as phenytoin, warfarin, and diazepam. As such, the use of these drugs requires caution in those undergoing PPI therapy. Furthermore, the stomach's acidic environment is necessary for the effective absorption of ketoconazole, and it is advisable to use other antifungals in the setting of long-term PPI use. Conversely, the same acidic environment potentiates the absorption of digoxin, and thus this drug's use merits extreme caution due to the severity of its side-effect profile.
