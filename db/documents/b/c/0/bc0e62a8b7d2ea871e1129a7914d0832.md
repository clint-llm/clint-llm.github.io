The initial belief was that Scarpa fascia prevented hernia formation, but this is not true. The fascia is not strong at all. Today the thinking is that the superficial fascia acts as a scaffolding that attaches the abdominal wall skin to the deeper layers so that there is no sagging.

During certain medical disorders including acute pancreatitis, fluid may collect in pockets created by fascial planes, or if there is a rupture, one may see bruising as in Grey Turner sign or Cullen sign. Skin discoloration (Grey Turner sign) boundaries observed in extraperitoneal hemorrhage correlate with the firm attachment sites of the Scarpa's fascia to the external oblique aponeurosis.

Trauma or surgery can lead to scar tissue formation or adhesions that spans adjacent structures. Due to the presence of such scar tissues, fascia can eventually fail to make the original connections between structures. In some cases, fascial stiffness may also undergo alteration, causing reduced shearing ability.
