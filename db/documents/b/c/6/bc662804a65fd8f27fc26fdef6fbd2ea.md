Bone pain is the most commonly reported adverse effect of filgrastim.

A systematic literature review by Dale et al. reported bone pain and other musculoskeletal symptoms as being the most common adverse effect of filgrastim while also noting the incidence of other adverse effects that were not as significant in comparison.

The various adverse reactions noted in clinical trials that can occur in the different subsets of patients for which filgrastim is indicated include:

- **Cancer patients receiving myelosuppressive therapy**- Arthralgia, back pain, bone pain, nausea, chest pain, fatigue, pyrexia, dizziness, cough, dyspnea, rash, thrombocytopenia, elevated LDH, elevated alkaline phosphatase.

- **AML patients receiving induction/consolidation chemotherapy**- Back pain, pain in extremity, erythema, maculopapular rash, epistaxis. In patients with sequelae of underlying malignancy/ cytotoxic chemotherapy- Diarrhea, constipation, transfusion reaction.

- **Patients with non-myeloid malignancies undergoing myeloablative therapy following Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT)**- Rash, hypersensitivity. In patients receiving intensive chemotherapy followed by autologous BMT - hypertension, sepsis, bronchitis, insomnia, anemia, thrombocytopenia.

- **Patients undergoing peripheral****blood progenitor collection and therapy**- Headache, bone pain, pyrexia, elevated alkaline phosphatase.

- **Patients with severe chronic neutropenia**- arthralgia, back pain, bone pain, muscle spasms, pain in extremity, chest pain, diarrhea, alopecia, epistaxis, hypoesthesia, splenomegaly, anemia
- Although total infection rates were significantly lower in filgrastim-treated patients, the incidence of upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infections was higher compared to placebo.

**Other Adverse Effects reported since Filgrastim's Approval are as Follows**

- Aortitis

- Capillary leak syndrome

- Cutaneous vasculitis

- Decreased bone density/Osteoporosis

- Glomerulonephritis

- Leukocytosis

- Pulmonary toxicity - ARDS, alveolar hemorrhage/Hemoptysis

- Severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis

- Sickle Cell disorders - severe sickle cell crisis has been reported in some filgrastim-treated sickle cell patients

- Splenomegaly/Splenic rupture - Filgrastim-treated patients with symptoms of abdominal pain, especially LUQ, require evaluation.

- Sweet syndrome

There is limited data on the incidence or frequency of these adverse effects. There have been a few reports of incidence of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and/or myelodysplastic syndrome in certain populations receiving filgrastim, especially patients with congenital neutropenia. The Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry published a 10-year report in 2003 on the incidence of AML/myelodysplastic syndrome occurring in 35 of 387 patients with congenital neutropenia, but with no established relationship to the dose and duration of filgrastim.
