Chemical burns are the result of exposure to a variety of substances commonly found at home, the workplace, and the surrounding environment. The burn may be obvious, for example, from a direct spill or other exposure, or more covert, especially in children. Chemical burns can cause short-term, long-term, and lifelong health problems, especially if undertreated. Occasionally, they can result in premature death, especially if ingested in an attempt to self-harm.

Common causes of chemical burns include the following:

- Acids: Sulfuric, nitric, hydrofluoric, hydrochloric, acetic acid, formic, phosphoric, phenols, and chloroacetic acid

- Bases: Sodium and potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, sodium and calcium hypochlorite, ammonia, phosphates, silicated, sodium carbonate, lithium hydride

- Oxidants: Bleaches like chlorites used in the home, peroxides, chromates, magnates

- Miscellaneous: White phosphorus, metals, hair coloring agents, airbag injuries

- Vesicants like mustard gas
