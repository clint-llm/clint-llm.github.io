Screening questionnaires such as the Brief Grief Questionnaire (BGQ) and the Inventory of complicated grief (ICG) can reliably identify complicated grief.

The grief evaluation measure (GEM) can also assist in identifying the development of complicated grief symptoms in a mourning adult.

It provides in-depth information on bereaved individuals' subjective grief symptoms and associated experience.
