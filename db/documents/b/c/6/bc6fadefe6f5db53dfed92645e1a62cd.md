Check your local institutions for radiation exposure protocols. Many hospitals have disaster committees with protocols in place for radiation exposures. If your hospital has a nuclear medicine department, they are an excellent source of information on radiation and the treatment of exposure. Several federal agencies have information on radiation disasters. These include Â U.S. Homeland Security and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
