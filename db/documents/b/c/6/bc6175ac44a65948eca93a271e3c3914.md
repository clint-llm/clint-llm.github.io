Similar to other first-generation, or typical antipsychotics, thioridazine is a medication with FDA approval to treat schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

It is not a first-line therapeutic choice for schizophrenia due to its adverse event profile. The brand-name version of this medication was withdrawn by its manufacturer from the market worldwide in 2005 because of adverse effects, notably cardiac arrhythmias., although generic versions remain available.

Thioridazine combined with other antibiotics has been shown to be effective against drug-resistant tuberculosis, although there is no trial data to support its use for this indication.
