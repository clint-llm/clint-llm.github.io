The differential diagnosis of type II hypersensitivity reactions largely depends on the presentation patterns specific to each disease category. In addition, knowledge of the other different types of hypersensitivity reactions and the clinical presentations of each is essential.

The following are the most common examples:

- Hemolytic anemias

- Cytopenias (thrombocytopenia- neutropenia)

- Drug toxicities

- Autoimmune diseases

- Allergic reactions

- Infections

- Endocrinopathies

- Neuromuscular disorders (congenital, familial, degenerative, inflammatory, iatrogenic, neoplastic, and autoimmune)

- Valvular heart disease
