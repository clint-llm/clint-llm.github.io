There are no known means of preventing granulosa theca cell tumors of the ovary. Patients should be counseled preoperatively about the planned procedure for benign, malignant, or indeterminate intraoperative findings and issues regarding fertility preservation, which should be documented in the medical records.Â In patients who opt for fertility preservation, issues regarding incomplete staging, and the potential need for further surgery if the definitive diagnosis is malignant, should be discussed. The need for life-long follow-up should be emphasized and thoroughly discussed with the patient, as these tumors tend to have late recurrences, sometimes even after a disease-free interval of 30 years.
