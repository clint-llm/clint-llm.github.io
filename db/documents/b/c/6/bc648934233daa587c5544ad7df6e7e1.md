Pernicious anemia is a complex disease, with a clear autoimmune basis. The anemia isÂ megaloblastic and is caused by vitamin B12 deficiency secondary to intrinsic factor (IF) deficiency.

Pernicious anemia is found in up to 25% of patients with autoimmune gastritis (AIG), which affects the corpus and fundus, spares the antrum, and is characterized by antiparietal cell antibodies destroying parietal cells located only in the oxyntic mucosa, which produce IF and hydrochloric acid. In turn, achlorhydria causes a decrease in the release of cobalamin bound to dietary protein, and fewer parietal cells are available to produce the IF needed for dietary B12 absorption. The term pernicious anemia has been used at times as a synonym for AIG; however, it is considered a late-stage manifestation as a part of the AIG clinical spectrum.

Patients with pernicious anemia also have a higher incidence of co-occurring autoimmune disorders, including diabetes mellitus type 1, autoimmune thyroid disease, and vitiligo.

Whether or not Helicobacter pylori plays a causative role in pernicious anemia is unclear.
