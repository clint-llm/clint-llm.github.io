The main arterial supply to the leg and foot is the femoral artery which passes through the adductor hiatus in the thigh to become the popliteal artery. The popliteal artery travels through the popliteal fossa on the posterior aspect of the knee joint, before ending in two main branches: the anterior tibial artery and the tibioperoneal trunk (tibial artery). The tibioperoneal trunk then branches into the posterior tibial artery, and peroneal artery. The anterior tibial artery is most commonly the first branch and courses through the interosseous membrane, continuing down the anterior compartment of the leg and running along with the deep peroneal nerve. Â It ultimately becomes the dorsalis pedis artery (DPA) as it crosses over the ankle joint.
