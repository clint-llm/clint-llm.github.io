Right heart catheterization is commonly performed by accessing the common femoral vein in the leg, the internal jugular vein in the neck, or the antecubital veins in the arm. In the leg, the femoral vein becomes the external iliac vein and then drains into the inferior vena cava, draining into the right atrium.
