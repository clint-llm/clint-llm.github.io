Further evaluation beyond history and physical are rarely necessary for most cases of notalgia paresthetica. Imaging studies such as X-rays, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging are not required to establish aÂ diagnosis. Imaging may be appropriate in patients presenting with additional musculoskeletal or neurological complaints. Thus, the diagnosis of notalgia paresthetica is primarily through a thorough history and physical examination.
