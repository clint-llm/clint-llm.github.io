- Pain physician visit - evaluation/patient selection process to determine if the patient's pain syndrome would benefit from neuromodulation and if they have exhausted conservative therapy.

- Psychological evaluation - active or untreated psychological disorders can lead to poor outcomes, and a licensed psychiatric professional can help determine if a patient would be an ideal candidate for a spinal cord stimulator.

- Diagnostic imaging - Ideally, MRI imaging of the epidural space and anatomy of the lead's final location helps plan the approach and provides diagnostic value to a patientâ€™s pain distribution.

- Trial stimulation - a trial with one or more implanted leads connected to an external IPG allows the patient to determine if all pain areas are covered and if he or she has at least 50% decreased pain and or 50% increased functionality.

- Permanent implantation - reimplantation of one or more leads and IPG.
