It is essential to recognize the risk of recurrence of pheochromocytomas. This risk is present in sporadic as well as familial cases.Â In a study of 192 patients with pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas, the recurrence risk was higher in familial, right adrenal, and extra-adrenal tumors.

As estimated by a recent meta-analysis, the recurrence rate after curative surgery appears to be low at 3% at a mean follow-up of 77 months.
