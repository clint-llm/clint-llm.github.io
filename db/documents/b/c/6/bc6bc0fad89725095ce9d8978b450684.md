Patients should have monitoring for respiratory depression, benzodiazepine withdrawal, and other residual effects of benzodiazepines for at least 2 hours.

Seizures may occur secondary to flumazenil administration. Seizures induced by flumazenil may require larger doses of benzodiazepine.

Monitor the patient for the possible return of sedation, mostly in those who are tolerant of benzodiazepines or in the case of long-acting benzodiazepine overdose. Re-sedation may be treated in adults by administering flumazenil again until theÂ therapeutic effect is achieved.
