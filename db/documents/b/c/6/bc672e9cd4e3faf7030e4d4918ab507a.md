Any patient suspected of myocardial ischemia or infarction should undergo an evaluation with EKG and measurement of cardiac biomarkers.

EKG changes - Anterior wall ischemia/infarction presents as ST elevation in some or all of leads V1 through V6. In anterior MI, the EKG is useful to predict the LAD occlusion site relative to its major side branches.

Lab studies should include troponins, a complete metabolic panel, a complete blood count, B-type natriuretic peptide, and a coagulation profile.

A chest X-ray (CXR) should be obtained, and bedside echocardiography should be a consideration if available. CXR helps in the diagnosis of pulmonary edema. The presence of pulmonary edema confers a poor prognosis. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) can help diagnose acute MI by wall motion abnormalities and rule out alternate causes of chest pain like pericardial effusion, aortic valve stenosis, and aortic dissection. ItÂ can also estimate left ventricle ejection fraction, which also helps to estimate prognosis. This testing not only helps in diagnosis but also provides prognostic information.
