The distal humerus can be conceptualized into medial and lateral columns, both with their corresponding epicondyles as well as the condyles which make up the articular surface. The articular surface is made up of the capitellum as well as the trochlea which project anteriorly. The distal humerus is often thought of like a triangle with these two separate columns; this explains why there is often a need for bicolumnar fixation for mist fracture patterns.
