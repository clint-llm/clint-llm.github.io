When the hymen, a thin membrane of stratified squamous epithelium circumscribing the vaginal introitus, does not spontaneously rupture during neonatal development, it is referred to as an imperforate hymen. An imperforate hymen can present with obstructive symptoms of the female genital and urinary tract during the perinatal, pediatric, or adolescent years and is a rare cause of primary amenorrhea. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of imperforate hymen and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of the imperforate hymen in the setting of female urogenital development.
- Outline the presentation of a patient with an imperforate hymen.
- Summarize the various methods and alternatives to imperforate hymen treatment.
- Discuss the importance of collaboration among the interprofessional team with the parents and patient to promote timely treatment of an imperforate hymen and maintain post-surgical follow-up to monitor for potential complications and fertility morbidity.
