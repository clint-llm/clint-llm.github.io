Regional modalities can significantly decrease the requirements of opioids for surgical pain relief. This is noteworthy in the face of a nationwide opioid epidemic. Adequate management of acute surgical pain also halts transition to chronic pain, which significantly impairs quality of life and results in long-term opioid use. In addition, regional anesthesia is an integral component of many enhanced recovery strategies aimed to accelerate postoperative recovery and minimize the length of hospital stay. This ultimately translates to improved patient and parent satisfaction and decreased healthcare costs for the system.

Regional anesthesia for pediatric patients requires the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team that includes the clinician, NPs and PAs, anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists, and OR nursing staff, coordinating their activities and monitoring patient response to achieve optimal outcomes with minimal adverse events.
