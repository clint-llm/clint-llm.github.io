Segmental lung resection is an important component of the lung cancer treatment apparatus. Interprofessional communication is imperative for maximizing the number of patients reached and receiving appropriate care. This begins with primary care providers encouraging healthy lifestyle choices and following screening guidelines. Once identified, a system must be in place to quickly mobilize the workup or follow-up concerning screening findings.

Following the identification of likely lung cancer, the patient should be brought before a multidisciplinary lung cancer board to discuss the course of treatment. Perioperative care will include a thoracic surgeon team, anesthesia, nursing staff, physical therapy, occupational therapy, respiratory therapy, and social workers. Creating a system that follows screening guidelines and quickly moves patients through the workup will, in conjunction with appropriate surgical planning and execution, lead to improved results via identification and treatment of earlier-stage disease.
