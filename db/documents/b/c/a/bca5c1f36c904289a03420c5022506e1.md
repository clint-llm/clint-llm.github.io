Variation in the region of attachment of the palatoglossus muscle in the soft palate has been observed. In some individuals, this region is near the uvula. In such cases, the mechanical ability of the palatoglossus muscle in elevating the tongue may be limited due to the lack of a rigid anchoring point towards which the tongue elevates. However, this attachment is favorable to lower the soft palate. This action is based on a class II lever system where the load (the bulk of soft palate) is present between the fulcrum (the posterior rim of the hard palate) and the force applied (action of the palatoglossus muscle). In some individuals, the attachment area of the muscle is relatively large into the anterior portion of the velum. In such instances, a considerable increase in the ability of the muscle to elevate the tongue exists. However, this attachment is not favorable to lower the soft palate. This action is based on a class III lever system where the force applied lies between the load and the fulcrum. The primary mechanism in these individuals to approximate the tongue and soft palate during swallowing is tongue elevation rather than lowering of the soft palate.
