Dextrocardia by itself (also termed as isolated dextrocardia) is asymptomatic, whereas dextrocardia with situs inversus and Kartagener syndrome can have a multitude of symptoms depending on the accompanying abnormalities. The history of these patients might reveal the following symptoms.

- Cyanosis

- Dyspnea

- Failure to thrive

- Fatigue

- Jaundice

- Pallor

- Decreased exercise tolerance

- Repeated sinus or lung infections

- Hydrocephalus

- Arrhythmias, especially atrioventricular (AV) blocks

- Intestinal obstruction

The physical examination of a patient with dextrocardia might reveal cyanosis, clubbing, a prominent apical impulse on the right side of the chest, and easily audible heart sounds on the right side of the chest.
