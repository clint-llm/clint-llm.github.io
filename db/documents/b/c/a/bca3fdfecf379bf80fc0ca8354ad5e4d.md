The administration of neuromuscular blocking agents is most effective via an intravenous or intramuscular route. NMBAs are poorly absorbed if administered orally.

The dosing scalar for NMBA is based on ideal body weight to prevent overdosing, prolonged and undesired paralysis.

Underdosing NMBA can lead to inadequate paralysis. The recommendation is that adequate sedation and analgesia be provided before the administration of NMBA.
