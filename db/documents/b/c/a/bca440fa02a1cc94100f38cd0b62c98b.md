The glossopharyngeal nerve has its origin in the medulla oblongata and exits the skull via the jugular foramen, which is where the tympanic nerve branches off to give parasympathetic innervation to the parotid gland. After the jugular foramen are the superior and inferior ganglia, which house the cell bodies of the sensory fibers, and then the nerve descends the neck, where it provides innervation to the stylopharyngeus and sensation to the carotid sinus and body. It terminates in the pharynx between the superior and middle pharyngeal constrictors, splitting into its other branches – lingual, pharyngeal, and tonsillar.

The branches of the glossopharyngeal nerve are:

- **Tympanic nerve**(AKA nerve of Jacobson) – carries parasympathetic fibers and eventually becomes the lesser petrosal nerve, exiting the skull via the foramen ovale and synapses in the otic ganglion

- **Stylopharyngeal nerve**– provides motor innervation to the stylopharyngeus muscle

- **The nerve to carotid sinus**– communicates with the vagus nerve to carry signals from the baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and chemoreceptors in the carotid body - this helps in regulating blood pressure (carotid sinus) and monitoring blood oxygen and CO2 levels (carotid body)

- **Pharyngeal branches**– join with the pharyngeal branches of the vagus nerve and sympathetic nerves to form the pharyngeal plexus, which innervates the muscles of the pharynx

- **Tonsillar branches**– provides sensory innervation to the palatine tonsil

- **Lingual branches**– supply the vallate papillae, mucous membrane, and follicular glands of the posterior tongue
