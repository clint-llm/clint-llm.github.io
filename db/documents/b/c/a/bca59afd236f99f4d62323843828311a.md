Understanding how the placebo responses form is vital for clinical practice and can play a crucial role in determining the patient's therapeutic outcome. Although placebo effects frequently occur in clinical practice, they often go underrecognized. The therapeutic rituals and the psychosocial context surrounding the patient can mediate a placebo effect. The placebo effect is considered a melting pot of ideas in neuroscience. Translating the knowledge of the placebo effect to benefit the patient requires a thorough evaluation of the clinical effectiveness of the intended effect. Therefore, attempts to generate beneficial placebo responses should be done only under strict professional, legal, and ethical norms after obtaining appropriate informed consent.

Placebo effects have been a subject of ethical concern in clinical practice as well. Additionally, the ethical dimensions of placebo-controlled trials, such as using sham invasive procedures, withholding potential proven treatments, or deception, are issues of concern in studying the placebo effect.
