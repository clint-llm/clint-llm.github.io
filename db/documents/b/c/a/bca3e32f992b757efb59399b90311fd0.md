Initial management should always be closed reduction. The reduction can help decrease pain and swelling as well as taking pressure off of soft tissue and neurovascular structures. Anterior elbow dislocations require modification to the typical elbow reduction maneuvers.

In most cases, the patient will need intravenous sedation to relax the muscles allowing for proper manipulation for reduction. Once the patient is adequately sedated, traction should be applied to the arm. Ideally, there are two providers pulling traction, one on the forearm with the other pulling counter traction on the humerus. For an anterior elbow dislocation, the reduction is performed by flexing the elbow while pulling traction and applying a downward force on the proximal forearm.

The patient should remain splinted and follow up in five to ten days from the time of reduction.
