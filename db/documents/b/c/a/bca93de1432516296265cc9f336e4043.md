In a comprehensive review of all published cases of superior oblique myokymia, Zhang et al. reviewed the findings in 116 cases and found the following:

- Age at the time of examination ranged from 17 to 72 years (mean 42 years).

- The age of presentation was the same for men and women.

- Half the patients presented between the ages of 31 and 50 years, regardless of sex.

- Most tended to be young, healthy adults.

- SOM more commonly affects the right eye (61%).

- The right-sided predominance was statistically significant in women but not in men.

- The sexes are equally affected.

- SOM was unilateral in all cases.

- In MRI studies, there is no anatomical asymmetry of the trochlear nerve or the superior cerebellar arteries.
