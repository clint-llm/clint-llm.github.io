Chronic cholecystitis is a prolonged, subacute condition caused by the mechanical or functional dysfunction of the emptying of the gallbladder. It presents with chronic symptomatology that can be accompanied by acute exacerbations of more pronounced symptoms (acute biliary colic), or it can progress to a more severe form of cholecystitis requiring urgent intervention (acute cholecystitis). This activity reviews the pathophysiology of chronic cholecystitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Recall the cause of chronic cholecystitis.
- Describe the workup of a patient with suspected chronic cholecystitis.
- Summarize the treatment options for chronic cholecystitis.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by chronic cholecystitis.
