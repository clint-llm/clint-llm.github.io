Depending on the study chosen, there are different normal and critical findings found in nuclear medicine. Normal findings arise when radiotracer is injected and interacts with the body in a predictable pattern. For example, in a bone scan, the radiotracer's uptake into bones should be symmetrical throughout the skeleton, with exceptions in the acromioclavicular joints and sacroiliac joints, a slight increase of uptake should be expected.
