Isthmic spondylolisthesis with low back pain should initially be managed conservatively. Activity modification, NSAIDs, muscle relaxers, physical therapy, and epidural steroid injections are some of the conservative options. Â Should the back pain persist despite conservative management, or if the severity is such that quality of life is significantly affected, then referral to a specialist for evaluation is indicated. When the presentation consists of symptoms of neurogenic claudication or radiculopathy, then imaging of the neural elements of the lumbar spine is indicated along with referral to a specialist. Surgical treatment options consist of decompression of the neural elements alone versus decompression with internal fixation for bony fusion to prevent further subluxation
