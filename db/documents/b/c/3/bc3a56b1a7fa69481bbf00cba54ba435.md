In general, the treatment for a large AP window is surgical patch closure, and the results are generally good when the repair occurs early in infancy.

Anticongestive medications such as diuretics (e.g., furosemide and chlorothiazide) and digoxin can provide temporary symptomatic improvement but should not significantly alter the course of the disease. Afterload reduction can be considered with ACE inhibition. Medical therapy should be approached with caution, as there can be abnormal renal perfusion. Surgery should be considered at the time of diagnosis as there will likely be little growth with this physiology, and there is a risk of developing irreversible pulmonary hypertension over time. Furthermore, the AP window does not restrict or get hemodynamically less significant over time. In general, surgery involves separating the great arteries with either suture division or patch closure of the aorta and pulmonary artery, with low surgical mortality.

Catheterization can be considered when a defect is small enough to allow for device closure without causing stenosis of the great arteries or interference with the semilunar valves. If other cardiac defects are present, repair or palliation of the other defects should obviously occur at the same operation. Postoperative aorta, rarely, and pulmonary artery stenosis in the main and branch pulmonary arteries, more commonly, can occur. If this stenosis is hemodynamically important, future cardiac catheterization with balloon angioplasty or stent implantation can be employed. Â Furthermore, in the setting of interrupted aortic arch repair, transcatheter aortic interventions for residual arch obstruction could be necessary.
