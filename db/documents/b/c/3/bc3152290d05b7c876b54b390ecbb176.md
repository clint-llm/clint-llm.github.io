Mature cystic teratomas are unilocular in  88% of the cases with a cystic cavity lined by squamous epithelium. The cyst is predominantly filled with sebaceous material that is liquid at body temperature and solidifies at room temperature. The size of these tumors varies from very tiny cystic masses to as large as greater than 39cm, with 80% measuring 10cm or less.

On gross appearance, these lesions do not have a characteristic shape or size as it depends on the microscopic heterogeneity of the contents. Hair, teeth, and bones are easily identifiable on gross examination. Microscopic examination of the contents confirms the diagnosis by identifying tissues derived from the following germ cell layers: Ectodermal tissue (epithelium and neural tissue), Mesodermal tissue (muscle, fat, bone, cartilage), and endodermal tissue ( thyroid tissue, gastrointestinal epithelium).
