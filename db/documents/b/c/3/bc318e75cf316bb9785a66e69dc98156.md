In the United States, approximately 2 million patients present annually to the emergency department for facial lacerations. The vast number of structures and functions that can be disrupted by facial lacerations highlights the complexity of facial anatomy, particularly when considering the potential for skeletal injury to accompany soft tissue injury. Appropriate management of facial lacerations requires understanding facial anatomy, suture techniques, wound contamination and infection prophylaxis guidelines, and the indications for specialist consultation. This activity reviews facial laceration mechanisms and details repair techniques, highlighting the role of the interprofessional team in optimizing outcomes for patients with facial lacerations.

**Objectives:**
- Apply knowledge of facial anatomy and physiology to perform precise and accurate tissue manipulation during facial laceration repair.

- Implement appropriate surgical techniques for the repair of facial lacerations, ensuring optimal wound closure, tissue approximation, and cosmetic outcomes.

- Assess and manage postoperative complications associated with oral and maxillofacial surgery and facial laceration repair, including hematoma, infection, and wound dehiscence.
- Collaborate with the interprofessional team to address complex facial injuries and coordinate comprehensive patient care.
