The advanced practice nurse (APN) role has existed for over half a century. APN role has evolved to provide health care needs to different populations and sub-specialties throughout the United States and its territories. APNs are registered nurses with master’s and/or doctorate degrees with advanced education and training beyond registered nurses. Therefore, they have additional scopes of practice over and above traditional nursing duties.

A call for APNs to provide health care to the full extent of their education in the 2010 Institute of Medicine Report on the Future of Nursing rapidly accelerated the production of APNs. The APN scopes of practice vary between states because of the rules and regulations governed by the board of nursing at the state level. The National Council of State Boards of Nursing identifies a need to align the APN scopes of practice with increasing practice mobility for the APNs to fulfill the increase in access to health care by the public.
