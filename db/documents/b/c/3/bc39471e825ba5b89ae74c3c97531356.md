The differential diagnosis for linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) should include other vesiculobullous diseases such as:

- Dermatitis herpetiformis

- Bullous pemphigoid

- Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita

- Bullous impetigo

- Pemphigus vulgaris

- Erythema multiforme

- Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)

Dermatitis herpetiformis has very similar findings on immunohistochemical staining, with the main difference being the granular deposition of IgA, instead of linear deposition as in LABD. Bullous pemphigoid is characterized by linear deposits of IgG along the epidermal basement membrane zone. Unfortunately, at times, there can be a mixed linear deposition of both IgG and IgA at the basement membrane, creating a diagnostic conundrum. Different options exist as far as classifying this specific deposition pattern as either bullous pemphigoid or LABD.
