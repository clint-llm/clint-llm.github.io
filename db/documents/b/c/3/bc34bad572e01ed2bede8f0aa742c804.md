Peripheral nerve surgery includes repair of acute nerve injuries, entrapment neuropathies, and nerve sheath tumor resection. Acute nerve injury can result from stretching, compression, or laceration. An example of nerve stretching is brachial plexus injury during vaginal delivery of an infant with shoulder dystocia resulting in Erb palsy.

Peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNST) can be benign or malignant.Â Benign tumors include neurofibromas or schwannomas, and malignant PNST are typically sarcomatous. Surgical consideration of the nerve fascicle that gave rise to the PNST involves intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring to establish if the associated fascicle has a motor function because that determines whether to do a complete or partial resection. Malignant PNST involves wide local excision, sometimes consisting of proximal amputation. Studies have shown that pre-operative biopsy of PNST results in increased risk of postoperative neurologic deficit, suggesting that referral for surgery without biopsy is recommended.
