Since syringomyelia is commonly associated with Chiari malformation type 1 (CM1), it is pertinent to look at clinical features directly related to Chiari Malformation 1.

- Tussive headaches: Classic of CM1. Coughing (Valsalva maneuvers) causes sudden increases in intracranial CSF volume in CM1 patients which presents as transient suboccipital headache and neck pain, a split second after a cough.
- Site: Sub-occipital
- Mode of onset: Sudden 
- Nature/character: Heavy, crushing, pressure-like. Pounding in quality when severe but otherwise non-throbbing
- Radiation: Radiates to the vertex and behind the eyes, and inferiorly to the neck and shoulders
- Duration: Short duration-often, lasting only seconds
- Exacerbated by physical exertion, Valsalva maneuvers, head dependency, sudden changes in posture

- Hoarseness, dysphagia, coughing with swallowing because of downward traction on the lower cranial nerves, and brainstem compression.

- Visual disturbances: Retro-orbital pressure and pain, visual phenomena such as flashing lights, floaters, blurred vision, photophobia, diplopia; possible horizontal, rotatory, or down-beat nystagmus on clinical examination because of the involvement of brainstem vestibulo-ocular connections

- Oto-neurologic symptoms: Dizziness, tinnitus, pressure in ears, decreased hearing, oscillopsia

- Cerebellar disturbances such as tremors, dysmetria, ataxia, gait, and balance problems.

- Syncope

- Sleep disturbances such as snoring, sleep apnea, and palpitations because of brainstem compression

Features caused by the syrinx will depend on its anatomical level and include:

- The most common sensory symptom is paresthesia/hyperesthesia followed by non-radicular segmental pain.

- Muscle weakness, impaired fine-motor function which may progress to atrophy of intrinsic muscles of hand – damage to the anterior horn cells (lower motor neuron) at the level of the syrinx. May progress to "claw hand" deformity.

- Spasticity in lower limbs: Syrinx expansion may compress and sometimes destruct adjacent lateral corticospinal tracts (upper motor neuron).

- Progressive scoliosis: Injury to anterior horn cells innervating the paraspinal axial musculature

- Horner syndrome may be seen in cervical/upper thoracic syringes

- Poorly localized non-radicular segmental neuropathic pain (substance P)

The presentation is highly variable. In most cases, patients complain of pain, muscle weakness and atrophy especially in hands and arms, temperature insensitivity in the upper limb, spasticity or stiffness in lower limbs, progressive scoliosis. The clinical course progresses over months to years, with an early rapid deterioration that gradually slows.

In patients with syringomyelia secondary to foramen magnum obstruction treated only a syringosubarachnoid or a thecoperitoneal shunt, it has been observed that the spasticity improves despite the worsening of other neurological functions. This suggests the spasticity in the limbs is possibly due to the bulk of the syrinx rather than the compression of the brainstem at the level of the foramen magnum.
