Colonoscopy has been shown to correctly identify the source of lower GI bleeds in more than 75% of patients while also allowing a therapeutic modality. The timing of the colonoscopy remains controversial. However, most studies suggest it should be performed within the first 24 hours of admission, following bowel prep of the patient. Treatments for diverticular bleeds include the injection of adrenaline (1:10000) in 1 mL to 2mL aliquots at the site. If the patient is not stable enough for a colonoscopy, then radiologic evaluation should be considered. CT angiography (CTA) is relatively noninvasive, fast and widely available. CTA can detect bleeding rates more than .3 mL/min to .5 mL/min. CTA, however, has a relatively low sensitivity (85%). Catheter angiography is reserved for patients with hemodynamic instability who cannot tolerate a colonoscopy or have recurrent bleeding. Radionuclide imaging uses Technetium (99mTc) based tracers to tag red blood cells and is helpful in detecting scant intermittent bleeding.  The half-life of 99mTc is long so the scan can be repeated several times in a 24-hour period to evaluate sequential images.
