Skeletal muscle tissue derives from the mesoderm of the original three germ layers. From here, the mesoderm develops into the paraxial and the lateral plate mesoderm. The paraxial mesoderm, precisely those organized in the trunk, is scattered into individual tissue blocks known as somites. These somites that are concentrated more so dorsolaterally aggregate into the dermatomyotome and undergo induction into myoblasts.

Differentiation of the mesoderm to transition to eventual myoblasts is theorized to be through the modifications employed by a family of basic Helix-Loop-Helix transcription factors, most notably through MyoD1. Continuous expression of MyoD transcription factors is essential for the genetic expression of genes involved in muscle development.

The cells of the dermatomyotome subdivide with one of the resulting structures to be the hypomeres. The hypomeres differentiate into three additional layers, representing the external intercostals, internal intercostals, as well as the innermost intercostals or the transverse thoracic muscle. A portion of the myoblasts originating from the hypomeres also give rise to the pectoral muscles in the anterior chest, including the pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, serratus anterior, and the subclavius.
