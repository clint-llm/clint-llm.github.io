The immediate management is similar to other patients with stroke with an emphasis on the airway, breathing, and circulation along with quick and complete neurological assessment.

The patients with an isolated Weber syndrome are mostly neurologically stable. However, scenarios wherein the large infarction and there is a risk of the propagation of the disease process, thrombolytic therapy may be justified.

- Cases with massive posterior circulation infarction, wherein there is need of emergent posterior fossa decompression

- External ventricular drain placement in cases of evolving hydrocephalus

- As an adjunct to surgical management for tumors and aneurysm causing Weber syndrome.

Apart from these, supportive care is most important, including early mobilization, bladder bowel care, and nutritional support.
