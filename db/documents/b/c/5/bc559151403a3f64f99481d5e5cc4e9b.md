Microscopically pleomorphic adenoma has a highly variable appearance, hence the name pleomorphic. It is characterized by mixed proliferation of polygonal epithelial and spindle-shaped myoepithelial cells in a variable stroma matrix of mucoid, myxoid, cartilaginous or hyaline origin. Epithelial elements are usually of polygonal, spindle or stellate-shaped cells which may be arranged to form duct-like structures, sheets, clumps,  or interlacing strands. The ducts and tubules are seen usually exhibiting an outer lining in addition to an inner cuboidal epithelial cell layer. This is outer myoepithelial cell layer (or layers) which merges into the surrounding stroma which also contains dispersed or clumped myoepithelial element cells. Areas of squamous metaplasia and epithelial pearls can be found. The tumor lacks the true capsule and is surrounded by a fibrous pseudo capsule of variable thickness. The tumor extends through normal glandular parenchyma in the form of finger-like pseudopodia. These microscopic extensions account for the high risk of recurrence in cases treated with simple enucleation or surgical resections performed with inadequate surgical margins.
