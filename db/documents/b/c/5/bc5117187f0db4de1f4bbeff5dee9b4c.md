**Paralytic Lagophthalmos**

Facial nerve paralysis is the cause of paralytic lagophthalmos, of which there are many underlying aetiologies outlined below.

**Infection:**

- Otitis (external, otitis media)

- Mastoiditis

- Viral (herpes simplex, herpes zoster, influenza, coxsackievirus, polio, mumps, mononucleosis)

- Bacteria (Tuberculosis, syphilis, leprosy, cat scratch disease, Lyme disease, botulism)

- Fungal (Mucormycosis)

- Immunocompromised (AIDS)

**Trauma:**

- Facial injuries

- Birth trauma

- Fractures to the skull base, temporal bone fracture

**Tumour:**

- Parotid lesion

- Cholesteatoma

- Facial nerve tumor

- Schwannoma

- Teratoma

- Neurofibromatosis Type 2

- Fibrous dysplasia

- Haemangioblastoma

- Acoustic neuroma

- Sarcoma

- Leukemia

- Meningioma

- Carcinoma (primary or metastatic)

**Metabolic:
**

- Diabetes mellitus

- Hypertension

- Vitamin A deficiency

- Hyperthyroidism

**Toxic:**

- Thalidomide

- Alcohol excess

- Arsenic

- Tetanus

- Diphtheria

- Carbon monoxide

**Iatrogenic:
**

- Parotid surgery

- Mastoid surgery

- Post-immunization

- Post-tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy

- Embolization

- Mandibular block anesthesia

- Antitetanus serum

- Dental surgery

- Eyelid surgery (excessive tissue removal from blepharoplasty)

- Squint surgery (vertical muscle recession surgery)

**Neurological:
**

- Millard-Gubler syndrome

- Foix-Chavany-Marie syndrome

**Congenital:**

- Mobius syndrome

- Goldenhaar syndrome

- Ichthyosis

**Idiopathic:
**

- Bell's palsy

- Amyloidosis

- Temporal arteritis

- Guillain-Barre syndrome

- Multiple sclerosis

- Myasthenia gravis

- Sarcoidosis

- Osteopetrosis

- Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura

- Hereditary hypertrophic neuropathy

- Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome

**Cicatricial Lagophthalmos**

Lagophthalmos is due to scarring to the eyelids. The upper and lower eyelids consist of seven structural layers. From anteriorly, these are skin and subcutaneous tissue, orbicularis oculi, orbital septum, orbital fat, retraction muscles, tarsal plate, and conjunctiva. Injury to any of these tissues can cause incomplete eyelid closure. Causes include:

- Solar elastosis

- Chemical burns

- Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid

- Steven-Johnson syndrome

- Trauma

**Nocturnal Lagophthalmos**

Lagophthalmos, which occurs during sleep, is termed nocturnal lagophthalmos and can cause similar symptoms of dry eyes and exposure keratopathy. The diagnosis can be challenging as there is clinical overlap with blepharitis, and the patient may not be aware of lagophthalmos during slumber. Patients can report insomnia, and exacerbated symptoms upon waking, either in the morning or during the night.

**Incomplete Blink andÂ Lagophthalmos**

An incomplete blink with consequent lagophthalmos is seen in patients with Parkinson disease and ocular myopathies like myotonic dystrophy and chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia.
