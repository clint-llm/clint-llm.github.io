The superior tarsal muscle develops in a way, not unlike the other extraocular muscles. These subtype of muscles are different in that; when compared to periocular tissues, these muscles came from paraxial mesoderm in the prechordal plate, which is unusual in that connective tissue tendons arise from neural crest cells instead. Specifically, around week five is when Muller's muscle first appears in development.
