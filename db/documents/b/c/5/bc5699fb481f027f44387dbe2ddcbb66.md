Pneumatosis intestinalis occurs in approximately 0.03% of the population. Given the asymptomatic course of the majority of cases, the exact prevalence of the condition is unknown, and that 0.03% is possibly an underestimation. It can affect any age group, although it is more prevalent in older populations than in young adults and infants. Infantile PI has higher mortality than adult forms, and it is usually associated with acute necrotizing enterocolitis. In adults, PI is usually benign and found incidentally on imaging. In adults, approximately 15% of cases are primary, and 85% are secondary.
