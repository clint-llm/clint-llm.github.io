Multicystic dysplastic kidney disease is caused by nonfunctioning kidney tissue in the affected area which develops into cysts. It can ultimately lead to renal agenesis of the affected side. Obstructive cystic renal dysplasia results from an obstruction of the ureter, bladder, or urethra that increases pressure to the kidney which creates cysts.
