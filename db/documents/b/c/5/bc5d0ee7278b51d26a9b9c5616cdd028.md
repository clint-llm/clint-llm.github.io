Simulation-based training help develop the skill and competency of medical personnel to cope with the stress associated with emergencies and disasters. Simulation-based training should focus on the shortcomings dictated by the participants rather than focus on a “one size fits all” model.

The skills learned, and the outcomes should be evaluated using both formative and summative evaluations, ensuring quantitative as well as qualitative assessment. These include questionnaires, objective structured assessment of technical skills, global rating scales, as well as video recording and assessment.
