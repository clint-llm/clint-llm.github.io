Hypersensitivity reactions are exaggerated or inappropriate immunologic responses occurring in response to an antigen or allergen. Type I, II and III hypersensitivity reactions are known as immediate hypersensitivity reactions because they occur within 24 hours of exposure to the antigen or allergen. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions are predominantly mediated by IgE, IgM, and IgG antibodies. This activity describes the pathophysiology of the immediate hypersensitivity reactions, reviews their evaluation and management, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the risk factors for immediate hypersensitivity reactions.
- Review the history and physical exam findings of immediate hypersensitivity reactions.
- Outline treatment options for immediate hypersensitive reactions.
- Summarize strategies to improve care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by immediate hypersensitive reactions.
