The preproglucagon gene is the precursor to glucagon and is shared between the A-cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans and the L-cells of the intestine. Within the L-cells, the processing of preproglucagon polypeptide forms glicentin, glucagon-like peptides 1 and 2 (GLP-1 and GLP-2), and glicentin is then further cleaved to produce oxyntomodulin, with a leftover fragment called glicentin-related polypeptide (GRPP).

Exenatide, a synthetic GLP-1 receptor agonist, was developed after the discovery of Exendin-4, a molecule of the glucagon superfamily of hormones, in the saliva of the Gila monster, which showed potent pancreatic insulinotropic effects in studies on animals, thus motivating the development of a new class of anti-diabetic medication.

The gene that codes for glicentin is in the alpha-cells of the pancreas and the intestinal or intestinal L-cellsâ€”the gene on chromosome 2 (6 exons, 5 introns).
