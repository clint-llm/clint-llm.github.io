An ultrasound unit, a fluoroscopic imaging system (such as a C-arm), lead shielding, sterile drapes, heparinized saline, and heparin is required for both types of approaches. An ACT machine should be available to ensure that the ACT after heparinization is greater than 250 seconds.

The transfemoral approach requires the following equipment:

- micropuncture kit for percutaneous access of the common femoral artery,

- 0.035 inch and 0.014-inch wires,

- 6 French short and long sheaths,

- angled catheters,

- angioplasty balloons,

- embolic protection device or flow reversal system.

The transcarotid approach requires the following:

- a surgical tray,

- vascular clamps to perform surgical exposure of the common carotid artery at the base of the neck and allow for direct puncture of the artery using a micropuncture kit,

- additional wires, sheaths, and balloons may be used as described above.

- a flow reversal system for neuroprotection against potential embolization.
