Gastrointestinal tuberculosis poses a diagnostic challenge as it typically presents with non-specific clinical and radiologic features. The diagnosis is often delayed due to its vague presentation resulting in various complications. A high index of clinical suspicion and appropriate use of various investigative modalities can aid in early diagnosis, thereby reducing associated morbidity and mortality. Antituberculous therapy is the mainstay of treatment, with surgery only required in a minority of cases.
