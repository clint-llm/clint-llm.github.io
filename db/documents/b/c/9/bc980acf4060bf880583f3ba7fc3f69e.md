Liver function tests should be assessed before therapy initiation, as statins are contraindicated in patients with active hepatic disease. It is unnecessary to schedule regular follow-ups of the patient's liver function unless clinical symptoms of the hepatic disease become apparent. Moderate-intensity therapy should result in an LDL reduction of 30% to 50% from baseline, and a high-intensity regimen should result in a reduction of more than 50% from baseline. Other than atorvastatin, statin medications have renal dosing guidelines that require an assessment of serum creatinine and creatinine clearance.

When colchicine is used along with statins, close monitoring of CPK should be done. Patients on high-intensity atorvastatin may be at increased risk of digoxin toxicity, and monitoring for digoxin toxicity is suggested.
