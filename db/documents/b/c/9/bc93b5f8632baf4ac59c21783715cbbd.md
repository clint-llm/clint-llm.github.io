The most common adverse effects of hydrocodone are constipation and nausea (>10%). Other adverse effects of hydrocodone include:

- Respiratory: severe respiratory depression, shortness of breath, respiratory tract infection

- Cardiovascular: hypotension, bradycardia, peripheral edema

- Neurologic: Headache, chills, anxiety, sedation, insomnia, dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue

- Dermatologic: Pruritus, diaphoresis, rash

- Gastrointestinal: Vomiting, dyspepsia, gastroenteritis, abdominal pain

- Genitourinary: Urinary tract infection, urinary retention associated with prostatic hypertrophy

- Otic: Tinnitus, sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL)

- Endocrine: Secondary adrenal insufficiency

**Drug Interactions**

- Taking hydrocodone with central nervous system depressants like alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or other opioids, can lead to profound sedation and respiratory depression; hence must be avoided.

- Medications that induce (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, and carbamazepine) or inhibit (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine, ritonavir) cytochrome enzymes should be monitored carefully; this can lead to wide variations in hydrocodone plasma concentrations.

- Hydrocodone, in combination with acetaminophen, has a potential drug interaction with warfarin that may lead to an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) and bleeding.

- Concurrent use of hydrocodone with CYP3A4 inhibitors or discontinuation of CYP3A4 inducers can lead to a fatal overdose of hydrocodone. Hence avoid the combination.
