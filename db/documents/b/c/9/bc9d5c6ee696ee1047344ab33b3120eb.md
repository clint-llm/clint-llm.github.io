Abdominal pain is a frequent complaint and the reason many people present to emergency departments or clinics. Right upper quadrant pain is commonly associated with biliary diseases. Qualitative cholescintigraphy can evaluate gall bladder emptying.

Clinicians often employ CCK cholescintigraphy/HIDA when biliary pain presents with a RUQ ultrasound showing obvious gallstones or in a normal-appearing ultrasound in the setting of classic physical exam findings associated with biliary disease.

Chronic cholecystitis is clinically diagnosed by poor gallbladder contractility due to prolonged inflammation. HIDA helps diagnose not only the delayed emptying but also the impaired squeeze of the GB musculature.

When there is high clinical suspicion of a calculus obstruction, the HIDA scan without CCK helps demonstrate GB filling but not squeeze.
