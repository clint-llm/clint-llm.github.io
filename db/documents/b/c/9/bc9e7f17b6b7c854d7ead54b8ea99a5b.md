The administration of morphine via the epidural route requires an interprofessional healthcare team that includes clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), nurses, and pharmacists. Epidural morphine administration is by an anesthesiologist, nurse anesthetist, or pain specialist for perioperative pain control or chronic refractory pain. A focused history and physical examination are necessary before administering neuraxial opioids to identify patients at risk of respiratory depression. Given its long duration of action, patients require close monitoring for 18 to 24 hours for the adequacy of ventilation, oxygenation, and level of consciousness. [Level 1]

Nursing should receive proper training to identify signs of respiratory depression or opioid toxicity so they can alert the physicians when there is a need for intervention. Reversal agents like naloxone should always be available for administration in case of respiratory depression after neuraxial opioid administration. [Level I] The pharmacist should verify dosing, make recommendations for reversal agents, perform medication reconciliation, check for drug-drug interactions, and report their findings to the team. The above highlights the necessity of a properly functioning and collaborative interprofessional team approach to ensure optimal patient care while avoiding adverse events when administering and monitoring epidural morphine.
