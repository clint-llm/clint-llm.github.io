Administration of RhIG for prevention of Rh isoimmunization is achieved by either intramuscular (IM) or intravenous (IV) injection, depending on the indication and manufacturer recommendations. During pregnancy, a single dose should be given prophylactically at weeks 26Â to 28 and again within 72 hours of delivery of an Rh-positive infant.

For any known or suspected maternal exposure to Rh-positive RBCs or any incompatible Rh-positive blood product received, RhIG should be administered within 72 hours and dosed accordingly to the amount of RBC exposure per manufacturer guidelines. In pregnant women, RhIG should be administered every 12 weeks from the first injection to maintain a sufficient quantity of passively acquired anti-D antibodies.

Administration of RhIG for immune thrombocytopenic purpura is via IV infusion only.
