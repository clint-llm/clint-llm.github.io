The assessment of developmental disorders is guided by the processes of surveillance and screening:

- Surveillance: The process by which children who are at risk or who have developmental delay are identified.

- Screening: The process by which asymptomatic children who may be at risk of developing a disorder are identified via standardized testing.****The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening at ages 9, 18, and 30 months. Some of the tools used are the Denver Developmental Screening Test, Ages, and Stages Questionnaires.

When evaluating a child, it is important to take into consideration the gestational age at birth, as premature infants have a higher risk of long-term neurodevelopmental disabilities. In order to assess the normal growth and development of an infant born premature, the clinician must adjust the chronological age to the appropriate gestational age, and adjust the milestones to the corrected gestational age. For example, a baby is born at 32 weeks, and they are 8 weeks premature based on a full-term baby born at 40 weeks gestation. One would expect this 32-week old baby to reach their milestones 2 months behind their chronological age.

The implementation of both surveillance and screening enhances early identification, enabling more prompt intervention, which promotes improved outcomes.
