Lasers represent a relatively new group of devices used within the practice of surgery. The applications of lasers in medicine continue to advance with the addition of new devices and the expansion of indications for laser therapy. Because LASER (light amplificated by the stimulated emission of radiation) light waves are by definition collimated (parallel), coherent (in phase), and monochromatic (a single wavelength), the technology is excellent for not only very precise surgical applications but also for targeting only specific tissues tissue types. This activity describes the use of lasers and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients who undergo treatment using this rapidly evolving technology.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for the use of lasers in clinical medicine.
- Outline how the risks of complications with laser use can be mitigated.
- Review treatment options for common complications of laser treatment.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to ensure the appropriate selection of candidates for laser therapy.
