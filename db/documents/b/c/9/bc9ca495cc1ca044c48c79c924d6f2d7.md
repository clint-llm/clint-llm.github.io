The bladder divides into two parts: a body and a base. The body of the bladder is composed of smooth muscle, which is known as detrusor muscle.

The base of the bladder is comprised of the trigone, a triangle-shaped area that encompasses the point at which the ureters open into the bladder (also known as the "vesicoureteric junction") and the beginning of the urethra. The ureters terminate at the ureteral orifices within the lumen of the bladder. The very distal portion of the ureter traverses the detrusor muscle, and when the bladder contracts, the orifices coapt and compresses the opening preventing vesicoureteral reflux.
