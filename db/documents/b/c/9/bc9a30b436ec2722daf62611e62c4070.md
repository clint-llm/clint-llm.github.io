The development of the fetal cerebrovascular system begins with the development of the ICA from the third branchial arch arteries at day 24.

Between 33 and 55 days of development, the VA begins to form from anastomoses of the seven cervical intersegmental arteries, starting with the pro-atlantal artery and proceeding caudally to the sixth intersegmental artery.
