Primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) is a rare inflammatory disorder of the blood vessels of the brain and the spinal cord without any evidence of systemic vasculitis. PACNS was first described as a distinct clinical entity in 1959, and since, multiple different clinical presentations have been reported. Clinical manifestations of PACNS at the time of diagnosis are non-specific with various presenting symptoms. A headache has been the most common presenting symptom in the majority of the PACNS cases. Other symptoms include focal neurological deficits including hemiparesis, aphasia, numbness, visual symptoms, ataxia, among others.
