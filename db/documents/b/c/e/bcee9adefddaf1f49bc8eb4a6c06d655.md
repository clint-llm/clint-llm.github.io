Intussusception is often suspected based on an examination, including observation of the Dance sign (Dance sign consists of evaluating the right lower quadrant of the abdomen for retraction, which can be an indication of intussusception).

- A digital rectal examination is helpful, as a finger may feel the intussusceptum.

- A definite diagnosis requires confirmation by imaging modalities.

- Ultrasound is the test of choice for the diagnosis of intussusception. The appearance of the target or doughnut sign, usually around 3 cm in diameter, confirms the diagnosis.

- The image seen on transverse sonography or computed tomography is a doughnut shape, created by the hyperechoic central core of the bowel and mesentery surrounded by the hypoechoic outer edematous bowel.

- In longitudinal imaging, intussusception may resemble a sandwich.

An abdominal x-ray may be indicated to check for intestinal obstruction. An air enema may be used for diagnosis, and the same procedure can be used for treatment.

CT scan is sometimes used to make a diagnosis, especially when the Ultrasound imaging remains doubtful. However, in young children, obtaining a CT scan often requires the use of anesthesia and there is also the risk of intravenous contrast and radiation exposure.
