Axillary lymphadenectomy is done when there is already positive disease within the axilla. Typically this is done to ascertain the extent of the disease within the axilla, which is extremely important for staging. In turn, the status of the axillary nodes and stage of the patient plays a major part in the subsequent treatment that the patient will be receiving. This can include chemotherapy and radiation therapy. A ten lymph node minimum is considered an adequate axillary dissection, although if less are obtained, surgeons rarely go back to surgery for additional lymph nodes. Of note, once a patient has had an axillary dissection, care is taken to avoid IV or blood pressure recordings in that arm as there is an increased risk of lymphedema compared to sentinel lymph node biopsy. Postoperatively, patients are given arm exercises and can be referred to a lymphedema clinic if this does arise.
