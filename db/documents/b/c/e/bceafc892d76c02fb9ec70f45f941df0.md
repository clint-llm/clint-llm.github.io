The prognosis of patients with myocarditis depends on the severity of the inflammatory process and presentation of symptoms. Patients with severe disease have a poor prognosis without a transplant. Patients with mild myocarditis usually have a good outcome. Poor prognostic factors include low ejection fraction, left bundle branch block, and syncope. The most common cause of death is cardiogenic shock. Others may develop varying degrees of heart block that require permanent pacing. The highest mortality rates are seen in postpartum cardiomyopathy.

The long-term prognosis was usually good, with a 3 to 5-year survival ranging from 56 to 83%, respectively. Patients with acute fulminant myocarditis have an excellent long-term prognosis of 93% at 11 yearsÂ once they survive the acute illness.
