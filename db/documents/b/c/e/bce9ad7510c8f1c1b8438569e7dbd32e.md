The management of a patient who is a victim of an act of bioterrorism is challenging and complex. This requires an interprofessional team consisting of healthcare professionals that include physicians in different specialties, nurses, laboratory technologists, pharmacists, and possibly governmental agencies. Without rapid identification of the causative agent followed by proper management, morbidity and mortality may be high. It may also lead to an outbreak if an agent with the human-to-human transmission is used. The internist, infectious diseases physician, may rapidly identify the offending pathogen or toxin or medical toxicologist.

The patient will require emergency care and possible intensive care, which requires a team effort. Cross consultation involving the various other medical subspecialties may also be required in the case of the disease's systemic involvement. The need for preparedness by healthcare professionals and an interdisciplinary approach in managing the patient is highly recommended to lower the morbidity and improve outcomes. [Level 5]
