An invasive test not usually performed for the initial diagnosis of C. difficile or antibiotic-induced colitis, colonoscopy aids in confirming the diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis in the presence of suggestive symptoms, negative testing, and failure to respond to conventional treatment. Colonoscopies of patients with pseudomembranous colitis demonstrate inflamed colonic mucosa characterized by raised yellowish, occasionally hemorrhagic nodules or plaques that congregate into widespread, pseudomembranes on the surface of the colonic mucosa. Up to 2 cm in diameter, these pseudomembranes present in scattered diffusely among areas of normal or healthy mucosa. The most severely affected have confluent pseudomembranes covering the entirety of their colonic mucosa.
