Parotid surgery can be performed with the basic instruments set used in head and neck operations.

Bipolar is used for hemostasis.

Nerve monitoring can be done by asking a dedicated assistant to watch the face for twitches, however continuous EMG nerve monitoring has become the standard of care in many centers. This can be employed via:

Intraoperative electrophysiological facial nerve monitor (such as the Medtronic NIMS)

and/or

Handheld nerve locator (such as the CheckPoint)

Evidence in the literature suggests the following concerning electromyographic facial nerve monitoring

- It decreases the rate of immediate facial weakness in primary surgeries

- Help localize the facial nerve

- Mandatory in extracapsular resection where by definition the facial nerve is not identified

- Offers prognostic value regarding postoperative facial nerve function
