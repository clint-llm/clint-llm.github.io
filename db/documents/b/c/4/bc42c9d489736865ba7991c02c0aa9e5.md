The heart muscle originates from the mesoderm layer and begins forming during the third week of embryonic development. The mesoderm serves as the primary source for myocardial precursor cells, which make up the cardiogenic or primary heart field during early development. A primitive, horseshoe-shaped endothelial heart tube is formed and begins contracting to facilitate the embryoâ€™s early circulation system. Within the next several weeks, the proliferation of cardiomyocytes is necessary for expanding the myocardial layer and generating the multichambered system of the mature heart.
