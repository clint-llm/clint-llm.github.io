The epidemiology of flexor tendon injuries is not well understood; however, they remain a causative injury of significant morbidity throughout the working-aged (20 to 45 years) young male population. They are frequently known to involve nerve injuries. The dominant hand is affected more often than the non-dominant hand and is usually injured when using a sharp object or catching a falling object.

Flexor tendon injuries occur at an estimated rate of 30 to 42 per 100,000 persons, accruing a total direct and indirect cost of tendinous injuries within the United States alone of $240 to $409 million.
