The orbital apex disorders include superior orbital fissure syndrome, cavernous sinus syndrome, and orbital apex syndrome.

Orbital apex syndrome (OAS), also called Jacod syndrome, is a complex neurological disorder characterized by a constellation of signs resulting from multiple cranial nerve involvement.

**Anatomy of the Orbital Apex**

The orbital apex is an opening connecting the orbit and the cranial cavity.

The intracanalicular part of the optic nerve is present above the orbital apex, passes through the optic canal, and runs to the posteromedial optic chiasm. The middle portion of the superior orbital fissure contains the cranial nerves III, IV, and VI and the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (V1). The annulus of Zinn is a fibrous chord located superior and medial to the superior orbital fissure.

Knowledge of the anatomy of the orbital apex and its contents is essential to diagnosing and managing orbital syndromes.
