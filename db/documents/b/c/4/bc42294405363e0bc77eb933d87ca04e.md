The epidemiology of PDS is variable. Many cases are misdiagnosed due to the asymptomatic nature of the disease.

Goyeneche et al. reported a prevalence of 37.5% of PG in Latin American patients.

In another retrospective study by Mastropasqua et al., 20 % of patients with PDS developedÂ  PG. They also reported that 85% of patients converted to PG within the first ten years. Apart from this, major studies have reported that the conversion rate of PDS to PG is approximately 50%.
