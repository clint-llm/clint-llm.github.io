Patients treated for sinusitis or otitis should be warned that if they develop headaches, nausea, seizure, or disorientation, they should immediately return to their primary physician for reevaluation. Those patients who are using antiepileptic medication should not discontinue them without medical recommendations as they may experience the return of the seizures.
