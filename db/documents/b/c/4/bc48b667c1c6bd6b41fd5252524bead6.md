In assessing the reason for amenorrhea, a pregnancy test should first be conducted. The Tanner scale should be used to stage pubertal development to determine whether secondary sexual characteristics are present. The absence of secondary sexual characteristics indicates that a woman has never been exposed to estrogen. Pelvic ultrasound should be conducted to confirm the presence or absence of a uterus. Initial laboratory tests can determine the serum levels of serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels unless the history and physical examination indicate otherwise - this can help to discern hypergonadotropic and hypogonadotropic forms of hypogonadism. If the screening FSH level is low, the diagnosis of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism can be confirmed. Other important blood investigations include measurement of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level and serum prolactin level. Elevated serum FSH level indicates premature ovarian insufficiency or failure. A karyotype should be conducted in patients under 30-years-old.

A karyotype is also useful in diagnosing androgen insensitivity syndrome, Turner syndrome, Mullerian anomalies, and gonadal dysgenesis. Due to the association between Turner Syndrome and coarctation of the aorta, patients should have an echocardiograph conducted every 3 to 5 years. The presence of the Y chromosome, along with raised serum testosterone levels, point towards the diagnosis of androgen insensitivity. If the karyotype is normal with an elevated FSH level, 17-hydroxylase deficiency should be considered, as it can be life-threatening if left untreated. Testing can be done with serum measurement of 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone and deoxycorticosterone levels. The diagnosis is established with an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test. Ultrasonography or MRI is useful to identify the Mullerian anomaly when the abnormality cannot be found by physical examination. Lesions of the central nervous system should be excluded through the use of imaging using CT or MRI, particularly if headaches, visual impairments, or galactorrhea are present.
