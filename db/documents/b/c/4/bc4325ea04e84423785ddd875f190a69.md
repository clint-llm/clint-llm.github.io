Peripheral venous access is the best choice when there is a short-term need for access, adequate peripheral sites, and the patient does not have specific indications for central venous access. Indications for central venous access include infusates incompatible with peripheral administration, a need for invasive hemodynamic monitoring, multiple infusions or infusion incompatibility, and parenteral nutrition.
