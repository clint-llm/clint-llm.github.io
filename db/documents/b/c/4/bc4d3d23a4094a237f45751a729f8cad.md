When used at therapeutic doses, the risk of toxicity is rare. Toxicity is more likely when the drug is used in combination with other antihypertensive drugs or at supratherapeutic doses. Captopril is the only ACE inhibitor to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and potentially cause confusion and lethargy.

For the majority of patients, the effects of poisoning are mild, and close observation is required. Hospital admission is indicated when symptoms and signs are more severe. Derranged hemodynamic parameters may require supportive therapy with intravenous fluids and inotropic support.
