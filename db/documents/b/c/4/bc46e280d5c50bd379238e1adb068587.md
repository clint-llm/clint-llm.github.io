Nosocomial infections affect a substantial number of patients globally, leading to increased mortality and financial impact on healthcare systems. While the actual global burden of healthcare-associated infection (HAI) remains unknown due to the lack of reliable data and surveillance systems, epidemiologic studies from Europe and the United States show relatively consistent results in surveillance programs. As such, most of the epidemiologic studies come from the United States and Europe.

Among European hospitals, the prevalence of at least one HAI varied based on the care setting: 4.4% in primary care hospitals; 7.1% in tertiary care hospitals; 19.2% in intensive care units; and 3.7% in long-term care facilities.

The prevalence of HAI among hospitalized patients in the US was 3.2% based on a survey in 2015, which was significantly lower than 4% in a study from 2011.

An earlier study showed the area of HAI acquisition was highest among adults and children outside ICU, ICU patients, high-risk neonate nurseries, and then well-baby nurseries.

The endemic burden of HAI appears to be higher in developing countries. A pooled analysis of data from developing countries showed HAI prevalence of 15.5%, most of which occur as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and neonatal infections in intensive care settings.
