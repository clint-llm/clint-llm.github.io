Falls account for one of the most common and serious issues contributing to a disability, especially among elderly individuals. Tinetti et al. in 1988 defined a fall as an event that results in a person coming to rest on the ground or other lower-level unintentionally, which is not as a result of a major intrinsic event (such as stroke) or overwhelming hazard. There is a direct correlation between falls and mortality, morbidity, and reduced functionality. Falls occur with high frequency in the elderly, children, and athletes. Among the elderly, associated medical comorbidities correlate to an increased propensity to fall, and in turn, increased susceptibility to injury.
