Causes of central cyanosis include:

- Hypoventilation due to conditions affecting the central nervous system, such as intracranial hemorrhage, tonic-clonic seizures, and heroin overdose.
- Pulmonary causes leading to ventilation-perfusion mismatch and impaired alveolar-arterial diffusion, for instance, bronchospasm (asthma), pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, pulmonary hypertension, hypoventilation, and COPD
- Cardiovascular causes include heart failure, congenital heart diseases (right to left shunting), and valvular heart diseases.
- Hemoglobinopathies including methemoglobinemia, sulfhemoglobinemia
- Polycythemia
- High altitude
- Hypothermia
- Obstructive sleep apnea

Peripheral cyanosis can be seen because of the following:

- Reduced cardiac output secondary to heart failure or shock

- Local vasoconstriction due to cold exposure, hypothermia, acrocyanosis, and Raynaud phenomenon

- Vasomotor instability

- Arterial obstruction causing regional ischemia secondary to peripheral vascular disease. Causes include atherosclerosis, Buerger disease, atheroembolism

- Venous stasis or obstruction, such as in deep vein thrombosis

- Hyperviscosity attributable to multiple myelomas, polycythemia, and macroglobulinemia

All causes of central cyanosis can also cause peripheral cyanosis. Cardiopulmonary causes and hemoglobin abnormalities are the common causes of central cyanosis.

Differential cyanosis can be seen in patent ductus arteriosus with pulmonary hypertension.
