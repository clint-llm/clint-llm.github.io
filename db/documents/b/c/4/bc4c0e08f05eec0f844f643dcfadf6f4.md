As noted above, rectal prolapse refers specifically to prolapse of some or all of the rectal mucosa through the external anal sphincter. There are 2 types of rectal prolapse: type 1 and type 2, also called false procidentia and true procidentia, respectively. Type 1, which is partial or mucosal prolapse, produces radial folds at the junction with the anal skin. This type is usually involves less than 2 cm of prolapse and only the mucosa is prolapsed. Type 2, or complete prolapse, is characterized by full-thickness extrusion of the rectal wall. Concentric folds are seen in the prolapse mucosa. This type of prolapse, which is similar to intussusception functionally, is further divided into first, second, and third degree prolapse. First-degree, type 2 prolapse protrudes greater than 5 cm from the anal verge and includes the mucocutaneous junction. Second-degree prolapse protrudes only 2 to 5 cm from the anal verge. Finally, third-degree prolapse or occult rectal prolapse is an internal process and thus does not protrude through the anal verge.
