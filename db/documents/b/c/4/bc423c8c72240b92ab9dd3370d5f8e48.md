The sacroiliac joint is well innervated but the pattern of innervation varies among individuals. The sacroiliac joint receives its innervation from the ventral rami of L4 and L5, superior gluteal nerve, and dorsal rami of L5-S2. The nerve supply to the SI joint varies between individuals and innervation may be almost exclusively derived from the sacral dorsal rami. This may account for the variable patterns of referred pain from the SI joint.
