Obtaining vascular access is often difficult and delays patient care in the prehospital and hospital setting. Intraosseous (IO) access is a fast and reliable route to give medications and infusions of any type. This activity reviews IO access, explains how to place an intraosseous device, and reviews how it can be used effectively by the health care team to enhance patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures of importance in intraosseous access.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique pertinent to intraosseous access.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and their clinical significance of intraosseous access.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance intraosseous access and improve outcomes.
