The device is inflated to 4 atmospheric pressures (ATM) and is advanced through the target plaque, ten rounds of pulsatile sound waves are delivered via transmitters within each emission cycle, the balloon is subsequently deflated, allowing formed bubbles to disburse safely, then, the procedure is repeated for a minimum of two interventions per 12mm target field. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence imaging (OCT) can be performed following the procedure to localize calcium fractures and evaluate procedure success.
