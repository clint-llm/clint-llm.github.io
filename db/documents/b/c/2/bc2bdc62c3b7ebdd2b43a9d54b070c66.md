In preparation for ECV, the fetal presentation must be determined by ultrasound and fetal well-being must be assessed, usually by a nonstress test. Contraindications are reviewed with the patient to confirm that they have none. Risks, benefits, and alternatives are reviewed with the patient,Â and informed consent is obtained. Rh status should be known before the procedure and anti-D immune globulin administered after the procedure if indicated.
