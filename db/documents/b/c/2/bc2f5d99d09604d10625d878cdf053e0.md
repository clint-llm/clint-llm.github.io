The brachial plexus, and therefore the medial brachial cutaneous nerve, have an ectodermal origin, with the bones, blood vessels, and muscles of the limbs arising from mesoderm. The limb buds are paddle-shaped structures that grow outwards gradually, starting in the fifth week of development.FGF), sonic hedgehog (SHH), and homeobox (Hox) genes.FGF signaling molecules are important for anterior-posterior patterning of limb development and induce the formation of the apical ectodermal ridge at the limb bud, which controls cell death. The loss of this gene leads to the webbing between digits. The SHH signaling molecule regulates the growth of limbs and is secreted at the zone of polarizing activity on the posterior side of the limb buds. The Hox genes contribute to proximodistal limb patterning, and mutations lead to limb formation in abnormal locations.
