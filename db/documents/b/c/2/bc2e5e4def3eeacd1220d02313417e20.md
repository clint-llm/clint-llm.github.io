The skull has multiple foramina that allow passage of neurovascular structures into and out of the skull. The cranial nerves and some vessels mostly exit via foramina in the cranial base. Below is a brief list of the most important foramina and associated structures.

- Cribriform plate: olfactory nerve (CN I)

- Optic canal: optic nerve (CN II) and the ophthalmic artery

- Superior orbital fissure: oculomotor nerve (CN III), trochlear nerve (CN IV), abducens nerve (CN VI), ophthalmic division of trigeminal nerve (CN V1)

- Foramen rotundum: maxillary division of trigeminal nerve (CN V2)

- Foramen ovale: mandibular division of trigeminal nerve (CN V3)

- Stylomastoid foramen: facial nerve (CN VII)

- Internal auditory meatus: facial nerve (CN VII) and vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII)

- Jugular foramen: glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX), vagus nerve (CN X), spinal accessory nerve (CN XI), and the jugular vein

- Hypoglossal canal: hypoglossal nerve (CN XII)

- Foramen magnum: brainstem, the spinal root of the accessory nerve (CN XI), and the vertebral arteries

Other key foramina that may or may not be associated with nerves include the foramen spinosum (middle meningeal artery), carotid canal (internal carotid artery and sympathetic plexus), and supraorbital and infraorbital foramina (supraorbital and infraorbital nerves). The superficial sensory nerves of the skull, scalp, and face receive input from branches of the trigeminal nerve anteriorly and the greater and lesser occipital nerves posteriorly.
