The majority of cutaneous and motor innervation of the shoulder and upper limb arise from the brachial plexus, which originates from the C5 to T1 ventral rami.

Sensory input can originate from pure sensory nerves as in the case of the medial antebrachial cutaneous, medial brachial cutaneous, and the supraclavicular cutaneous nerves, or from the combined motor and sensory nerves such as the axillary, radial, median, ulnar, and intercostal brachial nerves with their cutaneous branches.
