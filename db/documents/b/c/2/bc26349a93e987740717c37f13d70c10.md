When there is suspicion of rat bite fever and if the cultures are negative, the bite site can be biopsied to isolate the organism. Streptobacillus moniliformis is a filamentous, highly pleomorphic, non-motile gram-negative organism. Under the microscope, it may appear straight but may have some irregular lateral bulbar swellings. The bacteria may be found in aggregates or chains. The colonies appear as "cotton ball" in culture media

In case of Spirillum minus, the organism is a thick, short, tightly coiled rod and it is gram stain negative.
