The differential diagnosis includes other causes of cavernous sinus syndrome and painful ophthalmoplegia.

Cavernous sinus syndrome can also be caused by local compression of the cavernous sinus from noninfectious and non-thrombotic lesions, 30% of which are tumors:

- Carotid cavernous fistula, with enhanced CT or MRI showing proptosis, enlarged superior ophthalmic vein, “dirty” appearance of retro-orbital fat, and enlarged extraocular muscles.

- Lytic bone lesions near the sphenoid sinus or sella turcica, tumors (such as metastatic cancer, meningioma, schwannoma, plexiform neurofibroma, pituitary adenoma, chordoma, chondrosarcoma, melanocytoma or nasopharyngeal carcinoma, the most common primary malignant tumor), or a cavernous hemangioma

- Meningioma

- Sino-orbital aspergillosis

- Superior orbital fissure syndrome

- Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, involving a retro-orbital granulomatous pseudotumor into the cavernous sinus, manifesting as retro-orbital pain, ophthalmoplegia, cranial nerve palsy, and clinical response to systemic steroids.

Other causes of painful ophthalmoplegia include:

- Orbital apex syndrome (inflammation of the posterior orbit, including the superior orbital fissure through which cranial nerves III, IV, V, and VI and the superior ophthalmic vein traverse, as well as the optic canal involving the ophthalmic artery and optic nerve and characterized by less edema and proptosis but more vision loss than cavernous sinus thrombosis)

- Orbital cellulitis

- Sarcoidosis

- Syphilis

- Tuberculosis
