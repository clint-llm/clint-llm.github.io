The sacrum articulates with the ilium, which helps to distribute body weight to the pelvis. The SI joint capsule is relatively thin and often develops defects that enable fluid, such as joint effusion or pus, to leak out onto the surrounding structures. As surrounding muscles and structures are affected different presentations of pain can present because different nerve roots innervate these structures. Common distributions of pain are L4-L5 dermatomes, but distributions can certainlyÂ present in dermatomes as high as L2 and as low as S3. The asymmetric motion of the pelvis can cause mechanical dysfunction, leading to degeneration and significant pain. Differential diagnosis includes leg-length discrepancies, unilateral weaker limb or gluteal muscles, tight or strained surrounding muscles structures, or hip osteoarthritis.
