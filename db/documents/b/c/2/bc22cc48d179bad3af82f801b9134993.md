Although most patients remain asymptomatic throughout their life, the clinical manifestations of G6PD deficiency depend on the age of the patient.

- In newborns, G6PD deficiency is recognized as a serious risk factor for the development of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Neonates with G6PD deficiency are two times more likely to develop hyperbilirubinemia than the general population, and approximately 20% of kernicterus cases are associated with G6PD deficiency. Symptoms of kernicterus in a newborn include lethargy, extreme sleepiness, and poor muscle tone. Although rare, G6PD deficiency should be considered in neonates, who develop jaundice in the first 24 hours of life, who have a history of a sibling with neonatal jaundice, or have a bilirubin level greater than the 95th percentile.

- In adults, common symptoms and exam findings of G6PD deficiency include those of hemolytic anemia or possibly red blood cell sequestration by the spleen. Some of these manifestations include pallor, jaundice, fatigue, splenomegaly, and dark urine.
