The management and care of patients with suspected anoxic encephalopathy or anoxic injury are challenging and should involve individuals from not only medical teams but also supportive roles, all functioning as a coordinated interprofessional team. This interprofessional team approach includes care management, nursing, pharmacy staff, dieticians, palliative care, and neurology consultation. Daily collaboration as a team to discuss further management and findings to inform surrogate decision-makers is essential and may best be performed collaboratively to ensure no gaps in information. Pharmacists review medications prescribed, detect drug-drug interactions, and counsel patients and their families. Specialty-trained critical care and neuroscience nurses provide prescribed treatments, monitor patients, educate family members, and give status updates to the team.

The outcomes for patients with anoxic encephalopathy depend on the age of the patient, the extent of brain injury, the presence of neuropsychiatric deficits at the time of diagnosis, and comorbidity. For most patients, recovery is prolonged and requires extensive rehabilitation. The interprofessional paradigm with open communication will yield the best patient outcomes. [Level 5]
