Vaginal hysterectomy is considered one of the minimally invasive forms of hysterectomies with better outcomes and fewer complications. It should be viewed as the preferred mode of hysterectomy whenever possible.Â The advantages of vaginal hysterectomy include less pain, rapid recovery, faster return to work, lower costs, and lower morbidity. It is usually performed for benign reasons.

Hysterectomy can majorly impact a patient's quality of life and have long-term physical, psychological, and mental health effects. Healthcare practitioners should thoroughly counsel patients before hysterectomy so that they can make informed decisions about their treatment.
