Although the cause of idiopathic pulmonary hypertension is unknown, some cases are known to be familial secondary to a gene defect with autosomal dominant inheritance. A mutation in the gene that makes these blood vessels more susceptible to vasoconstrictors may cause the condition. Environmental factors also play a role. Acute hypoxia can cause vasodilation of the systemic arteries and vasoconstriction of pulmonary arteries.
