**Chronic Pain Assessment**

Standard blood work and imaging are not necessarily indicated for chronic pain that has been previously evaluated, but the clinician can order it when specific causes of pain are suspected and/or when there is worsening of chronic pain or a change in symptoms. This is determined on a case-by-case basis. When managing patients with opioid therapy for chronic pain, it is advisable to obtain random urine toxicology screening at the start of implementation of opioid therapy and then at least once a year to monitor compliance and exclude the use of nonprescription drugs. This is the current Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommendation.

Psychiatric disorders can amplify pain, signaling making symptoms of pain worse.

Furthermore, comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as MDD, can significantly delay the diagnosis of pain disorders.

**Prescribing Opioids**

Before prescribing opioids, complete a detailed patient history that includes:

- Indication requested for pain relief

- Location, nature, and intensity of pain

- Prior pain treatments and response

- Comorbid conditions

- Potential physical and psychological pain impact on function

- Family support, employment, and housing

- Leisure activities, mood, sleep, substance use, and work

- Emotional, physical, or sexual abuse

When considering opioids, weigh the risks of abuse, addiction, adverse drug reactions, overdose, and physical dependence. If there are any special concerns, such as a history of substance abuse, consult a psychiatrist or addiction specialist. If current substance abuse, withhold prescribing until the patient is involved in an addiction treatment and monitoring program.

Following the World Health Organization (WHO) Analgesic Ladder is recommended instead of starting an opioid without trialing alternative therapies first or alongside opioid management.

**Addiction Risk Assessment**

The clinician should consider information from the history and physical, family members, the state prescription monitoring program, and screening tools to assess the risk of developing an untoward behavioral response to opioids. Patients can be stratified into three risk levels based on responses to screening tools (such as those listed below):

- Low-risk: standard monitoring, vigilance, and care.

- Moderate-risk: additional level of monitoring and more frequent provider contact.

- High-risk: intensive and structured monitoring, frequent follow-up contact, consultation with an addiction psychiatrist, and limited monthly prescription of short-acting opioids.

Personal or family history of substance abuse, current substance abuse, poor social support, family or social environments that lend themselves to misuse, younger age, and comorbid untreated psychiatric diseases are some of the risk factors for opioid misuse and addiction.

**Assessment Tools**

Screening tools help determine the risk level and degree of monitoring and structure required for a treatment plan; however, their validity is not yet supported in the literature. Some examples of opioid tools follow.

**Brief Intervention Tool**

Brief Intervention Tool is a 26-item "yes-no" questionnaire used to identify signs of opioid addiction or abuse. The items assess for problems related to drug use-related functional impairment.

**CAGE, CAGE-AID, and CAGE-Opioid**

CAGE (Cut down, Annoyed, Guilty, and Eye-opener) Questionnaire consists of four questions designed to assess alcohol abuse. CAGE-AID and CAGE-OPIOID are revised versions to assess the likelihood of current substance abuse.

**Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM)**

The Current Opioid Misuse Measure is a 17-item patient self-report assessment designed to identify abuse in chronic pain patients. It identifies aberrant behaviors associated with opioid misuse in patients already receiving long-term opioid therapy.

**Diagnosis, Intractability, Risk, and Efficacy (DIRE) Tool**

The Diagnosis, Intractability, Risk, and Efficacy is a clinician-rated questionnaire used to predict patient compliance with long-term opioid therapy. Patients scoring low are poor candidates for long-term opioids.

**Mental Health Screening Tool**

The Mental Health Screening Tool is a five-item screen that evaluates feelings of calmness, depression, happiness, peacefulness, and nervousness in the past month. A low is an indicator that the patient should be referred to a pain management specialist.

**Opioid Risk Tool (ORT)**

The Opioid Risk Tool is a five-item assessment to evaluate for aberrant drug-related behavior. It categorizes the patient into low, medium, or high levels of risk for aberrant drug-related behaviors based on question responses concerning previous alcohol, drug abuse, psychologic disorders, and other risk factors.

**Pain Assessment and Documentation Tool (PADT)**

Guidelines by the CDC, the Federation of State Medical Boards, and the Joint Commission stress documentation from both a quality and medicolegal perspective. The Pain Assessment and Documentation Tool (PADT) was designed to help the clinician document appropriate information.

**Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain-Revised (SOAPP-R)**

The Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain-Revised (SOAPP-R) is a screen with questions addressing the history of alcohol or substance use, cravings, mood, psychological status, and stress. The SOAPP-R helps assess the risk level of aberrant drug-related behaviors and the monitoring level needed.

**Urine Drug Tests (UDT)**

Urine drug tests evaluate the use of the medication prescribed and detect unsanctioned drug use. The CDC recommends drug testing before starting opioid therapy and at least annually.

One study suggests urine drug screen monitoring frequency based on risk level.

Testing is usually done with class-specific immunoassay drug panels; however, this may be followed with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry for specific metabolite detection. The test should identify the specific drug. If urine test results suggest aberrant opioid use, discuss the issue in a positive, supportive approach, and document the discussion.

**Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs)**

Prescription drug monitoring programs, or PDMPs, are now in place in various degrees in all states and most territories. They assist prescribers and dispensers in working together to decrease drug abusers and diverter's access to prescription opioids. The PDMP regulations are state-based and, as such, vary in application. The key benefits are as follows:

- Assists in monitoring outpatient prescriptions

- National decrease in multiple providers providing prescriptions (avoids "doctor shopping")

- Encourages prescribers and pharmacists to work together as an interprofessional team

- Assists regulatory boards, Medicaid, medical examiners, law enforcement, and research organizations in gathering data on the effectiveness and enforcement of provisions

- Some states are participating in PMP Interconnect, which allows the sharing of prescription information across state lines.

The authors recommend that the PDMP should be checked prior to every prescription written at the time it is written, regardless of the amount and regardless of whether the script is for acute or chronic pain. The current CDC recommendation is that the prescriber should review the PDMP when starting opioid therapy and then again at least every 3 months and/or every time a script is written.

**Weaknesses In PDMP System**

- The system is not interlinked among all states.

- Many states only require clinicians and pharmacists to consult the PDMP if they have a reasonable belief there is drug-seeking

- The database may be out of date by several days as they are often not updated in real time.

**Future PDMP System**

- In the future, it is expected that PDMP requirements will expand to mandatory checking of the database by both prescribers and dispensers, real-time reporting, easier use, more active management, and flagging by government agencies.

**PDMP Systems Success**

- States with aggressive PDMPs in place are seeing as much as an 80% decrease in opioid prescribing.****

**Checklists For Prescribers and Dispensers**

**Prescribing/Dispensing**

- Dose, frequency, and length prescribed consistent with the indication - avoid long-acting opioids for acute pain.

- Age, weight, height, and sex considered

- Evaluate for potential drug interactions

- Evaluate for potential allergic reactions

- Patient informed and understands risks and benefits - warnings addiction, abrupt halting, use of power equipment, side-effects, respiratory depression, avoiding sharing, storage, theft protection.

- Medication use agreement in place

- Instructions for storage and disposal of unused opioids

**VIGIL**

- Verification: Is this a responsible opioid user?
