The identification of a single ventricle can be made in utero or after birth. When made in utero, healthcare teams must report this finding and begin goal discussions with the mother as soon as possible. When found emergently after delivery, healthcare employees need to workÂ as an interprofessional team to provide an urgent resolution quickly. Overall, general practitioners should understand the severity of single ventricles and the suboptimal prognoses to guide decision-making better.
