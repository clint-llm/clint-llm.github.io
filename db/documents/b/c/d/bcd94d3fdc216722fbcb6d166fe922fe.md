The diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease (HD) almost exclusively demands surgical intervention. Pediatric healthcare providers should possess a comprehensive understanding of the most popular surgical procedures to assist in the bridging referral phase between the surgeon and the patient's family. Rectal irrigation before the surgery and in the management of HAEC is highly recommended. It might have a couple of crucial advantages, including colon size decompression and preventing the most devastating complication, enterocolitis. Surgical planning is profoundly affected by the presence of comorbidities, while short-segment HD without any comorbidities can be subjected to a single-stage pull-through procedure.

The recommended timing for a definite pull-through procedure varies from four to six months following colostomy placement. A variety of pull-through surgeries have been identified. The traditional Swenson's technique involves proctectomy, pulling the healthy ganglionated colon through, and anastomosing it to the anus. Novel surgical procedures (e.g., Duhamel's and Soave's procedures) have the advantage of preserving the intricate innervation of the rectum and bladder.

An alternative approach is to perform a single-stage transanal Soave's procedure early in the neonatal period, which might obviate the need for an abdominal incision and colostomy.
