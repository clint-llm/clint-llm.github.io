The cause can occur from thromboembolism, atherosclerotic disease, or vascular dissection. The mechanism differs depending on the affected segment. Atherosclerotic disease more commonly affects the mid-portion of the basilar artery, followed by the vertebrobasilar junction. Lodging of an embolic source is much more frequent in the distal third of the basilar artery especially at the top of the basilar arteryÂ and the vertebrobasilar junction. Arterial dissection is more common in the extracranial vertebral artery and has been associated with neck injuries and cervical chiropractic adjustments. Intracranial dissections are exceedingly rare.
