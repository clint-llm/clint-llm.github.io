An increase in intraluminal esophageal pressure is the etiology of epiphrenic diverticula. Although this can be due to several mechanisms, the most common is associated with an underlying esophageal motility disorder. Achalasia, diffuse esophageal spasm, or hypertensiveÂ lower esophageal sphincter, which results in a functional obstruction, are some reasons.

These diverticula can also arise from an iatrogenic cause, such as after a fundoplication, which leads to a mechanical obstruction, and increased intraluminal pressure.
