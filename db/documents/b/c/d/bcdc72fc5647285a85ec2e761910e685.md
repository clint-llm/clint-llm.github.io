Surgical education has undergone significant recent changes. The apprenticeship model described as Halsted’s “see one, do one, teach one” model, has been the foundation of surgical training for over a century.

These factors highlight the need to optimize surgical training worldwide. In the United Kingdom (UK), for example, the context of trauma and orthopedic training has shifted from a time-based to a competency-based system of training as laid out by the Royal College of Surgeons and Health Education England. Defining clinical competency is essential to allow validated training, which permits benchmarking of clinical knowledge and skills; this, in turn, helps to meet ever-growing patient expectations.
