The clinical features of Cheyne-Stokes respiration are similar to congestive heart failure, including dyspnea, cough, and fatigue. A patient with Cheyne-Stokes respiration with heart failure shows more lethargy and fatigue due to increased sympathetic activity because of disturbed sleep. Periodic leg movements are more common in patients with heart failure with Cheyne-Stokes respiration than patients without Cheyne-Stokes respiration.
