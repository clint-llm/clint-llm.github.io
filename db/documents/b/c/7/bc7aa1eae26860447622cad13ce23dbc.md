Hairy cell leukemia is a relatively rare hematological malignancy and is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an oncologist, hematologist, internist, and an infectious disease expert. There is no cure for hairy cell leukemia and without treatment life expectancy is about 4 years.

The interprofessional team can optimize the treatment of these patients through communication and coordination of care. Oncologists provide diagnoses and care plans. Nurse practitioners implement care and monitor treatment. Specialty care oncologic nurses should work with the team for coordination of care and are involved in patient education. Oncologic pharmacists should evaluate medications prescribed, recognize drug-drug interactions, provide patient education, and monitor compliance. The interprofessional team can thus improve outcomes for patients with HCL. [Level V]

Supportive care measures such as antimicrobial prophylaxis for viral and pneumocystis pneumonia should be considered for those with significant cytopenias. Patients should be educated about personal hygiene and the importance of handwashing.
