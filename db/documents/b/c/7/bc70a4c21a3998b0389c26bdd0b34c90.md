Cannabinoid intoxication occurs most frequently through inhalation, whether being used recreationally or medicinally. Cannabinoid toxicity usually occurs due to overuse and abuse or inadvertant ingestions of cannabis. Accidepntal overuse can occur with marijuana edibles due to excessive ingestion during the extended, unanticipated time it can take for peak action.
