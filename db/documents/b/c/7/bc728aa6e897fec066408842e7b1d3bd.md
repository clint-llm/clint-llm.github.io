The route of administration for corticosteroids depends on many factors, primarily being the disorder treated. The route can be parenteral, oral, inhaled, topical, injected (intramuscular, intraarticular, intralesional, intradermal, etc.), and rectal. The clinician must keep many factors in mind upon deciding to initiate corticosteroid therapy, including the route of administration, preparation, dosing, frequency, and duration of treatment.

Parenteral administration is often used in more emergent therapy as well as in those unable to tolerate medication by mouth. Oral administration is more common for chronic treatment. Patients should receive non-systemic therapy whenever possible to minimize systemic exposure.
