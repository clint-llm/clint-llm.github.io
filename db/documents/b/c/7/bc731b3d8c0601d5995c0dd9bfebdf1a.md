**Hemorrhoids**

Hemorrhoids arise from the internal or external hemorrhoidal plexuses and result from dilation and irritation of the anal cushions. Risk factors include constipation, diarrhea, prolonged straining to defecate, and pregnancy. Internal hemorrhoids typically present as painless bleeding with defecation. Internal hemorrhoids arise above the pectinate line and are usually painless because this area's nerve supply is by visceral innervation. External hemorrhoids can be pruritic and also present with bleeding. External hemorrhoids occur below the pectinate line. Thrombosis of external hemorrhoids is painful because this area below the pectinate line has somatic innervation. Hemorrhoids preferably receive conservative management, including eating a high fiber diet, doing sitz baths, and using stool softeners, etc. There are also medications and other non-operative treatment options available, such as rubber band ligation, before resorting to surgery as treatment.

**Anal Cancer**

Most cancers of the anal canal are classified as squamous cell carcinoma and share a strong correlation with a human papillomavirus infection of the anus. Cancer of the anal canal can present similarly to benign anal disease with symptoms such as pain, bleeding, pruritus, and a mass. Diagnosis includes a biopsy, pelvic MRI, and PET/CT. Anal cancer is treated with concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy and has a very high success rate.
