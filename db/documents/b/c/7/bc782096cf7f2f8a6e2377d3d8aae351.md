The incidence of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia is 35 per 10,000 person-years or 2.29 per 1000 persons and is the most common non-sinus tachydysrhythmia in young adults. Women have two times higher risk of developing paroxysmal SVT in comparison to men, and older individuals have five times higher compared to a younger person.

SVT is the most common symptomatic dysrhythmia in infants in children. Children with congenital heart disease are it increased risk for SVT. In children younger than 12 years old, an accessory atrioventricular pathway causing reentry tachycardia is the most common cause of SVT.
