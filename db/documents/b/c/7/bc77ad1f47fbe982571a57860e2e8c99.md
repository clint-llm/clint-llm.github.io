**Fractures and Dislocations**

Lisfranc injuries are categorizable into sprains and fracture/dislocation. The most common mechanism of injury is axial compression on a hyperplantar flexed foot. Patients present with a painful swollen foot with an inability to bear weight. Patients also typically have a plantar ecchymosis at the mid-foot which is highly correlative to a Lisfranc injury. During the physical exam, there is palpable tenderness at the midfoot, and passive motion of the forefoot reproduces the pain. Initial imaging is done with non-weight-bearing anteroposterior (AP), lateral and oblique x-rays. This can miss up to 50% of injuries so if there is a high index of suspicion then a weight-bearing comparison film with the contralateral foot is helpful.

Disruption of a line drawn from the medial base of the second metatarsal to the middle cuneiform as well as dorsal displacement of the first and or second metatarsal bases are reliable signs of fracture-dislocation. 2-mm or more of separation between the first and second metatarsal is a sign of instability. The fleck sign is another important finding of a Lisfranc injury and indicates an avulsion fracture of the Lisfranc ligament from the second metatarsal base. Missed diagnosis is common for Lisfranc injuries and can lead to chronic pain, dysfunction, and deformity. Non-displaced injuries are treated with a non-weight-bearing cast or boot for 6-8 weeks. If the injury is displaced over 2-mm, then surgical fixation is required.  For markedly displaced injuries open reduction and internal fixation is the treatment of choice.

Calcaneus fractures result secondary to a fall from height. The range of injuries can be mildly displaced to severely comminuted fractures. Often missed injuries also include lumbar spine compression fractures. These injuries can be devastating in their long-term sequelae not only from the damage to the subtalar joint but to the surrounding soft tissue as well.

Jones fractures are fractures of the base of the fifth metatarsal which is separate and distinct from avulsion fractures. This fracture represents a vascular watershed area prone to nonunion and requires prompt surgical stabilization in athletes and active individuals.

**Charcot Neuropathic Osteoarthropathy**

Charcot neuropathic osteoarthropathy is a chronic progressive disease most commonly seen in diabetes. This is frequently seen in the foot and ankle as a result of peripheral neuropathy. It starts off as a localized unregulated inflammatory process but eventually leads to gradual bone loss, joint dislocations, and deformities. Patients usually present with a red, warm, and swollen foot. Pain may or may not be present. Radiographs of the affected area can show a range of pathologies from osteopenia, fracture and dislocations, and severe joint destruction. Evalutation and diagnostics should include a CBC, CRP, and ESR to rule out an infectious process. MRI or bone scans can also helpful and may help distinguish between infection and arthropathy.

**Gout**

Gout typically presents as an acute and extremely painful red, swollen, great toe specifically affecting the metatarsophalangeal joint (MTP). The pathogenesis remains unclear but is thought to be due to a purine metabolism defect causing monosodium urate crystals to deposit in joints. Patients usually have elevated uric acid in the blood but the diagnosis is made by aspiration of the joint to find negatively birefringent crystals. Treatment for acute episodes is rest with intraarticular injection of cortisone, oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, glucocorticoids, or colchicine. Allopurinol or other xanthine oxidase inhibitors are used to prevent future occurrences. Additionally, conservative treatment such as weight loss, avoiding purine-rich food and alcoholic beverages, are adjunctive measures to help alleviate symptoms.

**Hallux Rigidus**

Hallux rigidus is a degenerative joint disease of the MPJ joint of the great toe. Patients typically present with a painful stiff toe with tenderness to palpation of the MPJ joint dorsally. Osteophytes may be palpable dorsally on the physical exam. The most common physical exam finding is usually a decrease in active and passive range of motion, most notably dorsiflexion. On x-ray, there is the characteristic dorsal osteophyte and signs of osteoarthritis of the first MPJ. Treatment includes NSAIDs, activity and shoe modification, and intra-articular injections. It may also be treated surgically.

**Hallux Valgus**

Hallux valgus (bunion) is valgus deviation of the proximal phalanx which promotes varus posturing of the first metatarsal. The metatarsal head is displaced medially leaving the sesamoids uncovered and rotated on the frontal plane. The medial capsule becomes attenuated and the lateral joint capsule is contracted. Risks factors are both intrinsic and extrinsic. There is a genetic predisposition in addition to biomechanical factors related to the first ray that may lead to bunion deformity.  High-heeled shoes with a narrow toe box can also lead to deformity. Bunions are more common in adults, primarily women, but are also common in children, termed juvenile hallux valgus. Patients present complaining of pain exacerbated by shoe wear. Physical examination reveals a wide forefoot with tenderness over the first metatarsal head and a valgus deviation of the phalanx.  Conservative treatment consists of shoe modification and the avoidance of high-heeled footwear. Juvenile hallux valgus should be treated conservatively as long as possible. Patients who fail conservative treatment may be treated surgically. Surgical treatment depends on the severity of the deformity and the patients' age and activity level.

**Lesser Toes Deformities**

Claw toes are hyperextension deformities of the MPJ joint with a flexion deformity of the PIP and the DIP.  Hammertoes are flexion deformities of PIP and extension deformities of the MPJ and DIP joints. Mallet toes are flexion deformities of the DIP joints. If any of these deformities become symptomatic, they can be treated conservatively with splinting/padding. For severe deformities, surgical management is recommended.
