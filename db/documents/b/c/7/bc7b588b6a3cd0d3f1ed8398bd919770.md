Neck abscesses in the deep neck tissues are difficult to diagnose, localize, access, and manage. The anatomy of the neck is complex and contains several important vessels and nerves, as well as structures that are critical to the functioning of the airway and gastrointestinal system. The affected tissues may be deep and impossible to palpate or visualize externally. Nearby structures can become involved in the inflammation and lead to neurovascular, bony, or airway issues. This activity examines when neck abscesses should be considered on differential diagnosis and how to properly evaluate them. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with neck abscesses.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the signs and symptoms that patients with a neck abscess may exhibit.
- Explain which patients are most at risk for developing neck abscesses.
- Explore treatment strategies for neck abscesses. 
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination to enhance outcomes for patients affected by neck abscesses.
