The differential diagnoses of hypoglycemia can be divided as low glucose without symptoms or normal glucose with symptoms. It is described in detail as follows:

**Low Asymptomatic Glucose**

The artefactual low glucose without any symptoms can be observed if a sample is taken without an antiglycolytic agent such as fluoride in the blood collection tube and delayed processing.

**Symptomatic Normal Glucose**

Normal plasma glucose with autonomic symptoms (tremors, palpitations, sweating, anxiety, and hunger) can be seen with other conditions as follows:

- Postprandial syndrome

- Cardiac disease (arrhythmia, valvular disease)

- Hyperthyroidism

- Pheochromocytoma

- Medications

- Psychiatric disease
