The route of administration of the prostaglandin analog can determine the side effects the patient might experience. Continuous prostaglandin infusion may place the patient at risk for catheter infections, while an injected prostaglandin analog may cause a local siteÂ infection or pain at the injection site.

Topical latanoprost has very limited systemic side effects, but over time the drug may cause iris darkening, eyelash thickening, periocular skin pigmentation, and conjunctival hyperemia.
