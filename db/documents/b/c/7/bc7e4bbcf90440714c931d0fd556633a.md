Pentobarbital works in the central nervous system by binding to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A subtype receptors. This action induces a change in the chloride transport receptor, leading to an increase in the duration that the chloride channels remain open, hence potentiating GABA effects. GABA is responsible for producing CNS depression and thus prolonging the time the channels remain open and intensifying the depressant effects on the CNS.
