These tumors arise from the meningeal cells (arachnoid cap cells) lining the optic nerve sheath. They typically grow circumferentially around the optic nerve and can significantly compress its pial vascular supply. These tumors tend to follow the path of least resistance, and as a result of that, they can invade the entire path of the optic nerve, from the optic canal posteriorly to the globe anteriorly.

Secondary ONSM is an extension of an intracranial meningioma growing into the orbit. A secondary ONSM is more common than primary ONSM, but it is not a true ONSM as it do not grow from the cells surrounding the nerve. Some meningiomas can grow as an en-plaque meningioma along the temporal dura and can easily extend into the orbit through the optic canal or the superior orbital fissure.
