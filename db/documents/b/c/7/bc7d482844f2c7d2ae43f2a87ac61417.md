Diagnosing urethritis can be a challenge if patients do not feel comfortable discussing their sexual practices. For patients to feel at ease and disclose important history, a robust doctor-patient relationship must exist. Doctors should work closely with other staff to ensure patient comfort and a non-judgemental environment. Pertinent history can lead to different suspected organisms, and since treatment is organism-specific, it is imperative to maintain and establish this relationship early on.

Clinicians should work closely with a pharmacist to ensure the best antibiotic choices for treatment, with the pharmacist verifying appropriate coverage, dosing, and duration. Patient and community safety are affected by ensuring the prescribing of the best antibiotic and medication compliance. Nursing can chart progress and counsel the patient on compliance, as well as answer any patient questions and report concerns or results to the clinical team. The patient's confidentiality is a priority, as well as reporting diseases.

Having an interprofessional team approach to testing and treating patients will maximize patient care benefits and medication compliance while eradicating the disease. [Level 5]
