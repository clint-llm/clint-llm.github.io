Potency correlates with lipid solubility, which is the ability of the local anesthetic molecule to penetrate membranes in a hydrophobic environment.

The duration of action also correlates with lipid solubility and protein binding. Highly lipid-soluble and protein-bound local anesthetics have a longer duration of action, presumably because they are less likely to be cleared by blood flow. Local anesthetics that are highly lipid-soluble also exhibit a high degree of plasma protein binding, mostly to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein and, to a lesser extent, albumin; as a direct consequence, their elimination is prolonged. Blood flow to the tissue deposit of local anesthetic determines the absorption rate and is responsible for the plasma level. It will, however, also transport local anesthetics away from the tissue site, reducing the risk of direct nerve toxicity. Lidocaine has a 90% hepatic metabolism, and the elimination half-life is 1.5 to 2 hours, which can be prolonged up to 3.5 fold in patients with severe liver disease.
