History will reveal deficits in attention and awareness with at least one alteration in cognition (per DSM-5 criteria for delirium). These changes often develop within a short time frame and are frequently noted to fluctuate during the day. An existing or emerging neurocognitive disorder must not better explain these changes. Of note, indeed, inattention and change in cognition cannot be explained as a baseline neurocognitive disorder such as dementia or a seriously reduced level of arousal due to sedative administration or coma.

Classic assessment of orientation to person, place, situation, and time may not be enough for evaluation of delirium, as patients can be alert and oriented to all of these but still meet criteria. The course of delirium can last days to months. Additional symptoms include positive psychotic symptoms, confusion, lethargy, and drowsiness, among other symptoms.

A complete neurological and physical exam should be performed and may reveal clues suggesting the cause of delirium. The presence of a fever, for example, provides clues of an infectious etiology, whereas focal neurological deficits may indicate a neurological or vascular cause of the delirium.

Thorough patient history may reveal other clues, including a history of substance or alcohol abuse that may suggest intoxication, withdrawal, or relevant vitamin deficiency.
