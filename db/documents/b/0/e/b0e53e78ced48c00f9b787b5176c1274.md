As labetalol is typically used to treat acute hypertension, whether it presents in the emergency department or an outpatient clinic, an interprofessional team approach and effective communication are essential for quality patient care. This interprofessional team can include specialists, other clinicians (MDs, DOs, PAs, NPs), nursing staff, and pharmacists. In the emergency department, swift intake and triage by the nurse or medical technician to identify a patient with dangerously elevated blood pressure and quickly but effectively convey the critical information to a physician or provider are necessary. If hospital admission is warranted, communicating the crucial details of the patient's presentation, medical history, and the treatment and current medical workup that have been completed are important, so time and resources are not wasted on repeating tests and exams. Utilizing an interprofessional team methodology that employs open communication between all team members and coordinated activity will improve patient outcomes and fewer adverse effects, particularly in hypertensive emergencies.
