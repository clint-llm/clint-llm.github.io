Isolated extremity trauma is the next potential target in specialty fields like orthopedic surgery as, in general, the diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation clinical care pathways are being given increasing attention in the literature as potential targets for alternative payment models, bundled payment care initiatives, and healthcare cost containment strategies.  Thus, healthcare providers, clinicians, and institutions have been previously encouraged to implement a "big data versus little data" management mindset to apply notable trends, risk factors, and potential treatment variables that have been previously identified across large sample sizes and database literature reports and subsequently applying these potential "at-risk" variables in a customized fashion across all institutions.  This ensures that the healthcare systems worldwide mitigate the risk of falling into a "one size fits all" treatment strategy for patients in all areas of the world.
