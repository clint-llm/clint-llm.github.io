Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (recompression therapy) is considered the treatment of choice for DCS and IEDCS, and this should be instituted as soon as possible. This increases ambient pressure to drive gases back into solution and increases oxygen delivery to ischemic tissues. Controlled decompression then allows controlled dissolved gas offloading to prevent the re-formation of any precipitant bubbles. Once the patient improves clinically, the patient is decompressed slowly to atmospheric surface pressure. Multiple sessions of recompression therapy may be required if symptoms return.

If recompression therapy is not immediately available, the patient should be placed on 100% oxygen for several hours (whether or not there is a resolution of symptoms) or until recompression is available. This establishes an oxygen washout, which is when there is a maximum inert gas gradient between the lungs and dissolved gases, resulting in rapid removal.

The other initialÂ intervention for IEDCS should include adequate fluid resuscitation with crystalloid solutions. The formation of free gas in the bloodstream can also induce platelet activation, so consideration of antiplatelet therapy (i.e., aspirin) is warranted.

If the patient is suffering from suspected IEDCS, it should be noted that inner ear barotrauma cannot be easily excluded. Therefore, bilateral myringotomy should be considered before initiating hyperbaric oxygen therapy.
