Although absolute contraindications for bleomycin have not been established, it is crucial to assess lung disease history and renal function before administration. Because of the aforementioned numerous adverse effects of bleomycin on pulmonary tissue, patients with a history of smoking are at elevated risk for pulmonary complications due to bleomycin. In addition, elderly patients and patients with stage IV disease have demonstrated to be more likely to experience lung toxicity with bleomycin exposure. This is also true of patients who receive bolus drug delivery as opposed to continuous infusion. Patients who require supplemental oxygen administration have also been shown to be at increased risk for serious adverse effects of bleomycin exposure. Although studies regarding teratogenic effects of bleomycin exposure in humans are limited, some sources consider antineoplastic therapy during gestation to be generally harmful to fetal development, especially during the first trimester.
