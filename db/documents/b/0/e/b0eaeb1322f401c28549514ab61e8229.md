A standard open or laparoscopic abdominal operative tray is essential to the surgeonâ€™s success in performing this procedure. Basic equipment such as surgical drapes, scalpels, and electrocautery should be included. For open procedures, a self-retaining table-mounted retractor such as a Bookwalter retractor system is helpful. For laparoscopic procedures, CO2 gas insufflation tubing, trocars, a 30-degree laparoscope with a light source, and a monitor are required.

Frequently used instruments for both open and laparoscopic procedures include suction irrigator, bowel graspers, liver retractor, scissors, ultrasonic dissector (harmonic scalpel), and vessel sealing device. A linear GIA or circular EEA stapler may be used depending on the type of gastric resection and reconstruction technique performed.
