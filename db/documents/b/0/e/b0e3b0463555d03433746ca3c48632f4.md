Erythromelalgia is a rarely occurring disease entity characterized by a triad of erythema, warmth, and recurrent burning pain, most notably affecting the extremities. Although erythromelalgia is typically bilateral, it can present unilaterally, especially in secondary cases. Atypical cases presenting with lesions and symptoms solely involving the face have been observed; however, they are extremely rare and are often misdiagnosed. This activity outlines the evaluation of erythromelalgia in addition to highlighting the role of the interprofessional team in managing and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of erythromelalgia.
- Summarize the evaluation of erythromelalgia.
- Outline the management options available for erythromelalgia.
- Summarize some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance erythromelalgia and improve outcomes.
