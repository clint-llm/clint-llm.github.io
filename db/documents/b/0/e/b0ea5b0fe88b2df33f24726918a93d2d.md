The radiation of back pain associated with disc disease is thought to be due to compression of the nerve roots in the spinal canal from a disc bulge or expansion of degenerative tissues (i.e., ligamentum flavum, facet joints). In a 2010 study by Suri et al. of 154 consecutive patients presenting with new lumbar disk herniation, 62% noted the symptoms began spontaneously compared to just 26% reporting the symptoms started after a specific household task or seemingly common non-lifting activity. Contrary to popular belief, fewer than 8% reported this acute sciatica started after heavy lifting or physical trauma.
