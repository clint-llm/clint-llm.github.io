Contaminated fish may both smell and appear fresh, but many report the fish tasting “peppery.” The skin may appear honeycombed when cooked.

Signs and symptoms typically occur within 2 hours of ingesting a fish with Scombroid poisoning and last for about 12 to 48 hours. The most common symptoms are rash, flushing, headache, and diarrhea. Less common symptoms include abdominal cramps, blurred vision, cold-like sensation, dizziness, nausea, sweating, and tachycardia. Severe reactions cause angioedema, tongue swelling, respiratory distress, cardiac arrest, and death. Patients taking isoniazid or monoamine oxidase inhibitors can have much worse reactions because of the histaminase blockade in the gastrointestinal tract.
