Before disease onset, screening tests using a card agglutination test have can be implemented. The card agglutination test is a serologic test that utilizes capillary blood, plasma, or serum dilutions. The latter is more specific. This test employs antigens from T. brucei gambiense and has a variable sensitivity of near 90%. While some sources boast a negative predictive value of equal to 99%,

Diagnosis of active disease relies on the constellation of clinical history, exposure to endemic areas, direct visualization of organisms, and adjunctive serologic tests. Microscopic examination of blood, lymph node aspirate, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may yield parasites. Thin and thick blood films have low sensitivity, and miniature anion-exchange centrifugation technique and/or capillary tube centrifugation should be used to increase yield.

Diagnosis of T. cruzi is usually established by a history of exposure to an endemic area and direct observation of trypomastigotes in Giemsa-stained wet mounts of blood or CSF. Organisms may be seen in pericardial fluid, bone marrow, brain, skin, or other infected tissues. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most sensitive mode of detection, but often serologic assays are used to confirm the disease.
