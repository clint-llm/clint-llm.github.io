**Antibiotic Prophylaxsis**

Prophylaxis against Lyme disease following a bite from I scapularis is a chief concern. However, even if the bite occurs in an area where B burgdorferi exists, if the tick has not eaten a blood meal, infection is unlikely. Prophylaxis against Lyme disease is recommended when all of the following circumstances exist:

- the attached tick can be reliably identified as an adult or nymphal I scapularis tick

- the estimated time of attachment is greater than 36 hours based on the degree of engorgement of the tick with blood or certainty about the time of tick exposure

- antibiotic prophylaxis can be initiated within 72 hours of tick removal

- ecologic information indicates that the local rate of infection of ticks with B burgdorferi is greater than 20%

- doxycycline is not contraindicated

If prophylaxis is advisable, a single dose of doxycycline may be offered. There is limited data on the efficacy of chemoprophylaxis initiated more than 72 hours following tick removal. More than 20% of the  I scapularis population is infected with B burgdorferi in parts of New England, the mid-Atlantic States, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, but not in most other locations in the United States. Whether antibiotic prophylaxis after a tick bite will reduce the incidence of anaplasmosis or babesiosis is unknown.

It is not recommended to use amoxicillin instead of doxycycline in persons for whom doxycycline is contraindicated because of the absence of data on an effective short-course regimen for prophylaxis, the likely need for a multi-day regimen (and its associated adverse effects), the efficacy of antibiotic treatment of Lyme disease if infection were to develop, and the low risk that a person with a tick bite will develop a serious complication of Lyme disease.
