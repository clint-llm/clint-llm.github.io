The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Betacoronavirus genus and consists of four major structural proteins identified in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease.

Initially, the virus is able to evade the immune system with continued viral replication intracellularly and may cause direct cellular injury. Eventually, the innate and adaptive immune system recognizes the S-protein and leads to an overt immune response and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α that may potentiate lung injury and diffuse alveolar damage. A maladaptive immune response with severe lymphopenia and release of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) induced protein 10 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has also been associated with severe COVID-19 and mortality.

In severe COVID-19 ARDS, sustained lung injury and inflammation lead to the release of profibrotic markers such as TGF-b, leading to accelerated pulmonary fibrosis.
