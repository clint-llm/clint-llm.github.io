Peripheral vascular trauma can occur in either the civilian or military setting.  From there it subdivides by the mechanism of injury (which can be blunt, penetrating, or combination) and anatomical location (upper or lower extremity). Penetrating trauma can be from objects that are missiles (e.g., bullets, fragments from a blast, etc.) or stabs (e.g., knife, coat hangers, keys, etc.). Blunt trauma occurs secondary to fractures or dislocations.
