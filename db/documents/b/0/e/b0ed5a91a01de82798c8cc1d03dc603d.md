Poland syndrome has a wide diversity of clinical presentations. The congenital deformity can extend to anomalies of the pectoral muscle, breast, nipple complex, axillary fold, soft tissue, ribs, and upper limb.

Poland syndrome has also been occasionally associated with vascular, skeletal, and inner organ anomalies, including subclavian and axillary vascular system variances, scoliosis, sternal and rib abnormalities, and even dextrocardia.

Symbrachydactyly, sometimes referred to as “atypical cleft hand,” is a congenital limb abnormality describing hand malformations involving brachydactyly (short fingers), syndactyly (union of 2 or more fingers), and global hypoplasia of the hand. These can include transverse deficiency (congenital amputation), central deficiency (absence of one or more digits in which the central rays of hand affected), brachymetacarpia (shortened metacarpal bone and finger), brachyphalangism (shortened phalanges), and hypodactyly (fewer than the normal number of fingers). All these anomalies describe different forms and severity of hand conditions that can present in patients with Poland syndrome.
