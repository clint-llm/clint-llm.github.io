Plasmodium ovale is a cause of non-falciparum malaria infection. Non-falciparum malaria is due to infection caused by Plasmodium species other than P. falciparum. Other causes of non-falciparum malaria infection include P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. knowlesi. Malaria is a protozoan disease transmitted by the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes. P. ovale malaria is endemic to tropical western Africa. It rarely causes severe illness or death.

To avoid the morbidity and mortality of malaria, prompt diagnosis, and treatment are necessary. P. falciparum is often resistant to chloroquine and can quickly be fatal. The plasmodium species can be differentiated by its morphology on a blood smear. P. falciparum is often associated with high levels of parasitemia and the 'banana-shaped' gametocytes. About 5% to 10% of patients with malaria are infected with more than a single plasmodium species. Each plasmodium species has a geographical area of endemicity, but some overlap is common.
