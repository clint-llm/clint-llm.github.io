The differential diagnosis for EBV positive mucocutaneous ulcer includes the following:

- EBV positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)

- Classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL)

- Plasmablastic lymphoma

- Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD)

- Anaplastic large cell lymphoma

The clinical features of EBVMCU, specifically the localized nature and absence of a mass lesion, are integral in distinguishing it from DLBCL. These entities share an almost indistinguishable cytologic composition and phenotype. The presence of sharp circumscription and a band of small T cells at the base of the ulcer can differentiate EBVMCU from the more infiltrative patterns of DLBCL. EBV positive mucocutaneous ulcer also shares morphologic and phenotypic characteristics with cHL, specifically the presence of CD30/CD15 positive Reed-Sternberg like cells, though, cHL rarely presents as extranodal disease.
