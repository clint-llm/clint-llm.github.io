Scapular dyskinesia is a loss of normal scapular motion. It can result from inflexibility and stiffness of muscles attaching from the scapular to the humerus.

Subscapularis tendon ruptures frequently occur in approximately 60% of people in the setting of anterior shoulder dislocations.

Functional shoulder instability (FSI) occurs when there is dyssynergia of the muscles acting on the shoulder without trauma or morphological/anatomical alterations. We can distinguish subgroups: positional FSI (if a sub-dislocation occurs during movement) and nonpositional FSI (if a sub-dislocation occurs in a neutral position). The FSI seems to have origins in adolescence, and the causes are not entirely understood, with an incidence of 69% among young people.

When evaluating a shoulder with multiple existing manual tests, it is always better to combine instrumental clinical examinations since the literature demonstrates a modest accuracy in searching for lesions.
