Early closure or fusion of the physis leads to growth disturbances such as deformity and limb length discrepancies. Complications are usually found when fractures of the distal tibia and distal femur are involved.

When the closure of only a part of the plate occurs, angular deformities may be present.

Entrapment of the periosteum within the fracture may occur and can prevent a complete fracture reduction. MRI can identify this.
