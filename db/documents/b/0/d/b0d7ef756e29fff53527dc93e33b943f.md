- The most common mechanism of injury for both distal radius and ulna fractures is from a fall on an outstretched hand (FOOSH).

- The most common distal ulna injury presentation is a distal radius fracture with a neighboring ulnar styloid fracture.

- An ulnar styloid fracture with greater than 2 mm at its base is at increased risk of DRUJ instability and may require surgical intervention.

- An isolated distal ulnar shaft fracture is rare and should warrant evaluation for possible abuse in at-risk populations (i.e., nightstick fracture).

- In cases where both distal radius and ulna fractures are present, the DRUJ should be assessed before and after fixation of the distal radius to determine if the distal ulna requires repair.

- Most distal ulna fractures only need proper stabilization of the concomitant distal radius fracture to heal appropriately.

- Hardware irritation is a common complaint with distal ulna fracture repair due to inadequate soft tissue coverage.

- Extensor carpi ulnaris rupture and ulnar neurovascular structures are at risk with distal ulna injuries and operative repair.
