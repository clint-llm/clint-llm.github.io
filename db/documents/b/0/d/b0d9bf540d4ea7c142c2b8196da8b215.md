IBC is a clinicopathological diagnosis that requires an interprofessional approach for diagnosis.

Several things need to be kept in mind when evaluating the skin biopsy:

- Dermal lymphatic invasion (DLI) is not always found in patients with primary inflammatory breast cancer, this is likely due to sampling error.

- DLI can be an incidental finding in patients with breast cancer who do not have clinical evidence of IBC. These tumors are not considered to be inflammatory cancers.

- Other disorders like acute mastitis, infiltrated lymphoma or leukemia, and advanced breast cancers can also have similar clinical features.
