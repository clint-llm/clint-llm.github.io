**Decontamination**

- In-vitro studies showed that lithium does not adhere effectively to activated charcoal

- Gastric lavage should be considered, particularly in the case of regular-release preparations and patients presenting early to the emergency department. On the other hand, in case of sustained-release preparations, administration, or massive ingestion of regular-release products, whole-bowel irrigation should also be considered

**Elimination**

- The most appropriate method of lithium removal is hemodialysis,Â particularly if the patient demonstrates signs and symptoms of severe lithium poisoning or is having a renal failure due to its small volume of distribution and marginal protein binding

- Peritoneal dialysis should not replace hemodialysis; however, if the hemodialysis facilities are not available (e.g., in remote areas), peritoneal dialysis can be initiated

**Disposition**

- All patients with toxicity signs and symptoms, even those with normal serum lithium levels, should be admitted for monitoring in the hospital.

- In case of moderate or severe symptoms, the patient has to be admitted to an intensive care unit.

- Serial levels of lithium in the serum should be obtained every 6 hours in case of asymptomatic patients after acute ingestion. This should be continued until a descending drift has been established.

- Patients should not be discharged until they are asymptomatic and have a serum lithium level less than 1.5 mEq/L.
