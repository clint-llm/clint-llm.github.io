The principal differential diagnosis for de Quervain thyroiditis is acute infectious thyroiditis and hemorrhagic thyroid nodule. Thyroid function tests are usually normal. Infectious thyroiditis is associated with leukocytosis, and a thyroid ultrasonogram might show an abscess—needle aspiration show neutrophil predominant fluid in infectious thyroiditis and blood in a hemorrhagic thyroid nodule.

The other differential diagnosis for subacute thyroiditis is painless thyroiditis, postpartum thyroiditis, amiodarone (Iodine) induced thyroiditis, checkpoint inhibitor-induced thyroiditis, radiation thyroiditis, and palpation thyroiditis. Urine iodine levels are < 500 mcg/L in subacute thyroiditis compared to amiodarone-induced thyroiditis. Thyroid cancer, lymphoma, and painful Hashimoto thyroiditis are other differential diagnoses to consider in less classic presentations of subacute thyroiditis.

There have been cases where patients present with a fever of unknown origin, and the workup only reveals subacute thyroiditis.
