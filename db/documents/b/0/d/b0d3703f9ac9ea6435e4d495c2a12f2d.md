Emergency room consultation may include radiology, internal medicine, and, most importantly, surgery. In the long term, consultation should be aimed at the specialist team that will assist in the management of the underlying pathology that leads to perforation. This may include gastroenterology to assist in long-term surveillance and chronic disease management strategies in cases of inflammatory bowel disease or diverticulitis, oncology for the management of malignancy, or the primary care team for assistance with chronic medication management.
