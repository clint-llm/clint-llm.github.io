For classic HL, radiation therapy (RT) is often used after chemotherapy for a residual, limited area of lymphadenopathy that is FDG avid on restaging PET/CT. RT by itself can be used to treat some cases of nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL.

In NHL, RT can be used in various scenarios;

- For early-stage (Ann Arbor stage I or II) indolent NHL with a limited amount of disease burden, RT can be used as a single modality treatment.

- For more advanced and/or aggressive NHL, RT is used after chemotherapy as consolidation.

Consensus recommendations/guidelines from the International Lymphoma Radiation Oncology Group (ILROG):

- Positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) is recommended as the standard modality for staging and response assessment in fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid lymphomas, in line with the international Lugano guidelines. An accurate definition of sites of involvement before any systemic therapy is important for radiation therapy (RT) planning. Baseline pretreatment PET/CT is recommended as best practice.

- Radiation oncologists should familiarize themselves with the limitations of FDG imaging and recognize conditions that mimic lymphoma, such as brown fat; physiologic uptake in tonsils, nasopharynx, or salivary glands; inflammatory uptake; benign tumors of parotids; sarcoidosis; thymic hyperplasia; and physiologic bone marrow uptake.

- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is indicated in certain anatomic areas: central nervous system, head (orbits, nose/paranasal sinuses, and skull base), and skeletal sites.

- The use of a 5-point score (known as Deauville criteria) is recommended for response assessment, in line with the international Lugano guidelines.

- Deauville score 3 requires cautious interpretation, with consideration given to clinical context, histological type, disease stage, bulk, and estimated prognosis, as well as the results of clinical trials. In some clinical trials using a de-escalation strategy with the omission of RT, Deauville score three was not considered a complete metabolic response.

- When defining RT targets based on PET/CT, the clinician should carefully consider the anatomical information from the CT part of the scan because some small involved nodes with low FDG uptake may be below the PET detection limit.

- Smaller nodes that are not FDG-avid but seen on CT adjacent to (or between) FDG-avid nodes, and judged to be involved, should be included in the target volume. For CT masses with partial FDG uptake, the entire mass should be included in the target volume.

- Residual FDG-avid areas can be treated to higher doses using an integrated boost technique.

- Thin-slice CT should be performed in the chosen treatment position, using immobilization devices if required, and should include relevant organs at risk as a whole. Intravenous contrast is recommended to help identify blood vessels and enhance soft-tissue definition.

- Breathing-control techniques (e.g., deep inspiration breath-hold) are recommended as best practice for mediastinal treatment to help reduce organ-at-risk doses.

- PET/CT is highly recommended as best practice for planning modern radiation volumes, according to the involved node or involved site RT concepts.

- If RT is the sole modality of treatment, a dedicated planning PET/CT can be performed in the treatment position, with the use of immobilization devices if required.

- If chemotherapy is given before RT, it is recommended that the prechemotherapy PET/CT be performed in a position similar to RT position to enable accurate coregistration with the planning CT and outlining of involved node RT volumes.

- If the prechemotherapy PET/CT cannot be obtained in the treatment position and accurate coregistration is not possible, the concept of involved site RT as described in other International Lymphoma Radiation Oncology Group guidelines should be used to account for the lack of optimal prechemotherapy imaging.

- In sites where MRI is useful, both PET/CT and MRI scans should be coregistered with planning CT scans to guide target volume definition.

- Image-guided radiotherapy, particularly using cone-beam CT, is recommended with modern RT techniques, which use small target volumes and steep dose gradients, to ensure accuracy of treatment delivery.

- The frequency of imaging has not been studied carefully in the context of lymphoma, and individual departments should decide on the frequency of imaging based on local setup accuracy data, margins used to create the planning target volume, specific treatment site, and use of immobilization devices.
