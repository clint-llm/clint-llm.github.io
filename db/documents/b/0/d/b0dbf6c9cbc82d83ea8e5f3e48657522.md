The clinical presentation is very variable. HI lesions suggest the ‘negative image’ seen in incontinentia pigmenti. It is characterized by hypopigmented macules following the lines of Blashko, arranged in sharply demarcated whorls, streaks, and patches. The lines of Blashko represent migratory pathways for fetal epidermal cell migration. The hypopigmentation can be unilateral or bilateral, located or diffuse, sparing the palms, soles, and mucous membranes. The pattern of lines involves the trunk, the limbs, and more rarely the head.  Hypopigmentation may become more apparent in the first few months or after the first exposure to the sun, by increasing the contrast with healthy skin. It may fade within adulthood, rarely in childhood.

Extracutaneous findings are found in 75 % of cases. Neurological manifestations are seen in 90 % of cases. In addition to musculoskeletal symptoms which are found in 70 % of cases, ophthalmologic manifestations are present in 25 %, and 10 % have cardiac defects. Scalp alteration including changes in hair color, alopecia, and hair with trichorrhexia and white-grayish color may be found.
