The presence of a left atrial thrombus is an absolute contraindication to catheter ablation for AF as this may cause embolism of the thrombus into the arterial system. There is no large-scale data yet that has shown catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation mitigates stroke risk. Thus, patients not amenable to anti-coagulation represent a relative contraindication to this procedure.
