- Warts : Filiform warts usually resemble skin tags.The distribution of warts usually help to differentiate them from acrochordons.

- Neurofibromas : These are benign soft pedunculated growth.

- Naevi : Different small pedunculated nevus usually resemble a skin tag. The size, pigmented pattern and location of naevi can differentiate these from acrochordons

- Seborrheic keratoses. For instance, some seborrheic keratosis, specifically the variant termed dermatosis papulosis nigra (DPN), may overlap clinically with acrochordons on the face. Dermatosis papulosa nigra typically present in a pattern of small, typically pigmented, pedunculated or simplyÂ raised papules on the face and adjacent structures. These are most common in patients of African-American descent.
