The binding ofÂ avian influenza viruses (AIVs) to human cells is mostly via specific receptors found more commonly in the respiratory tract.

Once the AIV has entered the host cell, replication may be prolonged relative to endemic human influenza viruses. In the 1997 H5N1 outbreak, the median time from infection to the detection of the virus was 6.5 days, and in some patients, no virus was detectable for up to 16 days.

Host immune response plays a role in pathogenicity, as inflammatory markers appear to be higher in patients who experience a more severe disease course, and the presence of inflammatory cells in damaged alveoli in post-mortem patient evaluation seems to support this suggestion.
