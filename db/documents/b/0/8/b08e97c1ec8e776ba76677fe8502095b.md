Establishing an anembryonic pregnancy can sometimes b difficult on an ultrasound. Communication with the radiologist relaying hCG lab values and patient presentation can be helpful in avoiding a missed diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy. The sonographer also plays an important role in accurately evaluating a patient to appropriately exclude an ectopic pregnancy. Patients presenting with complications of either initial presentation or from treatment often present to the emergency department. Interprofessional communication between an emergency department provider and an OB/GYN specialist includes communicating a detailed and thorough history and physical exam. This especially includes signs of sepsis or hemodynamic instability. The role of a mental health professional in following up with patients is also critical in ensuring the appropriate mental health management of a possibly traumatic experience for a patient.
