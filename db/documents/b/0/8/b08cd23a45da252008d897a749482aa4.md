The lingual artery branches off the external carotid artery in the neck-deep to the platysma muscle. The lingual artery moves medially to the greater hone of the hyoid bone and dives deep to the digastric and stylohyoid muscles. The lingual artery passes between the middle constrictor of the pharynx and the hyoglossus muscles.
