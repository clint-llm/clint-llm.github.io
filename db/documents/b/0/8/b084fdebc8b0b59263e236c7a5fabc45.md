Fluid management is best managed through the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team. Interprofessional discussion within the healthcare team can optimize proper fluid management for patients admitted to the hospital.

Nutritionists and dietitians help determine caloric needs for patients to ensure that they meet their metabolic demands, which are especially important during acute illnesses so that the body can heal properly. This is especially important in the pediatric population for infants who drink breast or formula. Pharmacists can recommend optimal fluid replacement formulations via IV, along with working with nutritionists for total parenteral nutrition (TPN). TPN is sometimes necessary as a temporizing measure for patients unable to take enteral fluid intake, but it comes with various challenges, such as the need for central venous access and the risk of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI). In the end, only with a complete interprofessional approach to fluid management can patient outcomes be optimized. [Level 5]
