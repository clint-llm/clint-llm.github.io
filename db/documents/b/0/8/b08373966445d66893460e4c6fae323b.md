The RLAS-R is often used in conjunction with the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) to provide an early assessment of cognitive function in brain injury patients. Differing from the GCS, the RLAS-R is helpful in evaluating a patient's recovery beyond the initial emergence from coma. Earlier screening of cognitive function plays an important role in the prediction of recovery outcomes and facilitates rehabilitation planning in a clinical setting.

The Ranchos Los Amigos Scale was shown to have high inter-rater reliability and concurrent, predictive value. It is often used in conjunction with the GCS.
