The medial brachial cutaneous nerve has a significant clinical role in brachioplasty surgeries. With the rise of bariatric surgery procedures, there has also been an increased demand for plastic surgery focusing on the upper arm. Brachioplasty procedures emphasize correcting the soft tissue laxity of the middle to the upper third of the arm. Traditional procedures involve incisions from the axilla to the medial epicondyle, with the elevation of cutaneous tissue proximal to the medial epicondyle. One of the complications of brachioplasty is an injury to cutaneous nerves within the tissues dissected, mainly the ulnar nerve and terminal branches of the medial brachial cutaneous nerve and medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve. Unfortunately, the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve and medial brachial cutaneous nerve's anatomic path makes it necessary for these nerves to cross the area where the older skin incision is typically placed.
