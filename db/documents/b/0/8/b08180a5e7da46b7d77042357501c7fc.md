The mechanism of action for patients receiving RhIG in immune thrombocytopenic purpura treatment is not entirely understood. Prevention of Rh isoimmunization appears to be an immunologic blockade of Fc receptors (RcR) within the reticuloendothelial system (RES); other immunomodulatory effects are also possible. Intravenous infusion of anti-D into an Rh-positive recipient leads to antibody coating of the circulating erythrocytes, which are eventually cleared primarily by the spleen. Clearance of sensitized erythrocytes by the RES results in increased platelet counts and reduced bleeding.

The mechanism by which RhIG prevents isoimmunization is not completely understood but is likely to suppress the immune response and antibody formation in Rh-incompatible individuals (Rh-negative exposed to Rh-positive RBCs). If administration occurs within 72 hours of full-term delivery, the incidence decreases from 12% or 13% to 1% or 2%. The chances of isoimmunization drop to less than 1% with the administration schedule at 28 weeks gestation and within 72-hours postpartum.
