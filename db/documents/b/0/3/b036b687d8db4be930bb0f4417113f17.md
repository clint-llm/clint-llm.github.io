**Erosive Esophagitis (EE)**

EE is characterized by erosions or ulcers of the esophageal mucosa

**Esophageal Strictures**

Chronic acid irritation of the distal esophagus can result in scarring of distal the esophagus leading to the formation of a peptic stricture. Patients can present with symptoms of esophageal dysphagia or food impaction. ACG guidelines recommend esophageal dilation and continue PPI therapy to prevent the need for repeated dilations

**Barrett Esophagus**

This complication occurs as a result of chronic pathological acid exposure to the distal esophageal mucosa. It leads to a histopathological change of the distal esophageal mucosa, which is normally lined by stratified squamous epithelium to metaplastic columnar epithelium. Barrett's esophagus is more commonly seen in Caucasian males above 50 years, obesity, and history of smoking and predisposes to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma
