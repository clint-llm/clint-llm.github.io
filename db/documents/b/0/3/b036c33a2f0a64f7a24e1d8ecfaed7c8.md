Labwork consistent with iron deficiency include low serum iron levels, low transferrin saturation, and a high total iron-binding capacity (TIBC). For patients receiving oral iron, patients will need to return to the office for repeat bloodwork to monitor tolerability to the medication and will need to be on supplementation for months. For those receiving IV iron, levels should be within normal limits after six weeks of therapy. Iron supplementation may cease once there are adequate iron and transferrin stores in the body.

If there is an inadequate response to oral therapy, investigate reasons why: such as noncompliance, reduced absorption, or GI bleeding exceeding the amount of iron supplementation. This situation should prompt additional screening for other underlying etiologies in addition to inadequate iron intake, increased iron demand, and iron loss such asÂ GI causes such as H. pylori infection, autoimmune gastritis, and screening colonoscopy for colorectal cancer.
