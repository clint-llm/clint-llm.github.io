Primary ciliary dysfunction is managed by an interprofessional team of healthcare workers, including clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, and respiratory therapists. Primary ciliary dysfunction patients should be managed in centers specializing in primary and chronic pulmonary diseases. Patients should be evaluated by a pulmonologist two to four times per year. Spirometry and surveillance cultures of sputum should be done during these visits. Additionally, children with primary ciliary dysfunction should be evaluated by an ear-nose-throat specialist one to two times per year and as needed in adults. An audiology assessment should be performed since there is a high incidence of recurrent otitis media with chronic middle ear effusions and associated complications of conductive hearing loss. The primary care provider and nurse practitioner should monitor for chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. These patients should receive daily chest physiotherapy, influenza vaccination, and pneumococcal vaccination, as indicated. Antibiotics should be prescribed for acute respiratory exacerbations.
