The cause of substance use disorders is multifactorial and includes psychological, biological, socio-cultural, and environmental factors. Co-morbid psychiatric disorders have been associated with an increased risk of illicit substance use. For example, those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and bipolar affective disorders have an increased risk of developing a substance use disorder in adulthood compared to the general population.

Environmental and genetic factors also play a strong role in substance use disorder. An individual's genetic make-up for stress-response predisposes the risk of dependence on substances. Individual variations in genetics have been demonstrated to influence stress response and predispose some individuals to develop a substance use disorder.

The Adverse Childhood Experience Study (ACES) demonstrated that exposure to a range of traumatic events during childhood is associated with an increased risk of substance use later in life. This risk association was demonstrated to follow a dose-response-like pattern where increased trauma exposure was directly correlated with increased risk of developing a substance use disorder.
