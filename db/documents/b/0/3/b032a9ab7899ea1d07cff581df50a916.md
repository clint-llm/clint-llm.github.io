Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of death. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a non-surgical, invasive procedure with a goal to relieve the narrowing or occlusion of the coronary artery and improve blood supply to the ischemic tissue. This is usually achieved by different methods, the most common being ballooning the narrow segment or deploying a stent to keep the artery open. This activity describes the indications for PCI and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with CAD.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for percutaneous coronary intervention.
- Outline the technique of percutaneous coronary intervention.
- Summarize the complications of percutaneous coronary intervention.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients undergoing PCI.
