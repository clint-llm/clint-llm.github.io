Management of acne keloidalis nuchae consists of measures directed at improving the clinical manifestations and symptoms of the disease.

Overall, the treatment of acne keloidalis nuchae is difficult and unsatisfactory. Over the years, many treatments have been used with varying degrees of success. There is no first-line therapy, and it all depends on the personal preference of the treating physician.

The first part of treatment is to educate the patient on preventing progression of the disease. This means avoiding close shaving and frequent haircuts. Secondly, the individual should be told to avoid shirts with tight collars and restrictive athletic neck gear. Any ornaments like chains worn around the neck should be discontinued.

The treatment should be initiated at the time of diagnosis to avoid cosmetic disfigurement. One may use topical antimicrobial agents such as benzoyl peroxide or chlorhexidine to prevent secondary bacterial infections.

- Mild keratolytic agents can help soften the coarse hairs.

- The patient should be told to avoid the use of all hair product greases that can interfere with hair growth.

- When the disease is in the early papular stage, it may respond to potent topical steroids with or without a retinoid.

- If folliculitis is present, one may need to use minocycline or doxycycline. Moderate dose isotretinoin (20 mg daily) has an anti-inflammatory effect on folliculitis but does not affect indurated lesions.

Once the acute disease is under control, one can use maintenance therapy with a topical steroid, benzyl peroxide washes, and a topical retinoid.

If the papules are hard, intralesional injection of triamcinolone can help reduce the size and also soften the lesion. The injections can be very painful, and pretreatment with topical lidocaine may help. Steroid injections may result in hypopigmentation and skin atrophy. Some dermatologists use cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen to create edema before the injection of steroids.

Cryotherapy has also been used as solo therapy, but it is often not well-tolerated because of pain. The treatment also causes hypopigmentation and often requires months of treatment.

Surgical excision may be performed, but mild recurrences are not rare. Cryosurgery also seems to be effective in acne keloidalis nuchae, while vaporization with the CO2 laser is less effective than surgery.

Various other types of lasers have been used to treat acne keloidalis nuchae with varying success. The most effective lasers are the 1064 nm Nd: YAG laser and 810 nm diode laser. Most patients require several laser sessions in combination with topical steroids or retinoids to improve the cosmesis. Pulsed Dye laser (595 nm) has also been used in acne keloidalis nuchae but is less effective than the other lasers. Phototherapy using targeted ultraviolet B  light three times a week for 8 to 10 weeks has also been effective.

Radiation therapy should only be reserved for recalcitrant cases.
