Antecedent infections are reported in up to 70% of patients with Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS).

Certain gangliosides are more likely to be associated with specific presentations. For example, Miller-Fisher syndrome is associated with the anti-GQ1B antibody.

Given that not all patients test positive for anti-ganglioside antibodies, further research is needed to elucidate the roles of anti-ganglioside antibodies in GBS as causal or epiphenomenon. Less is known about the pathophysiology behind the acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy variant (AIDP) of GBS, despite the fact that it is considered the most common variant in the United States.
