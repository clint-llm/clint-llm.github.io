Postoperative treatment depends on the alignment of the eyes. The patient may complain of diplopia, eyes can be in the ortho position, or have residual exodeviations or a consecutive esotropia.

- Orthotropia: In small children, a small esotropia of 8 to 10 prism diopters is ideal in young patients because of the natural tendency of the eyes to deviate outside postoperatively. In patients with orthotropia immediately, post-operative orthoptic exercises should be advised to strengthen the positive fusional convergence. This will enable control of the newly acquired bifoveal single vision.

- Consecutive Esotropia: A residual esotropia of up to 10 prism diopters is ideal. Even patients with up to 20 prism diopters of residual esotropia may resolve over time. Non-surgical measures should be tried for at least 1 month, as there are high chances of spontaneous resolution.

**Children**

There are high chances of monofixation syndrome and suppression of amblyopia. Therefore, the following measures are advocated within 2 weeks post-surgery.

- Refraction using cycloplegics should be done, and any hypermetropic should be fully corrected.

- Bifocals – if there is greater near deviation present post-surgery.

- Occlusion therapy – part-time alternate eye patching or monocular patching based on the fixation pattern.

- Prismotherapy – Fresnel prisms can be advised to fully correct the deviation and maintain bifoveal fixation.

A decision for repeast surgery should be taken if the child remains overcorrected by more than 15 prism diopters, despite the non-surgical measures.

**Adults**

In patients with a visually mature system, an overcorrection of more than 20 prism diopters, nonsurgical measures may be tried after a watch period of 6 to 8 weeks. As explained above, the same options of non-surgical treatment in the form of hypermetropic correction, bifocals, or prismotherapy might be considered. Any decision for repeat surgery should only be after 6 months post-surgery.

**Residual Exotropia**

- Small residual exotropia (15 to 18 prism diopters) – These patients can be managed with non-conservative measures.

- Optical correction – A full correction should be given for any underlying myopic refraction.

- Cycloplegics – Hypermetropes or emmetropes patients can be started on 1% cyclopentolate eye drops twice a day to stimulate accommodative convergence.

- Orthoptic exercises – anti suppression exercises or fusional exercises should be continued till alignment is obtained.

- Prismotherapy – base-in-prisms equal to fully neutralize the deviation may be helpful to avoid diplopia and maintain bifoveal fusion.

- Large residual exotropia (15 to 18 prism diopters) - Patients with a large residual exotropia in the first postoperative week will probably require additional surgery. It is better to wait for 8 to 12 weeks before re-operating for the residual exotropia. If the primary surgery was bilateral lateral rectus recession of 6 mm or less, re-recession of the lateral rectus might be planned. If the primary recession was greater than 6 mm, bilateral medial rectus resections with a conservative approach might be planned, as overcorrections are common after resecting against a large recession.
