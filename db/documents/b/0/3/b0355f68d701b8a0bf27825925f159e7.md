The majority of cases of PTLD are caused by EBV that is a herpes virus infecting up to 95% of the adult population. Primary infection with EBV in immunocompetent adult patients usually results in self-limiting illness without significant complications. However, once EBV infection occurs, either the virus remains latent in B-cell lymphocytes by the transformation of the cell expressing partial EBV genome, or it results in viral replication and B-cell lysis. In the immunocompetent patient, B-cell proliferation is controlled by cytotoxic T-cells while in an immunocompromised patient unchecked B-cell activation and continuous proliferation leads to PTLD.
