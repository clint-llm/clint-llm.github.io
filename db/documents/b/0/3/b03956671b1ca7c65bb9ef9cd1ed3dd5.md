Up to 50%-70% of tracheobronchial injuries are missed in traumas, and a late diagnosis requiring subsequent surgical repair increases the mortality. A high suspicion is a must to detect tracheobronchial tear/injury in all trauma patients, especially with chest and neck injuries. The vast majority of tracheobronchial injuries are managed surgically though there is a recent trend to manage patients with iatrogenic posterior tracheal wall injuries either conservatively or semi conservatively with fiberoptic endoscopic interventions. The fiberoptic endoscopic interventional management also applies to candidates who are unfit for surgical repair initially or permanently. However, a definite surgical repair might still be needed at a later date. Some of them could even improve without surgical intervention.
