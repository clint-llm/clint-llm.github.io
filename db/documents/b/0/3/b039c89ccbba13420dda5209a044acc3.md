Giardia cysts are resistant to chlorination. Iodine can be used for disinfection but may take up to 8 hours before the water is safe for drinking. Filters are also available. Travelers should ensure filters meet the National Safety Foundation (NSF) Standard 53 or NSF Standard 58 ratings for oocyst or cyst reduction. Boiling water for 10 minutes also kills the cysts.
