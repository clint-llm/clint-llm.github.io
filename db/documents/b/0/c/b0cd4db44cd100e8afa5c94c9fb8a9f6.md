Essential equipment is minimal and includesÂ the following:

**Preoperatively**

- Local anesthetic (typically lidocaine 0.5% with epinephrine 1:200,000 and buffered with sodium bicarbonate)

- 3 cc syringe(s)

- 30 gauge needle(s)

- Antiseptic scrub

**Intraoperatively**

- Sterile drape

- Scalpel with #15 blade

- Toothed forceps

- Suture scissors

- Needle holders

- Normal saline

- Sterile gauze

- Absorbable suture (for subcutaneous/deep stitches)

- Cutaneous suture (non-absorbable or absorbable)

- Ideally, an electrosurgical device should be available for hemostasis

**Postoperatively**

- Nonstick dressing
