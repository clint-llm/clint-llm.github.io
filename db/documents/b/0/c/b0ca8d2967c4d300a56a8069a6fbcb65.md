Lower extremity blocks are useful in providing targeted anesthesia to the hip, knee, ankle, or foot, particularly in patients for whom general or neuraxial anesthesia is contraindicated. Furthermore, lower extremity blocks are frequently utilized postoperatively to improve pain control and lower the acute postoperative opioid burden.

Another benefit of lower extremity nerve blocks is the added effect of restoring mobility to patients who may otherwise be limited by pain in the early postoperative period. This early mobilization is important in minimizing complications such as venous thromboembolism and bedsores and promotes early progress in physical therapy.
