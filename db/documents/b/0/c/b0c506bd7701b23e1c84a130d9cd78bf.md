Jugular vein pulsation (JVP) provides clinically meaningful information about the central venous pressure (CVP). JVP is an important and reproducible tool to diagnose various cardiac conditions which can cause a change in CVP. Canon A wave can be easily missed without close attention during bedside examination especially due to declining physical exam skills in contemporary clinical practice. Recent literature does not describe the frequency of cannon A waves in rhythm disturbances.
