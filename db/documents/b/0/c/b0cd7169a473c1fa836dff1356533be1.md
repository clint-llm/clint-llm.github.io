MERRF is a multisystem disease. It needs a team of specialists for optimal care. Affected persons with MERRF and their asymptomatic at-risk relatives should have a regular follow-up (e.g., every 6-12 months initially) for disease monitoring and the appearance of new symptoms.

It is recommended to have annual neurologic (epilepsy control), ophthalmologic (for vision changes), cardiology (electrocardiogram and echocardiogram), and endocrinologic evaluations (for diabetes and thyroid problems). Physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and rehabilitation are important for improving the quality of life and prevent complications.
