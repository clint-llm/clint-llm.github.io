Amblyopia. When aniseikonia is missed in children during the amblyogenic age (until age 8 to 10), it can result in permanent vision loss from amblyopia.

Ongoing symptoms of asthenopia, dizziness, diplopia, reduced ability to do visual tasks or headache. When aniseikonia is not detected or not treated adequately, the impact on the visual function can be tremendous.

Loss of binocular function. When aniseikonia cannot be treated, the patient may develop suppression, strabismus, or in the presence of persistent diplopia, may choose to occlude the eye. This results in a loss of binocularity and depth perception.

Loss of the benefit of ophthalmic surgery: Ophthalmic surgery, such as scleral buckle procedures, monocular cataract extraction, or corneal transplant procedure, generally results in an excellent monocular visual outcome. When aniseikonia interferes with binocular function, patients may feel they are functionally worse off than before their surgery.

Contact lens complications. Treatment with contact lenses increases the risk of contact lens-related dry eye, corneal infection and inflammation, allergies, and increased stress related to contact lens insertion and removal technique and complications.

Iseikonic lens complications. Iseikonic lenses can induce prism and distortion, and the use of the lenses is often not completely problem free. The lenses also affect the cosmetic appearance of the patient due to the magnification of one eye.
