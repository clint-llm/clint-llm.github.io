The mutations responsible generally appear on exons of 6, 8, 10, and 13 of the HGD gene coding for the enzyme homogentisate dioxygenase. However, over 100 abnormalities are recorded and even a rare autosomal dominant variant that has yet to be genetically characterized.

Homogentisate dioxygenase, a hexamer metalloprotein, is chiefly responsible for converting homogentisate into maleyacetoacetate, and eventually ketones for excretion. When defective an obvious sequester of the substrate, homogentisate increases by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude in the serum. Despite being renally-cleared, colorless, and water-soluble, it quickly degrades into benzoquinone acetate, which shares non of those attributes. Furthermore, benzoquinone precipitates and polymerizes into collagen.
