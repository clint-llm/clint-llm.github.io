Currently, there are two clinical criteria used to diagnose PCS. These are the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10), and the DSM-IV, both of which can give varying results, even when applied to the same population.

Previous reports in the literature have attempted to associate the severity of the brain injury with PCS in patients who have suffered mild TBI, however, these have failed to consistently report that the severity of injury correlates with the risk of PCS. Variables and measures utilized in order to define a correlation include initial presenting GCS, duration of loss of consciousness, post-traumatic memory difficulties or amnesia, and imaging traumatic abnormalities on CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Current cohort studies and analysis show that women are at greater risk for persistent PCS.
