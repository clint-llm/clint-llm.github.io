Patients require an advanced airway under two sets of circumstances: failure to maintain a patent airway and the inability to oxygenate and ventilate the patient adequately.

- A diminished level of consciousness with concern for the loss of airway control (Glasgow coma scale less than 8)

- Hypoxemic or hypercarbic respiratory failure

- Cardiac arrest

- Risk of aspiration with vomiting, secretions, or blood

- Airway obstruction

Each provider's local protocols will identify definitive indications for field intubation and can guide a provider to the appropriate action.  The online medical command can also provide real-time guidance to providers in the field to help improve outcomes.
