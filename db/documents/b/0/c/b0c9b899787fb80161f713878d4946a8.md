The signs and symptoms manifested in patients with stunned myocardium are a result of underlying coexisting pathologies, including coronary artery disease and ischemic heart disease. When ischemic myocardial tissue undergoes reperfusion, most of the viable myocytes regain their contractile function, but some continue to have depressed contractility transiently. Since the stunning of the myocardium is a pathophysiological response to myocardial reperfusion, the evaluation of patients with stunned myocardium should focus on the history of present illness in these patients. Emphasis should be given to symptoms of chest pain at rest or exertion, past medical history, social and family history that includes the risk factors for coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension.
