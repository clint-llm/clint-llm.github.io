The type of suctioning involved depends on the anatomy of the region that is being suctioned.

- Nasopharyngeal suctioning: insertion of the catheter should be on a downward slant through the nostril into the floor of the nasopharynx

- Endotracheal suctioning: insertion of the catheter should be into the ET tube to the appropriate depth

- Airway stoma: insertion of the catheter into the stoma

Airway anatomy can be divided into two parts: (1) Upper airway anatomy, including the nasal cavity, nasopharynx, oropharynx, laryngopharynx and the larynx, and (2) Lower airway anatomy, including the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and the alveoli.

Extra care should be taken while suctioning the airway in children because they have narrow airway calibers, difficult accessibility, and relative deleterious effects from small changes in pressure, oxygen saturations, and lung volumes.
