Theophylline is often prescribed by the nurse practitioner, primary care provider, pulmonologist, internist, and emergency department physician. However, all healthcare workers who prescribe this medication should be familiar with its adverse effect profile. The drug has a low therapeutic index and is known to cause many unpleasant side effects, including life-threatening arrhythmias. Drug concentrations should be obtained regularly, and close monitoring of the patient is essential. With the availability of better and safer bronchodilators, the use of theophylline should not be routine. When necessary, the entire interprofessional healthcare team should be aware that the patient is taking the drug and being alert for potential adverse effects. Pharmacists can verify dosing and perform medication reconciliation, and nurses can counsel on dosing and adverse effects. This interprofessional approach will improve patient outcomes with this medication. [Level 5]
