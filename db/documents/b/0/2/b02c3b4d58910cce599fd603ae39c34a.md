Parasympathomimetics are a class of medications that activate the parasympathetic nervous system by mimicking or modifying the effects of acetylcholine. These drugs include muscarinic receptor agonists (direct-acting parasympathomimetics) and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (indirect-acting parasympathomimetics). This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, activity, adverse events, and other key elements of parasympathomimetic therapy in the clinical setting pertinent to interprofessional team members managing the care of patients receiving these medications.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of parasympathomimetic medications.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of parasympathomimetic medications.
- Review the appropriate monitoring of parasympathomimetic medications.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance parasympathomimetic therapy and improve outcomes.
