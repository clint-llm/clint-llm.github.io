Nearly half a million people require hemodialysis, and each year approximately 100,000 new cases of end-stage renal disease are diagnosed. Consequently, many patients require hemodialysis and vascular access. There are multiple types of arteriovenous (AV) hemodialysis access, though autogenous AV access has higher patency rates and lower risk of complications when compared to prosthetic arteriovenous access, and lower risk of infection compared to temporary central venous catheters. This activity describes the indications, contraindications and complications of arteriovenous fistulas and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing arteriovenous fistula formation.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for arteriovenous fistulas.
- Describe the technique involved in arteriovenous fistula formation.
- Summarize the complications associated with arteriovenous fistulas.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to optimize outcomes for patients requiring arteriovenous fistulas.
