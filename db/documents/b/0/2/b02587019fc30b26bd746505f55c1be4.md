More data are needed to assess the long-term benefits and risks of menopausal hormone treatment. There is a need for more research into the associations between persistent hot flashes and the increased risk of cardiovascular disease or dementia, and the post-menopausal estrogen levels to sleep disturbance and genitourinary symptoms, and if so, whether treatment improves outcome. Other potential therapies under investigation for vasomotor symptoms are oxybutynin, stellate ganglion blocks (C6-T2), neurokinin receptor antagonists, and estetrol (or E4, a natural estrogen), andÂ laser and radiofrequency ablation of genitourinary syndrome needs more investigation.
