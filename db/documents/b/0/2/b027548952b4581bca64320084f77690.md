**Radiographs:**Anteroposterior, lateral, and Mortise views. Radiographic assessment of a Tillaux fracture will reveal the classical pattern of anterior lateral physeal separation and extension of the fracture through the bony epiphysis into the ankle joint. It is a Salter-Harris type III fracture of the anterolateral distal tibial epiphysis.

**CT scan:**This is the preferred imaging modality in evaluating Tillaux fracture and its degree of displacement. CT is more sensitive than plain radiographs in evaluating fractures with as little displacement as 2 mm.
