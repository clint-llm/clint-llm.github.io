Burns to the face constitute a large percentage of all burns. As many as two-thirds of all burns have some association with the face.

In the United States, non-geriatric adults represent the largest number of burn victims. This tends to be the case for women predominantly during meal preparation and for men in the workplace. Over a third of all burns are estimated to be due to workplace injuries.Â The majority of these occurred in younger men in construction, food service, and manufacturing.

Fireworks are particularly implicated as a cause of burns to the face and eye.

Burn injury is found in child abuse. Approximately a tenth of the cases of child abuse involve burn injury, usually concentrated in children under the age of ten.

There are socioeconomic risk factors for a burn injury, as well.

Overall, there seems to be a downward trend in the incidence and severity of burn injury worldwide.
