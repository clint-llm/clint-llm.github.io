The ureteric wall is composed of three main of tissue: inner mucosa, middle muscle layer and outer serosa. The lining of the inner layer is transitional epithelium. Deeper to it is the lamina propria, which is combined with the epithelium make up the mucosal lining. The next deeper layer of tissue is the smooth muscle layer or lamina propria. An inner longitudinal and an outer circular layer comprise the smooth muscle layer of the ureter.

The path of the ureter is along the anterior edge of the psoas muscle, which is the general area where the gonadal vessels cross anteriorly to the ureter a third of the way to the bladder. The ureter crosses over the common iliac arteries, showing the anatomical landmark of the bifurcation of the common iliac vessels into internal and externa iliac vessels. The ureters finally enter on the posterior wall of the bladder where they incorporate into the trigone

The nomenclature of the ureter is based on its anatomic relationship to surrounding structures. The abdominal ureter is the segment of the ureter that extends from the renal pelvis to the iliac vessels. The pelvic ureter extends from the iliac vessels to the bladder
