Clinicopathologic correlation is required for the correct diagnosis of a neurothekeoma. If the lesion appears to be very superficial a shave biopsy may be appropriate; however, since these are usually dermal nodules with the possibility of deeper involvement, a deep punch, incisional, or excisional biopsy may be a better option. The chosen skin biopsy technique will vary depending on the size and location of the lesion. When the lesion is small, easily palpable, and not located in a cosmetically or functionally sensitive area, imaging is not generally necessary. There are no known pathognomic radiologic findings; computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) imaging may be helpful adjuncts for surgical planning and clinical correlation although histology will remain the gold standard for diagnosis.
