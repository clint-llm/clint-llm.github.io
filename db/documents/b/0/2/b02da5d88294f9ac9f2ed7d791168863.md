Bradykinin plays a prominent role in inflammation. Bradykinin, along with prostaglandins, and histamine, are mediators of vasodilation, in which the arteriolar smooth muscle relaxes, and in turn, increases blood flow. This increased blood flow causes the rubor, or redness, and calor, or warmth, components of the inflammation process. Bradykinin, along with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), also plays a role in the sensitization of sensory nerve endings, which causes the dolor, or pain, the component of the inflammation process. Thus in the process of inflammation, bradykinin causes an increase in vasodilation, and an increase in permeability, and an increase in pain.
