Although oral health is part of the overall systemic health, oral health care is not the main target of pediatric care providers. Collaborative efforts among health professionals are paramount to prevent the recurrence of dental caries.

A recent review of oral interventions for pregnant women and young mothers showed that healthcare providers could help reduce the incidence of early childhood caries by delivering oral health education to expecting mothers, conducting caries risk assessments, and referring their patients to the dentist.

According to a survey, most pediatric care providers will only refer a child with high caries risk to the dentist, but a few will refer a child for routine dental visits.

Inter-professional education in graduate programs has improved knowledge, confidence, and practice toward children's oral health.

Healthcare providers other than dentists can prevent dental caries if appropriately trained. Primary care clinicians and pediatricians can also detect early caries lesions, which appear as white spots on the gingival margin or brown stains on the occlusal surfaces, and make a prompt referral to the dentist.

The professional application of topical fluoride (varnish and gel) can be provided by medical professionals to children at high risk of caries. Oral health can be significantly improved by training a more comprehensive range of people to advise on dental caries prevention and provide preventive interventions, e.g., fluoride varnishes, including a mix of healthcare providers, nurses, and people from the community and schoolteachers.
