Although posterior cortical atrophy is a rare neurodegenerative type of dementia, it is an important condition that needs to be recognized early. Patients with this condition are often misdiagnosed or have significant delays in the diagnosis. It can present as an enigmatic tale with both the patients and the clinician 'looking but not seeing.'

Awareness and a high suspicion index among general practitioners, ophthalmologists, and optometrists can lead to a prompt referral for a neuropsychiatric evaluation. Early recognition and determination of the underlying condition can ensure the initiation of safety measures, psychological support for patients and families, and other appropriate pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures.

An interprofessional and collaborative approach involving geriatricians, neurologists, nursing care, physical therapy, occupational therapy, pharmacy, and social work will likely lead to better outcomes in this challenging and progressive disorder.
