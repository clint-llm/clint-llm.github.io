Ranolazine was FDA-approved in 2006 for the treatment of chronic angina. Angina is characterized by chest discomfort that occurs due to ischemia. Stable angina is treated to reduce ischemia symptoms and occurrence and prevent myocardial infarction and mortality. Standard therapy includes aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers, statins, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and nitrates. Ranolazine may be used in combination with these agents to treat angina. Off-label uses include the treatment of some arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia. However, there is little data to support this use. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring, of ranolazine, so providers can direct patient therapy in treating conditions for which it is indicated as part of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of ranolazine.
- Summarize the approved and off-label indications for ranolazine.
- Review the adverse event profile for ranolazine.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients who can benefit from therapy with ranolazine.
