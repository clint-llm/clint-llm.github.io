Understanding the concept of drug clearance is essential when determining the dosing of medications. When a medication is administered intravenously, the drug ends up either in the blood plasma or redistributes into the extravascular volume. The drug present in the plasma can be removed from the body primarily through the kidneys and liver.Â Drug clearance is defined as the volume of plasma cleared of a drug over a specified time period.
