Renal collecting ducts are microscopic passages that connect to multiple nephrons. Tubular fluid passes through the collecting ducts to reach the calyces and renal pelvis. While traveling through the collecting ducts, the composition of tubular fluid undergoes alterations. These alterations pertain primarily to reabsorption and secretion of electrolytes, acid, and water. Different cell types line the collecting duct lumen to mediate the alterations. These cell types are under the regulation of chemical messengers originating from both different organ systems and the kidneys themselves.
