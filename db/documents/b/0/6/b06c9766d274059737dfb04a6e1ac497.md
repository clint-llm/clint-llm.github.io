Studies have shown that about 20% of women experience vaginal bleeding before 20 weeks of pregnancy. Furthermore, about 50% of those patients who experience a threatened abortion progress to a pregnancy loss. Studies have shown that there may be an increased risk of adverse outcomes later in pregnancy if there was vaginal bleeding during the first trimester of that pregnancy. For example, there may be a greater risk of placenta previa, placental abruption, necessitation for manual removal of the placenta after delivery, cesarean delivery, preterm premature ruptured membranes, preterm birth, low-birthweight infant, fetal-growth restriction, and fetal or neonatal death.
