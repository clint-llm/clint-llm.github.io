As is the case with most physical ailments of the body, a thorough physical examination is imperative for diagnosing a swimmer’s shoulder pain. The shoulders should be checked for atrophy and symmetry, the range of motion should be measured. Special attention should be paid to scapular positioning at rest and symmetry in motion to assess for abnormal motion. Strength testing likely will produce pain, and in advanced cases, the shoulder may fail to resist the examiner’s force.

Special testing may provide further insight. The apprehension/relocation test and sulcus signs provide insight into instability. The Hawkins test is a useful and sensitive exam in the diagnosis of subacromial impingement. In patients with positive laxity test results, the examiner also should check other joints for laxity to rule out a generalized condition.
