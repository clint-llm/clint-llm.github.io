Elbow fractures are more common in the pediatric population than in the adult population. Children often utilize an outstretched arm as a protectiveÂ mechanism when falling, creating a high incidence of fractures about the elbow. Supracondylar fractures of the humerus account for up to 18% of pediatric fractures and 60% of elbow fractures.

The modified Gartland classification is often used to describe fracture patterns and guide treatment.
