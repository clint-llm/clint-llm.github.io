On microscopic examination, the hallmark of Becker muscular dystrophy is ongoing myofiber necrosis and regeneration. Active muscle fiber necrosis and cluster of basophilic regenerating fibers are more prominent in younger age. In contrast, myofiber splitting with necrosis, increased internal nuclei, fiber hypertrophy, fatty replacement, and endomysia fibrosis are conspicuous in older age.
