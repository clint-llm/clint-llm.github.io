Indications of corneal imaging are as follow:

- To determine properties of the cornea including elevation, shape, curvature, and thickness (topography)

- To determine properties of the posterior surface of the cornea and anterior chamber (optical coherence tomography)

- To evaluate and inform pre- and post-operative clinical treatment decision making

- To evaluate and monitor corneal disease progression or improvement
