Management of entropion should be directed at the specific etiology. Medical management is often ocular lubrication, artificial tears, or contact lenses. These can be used to protect the ocular surface from damage secondary to eyelash irritation. These simple techniques can often break the cycle in spastic entropion. Botulinum toxin injection can also be considered in a patient with spastic entropion

Surgical management can be considered in all types of entropion and provides definitive treatment. Suture techniques, such as Quickert sutures, are occasionally helpful and can be performed at bedside or in office
