Acinetobacter is a common colonizer of patients in the intensive care unit and those who have multiple comorbid disorders. It is most likely to cause infections in patients who are immunocompromised and those with a compromise of their cardiopulmonary system. The organism can readily be cultured, but the findings need to be correlated to the clinical picture.

**Laboratory Studies**

There may be leucocytosis, with a left shift.

**Imaging Studies**

A chest x-ray is required if pneumonia is suspected. Other imaging tests depend on signs and symptoms.

**Procedures**

If meningitis is suspected, then CSF needs to be analyzed and cultured.

**Histologic Findings**

There are no specific histopathological features of an Acinetobacter infection that can differentiate it from any other gram-negative bacilli
