Effective teamwork at all levels can improve the patient outcome in afferent loop syndrome. Primary care and frontline providers evaluating patients at risk for afferent loop syndrome should consider early surgical consultation and work closely with diagnostic radiologists to perform the appropriate diagnostic imaging and improve interpretation. An interprofessional approach is encouraged with the patient care team, including an interventional radiologist, endoscopist, hematologist, and nutritionist, along with the surgical specialist as well as specialty trained nurses. Perianesthesia and operating room nurses will provide surgical prep and intra- and post-surgical care. In cases requiring nutritional stabilization, nursing can work closely with nutritional support (nutrition doctor, nutritionist) to assist with patient monitoring and compliance. The pharmacy can assist with postoperative pain management. This interprofessional approach can prevent unnecessary delays in the diagnosis of afferent loop syndrome, ensure adequate surgical disposition based on underlying etiology, and also helps to optimize the patient before surgery, helping to increase the likelihood of a good surgical outcome.
