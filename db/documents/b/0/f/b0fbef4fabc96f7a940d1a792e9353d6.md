Similar to the blood supply and lymphatics, it is also useful to discuss the nervous system of the anal canal from the perspective superior and inferior to the pectinate line. These two regions are distinctly innervated and respond to different stimuli.

Above the pectinate line, the anal canal receives autonomic innervation from the inferior hypogastric plexus. The parasympathetic innervation inhibits the tone of the internal anal sphincter and evokes a peristaltic contraction to allow defecation. Sympathetic innervation works in opposition to maintain the tone of the internal anal sphincter and preserve continence. Given viscerosensory signals return from this region, the superior aspect of the anal canal is most sensitive to stretch or distention.

Below the pectinate line, the anal canal receives somatic innervation derived from branches of the pudendal nerve. As a result, the inferior aspect of the anal canal is highly sensitive to pain, temperature, and touch.
