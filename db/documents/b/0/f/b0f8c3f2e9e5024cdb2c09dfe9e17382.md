The asterion is an anatomical landmark on the lateral aspect of the skull formed at the junction of the occipital bone, the temporal bone, and the parietal bone. Its definition can also be a confluence of the lambdoid suture, which is the junction of the occipital and parietal bones, the occipitomastoid suture, which is a junction of the occipital and temporal bones, and the parietomastoid suture, which is a junction of the parietal and temporal bones. It is a visible landmark on the human skull seen when removal of the soft tissue from the bony surfaces has taken place.Â Asterion is related to the transverse and sigmoid sinus internally. It signifies the site of closed mastoid fontanelle. Asterion corresponds to the posterior end of the parietotemporal suture, the Pterion forming the anterior end. It is used as a surface landmark for the radiological and anthropological measurement of the skull. The sutural anatomy of the asterion is useful in retrosigmoid surgical approaches to the posterior fossa.
