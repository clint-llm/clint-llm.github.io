There currently is no minimum toxicity dose listed. The limitation for increased doses beyond 400 mg per day is due to CNS effects. It is essential to know the patient's history of mental illness and seizures before proceeding with therapy. Toxicity may manifest as acute psychosis, cardiovascular toxicity, coma, and/or death. Although there is no antidote for amantadine, side effects resolve with discontinuation of usage. Some preparations of the drug may contain propylene glycol. Large amounts of propylene glycol can potentially be toxic and cause hyperosmolality, lactic acidosis, respiratory depression, and seizures. In addition, Amantadine toxicity is a concern in patients with severe renal impairment, as 90% of the dose administered orally is excreted unchanged in the urine.
