A complete blood count showing possible anemia and low platelet count followed by renal function tests with elevated serum creatinine (0.4 mg/dl above the upper limit), blood urea nitrogen levels, and urine analysis positive for urine sediments: red blood cells and casts, white blood cells, granular casts are indicative of a glomerular pathology. For further confirmation, a 24 hours urine protein to creatinine ratio and 24 hours urine sample for protein levels can be done. A protein count of greater than 3.5 g/day is suggestive of nephrotic range proteinuria, which is associated with a worse prognosis. A 24-hour urine sample can be used to calculate creatinine clearance to estimate the eGFR. Renal ultrasound can be done to see the size and confirm the presence of two kidneys and the absence of any obstructive pathology resulting in hydronephrosis. Serum complement (C3 and C4) levels help determine the etiology; low levels are associated with the presence of SLE, cryoglobulinemia, and infectious etiology.

Renal biopsy remains the gold standard diagnostic test with light microscopy, electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence study, giving information regarding the severity and chronicity of the disease. Further insight into the possible underlying pathology can be achieved from auto-antibody screening (DS-DNA antibody, ANA, p-ANCA, c-ANCA, anti-GBM antibodies) as well as hepatitis B and C and HIV serology to rule out chronic infections.
