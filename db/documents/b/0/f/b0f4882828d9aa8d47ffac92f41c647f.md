Interprofessional and multidisciplinaryÂ teams around children who use hearing aids are critical for them to achieve optimal benefits from hearing aids. A team approach includes the audiology professionals responsible for assessing and fitting the child, early interventionists/teachers of the deaf who work closely at home and in schools with the child to provide tailored (re)habilitation programs, and speech and language therapists, among others who will support the child in using their aided speech access to develop speech and language in line with their normal hearing peers.In addition to supporting the child, working collaboratively with parents/guardians and families will promote smooth uptake of the devices and encourage good engagement with services.
