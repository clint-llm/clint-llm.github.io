Although prolapse, even at its most severe with procidentia, is not a life-threatening event. Further evaluation and treatment should be steered based on how bothersome the prolapse is. The workup for prolapse can be done by general gynecologists if there are no concurrent type urinary, bowel, or sexual health concerns. If there are concurrent symptoms, then multiple healthcare professionals should participate in the care of the patient due to the close anatomical approximation of urinary and gastrointestinal outlets. A joint pelvic floor interprofessional team consisting of a urogynecologist, a urologist, a physiotherapist specialized in women’s health, a colorectal surgeon, a geriatrician, and/or specialized nursing staff has been recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) to manage patients with pelvic floor dysfunction, including prolapse. This team approach can help to standardize treatment and improve patient outcomes in complex patients. [Level 2]
