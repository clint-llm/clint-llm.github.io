Nursing staff will need to monitor the patient's vital signs and cardiac rhythm. Patients who have been successfully resuscitated by precordial thump are at risk forÂ recurrent arrhythmia and require close monitoring. The nurses should quickly report to the clinical team any changes in vital signs or development of malignant arrhythmias and then make sure the crash cart is available.
