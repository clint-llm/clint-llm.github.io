It is important to educate the patient on local wound care and avoidance of additional insult/injury. A thorough discussion and the potential complications, including the need for additional repair, should be addressed early. If prophylactic antimicrobial coverage is pursued, education regarding potential side effects should occur. The explanation for the use of ice and compression to reduce edema should also occur. If the laceration repair occurs in an emergency department, or another acute care setting, contact information referral to ophthalmology will be key for establishing appropriate follow-up.
