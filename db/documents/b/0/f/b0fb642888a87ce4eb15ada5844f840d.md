There is no definitive treatment for EPP in order to decrease the circulating porphyrin levels, but patients should avoid sunlight or fluorescent light. Parents should also learn about how to protect their children from sunlight. When going outside, patients must wear protective clothes and broad-brimmed hats and stay in shaded areas. The use of broad-spectrum sunscreen is also important. Cars and house windows should be equipped with protective tinted glass. Phototoxic reactions may occur as a result of visible light and ultraviolet A (UVA) light in operating rooms. Light filters should be used in operating rooms to protect the patient, especially in case of long surgical procedures like liver transplantation in a patient with hepatopathy.

Afamelanotide, a synthetic analog of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), normally increases the skin pigmentation and decreases the production of cytokines and free radicals.

Rapidly progressive and severe hepatopathy can be treated with a regimen that includes intravenous hemin (to reduce plasma porphyrin level), plasmapheresis, ursodeoxycholic acid, cholestyramine, vitamin-E (400IU), and correction of anemia. Liver transplantation is the treatment choice for severe protoporphyric hepatopathy or for patients who develop liver cirrhosis.
