Acute fatty liver of pregnancy sometimes presents as a diagnostic challenge, as it may be challenging to differentiate from HELLP syndrome and preeclampsia with severe features. There is a significant overlap between these disease entities, and in fact, they may co-exist in the same patient.

Signs of liver failure such as coagulopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation and hypoglycemia are more consistent with AFLP as compared to HELLP or preeclampsia. Transaminase levels and hyperbilirubinemia is also more severe in AFLP.
