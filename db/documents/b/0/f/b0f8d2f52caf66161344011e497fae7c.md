Understanding the pathophysiology of jaundice and how bile is synthesized and secreted is essential to make a proper diagnosis and hence provide the proper treatment. Signs and Symptoms of biliary tract pathology include jaundice, pruritus, fever, xanthomas, steatorrhea (due to fat malabsorption), right upper quadrant pain (RUQ), and fatty dyspepsia (a feature of bile obstruction) (10). Biliary tract pathology may result in a decrease in the absorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). Deficiency in vitamin K would cause bleeding while a deficiency in vitamin D may cause rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults due to decreased calcium absorption from the gut. Deficiency in vitamin A may lead to night blindness.
