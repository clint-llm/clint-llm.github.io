The causes of refeeding syndrome are multifactorial and are linked to nutritional replenishment following a period of starvation. Accordingly, patients with poor nutrition who are rapidly or suddenly fed are at increased risk for refeeding syndrome. Causes include eating disorders, chronic alcoholism, malabsorptive conditions like inflammatory bowel disease, chronic malnutrition, poorly controlled diabetes, oncological conditions, and post-operative state.
