Prevention of venomous snakebites mostly centers on taking precautions to avoid snakes in the wild and not owning or handling venomous snakes at home.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends wearing long pants and boots when working or walking outdoors in known snake habitat and wearing leather gloves when handling brush or reaching into areas where snakes may be. Leather chaps or snake gaiters are also popular options for protecting against snakebites. The CDC also recommends not handling any venomous snake. Patients who do own venomous snakes should take extra precautions when handling them and use secure enclosures to ensure they do not escape.
