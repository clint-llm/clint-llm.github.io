Most women who use substances decrease their use during pregnancy. In general, women do not choose to begin using any potentially toxic substances once they know they are pregnant. Those who can quit on their own usually do so, which is the distinguishing factor between substance use and substance use disorder (SUD).

The etiology of SUD is multifactorial, and pregnant women are no different than the general population. Many genetic, environmental, psychological, biological, and socioeconomic factors contribute to individual susceptibility.

Other prescribed controlled substances like amphetamines and barbiturates can also lead to dependence. Illicit drugs such as heroin may be easy to obtain by those with SUD and drug-seeking behaviors. Other conditions such as poor nutrition, needle sharing, lack of safe housing, poverty, low educational level, and intimate partner violence are associated with the diagnosis of SUD. Patient-report surveys investigating the influence of the environment demonstrate increased levels of alcohol and drug use in urban locales and communities with higher proportions of adolescents, young adults, and immigrants.
