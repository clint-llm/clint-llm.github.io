The treatment varies with the stage of cancer. Surgical resection is the first line of therapy for stages I and II. For 1A, there is no role for chemotherapy. For 1B, surgical resection with adjuvant chemotherapy is considered in some cases if the tumor size is greater than 4 cm. Stage II is treated by surgery followed by chemotherapy; usually, lobectomy is preferred, but in poor surgical candidates, sub-lobar resection can be considered. In stages I and II, radiation therapy is considered if there are positive margins post-surgically and also in poor surgical candidates.

Most stage III tumors are unresectable. Stage IIIA, which is definitely staged during resection surgery, can be considered followed by adjuvant chemotherapy but chemotherapy with radiation is the usual choice. For stage IIIB, combined chemotherapy and radiation are used. In stage IV, chemotherapy with palliative radiation is used. Multiple randomized, controlled trials and large meta-analyses confirm the superiority of combination chemotherapy regimens for advanced NSCLC.

In NSCLC with somatic-driven mutation, specific inhibitor therapy is indicated.
