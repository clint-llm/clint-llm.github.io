Most children recover from ITP within three to six months from initial presentation, regardless of treatment.

Children less than ten years of age with chronic ITP are more likely to undergo remission than older children.

Most adults will reach a stable platelet count with one or more therapies. In about 10% of adults, spontaneous remission occurs most often within the first six months.

Mortality from ITP in adults is only slightly higher than in the age-matched population and is mainly due to complications from bleeding, similar to children.
