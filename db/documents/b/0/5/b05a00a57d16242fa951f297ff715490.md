Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubule agent. It promotes the assembly of microtubules by enhancing the action of tubulin dimers and stabilizing current microtubules while inhibiting their disassembly. Due to the stability of the microtubules, the late G2 phase stops, and cell replication becomes inhibited. Paclitaxel may also distort mitotic spindles causing the chromosomes to break.
