The sign of Leser-Trelat is considered to be a fairly rare paraneoplastic cutaneous marker of internal malignancy with the hallmark finding being an abrupt eruption of multiple seborrheic keratoses.

The sign of Leser-Trelat was first described by in the 1800s by Edmund Leser and Ulysse Trelat, but instead of eruptive seborrheic keratoses, they were studying the presence of cherry angiomas in oncology patients. In 1900, Hollander was the first to describe seborrheic keratoses in association with malignancy, but the names Leser and Trelat remained affixed to the condition.
