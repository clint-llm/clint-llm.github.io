Individuals presenting with chronic transplant rejection will have had a previous history of organ or tissue transplantation (for example, kidney, liver, and lung) for any of many chronic medical conditions. The symptoms and signs of rejection depend on the organ transplanted; for instance, a chronic kidney rejection causes fatigue, fever, flu-like symptoms, anuria or decreased urine output, generalized edema, and pain or tenderness at the site of transplantation. Other signs and symptoms of organ rejection can include:

- Jaundice

- Dark urine

- Itching

- Nausea and vomiting

- Abdominal swelling or tenderness

- Cough, shortness of breath

- Recurrent infections

- Arterial hypertension

- Proteinuria

- Fatigue

- Weight gain

- Premature death

- Anorexia

- Anemia

- Opportunistic neoplasia

- Pulmonary edema

- Atherosclerosis
