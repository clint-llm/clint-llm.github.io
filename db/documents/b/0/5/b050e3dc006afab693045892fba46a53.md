**History Taking**

Microalbuminuria, in itself, has not been associated with any specific symptoms. However, due to its link with diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular events, providers should focus on history and physical examination to assess for these complications. Specifically, paying attention to any personal or family history of renal, cardiac, and systemic diseases could reveal pertinent information. Additionally, patients with diabetes may present with symptoms of cardiac disease, vision difficulties, and urinary tract disorders. On physical exam, it is particularly important to evaluate for elevated blood pressure, abnormal cardiac exam, carotid pulse for bruits, and lower extremity swelling.

The majority of patients do not have any symptoms, and microalbuminuria is picked up on routine laboratory testing that is carried out to evaluate systemic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension, or when a well-person examination is conducted.

As microalbuminuria occurs mostly in the absence of any serious underlying renal disease, more benign and common causes of microalbuminuria should be considered first. The following questions should be asked:

- Is this transient - This may be because of physical exertion and fever

- Is this orthostatic - Typically seen in tall, thin adolescents or people younger than 30 years, there is an association with severe lordosis; normal renal function and albuminuria are frequently less than 1 g/24 hours

- Is nonrenal disease causing it, such as severe cardiac failure, sleep apnea - Normal renal function and albumin loss is less than 1 g/24 hours

- Are there any symptoms suggestive of nephrotic syndrome or significant glomerular pathology

- Are there any changes in the appearance of urine, such as red/smoky, frothy; is there any correlation of this to a respiratory tract infection

- Is there ankle, periorbital, labial, or scrotal edema

- Has the patient ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure

- Is there a history of high cholesterol levels in the patient's blood

- Has the patient ever had a diagnosis of a multisystem disease or another glomerulopathy

- Is there a past or family history of any renal disease

- If the patient has diabetes mellitus, for how long; are there any complications, such as retinopathy

- Is a family history of diabetic nephropathy present

- Are there any multisystem inflammatory diseases present, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or rheumatoid arthritis

- Are there symptoms like joint discomfort, skin rash, bone pain, fever, weight loss, night sweats, or Raynaud syndrome

- Is the patient on any medication, including herbal remedies

- Are there any past medical illnesses, such as jaundice, malaria, tuberculosis, syphilis, or endocarditis

- Is the patient at risk of HIV infection or hepatitis

**Physical Examination**

- Assessment of intravascular volume status is important - Take erect and supine blood pressure and pulse, examine the jugular venous pulse, and listen to heart sounds

- Examine for extravascular volume status - Look for edema, which may not be present in microalbuminuria; if there is a more significant loss, then weight gain and pleural effusions can be seen

- Assess the patient for the presence of systemic features, such as joint swelling or deformity, retinopathy, rash, signs of chronic liver disease, organomegaly, cardiac murmurs, and lymphadenopathy

- Look for complications of protein loss, such as venous thrombosis, although these may not be seen in microalbuminuria
