Nasal septoplasty is one of the most commonly performed procedures within ENT and plastic surgery. The primary indication for this functional (as opposed to purely aesthetic) surgery is usually septal deviation resulting in significant and symptomatic nasal airway obstruction. Many surgical techniques and approaches have been described; these include endonasal, endoscopic and open procedures. Septoplasty can also be performed alongside or in addition to rhinoplasty, turbinoplasty, or as part of functional endoscopic sinus surgery to improve surgical exposure and access. This activity outlines and describes the technical steps of performing a septoplasty procedure. It also highlights the interprofessional team's role in managing patients undergoing this procedure, ensuring appropriate pre-operative assessment and investigation.

**Objectives:**
- Review the indications and contraindications for performing septoplasty procedures.
- Describe the pre-operative assessment of patients being considered for septoplasty.
- Identify the surgical equipment and healthcare team members required for septoplasty procedures.
- Outline and explain the operative steps involved in septoplasty.
