Muscle Energy Technique (MET) is used by osteopathic physicians as a conservative, non-pharmacological treatment method for somatic dysfunctions of the musculoskeletal system. The Post-Isometric Relaxation and Reciprocal Inhibition techniques are commonly used variants of MET for improving restriction in the thoracic spine. This activity illustrates the procedural method for using MET in the treatment of somatic dysfunction of the thoracic spine and explains the role of the healthcare team in evaluating and treating patients who undergo MET.

**Objectives:**
- Review the physiological basis of the Muscle Energy Technique.
- Describe the technique for diagnosing thoracic spine somatic dysfunction. 
- Outline the treatment algorithm of the Muscle Energy Technique for somatic dysfunctions of the thoracic spine. 
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients receiving Muscle Energy Treatment.
