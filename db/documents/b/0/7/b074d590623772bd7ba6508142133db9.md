Oncology nurses are important in the patient's health care team, providing support, education, and connecting patients with resources. Nurses are involved in the care of the patient in many different settings:

- Gynecological oncology

- Radiation oncology

- Medical oncology

- Infusion centers

- Inpatient and procedural visits

In these various settings, nurses can educate cervical cancer patients on the importance of adhering to treatment schedules, anticipated side effects, and how to manage them. Nurses also have the opportunity to educate patients on HPV vaccinations and regular cancer screenings in efforts of primary and secondary prevention.

Nurses may need to follow lab results and report any abnormal findings, especially with white blood cell and red blood cell counts. PatientsÂ are at risk for neutropenia and anemia when receiving chemotherapy and if experiencing any bleeding. Patients undergoing radiation therapy may need skincare guidance. Potential side effects of treatment are nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, so it is also important to monitor lab values and vital signs for signs of dehydration or electrolyte imbalance.
