Diagnosis is mainly clinical, based on the clinical history and physical examination including a thorough neurologic exam, psychological exam, and certain standardized tests of brain function. It is important to make sure that the abnormality cannot be explained in another way, for example, genuine unfamiliarity with the stimuli, poor instructions, overlooked disease like neuropathy and cataracts, or other neurologic conditions like dyspraxia or dysphasia.

Various standardized tests are available to test for memory and cognition (MMSE, Montreal Cognitive assessment, ADAS-cog) and aphasia (Boston naming test, western aphasia battery).

Diagnosis is supplemented by neuroimaging tests such as head CT and brain MRI to look for etiology. More testing may be needed based on clinical judgment and suspected etiology. Auditory or visual evoked potentials may be used to determine whether a deficit exists in the sensory projection area as opposed to the primary sensory or association cortex.
