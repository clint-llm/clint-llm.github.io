Unstable pelvic fractures have a mortality of about 8%. Patients that are in hemorrhagic shock at presentation have increased mortality. Patients that present with an open pelvic fracture have a mortality risk of up to 45%. As noted earlier, the seriousness of pelvic fractures stems from the associated injuries; the risk of death from isolated pelvic fracture ranges from 0.4% to 0.8%.
