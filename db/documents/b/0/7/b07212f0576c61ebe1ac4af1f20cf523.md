Medical therapy serves no role in the management of esophageal cysts. Surgical removal is the treatment of choice in most symptomatic cases. Simple cysts show enucleation, whereas duplications get excised. Traditionally, a posterolateral thoracotomy was performed to remove the cyst. However, more recently, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS) are available to perform enucleation and resection with better cosmetic outcomes.

In asymptomatic cases, there are currently no clear guidelines on whether or not treatment is warranted. Surgery can be an option to prevent cases of ulceration, perforation, and rare instances of malignancy.
