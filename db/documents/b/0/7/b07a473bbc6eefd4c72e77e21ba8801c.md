It was common practice to cool blood gas tubes in order to slow leukocyte metabolism, which would result in inflated PCO2 values and an underestimate of PO2 and pH. Cooling is no longer recommended as PVC syringes are widely used, and as the tubes cool, they become more permeable, releasing PO2 and resulting in an underestimate. Instead, practitioners are encouraged to process blood gas samples within 15 minutes for more accurate PO2 results with minor metabolic interference and within 30 minutes for all other desired values.

Other influences on blood gas readings that can result in inaccurate findings include capturing an air bubble in the sample, shaking the sample vigorously, drawing from a line containing fluid other than blood, and improper phlebotomy technique.
