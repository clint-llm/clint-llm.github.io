The respiratory center in the medulla oblongata controls the rate and depth of ventilation. While the dorsal respiratory group controls the motor neurons for all inspiration, the ventral respiratory group only controls forced exhalation since normal exhalation is passive. The phrenic nerve is a branch of the cervical plexus. It originates mostly from C4, with some involvement of C3 and C5. The right and left sides travel through the neck and thorax before innervating the diaphragm.
