The personnel requirement for closed nasal fracture reduction under local and topical anesthesia is limited to a surgeon or emergency medicine physician. A nurse or assistant may be helpful to pass instruments and/or comfort the patient as well, however. Under general anesthesia, a circulating nurse, surgical technician, and anesthesia provider will be required in addition to the surgeon.
