Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) was originally intended to be used for the patients with polio and then sleep apnea, but since the 1990s the use of CPAP was introduced into the prehospital setting and has changed the outcome of several disease processes.   Since the original Scope of Practice Model for EMS providers, prehospital providers and physicians have been conducting research to show the efficacy of non-invasive ventilation in the prehospital setting.   The research conducted has been overwhelming positive where the 2018 EMS Scope of Practice Model concludes to use CPAP at the EMT level and above.

The EMS Scope of Practice Model along with the EMS Agenda for the future shows the value and need for prehospital providers to be educated to perform the skills with most training programs being accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP), then certified as competent with most states requiring an initial certification through the National Registry of EMT, and the majority of states allowing prehospital providers to perform non-invasive ventilation as a minimum scope of practice with medical directors credentialling the prehospital providers to perform this skill.  The trend for use of non-invasive ventilation in the prehospital setting has since pushed emergency medicine physicians, nurses, respiratory therapist and hospitals to adopt a similar practice method of use of non-invasive ventilation in the hospital setting.  Education on the use of non-invasive ventilation has become a collegial endeavor between prehospital and hospital providers.
