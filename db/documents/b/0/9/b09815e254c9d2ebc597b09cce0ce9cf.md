Functional ovaries are necessary to maintain fertility as well as hormonal balance during the reproductive years. Problems with the ovaries can lead to systematic issues including anemia, increased risk for cardiac disease, and pain.

Premature ovarian failure, or premature menopause, brings a multitude of problems other than infertility. It will bring symptoms of menopause and will reduce the benefits of estrogen. The premature weakening of the bones and cardiac protective factors are two of the most commonly discussed side effects.

There are over three million new cases of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) in the United States alone. PCOS has a wide range of symptoms but typically presents with oligomenorrhea, acne, hirsutism, and infertility. The ovaries can be view by ultrasound and will usually have over 25 active follicles (when using optimal resolution).

Ovarian cancers are typically insidious and are the third leading cause of cancer-related death in women. Due to its slow, benign-appearing onset, ovarian cancer has a high morbidity and mortality rate as it may not get diagnosed until it has metastasized.
