The mortality rate for subclavian artery trauma is high as these injuries are difficult to diagnose. As pre-hospital protocols and trauma systems improve, mortality rates from subclavian trauma could also improve. Early recognition of subclavian artery trauma is imperative to the appropriate management of this injury. Trauma management principles need to be initiated rapidly with an emphasis on rapid blood transfusion and control of bleeding. As endovascular approaches continue to become more prevalent, it is important to continue to evaluate the long-term outcomes of this approach.
