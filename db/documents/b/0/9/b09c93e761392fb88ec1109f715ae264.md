Several tests have proven beneficial to objectively record the changes observed during the dive reflex.  In particular, the cardiovascular component of the dive reflex has been the subject of intensive study.  A common trend in research is to take recordings of vitals before and after water submersion. A list of the commonly tested physiologic parameters are listed below:

- Blood pressure

- Heart rate

- Hemoglobin oxygen saturation

- Muscle sympathetic nerve activity

- Vascular resistance

In addition to the tests mentioned there has been current advancements in field devices that have allowed the obtaining more vitals and data.  The recent development of a submersible echocardiograph has allowed a viable assessment of cardiac function and anatomy during a real-time dive.
