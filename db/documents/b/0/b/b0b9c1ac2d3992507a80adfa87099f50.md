**Pregnancy**

The risks/benefits of intrathecal morphine should be considered during pregnancy, especially if prolonged use. The risk of teratogenicity is low. During labor and delivery, there is a risk for respiratory depression in both the mother and neonate. Respiratory depression, bradycardia, and withdrawal are all possible in the neonate with prolonged morphine exposure. It is routinely used as an analgesic in combination with local anesthetic (such as bupivacaine) in spinal anesthesia during Cesarean section.

**Drug Interactions**

Intrathecal morphine may potentiate other medications that cause CNS or respiratory depression and cardiovascular depression.Â  It lowers the seizure threshold and requires caution for use in patients predisposed to seizure. Intrathecal morphine also has a weak serotonergic effect and should be used with caution in patients on SSRIs. Intrathecal morphine is a CYP3A4 substrate, and use also requires caution in patients on other medications affecting the CYP3A4 enzyme.
