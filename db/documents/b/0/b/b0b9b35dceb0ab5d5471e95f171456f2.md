Patients with nfvPPA are best managed with an interprofessional team approach. The relationship between the primary clinician, the neurologist, and the speech and language pathologist is critical. The precise evaluations provided by speech and language pathologists can more accurately diagnose a patient's presentation in a subject area with more fluid boundaries between particular diagnoses. The clinician can correlate the clinical findings with imaging findings to solidify the diagnosis. Treatment by speech and language pathologists provides the most significant potential for improvement. It also requires close communication with the clinician to better monitor development and new findings that may need to be addressed several years after the initial symptom presentation. In later stages, PPA may require psychological and psychiatric intervention for cases with significant depression.
