According to ISHLT, a total of 5,074 heart transplants were performed in 2015. Median survival for cardiac transplants performed between 1982 and June 2015 was 10.7 years for adult recipients and 16.1 years for pediatric recipients. Survival rates in adults post-transplant were 94.8%, 84.1% and 72.3% after 1, 5 and 10 years respectively. The rates of HTR have steadily declined with the use of immunosuppressive therapy. HTR rates after discharge to 1 year of follow-up have declined from 30.5% in 2004-2006 to 24.10% in 2010-2015.

The incidence of PGD varies from 20-40%. A 6-year follow-up study published in 2018 reported PGD incidence of 31% in post-transplant patients.
