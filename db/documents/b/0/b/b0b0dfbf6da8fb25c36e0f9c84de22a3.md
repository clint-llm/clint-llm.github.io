The otologic surgeon who would typically perform a labyrinthectomy likely works within a healthcare team to perform many other otologic procedures. If not, certainly, a working relationship needs to be established between the surgeon, the anesthesiologist, the circulating nurse, and the surgical technician. This will ensure proper preoperative preparations regarding antibiotic prophylaxis, steroid administration, and facial nerve monitoring concerns. This will also minimize delays resulting from a lack of proper supplies or equipment in the operating room.
