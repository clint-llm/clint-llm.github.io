Eastern equine encephalitis is caused by a virus transmitted by a particular mosquito usually found in freshwater swamps. Symptoms include fever, chills, headache, myalgias, arthralgias. Diagnosis is made by serology and viral identification by PCR on a cerebrospinal fluid obtained after a lumbar puncture. Currently, treatment is supportive care and close monitoring. The fatality rate can be as high as 41%, and early diagnosis is key. Neurologic sequelae are seen in up to 50% of the patients, including seizures, paralysis, behavioral changes as psychosis, intellectual disability. There is no vaccine available. Prevention is critical to avoid EEE by limiting exposure to mosquitos. The center for disease control and prevention (CDC) recommends the use of insect repellent containing one of the following: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, or 2-undecanone. It also recommends wearing long-sleeve shirts and long pants and mosquito-control both indoors and outdoors.
