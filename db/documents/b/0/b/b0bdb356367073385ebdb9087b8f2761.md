Refractive surgery is a surgical laser procedure to alter the eye's refractive power and decrease the patient's dependence on spectacles and contact lenses. Radial keratotomy (RK) was one of the first and most commonly performed refractive surgical procedures of the 20th century. Approximately 10% of practicing ophthalmologists in the United States have performed several hundred thousand RK procedures.

Improvements to the technique so that incisions were placed solely on the anterior corneal surface were undertaken in the 1970s in Russia, where the use of multifactorial formulae and nomograms, which incorporated patient and surgical variables, led to improved predictability.

With the introduction of more accurate and stable laser refractive surgery i.e., photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), Laser In Situ Keratomileusis (LASIK), small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE), and intraocular lens surgery the popularity of radial keratotomy correction has decreased considerably. However, due to the number of patients who have undergone this procedure, knowledge of the procedure and its variations are required to manage this group of patients who may require visual rehabilitation in later life.
