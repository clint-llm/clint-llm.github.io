The lower limb bud appears during the fifth week of development, growing laterally from the L2 through S2 segments. Each limb bud contains the three primary germ layers: ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm. The lateral plate somatic mesoderm gives rise toÂ skeletal elements, and the musculature arises from the myotomic portions of somites. The lower limb rotates 90 degrees medially along the longitudinal axis, allowing the knee to face anteriorly. Programmed apoptosis occurs to form the digits.
