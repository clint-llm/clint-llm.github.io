Ischemic chest pain has been the hallmark of the clinical presentation of patients with acute coronary syndromes. Patients may present with absolutely no history of myocardial infarction or angina in the past, with previous myocardial infarction or with angina besides asymptomatic ischemic episodes. The history of presenting illness (HPI) and physical examination provide an immediate source of information for physicians to stratify the patients for further workup. Pertinent history in these patients would include past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, prior coronary artery disease (CAD), or presence of other risk factors for CAD. Physical examination can be benign in these patients.
