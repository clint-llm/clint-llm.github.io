Several issues in drug dosing can be explained in terms of Kd, receptor occupancy, and up/downregulation. Tolerance to a drug, where the effects seem to diminish with continued dosing, frequently occurs with prolonged dosing of opioids. Activation of opioid receptors stimulates the production of intracellular proteins called arrestins. Arrestins bind to the intracellular portion of the opioid receptor, block G-protein signaling, and induce receptor endocytosis. This results in less "signaling" or tolerance. The activity of arrestins, which produce receptor down-regulation, is one of the many pathways that lead to opioid tolerance.
