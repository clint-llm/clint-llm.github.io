Lissencephaly is usually diagnosed at birth through clinical evaluation and head imaging (ultrasound, computed tomogram (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)). It is characterized by the absence or reduction of the sulci and gyri of the cerebral surface and a thickened cortex. To confirm the diagnosis, DNA studies like chromosomal analysis or/and specific gene mutational analysis are needed toÂ find a mutation.
