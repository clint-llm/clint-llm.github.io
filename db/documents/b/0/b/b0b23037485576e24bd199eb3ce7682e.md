Originating at the apex of the styloid process of the temporal bone, the styloglossus muscle inserts into the lateral aspect of the tongue, namely into the fibers of the intrinsic longitudinal muscles and between the two parts of the hyoglossus muscle. External and internal fibers of the styloglossus muscle also fuse with parts of the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle and the palatoglossus muscle, respectively, with three bundles traveling anteriorly towards the apex of the tongue and an inferior longitudinal bundle joining the inferior fibers of the genioglossus muscle.

The fibers of the styloglossus muscle can be divided into anterior and posterior bundles. Anteriorly, the bundles run bilaterally and meet at the midline of the floor of the tongue, forming an arch. The posterior bundles of the styloglossus muscle split into approximately 10 smaller bundles of fibers that enter the tongue. These smaller bundles course between the inferior longitudinal intrinsic muscles of the tongue and the genioglossus muscle and ultimately insert into the lingual septum.

The styloglossus muscle functions to retract and elevate the tongue in a posterior and superior fashion. Following mastication, these movements promote passage of the food bolus towards the oropharynx.
