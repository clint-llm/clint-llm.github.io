Recent developments in the diagnosis and treatment of PCNs have been made.

- Ex vivo optical coherence tomography (OCT) of freshly resected pancreatectomy specimens have shown that mucinous cysts could be differentiated from nonmucinous cysts. OCT is an interferometric technique that typically uses near-infrared light. It allows noninvasive assessment of biological tissues by measuring their optical reflections.

- Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is a novel imaging technology that uses a low-power laser. Needle based CLE (nCLE) is used for intra abdominal organs under EUS guidance. The nCLE mini probe is introduced into the lesion through an FNA needle to obtain a biopsy. Pancreatitis was reported as an adverse complication in few cases.

- EUS-guided pancreatic cyst ablation uses EUS guidance to inject a cytotoxic agent, either ethanol or paclitaxel, after puncture of the pancreatic cyst. The injection of a cytotoxic agent may ablate the cyst epithelium.
