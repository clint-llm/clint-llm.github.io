Prolactinomas clinically present because of the mass effect of the tumor or because of hyperprolactinemia. Microprolactinomas (less than 1 cm) can present with symptoms of hyperprolactinemia or are detected incidentally on neuroimaging done for other reasons. Macroprolactinomas, on the other hand, present with mass effects on the surrounding structures.

**Signs and Symptoms Due to Mass Effect**

- Headaches

- Vision changes-visual field deficits, blurred vision, decreased visual acuity

- Cranial nerve palsies-especially with invasive tumors or with pituitary apoplexy

- Seizures, hydrocephalus, and unilateral exophthalmos are rare presentations

- Pituitary apoplexy is a medical emergency because of spontaneous hemorrhage into the pituitary tumor and presents with severe headaches, vision changes, and panhypopituitarism.

**Signs and Symptoms Due to Hyperprolactinemia**

**Males**

- Decreased libido

- Impotence

- Erectile dysfunction

- Oilgozoospermia (due to secondary hypogonadism)

**Females**

- Oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea

- Infertility, loss of libido

- Galactorrhea

**Children and Adolescents**

- Growth arrest

- Pubertal delay

- Primary amenorrhea

Other features like osteopenia, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and emotional instability can be seen in both sexes. About 10% of prolactinomas can be co-secreting growth hormone, so gigantism/acromegaly can be seen in those patients.
