- Acute stress disorder: The symptoms of PTSD and acute stress disorder mostly overlap. The onset and duration of the symptoms help in making the final diagnosis. Acute stress disorder is diagnosed if the symptoms are present for less than one month.

- Depression: At times, the patient has underlying depression that may co-exist and needs to be evaluated before formulating a treatment plan. Patients with PTSD also have a lifetime increased risk for depression and suicidal ideation/attempts.

- Adjustment disorder: The patient is diagnosed with adjustment disorder when the criteria for PTSD or any other psychiatric illness are not met.

- Anxiety disorders: The patient's increased negative emotional and physiological responses may be confused with panic attacks or other specified anxiety disorder.

- Traumatic brain injury (TBI): Cognitive impairment and dissociative symptoms may be due to traumatic brain injury.
