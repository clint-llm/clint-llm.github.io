Most PCNSLs are diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which constitutes about 95 percent of cases. Neoplastic B lymphocytes express pan-B cell markers and markers of germinal center and late germinal cell B cells. Less common histologies include Burkitt, T-cell PCNSL, lymphoblastic, and intraparenchymal marginal zone lymphoma.
