The use of opioid medication for analgesia dates back to the 1800s. One of the original opioid medications, morphine, named after Morpheus, the god of dreams, was extracted from opium plants and injected intravenously for providing analgesia in patients suffering from neuralgia. In the 1990s, various extended-release oral opioid formulations were introduced into the market.

These oral formulations available in high doses marked the beginning of the opioid crisis in the United States today. The euphoric effects of these medications, when combined with tolerance, and lethal central nervous system side effects, pose a dangerous situation for patients seeking pain relief. The opioid crisis has made the transition to illegal drug use and death by overdose, even with oral formulations, commonplace.  In the United States in 2016, over 230 million opioid prescriptions were written to treat acute and chronic pain. At that time, it was surveyed that one in every three adult Americans had currently been prescribed an opioid medication. Safe and effective pain management persists as a challenge for the physician and interprofessional health care team. The market for novel opioid medications with less abuse potential and fewer dangerous side effects is vast.

Kappa, delta, and mu-opioid receptors are present in various human tissues and can be targeted not only in the treatment of acute and chronic pain. Opioid receptor distribution in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis plays a role in the chronic itch that they can experience. Polypharmacy is commonly involved in managing these patients, who often have many comorbidities and decreased quality of life. The potential for selective opioid medications to target specific receptors in peripheral tissues is groundbreaking. It offers the opportunity to treat the etiology of itch that patients with end-stage renal disease may suffer from.

Indications for difelikefalin are the following:

- Uremic pruritus

- Post operative pain

Intravenous treatment of moderate to severe uremic pruritus has been conditionally accepted by the FDA.

In phase III clinical trials, intravenous dIfelikefalin has shown analgesic efficacy in treating post-operative pain and in the treatment of uremic pruritus in patients with end-stage renal disease who require hemodialysis.
