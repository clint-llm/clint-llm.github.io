There are many steps in providing patients with safe blood products. Transfusions should be based on clinical assessment and current guidelines. Unnecessary transfusion should be avoided as limiting exposure to blood products is the primary prevention of TTIs. Implementing advanced testing, such as NAT, has significantly advanced transfusion medicine safety regarding infectious entities; however, these advancements are not universal.

Close communication between blood banks and clinical services is crucial in establishing safe transfusion practices. Hemovigilance also keeps track of adverse events and helps develop better policies to reduce the chance of TTIs.

As medicine is ever-changing, weÂ must keep ourselves updated with the latest guidelines in transfusion. Participation in conferences, CMEs, and symposiums helps transfer and improve patient care through the most up-to-date evidence regarding preventing transfusion complications. Regular interaction between blood bank staff, donation centers, and the patient is crucial.
