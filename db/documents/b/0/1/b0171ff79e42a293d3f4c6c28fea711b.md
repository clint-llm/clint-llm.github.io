The FDA-approved indication for intravenous (IV) phenylephrine hydrochloride is for increasing blood pressure in adults with clinically significant hypotension resulting primarily from vasodilation in such settings as septic shock or anesthesia. Phenylephrine HCL is also used over-the-counter in ophthalmic formulations to promote mydriasis and conjunctival blood vessel vasoconstriction, intranasal administration as a treatment for uncomplicated nasal congestion, and as an over-the-counter additive to topical hemorrhoid medications. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, dose forms, monitoring, and toxicity of phenylephrine, so providers can direct patient therapy in treating the various conditions for which it is indicated, as part of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of phenylephrine therapy.
- Describe a hypotensive patient that would be most suitable for phenylephrine therapy based on known hemodynamics.
- Review the adverse event profile and contraindications of phenylephrine.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance phenylephrine therapy and improve outcomes.
