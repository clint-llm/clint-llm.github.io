Ocular injury caused by an IOFB depends on its velocity, size, nature, entry site, and impaction.

Metallic foreign bodies are the most common type.

Ocular damage with iron foreign body results in siderosis bulbi. It is a pigmentary, degenerative process due to chronic retention of an iron IOFB.

The pupil may become fixed and dilated. The pupil may show denervation hypersensitivity.
