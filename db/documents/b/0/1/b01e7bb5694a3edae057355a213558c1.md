Occlusion of toe clefts, maceration, and wet conditions with a simultaneous increase in the bacterial flora probably contribute to tinea pedis infection. Skin breakdown, humidity, and temperature play a role in this infection. The fungus released enzymes called keratinases to invade the keratin layer of skin. In addition, the dermatophyte cell wall also contains molecules called mannans which suppress the body's immune response.
