Appropriate use of sodium bicarbonate and preventing its potential adverse effects require the involvement of the entire allied interprofessional team of healthcare professionals. When ordering sodium bicarbonate for a patient, the ordering/prescribing clinician, administering nursing team, and pharmacy team must recognize the indications for the medication and observe any toxicity or side effects from its administration. Clinicians need to ensure that sodium bicarbonate is the appropriate therapeutic choice. Nursing will either administer the drug if the patient is inpatient or give instructions for home administration for outpatient use and counsel regarding potential adverse events. Pharmacists will verify appropriate dosing, perform medication reconciliation checking for drug-drug interactions, and reinforce patient counseling points where appropriate. Utilizing an interprofessional approach to sodium bicarbonate therapy will increase the chances of therapeutic success while minimizing adverse events, which will result in better patient outcomes.

Despite consistent, systematic checkpoints in evaluating negative outcomes, the clinical observation and recognition at the bedside consistently improve morbidity and mortality in the setting of patient medication errors, medication-induced reactions, and side effects.
