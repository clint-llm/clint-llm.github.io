Risk factors for this disease can be divided into two categories: weakening of the collagen and local injuries to the area.

Risk factors causing weakening of collagen include systemic illnesses such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, hyperparathyroidism, and iatrogenic, including chronic steroid and fluoroquinolone use.

Local injuries include patellar instability, patellar tendinopathy, or degeneration. Patellar instability can be congenital or due to anatomical variants. The most common causes of instability include patellar tilt, patella alta, trochlear hypoplasia, or vastus medialis weakness. Tendinopathies and degeneration can result from chronic overuse or repeated traumatic injuries.
