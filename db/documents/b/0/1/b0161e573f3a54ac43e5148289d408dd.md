In patients who survive to the hospital with subclavian injuries, the overall prognosis is favorable for patients who undergo successful vascular repair. The most common injury with significant comorbidity following subclavian artery trauma is brachial plexus injuries. Despite successful revascularization and hematoma evacuation, most patients experience long-term neurologic sequelae resulting in disability secondary to brachial plexus injury. In a case series of 28 patients with concomitant repair of brachial nerve and artery injuries, only 50% of patients had a good functional recovery.

Patients with arterial subclavian and axillary injuries have an estimated limb loss rate of 2.4% to 2.9%.

Patients with subclavian artery trauma likely have associated injuries that also must be identified and managed appropriately. Common associated injuries include spinal fractures, clavicular fracture, rib fractures, tracheobronchial injuries, and compressive hematomas. Associated humerus fracture was found to be associated with an increased risk of limb loss.

Compared with open repair, the endovascular approach has the reported advantages of decreased post-operative recovery time, limited dissection of the injured site, less pain, lower incidence of bleeding, and infectious complications.
