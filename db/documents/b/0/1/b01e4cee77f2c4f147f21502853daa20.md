Ceruloplasmin is undetectable before 20 weeks of gestation. Concentrations gradually rise to 25 to 40% of average adult concentrations and, by six months, are close to adult concentrations.

**Special Situations**

- There have been reports of inherited aceruloplasminemia in several families, and it is a genetic cause of ceruloplasmin deficiency; these patients have neurodegeneration and iron deposition in the brain.

- Menke's disease is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the ATP7A protein. With this mutation, copper cannot be transported out of the GI tract; therefore, copper is unavailable to the liver, which causes low ceruloplasmin levels. The patients present in infancy have sparse, brittle, and kinky hair, growth retardation and neurologic degradation, and death if untreated in the first few years of life.

- Wilson disease results from an autosomal recessive mutation in the ATP7B protein. Mutations in ATP7B (located on chromosome 13) lead to Wilson disease. ATP7B is an efflux transporter in the liver, but it is also essential in the Trans-Golgi Network for transferring copper for the metalation of ceruloplasmin and biliary copper excretion.
