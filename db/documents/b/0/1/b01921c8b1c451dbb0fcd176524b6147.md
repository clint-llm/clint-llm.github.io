Streptococcus pyogenes, also known as group A streptococcus (GAS) is a leading cause of pharyngitis in children and adolescents. Clinicians should use clinical and epidemiological findings to determine the likelihood of GAS pharyngitis.Â Infectious Disease Society of American (IDSA) recommends that a rapid antigen detection test (RADT) should be used as the first-line measure to assist the clinicians in the diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis. It is recommended to obtain throat cultures in children with negative RADT results to prevent the development of complications.

The gold standard test for the detection of GAS is throat culture; however, it is not cost-effective and can delay the treatment.S. pyogenes from other beta-hemolytic streptococci and tests for the presence of the enzyme pyrrolidinyl aminopeptidase.

Anti-streptolysin O (ASO) and anti-DNase B (ADB) titers indicate the previous streptococcal infection and can be used for the diagnosis of post-streptococcal complications.
