Melanoma is a skin cancer of the melanocytes that occurs after DNA mutation, most often secondary to excess sun exposure. Fair-skinned and light-haired persons living in high sun-exposure environments are at greatest risk. Clinically, melanoma exhibits shape irregularity, irregular color, and asymmetry. Sometimes, melanoma exhibits ulceration and bleeding, which is associated with a poorer prognosis. A punch biopsy often reveals atypical nests of melanocytes that accumulate and coalesce at the dermo-epidermal junction. The depth of melanoma is the most important prognostic factor. Two staging systems are available to assess depth: Breslow and Clark levels. In the past, physicians used the Clark level. However, Breslow level is now the standard of care because it is more specific.Â Depending on the depth of the lesion, the 10-year survival rate varies tremendously. Also, a melanoma lesion's depth determines the margins that a surgeon is to take when resecting the lesion.
