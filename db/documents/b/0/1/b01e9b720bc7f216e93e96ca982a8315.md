Nosocomial pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is defined as pneumonia that occurs 48 hours or more after hospital admission and not incubating at the admission time. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) represents a significant sub-set of HAP occurring in intensive care units (ICUs). This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology and presentation of nosocomial pneumonia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of nosocomial pneumonia.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with nosocomial pneumonia.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for nosocomial pneumonia.
- Describe some interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with nosocomial pneumonia.
