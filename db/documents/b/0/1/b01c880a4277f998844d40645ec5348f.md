Methods to prevent cribriform plate fractures center around precautions to reduce the risk of high-impact facial injuries. Head protection and face masks during high-impact sports should be strongly encouraged. Educating parents about the importance of seat belts and age-appropriate car seats can reduce instances of facial trauma in motor vehicle collisions. Improving safety measures that place small children at risk for falls can be beneficial. Community resources to curb violence and prevent assault could also help lower the incidence of cribriform plate fracture.
