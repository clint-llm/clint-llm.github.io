The anticipation of hypotonic labor and subsequent diagnosis and management requires interprofessional team management. The trained obstetric nurse or midwife may identify the risk factors during the antenatal visits and ensure appropriate monitoring at the time of labor. The midwife is also key in charting the labor progression using the various monitoring tools. They must be able to recognize an abnormal progression pattern and involve the necessary specialist in the care plan.

The Obstetrician usually takes the lead on the interprofessional team, ensuring early detection of slow progress due to hypocontractility and implementing the appropriate step-wise interventions and monitoring while coordinating the input of other team members.

The anesthetist and pharmacists ensure the patient has adequate pain management, especially where assisted or operative delivery is required.

For cases that require intrauterine fetal resuscitation, instrumental delivery, or cesarean delivery, early involvement of the neonatologist ensures continuity of postpartum care.

The team management approach improves maternal and fetal outcomes and may lower the average cesarean section rates.Â [Level 5]
