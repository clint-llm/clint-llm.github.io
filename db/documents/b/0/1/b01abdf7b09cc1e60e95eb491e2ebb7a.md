A cardiac catheterization procedure is usually performed in a cardiac catheterization laboratory with the help of fluoroscopy to guide and position the catheters in the appropriate position. Along with the experienced operator, support from registered nurses and radiologic technologists is needed for safely performing the procedure. Most of the procedures can be performed with minimal or moderate sedation with the help of a local anesthetic, but some procedures will require anesthesia services for providing deep sedation or general anesthesia. Some of these procedures can be performed at the bedside in a coronary care unit, and the common ones performed bedside include right heart catheterization and temporary pacer wire insertion.
