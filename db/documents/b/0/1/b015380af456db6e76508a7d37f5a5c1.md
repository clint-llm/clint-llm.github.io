GCBL occurs more frequently in males than in females. It is most common in uncircumcised males under the age of 50 years and rarely occurs in children.

Out of all the reported penile tumors in the US, GCBL constitutes about 5%Â to 24%. Very few cases of GCBL outside the penis have been reported. While penile cancers have a much higher incident rate outside the US, reliable epidemiological data are still lacking about the international incidence rates of GCBL.
