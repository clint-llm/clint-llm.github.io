Ecthyma gangrenosum is separated into bacteremic and non-bacteremic forms.P. aeruginosa, such as exotoxin A, elastase, and phospholipase C, cause skin and vascular destruction. P. aeruginosa has increased substantially in recent years, making treatment more challenging. Resistance mechanisms include decreased permeability (biofilm formation), antibiotic efflux pumps, antibiotic inactivating mechanisms, and antibiotic target site mutations.
