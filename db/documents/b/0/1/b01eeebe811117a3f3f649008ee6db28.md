The personnel varies in pre-hospital and hospital settings, however, if possible, there should be other healthcare providers nearby in addition to the one performing the procedure. In the pre-hospital setting, it is important to have someone to hand supplies, inflate the balloon, and perform any other tasks that can be very helpful. In the hospital setting, a nurse may be needed to attach the patient to the monitor, set up sedative or paralytic medications, administer medications, and perform other tasks. Furthermore, most hospitals now have respiratory therapists that will help secure the ET tube, place the patient on a ventilator, and help monitor the patient’s respiratory status post intubation. In the emergency department setting where NT intubation is no longer regularly performed, having an anesthesiologist or otorhinolaryngologist (ENT) may be necessary and helpful to the emergency medical provider.
