The GON-block can be performed relatively quickly, easily, and inexpensively. Only minimal equipment is required. The provider has the option to inject anesthetic alone or may also choose to inject a combination of anesthetic and steroid. Studies suggest no difference in short and long-term migraine pain control when the anesthetic is injected alone or in combination with a steroid. In contrast, the addition of steroids is very effective for treating cluster, cervicogenic, and post-dural puncture headaches.

Required equipment for a single GON-block includes:

- 5 cc syringe

- 25-gauge needle

- Povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine

- Anesthetic 

- Lidocaine 2% (2 mL)
- Bupivacaine 0.5% (2 mL)

- Anti-inflammatory

- Methylprednisolone 40 mg/mL (2 ml)
- Dexamethasone 2 mg/mL (2 ml)

Toal injection volume should not be greater than 4 mL. If lidocaine and bupivacaine are combined, the ratio should be 1 to 1 to 1 to 3.
