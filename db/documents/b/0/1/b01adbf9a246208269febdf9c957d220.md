Recently histopathological and electron microscopic studies have demonstrated obstruction through the outflow pathway. Frequently, the ciliary muscle is inserted high on the trabecular meshwork. Moreover, a detailed framework analysis has shown an excessive amount of collagen in the trabecular meshwork. Other studies have demonstrated fibrillary collagen fibers, elastin fibers, and ground substances in the intervening trabecular meshwork and the canal of Schlemm.
