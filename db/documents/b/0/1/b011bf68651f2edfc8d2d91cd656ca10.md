The diaphragm is considered the most important muscle when it comes to respiration. Unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis is a condition when one-half of the diaphragm is paralyzed. Each side of the diaphragm is innervated or controlled by the ipsilateral phrenic originating from cervical nerve roots three through five. Diaphragm paralysis can occur because of any pathology that affects the diaphragm muscle or interferes with the phrenic nerveâ€™s ability to properly send signals to the diaphragm muscle. There are many possible causes for diaphragm paralysis, although the most common etiology is trauma-related.

In most cases, unilateral paralysis is asymptomatic; if symptoms are present, it usually improves with time without treatment. Symptoms are more common with underlying heart or lung issues or obesity. When symptomatic, most patients experience trouble breathing, which is worse with exercise and lying flat on their back at night. There are imaging options to assist with diagnosing this condition, and the treatment is more specific to the underlying cause of diaphragm weakness. Treatments can range from conservative measures, watching and waiting, to surgery to correct the underlying issue.
