Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is characterized by tissue-bound and circulating IgG autoantibodies against type VII collagen, located in the lamina densa and sublamina densa of the basement membrane zone (BMZ). As the major component of anchoring fibrils, these structural components connect the papillary dermis to the lamina densa and play a significant role in maintaining the integrity of the epidermal BMZ.

Certain HLA class II alleles appear to overrepresent in some populations with EBA. A higher frequency of HLA-DRB1*13 has been described in Korean patients.
