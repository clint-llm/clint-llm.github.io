Panniculectomy is not a cosmetic procedure. The intention of the procedure is to remove the excess skin and fat that hangs over the thigh and causes difficulty in personal hygiene, walking, and other physical activities. A panniculectomy must meet specific criteria to be medically necessary, and these criteria may vary by locale. The most commonly utilized criteria include the following:

- The pannus must hang below the level of the pubis and be confirmed with photography.

- Patients must fail medical treatment of intertrigo for three months. Medical treatment includes good hygiene, topical antifungals, corticosteroids, and antibiotics.

- The role of panniculectomy is to restore normal function. Patients must maintain a stable weight for at least six months.

- After bariatric surgery, patients must maintain a stable weight for at least 18 months, including the most recent six months.
