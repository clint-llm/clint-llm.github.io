Chronic allograft rejection can be caused by antibody-dependent complement activation lesions as well as cell arteritis leading to the development of interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IF/TA).

The 2011 Banff meeting focused on diagnostic criteria for late-antibody mediated rejection.  In this review, there was the recognition of CD4-negative antibody-mediated rejection, in which endothelial activation and NK cells were suggested as the primary causes of chronic reaction.

- Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) toxicity

- Chronic dysfunction of the solid organ causing premature graft loss

- Alloimmunization to minor HLA antigens

- Production of interferon-gamma and IL-2 by Th1 lymphocytes

- Secretion of cytokines by endothelial cells
