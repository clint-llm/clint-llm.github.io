Intermittent exotropia is the most common type of strabismus. It is defined as a non-constant exodeviation that manifests predominantly at distance fixation and may progress over a variable period to near fixation. This entity is also named distance exotropia, divergent squint, periodic exotropia, or exotropia of inattention. Small exophorias are common in newborns and can be present in 60 to 70%, which resolves by 4Â to 6 months of age. This condition often presents in childhood.

The usual disease course begins with an exophoria that may progress to intermittent exotropia and eventually become constant. It is important to understand that all cases are not progressive, as some cases might remain stable over the years despite lack of treatment, and few may even improve. Von Noorden, in his analysis, found that among 51 untreated patients with intermittent exotropia, 75% showed progression, 9% remained stable, and 16% showed improvement.
