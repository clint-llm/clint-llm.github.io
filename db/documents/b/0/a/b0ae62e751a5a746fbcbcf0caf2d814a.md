The Paramyxoviridae is a family of single-stranded RNA viruses known to cause different types of infections in vertebrates. Examples of these infections in humans include the measles virus, mumps virus, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The paramyxoviruses primarily spread via respiratory droplets. To avoid the spread of this virus, appropriate administration of vaccinations, appropriate hand washing, and appropriate hygiene and employment of face masks are highly encouraged. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of different infections caused by the Paramyxoviridae and highlights the role of the healthcare team in evaluating and treating patients infected with these viruses.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with mumps, measles, parainfluenza virus, and RSV.
- Explain the common physical exam findings associated with patients who are symptomatic with mumps, measles, parainfluenza virus, and RSV.
- Summarize the epidemiology of mumps, measles, parainfluenza virus and RSV.
- Describe the management considerations for patients infected with mumps, measles, parainfluenza virus, and RSV
