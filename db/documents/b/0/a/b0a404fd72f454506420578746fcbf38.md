Hypergammaglobulinemia is the most common cause of HVS, specifically the monoclonal condition Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. More than 30% of all WM patients develop HVS at some pointÂ in their life because of the large star-shaped IgM pentamers that are highly viscous. Myelomas are the second leading cause of HVS. About 25% of HVS cases secondary to myelomas are caused by IgA, followed by IgG myelomas at less than 5% of cases.
