The gastrocnemius muscle consists of 2 heads. The medial head originates from the posterior medial femoral condyle while the lateral head arises from the posterior lateral femoral condyle. The gastrocnemius muscle is vulnerable to injury because it crosses 3 joints: the knee, the ankle, and the subtalar joint.
