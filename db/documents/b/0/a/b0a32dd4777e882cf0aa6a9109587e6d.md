This article will outline the current usage of SBME in otolaryngology. Broadly, the usage of SBME in otolaryngology falls into two categories: the acquisition of technical skills, such as endoscopic sinus surgery and temporal bone drilling, and the acquisition of non-technical skills, known within the educational literature as human factors. SBME is most well-established within the framework of curriculum output. Technical skills and human factors required by training programs can be taught using reproducible and validated simulators and scenarios and also to assess the abilities of otolaryngology team members. SBME can provide guidance and practice in medical decision making and medical leadership and provide multidisciplinary teams with continuing medical education (CME).
