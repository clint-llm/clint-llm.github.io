The pituitary gland is connected to the hypothalamus at the median eminence via the pituitary stalk. It sits within the bony cavity of the sella turcica, a superior depression within the sphenoid bone, named after its resemblance to a Turkish saddle. Laterally it is bordered by the cavernous sinus and internal carotid arteries. Superiorly, its border is the optic chiasm.

The pituitary is composed of two divisions: the anterior and the posterior divisions. The embryologic epithelial tissue from the primitive pharynx forms the anterior division, whereas the posterior tissues arise from neuroectodermal tissue. The differences in embryonic origins result in varied histologic compositions and functions between the anterior and posterior aspects of the pituitary gland. These different histologic compositions and cell type origins are notable since different tumor subtypes arise from these different anatomic regions, and this division is readily apparent on imaging.
