Treatment is typically managed by steroids and steroid-sparing immunomodulatory therapy. Steroids can be given either by mouth or directly into the eye by injection or implant. There is increasing use of steroids being placed into the eye to help control the progression of BCR. The use of steroids can cause an elevation of intraocular pressure, and if left untreated, can result in permanent vision loss. When using steroids, it is important to monitor intraocular pressure as this can often be asymptomatic to the patient until permanent vision loss has occurred. Many of the steroid-sparing immunomodulatory therapies currently used have significant side effects, and this should be discussed with the patient in detail. Unfortunately, there is not one regiment of therapy that is effective for all patients, and many combinations may need to be trialed to control the ocular inflammation. The goal of therapy is to find the lowest amount of medication needed to suppress the ocular inflammation. Often, a patient may need to follow with a rheumatologist or nephrologist for testing and management of these immunomodulatory therapies. With the use of IMTs, visual acuity can remain stable or can improve by 78.6% to 89.3%.
