Various radionuclides are used in clinical imaging and treatment.

**Common radionuclides used in imaging through the emission of gamma photons include:**

Technetium-99m: Technetium is used for a wide range of clinical applications when tagged to various other compounds.

Iodine-123: Iodine-123 is used in the evaluation of Parkinson's disease (I-123 ioflupane), the evaluation of pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma, neuroblastoma (I-123 MIBG, a norepinephrine analog), and in the evaluation of thyroid disease such as Graves disease (I-123).

Iodine-131: Iodine-131 is mainly used for the therapy of benign and malignant thyroid diseases.

Indium-111: Indium-111 CSF leak (In-111 DTPA), evaluation of neuroendocrine tumors (In-111 pentreotide), and infection (In-111 labeled WBCs).

Xenon-133: Xenon-133 is used for the evaluation of lung ventilation, often in the setting of the workup for pulmonary embolism.

**Commonly radionuclides used in imaging through positron emission include:**

Fluorine-18: Fluorine-18 is most well known for its use in the evaluation of tumor, however, is also used in the evaluation of cardiac viability, brain metabolism, infection, dementia, (in the form of F-18-FDG, a radionuclide glucose analog) and prostate cancer (F-18 fluciclovine, an amino acid analog).

Nitrogen-13: Nitrogen-13 is used in the evaluation of cardiac perfusion and is preferred for the quantification of myocardial blood flow.

Rubidium-82: Rubidium-82 is used in the evaluation of myocardial perfusion.

**Radionuclides used in therapy include:**

Yttrium-90: Yttrium-90 is a beta emitter and is used commonly in the treatment of liver malignancy via selective intra-arterial injection.

Radium-223: An alpha emitter used for the treatment of bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer that is resistant to other treatments.

Lutetium-177: Lutetium-177 is a beta emitter used for the treatment of gastrointestinal and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors that are refractory to other treatments.

Strontium-89 and Samarium-153: Beta emitters used as a palliative treatment measure for bony metastasis.
