The prognosis of the nephritic syndrome depends upon the underlying etiology and age of the patients. Usually, children have an acute self-limiting course of glomerulonephritis, and the prognosis is good. Adults typically have a chronic fulminating course. The disease is not resolved in 20Â to 74% of the adults. In these patients, the renal function derangement persists and will result in chronic renal failure.
