The presence of ongoing nonconvulsive seizures should be considered in any patient with altered mental status or focal neurologic deficits without a clear cause and should extend to patients demonstrating encephalopathy or transient neurologic deficits despite appropriate treatment of a known cause. This holds true, particularly for critically ill patients requiring intensive medical care or who have a known history of epilepsy.

Prompt diagnostic evaluation can help to identify both clear electrographic seizures and electrographic patterns that lie on the IIC with features strongly concerning for an ictal process. In addition, careful clinical observation of the patient in the ICU can be very helpful in identifying clear yet subtle ictal phenomena such as repetitive or stereotyped eye blinking and lip-smacking.

Patients experiencing generalized IIC patterns typically demonstrate encephalopathy of varying severity with cognitive impairments in attention or level of consciousness that reflect diffuse cerebral dysfunction.

Focal patterns on the IIC may be associated with impairments in cognitive domains typically implicated in the region of concern.
