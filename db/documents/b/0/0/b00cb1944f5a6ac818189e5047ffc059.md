Antiepileptic drug-level monitoring has been a common clinical practice since the advent of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Maintaining AEDs within laboratory-defined therapeutic ranges is a myth, with professionals overestimating values in most clinical settings. This review will explore the efficacy, variability, and utility of monitoring antiepileptic drug levels in various settings.

Epilepsy, in general, is a clinical diagnosis, with diagnostic modalities such as EEG and MRI considered complementary investigations. The assessment of AED efficacy should also be clinical, and the AED level should be utilized as a complementary tool in selected situations.
