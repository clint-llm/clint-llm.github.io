The olecranon is the proximal articular portion of the ulna.  Along with the coronoid process, it forms the greater sigmoid (semilunar) notch which articulates with the humerus to provide flexion and extension of the elbow. Fractures of the olecranon are a relatively common injury in adults; its subcutaneous location leaves it vulnerable to injury from a direct blow. Fractures sustained range from simple nondisplaced fractures to complex open fracture dislocations. Olecranon fractures frequently require surgical management to restore articular congruity and elbow stability.  Although outcomes after surgery are relatively good, it is not uncommon for patients to have a range of motion (ROM) deficit or require a repeat procedure to remove hardware.
