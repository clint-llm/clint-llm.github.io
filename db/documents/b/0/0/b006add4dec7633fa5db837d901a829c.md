The timely care of patients diagnosed with malaria and clinically relevant research regarding advancing diagnostic techniques and treatment requires interprofessional teamwork and communication between clinicians, infectious disease experts, pharmacists, nurses, and global health professionals.

Any clinician treating malaria will initiate treatment as outlined above. Still, it is good policy to include an infectious disease specialist and involve an infectious disease board-certified pharmacist, who can alsoÂ examine the regimen and agents chosen, as well as verify dosing and drug interactions. A nurse with infectious disease specialty training can also help by answering patient questions, serving as a bridge to the treating clinician, and monitoring treatment progress and potential adverse drug reactions. All team members must keep accurate and updated records, so everyone involved in treatment has the same information on the patient's case. If there are any concerns, each team member must be free to communicate with other team members so that appropriate interventions can be started or therapeutic modifications can be implemented. This collaborative interprofessional approach can optimize outcomes for malaria patients. [Level 5]
