Although rare, the risk of catastrophic adverse effects has been associated with manual therapy of the cervical spine. The most serious associated adverse events include cervical artery dissection (CAD) and vertebrobasilar insufficiency (VBI), and artery spasm, all of which can lead to stroke.

Controversy surrounds the dependability of vertebral artery testing before manipulation, with studies concluding that it is not possible to conclude the accuracy of pre-manipulative tests. Studies may indicate that the pre-manipulative tests do not seem reliable as a screening procedure.

Vertebral artery injury is a major complication, usually occurring when cervical HVLA is performed with the neck in the extended position.

Additional complications of this procedure, mainly performed by providers without sufficient experience, can include minor soreness or muscle pains. Overall, complications are rare, but the chance of adverse events will increase with contraindications. Additional complications can include fractures of cervical vertebrae, spinal cord injury, and other soft tissue injuries.
