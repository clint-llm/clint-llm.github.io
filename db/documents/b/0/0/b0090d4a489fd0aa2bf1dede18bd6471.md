OSSN has variable regional incidence. Previous epidemiological studies have reported 0.13/ lakh incidence of OSSN in Uganda and less than 0.2 cases/ million/ year in the United Kingdom. The incidence in Brisbane, Australia, has been reported to be 1.9/100000 population.

Sun et al., in their analysis, reported a 5 times higher incidence of OSSN in Qhirwa and showed that darker skin individuals residing in tropical climates close to the equator have more incidence of OSSN.

Lee and Hirst, in their analysis, reported the average age of occurrence of OSSN  to be 56 years (range 4 to 96 years).
