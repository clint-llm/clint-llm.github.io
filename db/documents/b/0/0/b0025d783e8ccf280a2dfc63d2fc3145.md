The various etiologies behind the causation of the 'Raccoon sign' can be summarized as follows:

- **Traumatic**
- Minor events like the plucking of the eyebrows
- Non-accidental injuries
- Thoracic trauma and crush injuries
- Following vigorous sneezing, coughing, or vomiting (probably due to periorbital venous hemorrhage)
- Posttraumatic orbital emphysema (due to fracture of orbital wall and entrapment of air from paranasal sinuses)

- **Vascular**
- Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) following the rupture of an ophthalmic artery aneurysm
- Venous sinus thrombosis (commonly secondary to cavernous sinus thrombosis)
- Giant cell arteritis
- Trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia
- Benign intracranial hypertension
- Acute migraine (due to vasodilation and release of vasoactive substances, including heparin)

- **Infectious**
- Severe pediatric adenovirus infection
- Periorbital leukoderma
- Frontal sinus mucocele

- **Immune-mediated**
- The neonatal lupus erythematosus (vasculitis may lead to facial and periorbital purplish-red plaques)
- Chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperature (CANDLE) syndrome (due to a predilection to involve periorbital skin)
- Lichen planus pigmentosus (hyperpigmentation due to pigment incontinence)
- Sweet syndrome or acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (skin disease characterized by the sudden onset of fever, an elevated white blood cell count, and tender, red, well-demarcated papules, and plaques that show dense infiltrates by neutrophil granulocytes on histologic examination)

- Raccoon sign in this condition results from secondary vascular damage caused by prolonged exposure to matrix metalloproteinases.
- Toxic products of neutrophils in the infiltrate may be responsible for vascular damage leading to erythrocyte extravasation.

- **Metabolic**
- Amyloidosis (most commonly light chain (AL) type) is due to increased vascular fragility resulting from amyloid deposition; this is one of the most common causes of raccoon eyes other than trauma; the finding presents in about one-fifth of patients with AL amyloidosis.
- Myxedema

- **Malignancies**
- Hematological malignancies (blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm, lymphoblastic lymphoma, and acute myeloid leukemia)
- Metastatic neuroblastoma (secondary to tumoral obstruction of the palpebral vessels)and neuroblastoma (observed in 5.4% of cases)
- Orbital metastasis of solid malignancies
- Kaposi sarcoma
- Multiple myeloma (infiltration of amyloid proteins in the capillaries leads to increased fragility, which can burst under minor stress and is usually painful)

- **Genetic**
- Hemophilia

- **Iatrogenic**(perioperative raccoon eyes)
- Usually observed among patients with systemic amyloidosis of AL type
- Post-rhinoplasty (due to a bleeding disorder)
- Post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), prone positioning, consumption of steroids, and Valsalva maneuver might cause increased venous pressure, which in turn lead to the rupture of fragile orbital vessels in an elderly patient)
