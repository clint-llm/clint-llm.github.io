Understanding abnormal EEG waveforms and differentiating them from normal EEG variations is very important. A normal EEG does not rule out epilepsy, as the sensitivity of an EEG to identify epilepsy is less than 50%. Further, it is also important to understand that even healthy volunteers may have interictal discharges and other EEG abnormalities. Hence unneeded EEG testing can lead to unnecessary and erroneous diagnoses and cause potential harm from treatments if not interpreted properly.

Furthermore, abnormalities like breach rhythm (normal rhythm seen with skull defects) can have focal, sharply contoured morphology.
