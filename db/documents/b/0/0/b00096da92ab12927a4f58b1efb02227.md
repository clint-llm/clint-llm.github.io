There are both maternal and fetal indications for operative vaginal delivery, which includes the use of forceps and vacuum extraction alike. No indication is absolute. The fetal indication is commonly a non-reassuring tracing when the vertex is well below the ischial spines which may preclude a cesarean delivery. Maternal indications include maternal exhaustion and prolonged second stage of labor (nulliparous: 4 hours with regional anesthesia and 3 hours without, multiparous: 3 hours with regional anesthesia and 2  hours without). Both imply adequate maternal pushing efforts with contractions.) According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the following criteria are necessary before proceeding with either vacuum or forceps delivery.

- Cervix fully dilated

- Rupture of membranes

- Fetal head engaged (vertex presentation)

- Knowledge of the fetal position

- Fetal weight has been estimated

- Maternal pelvis adequate for vaginal delivery

- Anesthesia administered

- The maternal bladder is empty

- Maternal consent obtained, risks and benefits thoroughly explained

- A back-up plan if the operative delivery method fails

- Maternal cardiac or neurologic disease when maternal pushing is not feasible
