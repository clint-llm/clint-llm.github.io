The pathophysiology of atypical fibroxanthomas is poorly characterized. Ultra-violet (UV) light has implications for its pathogenesis due to atypical fibroxanthoma predilection for sun-exposed areas of the body and the presence of atypical fibroxanthoma in xeroderma pigmentosum patients who exhibit defective repair of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. Research has documented these UV-induced pyrimidine dimers have in atypical fibroxanthoma lesions, along with mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53. A variety of rare genetic disorders have correlations with p53-induced atypical fibroxanthomas, including Li-Fraumeni syndrome (with germline p53 mutations) and xeroderma pigmentosum. One study showed that mutations of H-Ras and K-Ras genes were present in malignant fibrous histiocytoma but not in atypical fibroxanthoma lesions; this research may prove helpful in establishing the diagnosis of atypical fibroxanthoma.
