Aqueous humor is a slightly alkaline ocular fluid formed by epithelial cells of the ciliary body at a rate of 2 to 3 microliters/minute. The formation and chemical composition of aqueous humor is accomplished via three processes - diffusion, ultrafiltration, and active secretion by the ciliary processes - linear folds projecting from the ciliary body into the space behind the iris where the lens ligaments and ciliary muscle attach to the eyeball.

Aqueous humor is composed of organic and inorganic ions, glutathione, carbohydrates, amino acids, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and water. A major function of aqueous humor is to supply nutrients and oxygen to the avascular tissues of the eye, the cornea, and the lens. Aqueous humor also functions to remove waste products, blood, macrophages, and other debris from the posterior cornea and anterior lens and maintain the shape and IOP of the eyeball.
