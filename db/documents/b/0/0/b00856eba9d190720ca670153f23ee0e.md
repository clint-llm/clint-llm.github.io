Fleas are prevalent among mammals worldwide. In the developed world, the most influential vectors are household pets, specifically cats and dogs.

Tunga penetrans, also known as the chigoe or jigger flea, is a parasitic flea infestation found in tropical and subtropical climates including Africa, South America, and Central America. It is most common in underdeveloped and impoverished regions. Though rare in the United States and Europe despite global travel, it should be considered in patients returning from endemic regions. Peak incidence occurs during the dry season between August and September. Typically only adults are affected. Domestic and wild animals act as reservoirs of disease.
