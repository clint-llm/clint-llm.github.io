Surgical indications: displaced fractures, nonunion, ulnar nerve compression, median nerve compression, ulnar artery compression, tendon rupture, and metacarpal subluxation.

- Hook fractures:

- Acute, nondisplaced: Immobilization, ulnar gutter cast for six weeks. There is still debate whether patients may profit from initial surgical treatment in this type of fracture. Sport players will usually benefit from early surgical management, returning to sports activities in three months.
- Acute, displaced: Excision of a bony fragment is the gold standard procedure. Open reduction and internal fixation (screws or Kirschner wires) is another proven treatment. Both alternatives showed similar clinical results.
- Chronic pain, nonunion: These signs require fracture pinning with bone grafting.

-  Body fractures:

- Acute, nondisplaced: Immobilization, six-week cast.
- Acute, displaced: Open reduction and internal fixation (Kirschner wires, grid plate, or headless compression screws).

Surgical tech tips:

- The motor branch of the ulnar nerve must be clearly spotted and retracted before hook excision or drilling.

- After fractured fragment excision, periosteum closure should be over the base of the remaining body to protect the ulnar nerve and tendons.
