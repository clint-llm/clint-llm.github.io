The goal of the labyrinthectomy procedure is to ablate an unstable and dysfunctional vestibular system in order to promote central compensation for patients with episodic vertigo and/or baseline disequilibrium. As discussed earlier, total hearing loss in the operated ear is expected. Vertigo control rates are high (95Â to 100%), but there is a significant possibility of persistent disequilibrium.
