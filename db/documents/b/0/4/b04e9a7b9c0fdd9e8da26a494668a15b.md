Ancylostoma duodenale, the human hookworm, is the most common parasitic infection in countries with poor access to adequate water, sanitation, and hygiene. A. duodenale along with other soil-transmitted helminths (STH) are transmitted through contact with contaminated soil. In the last few decades, zoonotic transmission of 3 other Ancylostoma species has been documented. In these cases, the transmission occurred from domesticated animals to humans.
