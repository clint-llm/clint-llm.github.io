Abdominal and pelvic ultrasound, like most diagnostic ultrasound applications, has minimal to no associated risks and complications. There may be someÂ patient discomfort due to pressure applied with the transducer during the exam. The gel can also feel cool and should be completely removed using a clean, dry towel when the exam is complete.
