Diagnosis of preeclampsia requires a systolic BP of at least 140 mm Hg or a diastolic BP of at least 90 mm Hg on at least two occasions, taken at least four hours apart, plus new-onset proteinuria or a severe feature.

A single severe feature, in combination with hypertension, is sufficient for the diagnosis. Proteinuria is not essential for diagnosis if a severe feature is present. Severe features of preeclampsia include a systolic blood pressure of at least 160 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure of at least 110 mm Hg, platelet count less than 100 × 10^3 per microL, liver transaminase levels two times the upper limit of normal, a doubling of the serum creatinine level or level greater than 1.1 mg per dL, severe persistent right upper quadrant pain, pulmonary edema, or new-onset cerebral or visual disturbances.
