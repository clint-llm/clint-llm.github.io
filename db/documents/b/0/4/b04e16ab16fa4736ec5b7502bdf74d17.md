Most patients present soon after delivery especially in the first week postpartum. The symptoms are suggestive of heart failure, for example, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. These symptoms are usually attributed to normal pregnancy and that is why a diagnosis of postpartum cardiomyopathy can be easily missed. Physical examination findings include tachycardia, elevated jugular venous pressure, bilateral pulmonary crackles due to pulmonary edema, third heart sound (S3) and displaced apical pulse. Severe cases may present with acute respiratory failure or cardiogenic shock and a need for close monitoring in the intensive care unit.

Some of the most common risk factors for the development of postpartum cardiomyopathy are as follows:

- Advanced maternal age (more cases reported in both extremes of age)

- High parity (71% of women diagnosed with PPCM had three or more prior pregnancies)

- High gravidity

- Twin pregnancy (more endemic in women with twin pregnancies)

- Use of tocolytic therapy (greater than 4 weeks can cause silent ischemia)

- African descent (more prevalent in the African population)

- Poverty

- Hypertension

- Cocaine abuse
