Reports of acute and chronic kidney diseases are increasing in the U.S. and various parts of the world. When looking for a critical metric to understand when not to treat using a nephrotoxic medication, the standard is set at an eGFR less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m^2.

Nephrotoxic medications can elicit damage to the kidney via various mechanisms, including alteration in its structure and function. When evaluating the primary etiologies in renal injury, the incidence of drug-induced toxicity has accounted for 20% of all-cause incidents. Besides, when nephrotoxicity from pharmacologic agents is further examined, evidence has shown it to be one of the chief etiologies in intrinsic renal failure aside from the second most common cause, infection.

The more significant percentage of individuals affected by these agents come from the over 70-year-old category. With the aging life expectancy in the United States, we need to choose pharmacologically appropriate agents for our aging population with declining renal functions.
