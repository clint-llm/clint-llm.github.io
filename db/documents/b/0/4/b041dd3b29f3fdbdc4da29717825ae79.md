Approximately 40% of all sebaceous carcinomas present on the eyelids, with 80% occurring on the head or neck.

SC of extra-ocular locations generally presents as a yellowish nodule, often with ulceration. The head and neck are the most common locations; however, the trunk and extremities may also have involvement. There are also rare reports of cases of SC development at extracutaneous sites, such as the parotid gland, breast, ovary, and prostate.
