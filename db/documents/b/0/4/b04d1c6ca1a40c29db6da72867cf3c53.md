Post- cardiac arrest resuscitation is usually begun in the emergency department, and, if the patient survives, is continued in the ICU setting. The resuscitation is resource-intensive and involves a large interprofessional team including neurologists, intensivists, primary care providers, ICU nurses, social workers, ethics teams, organ donation teams, possibly child protective services, and clergymen. Because many patients do not survive cardiac arrest, and many have a poor prognosis, open communication with the family is important. An ethics team as well as bereavement support should be involved with the family early on. Children who survive cardiac arrest are often left with anoxic brain damage, and face numerous problems with daily living, so all outcomes should be explained in detail to family. Frequent communication and updates by the clinical team can help prepare the family if there is no hope for salvage. The local organ donation organization should be contacted as soon as the patient's prognosis is determined to be poor, as the family may need time to process these decisions. A multidisciplinary approach should be employed in all cases, as they often exhaust resources, cause increased stress for providers, and are emotionally taxing for all involved.
