Electrolyte imbalance is one of the hallmark concerns for systemic poisoning from hydrofluoric acid exposure through all routes of entry.  Immediate electrolyte assessment at minimum includes calcium, potassium, and magnesium levels to ascertain hypocalcemia, hypomagnesia and hyperkalemia.  Even though the concern is with systemic poisoning, patients with simple exposures can develop hypocalcemia, hypomagnesia, and hyperkalemia.

Cardiac monitoring and electrocardiography (EKG / ECG) are important to assess for clinically significant electrolyte imbalance to include QT prolongation from hypocalcemia (Figure 1), peaked T waves/arrhythmias from hyperkalemia, and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (specifically Torsades de Pointes) from hypomagnesia.

Chest x-rays should be performed on all patients with respiratory exposure to evaluate for pulmonary edema or pneumonitis.  Inclusion of EtCO2 monitoring can be considered for individuals with inhalation type exposures.  Urinalysis with evaluation for hematuria and proteinuria will indicate renal dysfunction, insufficiency and renal cortical necrosis.
