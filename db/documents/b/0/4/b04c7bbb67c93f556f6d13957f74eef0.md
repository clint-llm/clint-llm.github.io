Peyronie disease (PD) is a progressive and non-malignant disorder of the penis resulting in an abnormal curvature when erect. The condition is named for François Gigot de la Peyronie in 1749, who was a French surgeon and cofounder of Académie Royale de Chirurgie. It was first described in 1561. The abnormal curvature is caused by scar tissue in the erectile tissue; however, the exact mechanism responsible for the formation of this scar tissue remains elusive.

PD is reported to affect more than 1 in 10 men in the United States.
