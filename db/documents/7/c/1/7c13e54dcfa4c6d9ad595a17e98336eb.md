In its early stages, it can be misdiagnosed as eczema, psoriasis, or even ringworm. It may develop into an invasive cancer if it is not treated early. The most common cause of squamous cell carcinoma in situ is undue exposure to the sun’s rays; therefore, in preventing one’s susceptibility to the disease, there should be a limit to sun exposure. The use of sunscreen, photoprotective clothing, and other means that could minimize exposure to sun rays are helpful prevention tips. Regular testing and screening are also important, especially in people at high risk for squamous cell carcinoma in situ. Early detection has a very good prognosis and prevents the development of squamous cell carcinoma.
