Multiple studies have reported the histopathologic findings involved in lateral epicondylitis, with few studies focused on medial epicondylitis. However, the chronic degenerative process is understood to be similar in both conditions with histologic findings consisting of:

- Hypertrophic immature fibroblasts

- Poorly organized collagen

- Vascular hyperplasia

- Lack of inflammatory cells

The above chronic degeneration with failed healing findings are thought to be a consequence of the repetitive microtrauma and the poor blood supply of the tendons.
