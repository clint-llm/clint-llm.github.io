Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a well-known, life-threatening complication after organ transplantation, predominantly following solid organ transplantation (SOT) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The majority of the cases of PTLD are associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and it occurs within the first posttransplant year. In the transplant setting, it is essential to consider the timeline following surgery and initiation of immunosuppression when considering infectious complications. High-dose immunosuppression is associated with a higher risk of PTLD. The clinical presentation of PTLD can be highly variable ranging from localized to disseminated disease, and it can imitate benign conditions. Consequently, a high degree of clinical suspicion is critical for early diagnosis and prompt treatment.
