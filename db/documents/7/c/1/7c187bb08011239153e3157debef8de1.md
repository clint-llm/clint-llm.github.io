The most crucial entity in the differential diagnosis is angiosarcoma. The gastrointestinal angiosarcoma is rare, and it usually involves the small intestine. Angiosarcoma is composed of atypical epithelioid tumor cells arranged in solid sheets with only subtle vasoformation. Brisk mitosis and necrosis are common presentations in angiosarcoma.  However, florid vascular proliferation usually demonstrates a more obvious capillary architecture in a lobular growth pattern. Mitosis is none or infrequent. The endothelial cells in FVP do not have significant cytologic atypia. Furthermore, the finding of mucosal prolapse-type changes, such as muscular fibroplasia, is very helpful for a diagnosis of FVP. The diagnosis of angiosarcoma of the GI tract is only possible after the exclusion of florid vascular proliferation and other benign vascular lesions.

The second entity in the differential diagnosis is Kaposi sarcoma (KS). Kaposi sarcoma is a malignant neoplasm associated with human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), usually involving patients with immune deficiency.[

Other benign vascular lesions, such as hemangiolymphangiomas (HLAs), vascular malformations, or angiogenic polypoid proliferation, should also be considered in the differential diagnosis. HLAs are commonly polypoid lesions, ranging from 0.5 cm to 3.5 cm. Microscopically, HLAs show proliferation of capillaries, veins, or lymphatics, involving the mucosa or submucosa only, and is not transmural. Vascular malformations are more common in women and grossly appear as “congestive streaks” that may range in size from 0.6 cm to 3 cm. Microscopically, they are composed of submucosal clusters of abnormal, variably sized vessels of different types, including arteries/arterioles, capillaries, veins/venules, and lymphatics. Mucosal ulceration or erosion is common in vascular malformation. Angiogenic polypoid proliferation of the small bowel typically occurs in the lamina propria and is not transmural; this was initially thought to be a paraneoplastic process of the mucosa surrounding small intestinal well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors. However, Abraham et al. noted in a comparison cohort study that the researchers identified angiogenic polypoid proliferation in a majority of non-carcinoid neoplasms.

In summary, florid vascular proliferation is a benign pseudo-neoplastic vascular proliferation that may mimic other benign or malignant vascular lesions or neoplasms. Correct diagnosis of this entity is essential since this lesion is benign and does not appear to recur after complete surgical excision.
