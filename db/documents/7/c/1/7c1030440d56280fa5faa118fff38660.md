The prognosis for juvenile open-angle glaucoma patients is generally favorable if diagnosed and treated early in the disease course. In a Japanese study of 47 eyes with juvenile glaucoma, 21 eyes (45%) had normal visual fields, whereas 13 eyes (28%) were at an advanced stage, most of which were ascribed to a delay in disease diagnosis.
