**Pearls**

- The presence of a pucker sign on clinical examination indicates a more severe soft tissue injury and a high risk of neurovascular compromise.

- Refer patients with a positive posterior fat pad sign to an orthopedic surgeon for further review. This indicates the presence of an intra-articular fracture.

- In addition to standard AP and lateral views, internal oblique and external oblique views intra-operatively provide improved visualization of the medial and lateral columns for assessment of reduction.

**Pitfalls**

- Pin placement at the fracture site needs to be maximized. Lateral pins that cross at the fracture site or crossed pins that cross in the distal fragment have little to no rotational stability.
