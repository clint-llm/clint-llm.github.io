Carcinoid tumors are endodermal in originÂ and arise from enterochromaffin cells of the aerodigestive tract. GI carcinoids occur most frequently in the small bowel, followed by rectum, appendix, and stomach. It has been proposed that paracrine agents and growth factors induce cell proliferation, and form fertile ground for mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Carcinoids can also rarely be seen in patients with familial MEN1 syndrome.
