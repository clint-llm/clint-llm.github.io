Hydrofluoric (HF) acid is an extremely powerful inorganic acid and a vigorous dehydrating agent that is used in many industrial branches. Domestic concentrations of hydrofluoric acid are typically around 0.5 percent with industrial concentrations approaching 100 percent. Hydrofluoric acid is highly toxic and damaging. It penetrates into deep tissue causing liquefactive necrosis and release of cellular products. Ingestion of solutions or inhalation of fumes and vapors with unintentional and intentional exposures of hydrofluoric acid presents with dermal burns, eye injury, acute respiratory symptoms as well as causes systemic fluoride toxicity including cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal and neuromuscular symptoms, electrolyte imbalance and enzyme inhibition which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and death. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of hydrofluoric acid burns and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing the patients affected by it.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of hydrofluoric acid burns.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with hydrofluoric acid burns.
- Summarize the epidemiology of hydrofluoric acid burns. 
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance delivery of care for the patients affected by the hydrofluoric acid burns.
