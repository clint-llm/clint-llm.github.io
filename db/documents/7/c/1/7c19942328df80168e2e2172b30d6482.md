Each intercostal space receives its blood supply from 3 arteries, a posterior intercostal artery and a pair of anterior intercostal arteries. The posterior arteries of the first 2 intercostal spaces are fed from the superior (supreme) intercostal artery which comes off the subclavian artery.

The internal thoracic artery is another branch of the subclavian artery that supplies the anterior intercostal arteries of spaces 1 through 6 before dividing into the superior epigastric and musculophrenic arteries.

The intercostal veins run most superiorly in the costal grooves. There are 11 pairs of posterior intercostal veins and one pair of subcostal veins. Like the posterior arteries, the posterior veins also anastomose with the anterior intercostal veins. Several of the superior posterior intercostal veins typically merge to form the left and right superior intercostal veins at the level of T3 or T4 which can then empty into the brachiocephalic vein or the superior vena cava (SVC).
