A clinician in the outpatient setting can perform this procedure independently. However, it may be prudent to have an assistant. An assistant can help with the preparation and specimen handling. While no universal guidelines exist regarding using a chaperone during the examination, and accusations of inappropriate conduct during the exam/procedure are rare, providers should consider utilizing a chaperone. The American Medical Association Opinion 1.2.4 discusses chaperones and recommends that physicians adopt a policy where patients are free to request a chaperone. The provider and their office staff should ensure that the policy is communicated to patients, and any member of the health care team can serve as a medical chaperone as long as there are clear expectations to uphold professional standards of privacy and confidentiality.
