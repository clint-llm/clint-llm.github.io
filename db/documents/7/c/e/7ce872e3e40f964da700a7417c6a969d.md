The prognosis ofÂ intermittent claudication depends on many factors. For those who continue to smoke, have uncontrolled hypertension or elevated blood glucose, the condition can progress, leading to ischemia, necrosis, and eventually culminate in the amputation of the limb. Besides smoking, two factors that negatively affect prognosis include diabetes mellitus and advanced age. Overall, the survival of patients with intermittent claudication is less than that of age-matched controls. The key reason for the shortened life expectancy is the presence of coronary artery disease. About 5% to 30% of individuals are dead at 10 years, depending on the severity of the vascular disease.
