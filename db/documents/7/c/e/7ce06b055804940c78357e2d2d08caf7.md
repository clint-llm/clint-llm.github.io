Most Americans prefer to die at home or in a home-like setting, yet over 30% die in acute care hospitals.

The hospice movement began with the work of Dame Cicely Saunders, whose predominant concern was alleviating the suffering of dying patients. In 1967, Saunders opened St. Christopher’s Hospice in South London and is now credited with developing the principles of hospice care that have become the core values reflected in hospice program policies worldwide.

The first hospice program established in the US was Connecticut Hospice in 1974, spearheaded by Florence Wald, RN, who modeled it on St. Christopher’s Hospice. Both programs were in an inpatient setting.

The most recent decade has seen significant growth in the number of hospice programs and hospice utilization. In 2016, there were 4382 Medicare-certified hospices in operation.

An estimated 1.4 million people received hospice care in the US, with almost half being older than 84 years and 27.2% (the largest portion) having cancer as their terminal diagnosis. Over 50% of patients were cared for at home, with 42% cared for in a nursing home setting. On closer examination, there is tremendous geographic variation in the availability and use of hospice services. For example, the proportion of Medicare decedents enrolled in hospice at the time of death varied across states from a low of 23% (Puerto Rico) to a high of 58% (Utah). Hospice utilization also varies by race and ethnicity. Almost 50% of Whites who died in 2016 used hospice care compared to 31% to 37% of African American, Asian, or Native American descent. While longer Lengths of Stay (LOS) in hospice have been shown to be more beneficial to patient and family,

Variations in hospice use can also have a basis on hospice and physician characteristics. One study found that 78 percent of hospices had at minimum one enrollment policy that might prove restrictive to access to care for patients with potentially high-cost medical care needs, such as chemotherapy or total parenteral nutrition. Smaller hospices, for-profit hospices, and hospices in some areas of the country consistently reported more limited enrollment policies.

To enable more timely referrals, educational interventions need to target physicians, and hospice programs need to expand patient access to potentially costlier palliative treatments that provide symptom relief. Ultimately, reform of the Medicare Hospice Benefit to include concurrent care or extend beyond a 6-month prognosis could also improve access to hospice in the United States.
