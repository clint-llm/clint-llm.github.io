Opioid addiction results from many practices and behaviors. The United States possesses an insatiable appetite for the prescription of opioid medications. In 2015, 91.8 million individuals in the United States used prescription opioids. Due to their inarguable abuse potential, these drugs are frequently misused, with high numbers of patients developing dependence. Opioid medications prescribed for mild to moderate acute pain were continued indefinitely, with no intention of tapering or ceasing use. Due to pharmacologic effects, opioids are highly addictive. Tolerance is achieved within days, and the withdrawal syndrome is severe.
