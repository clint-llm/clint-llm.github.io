Provide analgesia after an abdominal wall procedure in a variety of abdominal surgeries are the indications of the TAP block. The TAP block can be performed for open abdominal surgeries as well as laparoscopic procedures. The TAP block is an easier and less risky substitute for epidural anesthesia in postoperative pain control for abdominal surgeries.

- A **unilateral block**is used for a one-sided procedure, such as appendectomy, cholecystectomy, nephrectomy, and renal transplant.

- **Bilateral blocks**are used for midline and transverse abdominal incisions, such as ventral hernia repair, umbilical hernia repair, exploratory laparotomies, colostomy closures, cesarean delivery, hysterectomy, radical retropubic prostatectomy, bariatric surgeries, inguinal hernia repair, and laparoscopic surgeries.
