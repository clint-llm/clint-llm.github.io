With a pneumothorax or a hemothorax, there is increased pressure within the intrapleural space. Because of this increased pressure, it moves the resting state of about -5 cmH2O to a higher value depending on the degree ofÂ disease. As this occurs, it would take a much more significant expansion of the thoracic cavity to create a negative pressure to bring air in from the atmosphere. In a tension pneumothorax, the pressure in the pleural space continually raises the intrapleural pressure, thus decreasing the volume in the lungs. Tension pneumothorax can generate enough pressure to cause a mediastinal shift which eventually interferes with the venous return to the right side of the heart and cardiovascular demise.
