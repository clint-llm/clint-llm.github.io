The external jugular vein is frequently used to obtain vascular access to administer medications or IV fluids in patients with problematic peripheral access, such as those on dialysis or in the intensive care unit who have had multiple prior peripheral IV catheters placed. The external jugular vein is not the first choice for venous cannulation as it is tortuous and can be challenging to cannulate in people with thick, short necks, and is more bothersome to patients than other peripheral IV locations. Unlike the internal jugular vein, the risk of complications from cannulation of the external jugular vein is much less and similar to any other peripheral site. The external jugular vein is ideally only used for short periods of hydration, as the dislodgement of the cannula is common due to the motion of the neck. The patient should be asked not to rotate the neck while the external jugular vein is in use.  Because of its variable course and valves, the external jugular vein cannot be reliably used to assess jugular venous pressure.

To access the external jugular vein, the patient is first placed in Trendelenburg position to facilitate filling of the vein.  Since a tourniquet cannot be applied, the patient can be asked to perform the Valsalva maneuver, or direct pressure can be applied just superior to the middle portion of the clavicle.  Standard infection control practices are utilized by cleansing the skin with a chlorhexidine wipe and wearing gloves throughout the procedure.  Needle insertion should be at a shallow angle (30 degrees or less) to the skin with the tip of the needle pointing obliquely from the midline along the course of the external jugular vein.  Gentle manual traction can be applied to the skin overlying or just adjacent to a more distal portion of the vein to stabilize the vein for cannulation.  Once you have achieved a flash of blood in the needle, the plastic catheter can be advanced into the vessel and secured.  A challenge with external jugular vein cannulation is that there may not be an appreciable flash of blood into your needle, or it may occur more slowly than in other peripheral veins due to the lower pressure in the external jugular vein.  One technique that can assist the practitioner is to attach a small syringe to the needle and hold gentle negative pressure on the syringe while advancing the needle; this will allow you to see blood return into the syringe and confirm entry into the external jugular vein.
