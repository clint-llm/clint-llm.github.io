The differential diagnosis for CNV from wet ARMD should include other causes of CNV. These include:

- Pathologic myopia

- Presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (POHS)

- Choroidal rupture

- Angioid streaks

- Chronic central serous chorioretinopathy

Breakthrough vitreous hemorrhage can also occur in wet ARMD, and diagnosis may be challenging if there is a poor view on dilated funduscopic examination. Diagnosis may be established by evaluating the patient’s fellow eye or obtaining a thorough history. Other potential causes of vitreous hemorrhage include:

- Proliferative diabetic retinopathy

- Retinal tear or retinal detachment

- Hemorrhagic posterior vitreous detachment

- Neovascularization from other causes, including vein occlusions, radiation retinopathy, or sickle cell retinopathy

Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) is a subtype of ARMD that is more common in Asian patients. It is characterized by orangish-red, bulb-like subretinal polyps associated with adjacent subretinal hemorrhage or exudates. ICGA is an essential tool in the diagnosis of PCV, and recurrent disease is more common among PCV patients than those with wet ARMD. Patients with PCV may benefit more from PDT than typical wet AMD patients.
