The most likely complaint associated with refractory cases of congenital fifth toe deformities is discomfort with shoewear. In cases that do not resolve in early childhood, nonoperative management is still often effective, but recurrence of the deformity may be more likely long-term. If surgery is attempted, complications are minimal, with infection and scarring being the most common.
