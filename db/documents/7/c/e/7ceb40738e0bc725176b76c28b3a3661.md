Adverse effects and complications of photodynamic therapy include:

- Short term adverse effects:

- Pain
- Erythema and edema
- Pruritus
- Urticaria
- Contact dermatitis
- erosive pustular dermatosis of the scalpÂ 
- Decreased delayed-type hypersensitivity responses
- Extensive ALA application could lead to systemic absorption and systemic phototoxicity

- Long term adverse effects:

- Pigmentary changes and scarring: Hyperpigmentation/hypopigmentation
- Bullous pemphigoid: pathogenic mechanism unknown

Carcinogenicity: keratoacanthomas, basal cell carcinoma, invasive squamous cell carcinoma, melanomas have been reported post-treatment with PDT. But as yet, the role of PDT in causing tumor has not been clearly defined and requires further elucidation.

The reason the use of PDT has declined over the years in ophthalmology is because of its complications, the most common being deterioration in vision due to subretinal hemorrhage.

During intravenous infusion, verteporfin can extravasate into the areolar tissue surrounding the blood vessels, and it can lead to skin necrosis if not addressed promptly. Backache following verteporfin infusion is a relatively rare complication.
