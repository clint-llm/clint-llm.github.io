There has been documented variation in the course of the superior branch of the superior gluteal nerve, specifically that of the superior branch traversing below the inferior branch of the superior gluteal nerve. This superior branch descended inferolaterally, entering the tensor fasciae latae.

An aberrant double belly composition of the piriformis muscle with the superior gluteal nerve trapped between the two muscle bellies has been observed. This observation suggests a unique anatomical variant that may serve as a rare cause of piriformis syndrome and undiagnosed chronic gluteal pain.
