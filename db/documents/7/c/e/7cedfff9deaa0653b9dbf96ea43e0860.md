The exact etiology depends on the type of esotropia. We have tried to describe the underlying etiology for each type briefly

**Infantile Esotropia**

The underlying factors predisposing to infantile esotropia are:

**Innervational Imbalances**

It is****characterized by a disturbance between the tonic convergence and divergence are considered responsible for deviations.

**Accommodation**

The role of accommodation is considered partially or fully in congenital esotropia patients. In a few cases, the accommodative esotropia might be superadded at 2Â to 3 years, over the primary deviation.

**Refractive Accommodative Esotropia**

The most important etiology for this type is underlying uncorrected hypermetropia. Additional factors to be considered in this type include fusional divergence amplitude, AC/A ratio, and patient personality.

**Non-Refractive Accommodative Esotropia**

An underlying high AC/A ratio is expected to predispose to this type of esotropias. The near point of accommodation is within the normal range for age in these patients.

**Partially Accommodative Esotropia**

These cases have an uncorrected hypermetropia, with a normal AC/A ratio.

**Sensory Esotropia**

Sensory esotropia occurs because of poor vision in one eye in early childhood. The eye with poor vision often deviates, and the other eye with good vision becomes the dominant eye.

**Consecutive esotropia**

This often occurs due to surgical overcorrection in a previously exotropia eye.
