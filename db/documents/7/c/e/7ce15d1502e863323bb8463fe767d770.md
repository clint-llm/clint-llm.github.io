**Apolipoproteins:**

Apolipoproteins are instrumental in the synthesis and metabolism of chylomicrons.

Apolipoprotein B-48 is vital for chylomicron synthesis, assembly, and secretion into the lymphatics via lacteals into the systemic circulation.

Apolipoprotein C-II is another component that both VLDL and chylomicrons acquire from HDLs. ApoC-II plays a significant role in the metabolism of triglycerides since it is a cofactor for the pivotal enzyme in TG metabolism, lipoprotein lipase (LPL).

LPL which, is attached to endothelium following synthesis by various cells, cleaves of fatty acids form TG for energy utilization or storage. Lipase maturation factor1 (LMF1) plays a key role in the stabilization of LPL and the movement of LPL to the endothelial surface. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored high-density lipoprotein binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) serves to anchor the LPL to the endothelium. This protein plays a crucial role in transporting LPL from the subendothelial spaces to the capillary lumen to execute its vital function. A mutation in this protein like with LMF1, can lead to hyperchylomicronemia.  ApoA5 plays a role in the activation of LPL and promoting TG lipolysis and mutations in this protein can also result in familial hyperchylomicronemia. ApoC-III inhibits LPL  activity. Hence LPL and its modulators are pivotal in the metabolism of chylomicrons.

Apolipoprotein E is another component derived from HDL that facilitates the clearance of chylomicron remnants by the liver.

While ApoAs are present in chylomicrons, their roles are not well defined in chylomicron metabolism, except for apo -A5, which activates LPL.

**Metabolism**

Chylomicrons exit the enterocyte via the lacteals into the systemic circulation. Here they are acted on by LPL with its cofactor Apo-CII, which cleaves off FA moieties, which in muscle and adipose tissue are immediately mobilized for energy or stored for future use. In addition to Apo-CII, other important modulators of LPL include apoA5, LMF1, GPIHBP1 as reviewed above.

The removal of triglycerides from chylomicrons in the peripheral tissues results in the formation of chylomicron remnants. The remnants are smaller particles that are mainly composed of cholesterol and are taken up by the liver via the Remnant and LDL receptors by recognition of ApoE.

Monogenic familial chylomicronemia syndrome is sporadic and arises from homozygous or compound heterozygote mutations in LPL and/or other modulators including, but not limited to:  ApoA5, LMFI, GPIHBP1and ApoC2 These rare disorders are discussed briefly later in the review. Familial chylomicronemia syndrome refers to chylomicronemia plus one of the following clinical features: eruptive xanthoma, pancreatitis, and hepatosplenomegaly or lipemia retinalis.
