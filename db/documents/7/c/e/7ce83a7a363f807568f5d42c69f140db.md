Edoxaban is contraindicated in patients with massive or pathological bleeding. Edoxaban should also not be used to manage patients with CrCL higher than 95 mL/min. The ENGAGE AFTIMI 48 study demonstrated that subjects with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation patients and CrCL higher than 95 mL/min had a more significant risk of ischemic stroke with a 60 mg daily dosage of edoxaban compared to subjects managed with warfarin.

Edoxaban is not for patients with underlying valvular pathologies or patients with mechanical heart valves. Patients taking edoxaban and undergoing spinal or epidural puncture procedures are at risk of producing a spinal or epidural hematoma. Indwelling catheters should be held for at least 12 hours post edoxaban therapy, and the agent should not be started for at least two hours post catheter removal.
