The palmar interossei are a group of paired intrinsic muscles of the hand locatedÂ between the metacarpals. They consist of four, and sometimes three, palmar muscles that, adduct fingers. The palmar interossei also assist in flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joints and extension of the interphalangeal joints. All interossei muscles receive their innervation by the deep ulnar branch of the ulnar nerve. As such, any injury to the ulnar nerve may have debilitating implications on specific intrinsic hand muscle functions, including finger adduction, which is primarily controlled by the palmar interosseous muscles.
