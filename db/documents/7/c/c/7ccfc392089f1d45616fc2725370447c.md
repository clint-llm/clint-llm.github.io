Powassan Virus (POW) is an emerging arboviral infection that can cause encephalitis and meningoencephalitis. It most commonly presents with neurologic symptoms, and among patients who become symptomatic, the case fatality rate is as high as 10% to 15%. Cases have been on the rise in the United States and Canada, and clinicians must be able to identify patients who present with geographic risk factors and a syndrome consistent POW virus infection. This activity outlines the evaluation, diagnostic testing, and treatment options for Powassan virus infection. It further reviews the role of interprofessional teams in managing outbreaks and patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of Powassan virus infections.
- Review the epidemiology of the Powassan virus.
- Outline the typical clinical presentation of a patient with Powassan virus encephalitis and meningoencephalitis.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation and diagnosis of a patient with suspected Powassan virus encephalitis and meningoencephalitis.
