**Primary Congenital Glaucoma**

Development of Haab's striae in cases of congenital glaucoma induces significant astigmatism and corneal opacity.

**AXR Anomaly**

Glaucoma develops in 50% of the patients with AXR anomaly.

**Peters Anomaly**

If it is not treated early, it can lead to dense amblyopia. Post-operative complications inherent to penetrating keratoplasty can be seen.

**Aniridia**

Total limbal stem-cell failure leading to total corneal opacity, persistent epithelial defect, and lenticular subluxations are some of the complications.

**CHED**

Dense amblyopia and risks of graft-related complicationsÂ are common in CHED.

**Sclerocornea**

Glaucoma, corneal degeneration, cataract, microphthalmos, nystagmus, esotropia (high hyperopia with astigmatism), and amblyopia are the associated complications.

**Congenital Ectropion Syndrome**

Congenital glaucoma, juvenile glaucoma, amblyopia, and phthisis are some of the complications.
