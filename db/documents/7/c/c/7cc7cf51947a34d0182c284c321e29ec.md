Educate patients about activity restrictions. Patients with a platelet count over 50000/mL should be cautious while participating in contact sports. Restriction from contact sports and other potentially traumatic activities is recommended in patients with platelets count under 10000/ mL.

Educate patients that certain over the counter medications like aspirin, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and ginkgo biloba interfere with platelet function. Educate patients about quinine-containing beverages and herbal teas, causing the low platelet count.
