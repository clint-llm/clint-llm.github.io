An esophageal ulcer is a distinct break in the margin of the esophageal mucosa. This mucosal damage to the esophagus is often caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease or from severe sustained esophagitis from other causes. The reported prevalence of esophageal ulcers emerging from gastroesophageal reflux disease has been estimated to be 2% to 7%. Other causes have not been sufficiently studied. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of esophageal ulcers and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the potential etiologies of esophageal ulceration.
- Describe the clinical presentation of esophageal ulcer and the relevant examination procedures for evaluation.
- Summarize the treatment options available for esophageal ulcer, based on etiology and severity.
- Explain the need for a well-integrated, interprofessional team approach to improve care for patients with esophageal ulcers.
