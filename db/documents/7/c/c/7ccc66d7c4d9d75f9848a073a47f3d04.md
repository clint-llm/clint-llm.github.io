Osteoclasts are large dome-shaped multinucleated cells comprised of fused mononuclear osteoclast progenitor cells. Osteoclast progenitors fuse together on the bone surfaces but are primarily found in bone marrow, where they derive from macrophage/dendritic cell precursors, which arise from myeloid progenitor cells, which ultimately originate from hematopoietic stem cells. Therefore, osteoclasts have a hematopoietic origin, which may explain their diverse and dynamic function.

A lifecycle has been proposed for osteoclasts, with the order being the following

- Pre-Osteoclasts (Precursors/Progenitors)

- This was the subject of prior discussion.

- Active Osteoclasts

- Multinucleated cells attached to the bone surface, with a ruffled border

- Inactive Osteoclasts

- Multinucleated cells attached to the bone surface, with no ruffled border

- Resting Osteoclasts

- Multinucleated cells not attached to the bone surface, with no ruffled border

- Post-Osteoclasts

- Mononuclear cells with a high capacity for phagocytosis

Osteoclasts and osteoclast progenitor cells have many receptors present on their cell surface, which play important roles that will be discussed later. The most important ones include receptor activator nuclear factor-kB (RANK) and toll-like receptors (TLRs).
