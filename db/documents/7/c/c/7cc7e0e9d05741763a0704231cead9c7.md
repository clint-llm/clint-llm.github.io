According to the manufacturer's product labeling, administration of ezetimibe in doses up to 40-50 mg daily was generally well tolerated in clinical trials. In addition, one patient with homozygous sitosterolemia had an accidental overdose of ezetimibe 120 mg/day for 28 days with no significant clinical or laboratory adverse events. There is no specific antidote to ezetimibe. In an overdose with ezetimibe, clinicians should provide symptomatic and supportive care. In addition, clinicians should obtain LFTs if hepatotoxicity is suspected, as autoimmune hepatitis associated with ezetimibe requires treatment withÂ corticosteroid therapy.
