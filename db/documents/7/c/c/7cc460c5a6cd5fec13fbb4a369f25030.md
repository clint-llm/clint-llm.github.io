Atracurium is a neuromuscularÂ blocking agent widely used in anesthesia. While the agent is primarily used by anesthesiologists, nurses in the ICU need to know about its mode of action, duration, and adverse effects. The agent is known to cause histamine release, which may be responsible for a variety of side effects.
