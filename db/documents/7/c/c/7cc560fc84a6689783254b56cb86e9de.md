Pulmonary rehabilitation benefits patients with chronic lung disease and can be beneficial to patients irrespective of the severity of the lung disease. The majority of earlier literature on pulmonary rehabilitation involves patients with advanced COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) as it was developed and implemented for them. However, lung function should not be the sole criterion. The selection of patients for pulmonary rehabilitation should be based on symptoms and functional limitations. Patients with mild to moderate COPD also benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation.

With its benefit in COPD, pulmonary rehabilitation has been extended to other pulmonary disease processes such as asthma, bronchiectasis, interstitial lung diseases, chest wall disorders, and pulmonary hypertension.

According to the recommendations of the American College of Chest Physicians and American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation (ACCP/AACVPR) practice guidelines, "pulmonary rehabilitation is appropriate for any stable patient with a chronic lung disease who is disabled by respiratory symptoms."
