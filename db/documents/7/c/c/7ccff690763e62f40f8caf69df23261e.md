In summary, a low residue diet is a restrictive diet that has both diagnostic and therapeutic roles. Regardless of the clinical indication, a low residue diet requires patient education to encourage compliance and to ensure that the patient is adequately following the diet as directed. The responsibilities of this education are deliverable by dietitians, nursing staff, and clinicians. Education is key to enhanced patient-centered care as it reinforces insight and understanding. It provides the patient with the complete opportunity to more likely obtain the desired outcomes of the diet.
