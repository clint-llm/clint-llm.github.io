Treatment of patients with Turcot syndrome is fairly rudimentary. In the event of tumor development, surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment. In patients presenting with adenomatous, precancerous colorectal polyps, especially if genetic confirmation exists, total colectomy is the conclusive way of preventing the development of colorectal cancer. In patients that develop brain tumors, surgical resection also applies. Surgery, chemotherapy, and occasionally radiation therapy have all been used to treat patients with TS.

Otherwise, there is no way developed to reverse inherited genetic mutations. Therefore, treatment targeting Turcot syndrome is largelyÂ preventative or defensive.
