interprofessional care in acute anemia results in improved outcomes. Education should focus on compliance with any medications (such as iron, steroids, etc.), avoiding triggers (such as alcohol, NSAID use) and a solid understanding of what caused the anemia and how best to avoid another episode. The prognosis of acute anemia largely depends on the etiology and is highly variable — rapid stabilization and treatment results in a better prognosis.
