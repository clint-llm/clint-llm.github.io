Failure to relieve the pressure in time can lead to tissue death in the affected compartment.

The most common complication is Volkmann ischemic contracture, an irreversible muscle contracture in the forearm, wrist, and hand resulting from muscle damage and necrosis. Patients usually present with particular clinical features, including elbow flexion, forearm pronation, wrist flexion, thumb adduction, metacarpophalangeal joints extension, and interphalangeal joints flexion. Volkmann contracture can be classified using the Tsuge classification into mild (when only finger flexor muscles are affected), moderate (when wrist and finger flexors are affected), and severe (when wrist, finger flexors, and extensors are all affected). Treatment options for this condition range from dynamic splinting to excision of necrotic tissue and tendon transfers.

Other complications include nerve damage, gangrene, chronic regional pain syndrome, and rhabdomyolysis, potentially leading to kidney failure. Rhabdomyolysis has been reported in up to 23% of cases diagnosed with acute compartment syndrome in general. Rhabdomyolysis presents clinically as a triad of symptoms, including muscle stiffness, muscle pain (particularly back pain), and poor urine output or dark-colored urine.
