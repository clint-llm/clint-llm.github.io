Patent foramen ovale is typically asymptomatic. It has been associated with migraine with aura and cryptogenic stroke, though the evidence for this is conflicting

The dive profile in which right-to-left shunt is most likely to be implicated in decompression sickness is one that is provocative enough to evoke silent venous gas emboli, uneventfully follows an established decompression protocol, is without other known risk factors*, and produces sudden-onset severe decompression sickness symptoms.   More than one such episode increases the likelihood that a right-to-left shunt exists. When recommending patent foramen ovale testing and interpreting test results, the practitioner should remain mindful that patent foramen ovale is not the only source of AV shunting, as noted above. Patent foramen ovale testing is not indicated in divers who have suffered from only minor decompression sickness symptoms, for example, joint pain, swelling, and type 1 skin rash.

*Long, deep dives, aggressive decompression protocols, omitted decompression, rapid ascent, heavy work at depth, cold on decompression, and repetitive dives (especially over multiple days) are risk factors for decompression sickness.
