The lymphatic drainage of the periocular adnexa is primarily via the facial lymph nodes (infraorbital, buccinator, and malar groups). The lateral tissue drains into the superficial parotid group of lymph nodes (i.e., preauricular nodes), while the medial tissue drains into the submandibular nodes. This lymph further drains into the deep cervical lymph nodes along the internal jugular vein.

The infraorbital group of lymph nodes is in the infraorbital region, near the medial canthus, tear trough, or nasolabial fold. These lymph nodes collect lymph from the skin and subcutaneous tissues of the medial portion of the eyelids and the medial canthus. The buccinator group of lymph nodes, overlying the buccinator muscle, drains the lower eyelid. The malar group of lymph nodes is often superficial to the malar eminence and drains the eyelids, medial and lateral canthi, and conjunctiva (Figure 2).

The post-septal orbit was once thought to be devoid of robust lymphatic drainage. By double staining with 5â€™-nucleotidase and alkaline phosphatase and using conjunctival lymphatics as a control, Gausas et al. demonstrated the first evidence of numerous lymphatic capillaries in the lacrimal gland and the outer and middle layers of dura mater encapsulating the human optic nerve.
