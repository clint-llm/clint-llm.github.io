Enhancing healthcare outcomes for patients who receive implantable hearing devices is multifaceted and involves all healthcare team members. Physicians, audiologists, nurses, pharmacists, and other health professionals must consider implications on healthcare outcomes when treating patients with hearing loss since failure to adequately treat patients with hearing loss results in significant detriment to the patient and cost to society.

Multidisciplinary care for patients receiving implantable hearing devices is critical in the pre-operative and post-operative settings. Pre-operatively establishing appropriate goals and expectations is of vital importance. Post-operatively, the ongoing role of the audiologist is crucial for device programming, troubleshooting, and training the patient and families.
