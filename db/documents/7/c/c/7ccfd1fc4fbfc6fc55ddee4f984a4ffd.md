On Gross examination, clear cell carcinomas are solid and yellow cortical based lesions, which are interspersed with cystic changes, hemorrhage, and necrosis in varying amounts.

Nuclear morphology has been shown to form the basis of grading these tumors, with grading systems showing a gradual evolution from the 1970s to the present.

The World Health Organization/ International Society of urological pathology has introduced a grading system that is based on the nucleolar pathology of the tumor.

Multilocular cystic RCC is characterized by cystic lesion, lined by a single layer of clear to pale cells, with scant papillae and fibrous component, clearly demarcated from the cortical component by a fibrous capsule and lacking a solid element.
