Patients, particularly those with obstructive jaundice, will require complete blood count, basic chemistry panel, and a liver function test. Results may reveal an unspecific cholestatic pattern caused by bile obstruction requiring decompression. Ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT) are usually the initial imaging studies. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is considered more accurate thanÂ ultrasound (76%) and useful in differential diagnosis to detect histological neoplasia correctly (97%). EUS will provide a valuable tumor-stage description with invasion depth and local lymphadenopathy. CT has limitations in discriminating benign from malignant, but dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) and MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) can help assess disease extent more accurately and properly identify unresectable candidates with hepatoduodenal ligament invasion, vasculature encasement, and/or lymph node involvement.
