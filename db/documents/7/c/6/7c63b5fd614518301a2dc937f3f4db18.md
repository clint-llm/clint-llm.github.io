Several imaging modalities are available for helping establish the diagnosis of a giant cell tumor of bone. They include:

- Plain radiographs

- Computed tomography (CT)

- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

- Nuclear medicine

On imaging, GCTB tends to have four radiographic findings when located on a long bone. They are usually eccentric, have well defined nonsclerotic margins, and occur at closed growth plates and near the articular surface. Because of the tumor's tendency to metastasize to the lung, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends chest CT.

**X-ray and Computed tomography scan (CT):**

On plain radiography and CT, a GCTB appears as a lytic lesion with well-defined, nonsclerotic margins. It is usually eccentric and occurs at the metaphysis.

**Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):**

On MRI, GCTB have low to intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images, heterogenous high signal intensity on T2, and demonstrates enhancement.

**Nuclear medicine:**

Studies using Technetium 99m scintigraphy demonstrates increased radiotracer on delayed images, most prominent in the periphery, while central regions are photopenic.
