Patients who undergo open carpal tunnel release have good to excellent long-term outcomes after a carpal tunnel release 70% to 90% of the time. Diabetes does not appear to affect outcomes of carpal tunnel release despite being a risk factor for the development of carpal tunnel.

Patients who are diagnosed with pronator teres syndrome requiring nerveÂ release typically return to full duty in 6 weeks. If tendon transfers are required, return to full duty is delayed to 10 to 12 weeks.
