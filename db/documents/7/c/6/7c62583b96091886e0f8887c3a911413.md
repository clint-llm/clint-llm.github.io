Electroencephalogram (EEG)- an EEG is useful in detecting the origin of seizure activity. In some cases, it may predict whether seizures will be controlled or uncontrolled. EEG may be normal once the seizure has been resolved. EEG can be video recorded while the patients are exposed to stressors such as sleep deprivation, light stimulation, and hyperventilation to induce seizure activity in a controlled environment. Interictal spikes seen on the EEG at a focal site are suggestive of epilepsy. A drawback to scalp EEG is that if the seizure activity is generated from deeper areas within the brain, a more invasive procedure is required. A neurosurgical procedure is necessary to place intracranial electrodes in targeted areas.

Imaging studies to identify structural causes:

- Computed tomography scan of the head with and without contrast

- Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence

- Interictal positron emission tomography (PET)

- Ictal single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT)

Cardiac workup with an electrocardiogram (EKG) and Holter monitor.

Laboratory analysis includes complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, drug screen, blood alcohol level, toxin screen, and thyroid panel.

Consultations with neurologists, psychologists/psychiatrists, and social workers for an interdisciplinary team approach.
