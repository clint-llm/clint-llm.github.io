As mentioned above, practitioners in the United States do not administer heroin in any sanctioned healthcare setting. Illicitly, people misuse heroin via subcutaneous, intranasal, intramuscular, intravenous methods. Heroin is highly lipophilic and, therefore, rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier.

Once absorbed into the serum, heroin reaches the brain in 15 to 20 seconds. While less than 5% of intravenous morphine reaches the brain, 68% of intravenous heroin makes contact withÂ receptors in the brain. This rapid effect gives the user a rush that typically leads to continued use with hopes of achieving that same first experience of euphoria.
