The musculocutaneous nerve arises from C5 and C6 spinal nerves. It innervates all the muscles of the arm anteriorly, enabling motor functions such as flexion of the elbow and supination by the biceps brachii.

The axillary nerve is the result of the network of C5 and C6 spinal nerves, which arise toward the deltoid muscle allowing for abduction; and the teres minor allowing forÂ external rotation of the shoulder.

Collateral nerves of the brachial plexus include the following

- Dorsal scapular nerve innervating the rhomboids

- Long thoracic nerve innervating the serratus anterior

- Suprascapular nerve innervating the supraspinatus and infraspinatus

- Lateral pectoral nerve innervating the pectoralis major

- Medial pectoral nerve innervating both pectoralis major and minor

- Upper subscapular nerve innervating the subscapularis

- Lower subscapular nerve innervating the subscapularis and teres major

- Thoracodorsal nerve innervating the latissimus dorsi

- Medial brachial cutaneous nerve innervating the skin of the arm medially

- Medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve innervating the skin of the forearm medially

The long thoracic nerve is known for allowing the protraction and superior rotation of the scapula, while the suprascapular nerve allows for shoulder abduction (by the supraspinatus muscle) and lateral rotation of the shoulder (by the infraspinatus muscle).
