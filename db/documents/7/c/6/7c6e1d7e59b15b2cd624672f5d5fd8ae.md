Patients with Dowling-Degos disease describe an abnormal darkening of the skin in their body folds and creases. Occasionally, patients report associated pruritus in these areas. On exam, reticulatedÂ hyperpigmentation is seen in intertriginous areas and is composed of lentigo-like brown macules and small brown papules with variable hyperkeratosis. The hyperpigmentation progressively increases over time, first arising in the axilla and groin and subsequently appearing in the intergluteal and inframammary folds, neck, trunk, and inner arms and thighs.

Comedone-like lesions on the back and neck, pitted perioral scars, and rarely palmar pits may also be present, especially in patients with an overlap of classic DDD and reticulate acropigmentation of Kitamura.
