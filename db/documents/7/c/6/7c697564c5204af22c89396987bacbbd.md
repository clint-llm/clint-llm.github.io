Cimetidine is available as an oral tablet and solution. The drug can also be administered parenterally as an intravenous (IV) injection. The recommended dosage of cimetidine for the pediatric patient is 20 to 40 mg/kg/day administered in divided doses every 6 hours (5 to 10 mg for neonates and 10 to 20 mg for infants; both divided every 6 to 8 hours also). The recommended dosage for treating peptic ulcers in adults is 300 to 400 mg twice daily or 800 mg at bedtime for up to eight weeks. The maintenance dosage of cimetidine is 400 mg per day. Dosages of 200 to 400 mg (OTC formulations) per day can effectively manage or prevent heartburn caused by the intake of caffeine and certain foods. Thus, cimetidine is optimally administered thirty minutes before a meal.
