Systolic blood pressure (SBP) increases progressively into the ninth decade of life. Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) increases into the mid-50s, after which it begins to decline, resulting in increased pulse pressure. The decrease in DBP seems due to large artery stiffness, resulting in less aortic blood volume and less elastic recoil in diastole.

Due to the aging population, obesity epidemic, and increasing adoption of sedentary lifestyles, the prevalence of HTN will continue to rise. By 2025, it is estimated that the number of people with HTN will increase to nearly 1.5 billion people worldwide.
