The diagnosis of pneumoconiosis is usually determined by radiologic evidence and history. A biopsy is rarely needed. Overall, a radiological review of pneumoconiosis demonstrates widespread opacities throughout the lung, but predominantly in the upper zones of both lungs.

Coal worker pneumoconiosis biopsies show coal macules and progressive massive fibrosis. The fibrosis is characterized by 1cm of fibrotic mass with anthracosis. These macules contain pigment laden macrophages in the bronchioles. Coal macules can range in size from 1 to 5mm but have dark pigmentation lacking fibrotic tissue.

The presence of asbestos bodies characterizes histopathologic analysis of asbestosis, a single asbestosis fiber coated in segmented protein-iron in intra-alveolar macrophages. Radiologically, asbestosis is similar to other diffuse interstitialÂ pulmonary fibrosis. Chest radiographs are characterized by small irregular opacities with a fine reticular pattern.
