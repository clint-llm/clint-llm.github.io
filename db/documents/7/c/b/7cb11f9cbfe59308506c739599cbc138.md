The best depiction of the mechanism of the Frank-Starling relationship is the length-tension relationship (image 1) established by Gordon et al. in 1966. Image 1 illustrates that the active tension generated by muscle contraction is a function of the passive tension provided by stretching the myofibrils.

- Increasing sarcomere length leads to an increased affinity of troponin for calcium, which facilitates the interaction of actin and myosin.

- Stretching the myocytes leads to decreased interfilament lattice spacing, which brings actin and myosin closer together.

- Stretch causes titin to reduce lattice space and change cross-bridge orientation.

- Calcium-binding to troponin induces conformational changes in the troponin-tropomyosin complex allowing stretch-dependent activation.

- Stretching induces cooperativity in which initial cross-bridge formation potentiates further binding leading to increased active tension for any given calcium concentration.
