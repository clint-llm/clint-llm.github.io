Preparation for lung transplantation includes the following:

- Pre-anesthetic work-up which includes routine blood work, electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram and other radiological and diagnostic procedures, history and physical examination

- Consent for lung transplant surgery

- When a donor is identified, lung allocation follows an established algorithm based initially on donor age (pediatric vs adult) and location of the donor hospital. Donor's lungs are then allocated to candidates with the appropriate blood type and size. In the waitlisted patients, the donor organ is then allocated to the patient with the highest lung allocation score (LAS). The LAS prioritizes patients based on medical urgency and the likelihood of benefiting from the transplant procedure.

- Pre-operatively, the patient is transferred to the Intensive Critical Care Unit (ICC) to prepare for surgery.

- Certain patients with very severe disease are bridged to lung transplant using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

- Donor lung images and investigations, as well as the cause of death, are reviewed prior to accepting the organs for harvestation.

- At the donor hospital site, the lung is re-evaluated by bronchoscopy, physical examination after opening the chest, and arterial blood gases from all four individual pulmonary veins prior to accepting them for transplantation.
