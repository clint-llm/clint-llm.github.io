The presentation of patients with deficiency of 5α-RD2 can be varying. This condition is an autosomal recessive disorder of sex development associated with the mutation in the SRD5A2 gene. There has been no direct association seen between the phenotype and the genotype in this disorder. Two individuals with the same gene defects in SRD5A2 can present with completely different phenotypes, which clearly shows that there are other additional genes that probably control the phenotype along with the gene under discussion.

The newborns might have genitalia resembling labia majora, which in reality would be unfused labioscrotal folds. The phallus in these children may look more like a clitoris than a penis.

**Gender Identity Problems in Children with 5 Alpha-RD2 Deficiency**

Although some children with this enzyme deficiency are raised as girls, many would change their gender to males at puberty after virilization. There are multiple factors like the culture and environmental pressures which can influence the gender changes in these children, but the most significant factor responsible for the gender change is the exposure of the child's brain to androgen, including testosterone, and not to the female sex hormone. A brain exposed to androgens will develop more masculine behavior and influences the child to identify itself as a male child rather than a female.
