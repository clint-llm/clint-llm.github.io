In contrast to lasers, IPL devices produce noncoherent, polychromatic light with a broad range of wavelengths. Their fluence, pulse duration, spot size, and filter type can be adjusted for the goal of targeting specific chromophores. Thus, IPL devices can treat a wide variety of lesions and skin types. Lesion clearance often depends on the frequency of treatment sessions as the effect of pulsed light is cumulative, routinely requiring 3 to 6 treatments every 2 to 4 weeks for the full clinical effect to be achieved.
