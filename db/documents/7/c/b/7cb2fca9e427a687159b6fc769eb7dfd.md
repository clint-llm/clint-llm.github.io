Patients receiving thrombolytic therapy must undergo a constant neurologic and cardiovascular evaluation with blood pressure monitoring every 15 minutes during and after tPA infusion for at least 2 hours, then half-hourly for 6 hours and hourly for the next 16 hours after injection. Strict BP monitoring is essential to prevent complications. Clinicians should stop thrombolytic therapy urgently with any signs of neurologic deterioration, and the patient should receive an emergency computed tomography (CT). Cardiac monitoring is required due to the risk of reperfusion arrhythmias.

Fibrinolytic agents or anticoagulants must be stopped immediately with any evidence of bleeding complications in a patient with ongoing fibrinolytic therapy. In the next step, supportive measures should be instituted, including volume correction and blood factor transfusion. If the patient is also on concomitant heparin, protamine sulfate can reverse the heparin effect.
