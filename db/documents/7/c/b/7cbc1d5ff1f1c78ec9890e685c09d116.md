In most patients with IgA nephropathy, history and examination would be unremarkable. The most common complaint is gross hematuria. Acute renal failure may cause ankle edema, facial puffiness, and hypertension. Frothy urine may be present. A history of upper respiratory tract infections, such as pharyngitis, may be present just before hematuria.

Physical examination should include checking for blood pressure and looking for signs of reduced renal function, such as edema, ascites, and lung basal crepitations. In addition, IgA nephropathy may coexist with cirrhosis, liver diseases, and celiac disease. Therefore, relevant general examination and abdominal examination should be done to exclude these clinically.

The range of clinical features of IgA nephropathy is broad, from asymptomatic hematuria to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. The mode of presentation differs according to age group and biopsy patterns. The two most common clinical phenotypes are:

- Asymptomatic hematuria

- Progressive kidney disease

Asymptomatic hematuria with mild proteinuria, such as 0.5 g/day, may be picked up on screening programs. A proportion of patients with isolated microscopic hematuria and mild proteinuria will ultimately develop significant proteinuria and hypertension, suggesting that long-term follow-up should be instituted.

Less frequent manifestations include synpharyngitic macroscopic hematuria, which is a classic clinical syndrome seen as the first presentation of IgA nephropathy. Gross hematuria, in combination with pharyngitis or other infection, prompts patients to seek immediate medical attention. Recurrent macroscopic hematuria is also seen. Although nephrotic-range proteinuria is not uncommon in IgA nephropathy, they rarely coexist.
