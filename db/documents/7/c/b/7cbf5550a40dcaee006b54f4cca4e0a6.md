Angiosarcoma is rare cancer and hence the data is scarce to drive evidence-based decision making. Despite that, certain approaches have shown clear benefits.

- History of RT, chronic lymphedema, and exposure to chemicals like vinyl chloride have been linked with the development of AS.

- Multidisciplinary tumor board discussion is a must for any patient diagnosed with angiosarcoma.

- R0 resection with perioperative RT is the best approach for local control of the disease.

- A combination of paclitaxel with RT has been demonstrated to achieve durable responses in patients with cutaneous AS.

- Weekly paclitaxel as a first-line treatment for AS has comparative efficacy to anthracycline-based regimens in patients with AS.

- Targeted therapy with anti-VEGF and anti-PDGFRA drugs has not to be proven to be beneficial over conventional chemotherapy, although did add to the toxicity of the regimen.

- Immune checkpoint inhibitors are currently being explored as a potential option for the treatment of AS.
