Tricuspid valve regurgitation and stenosis are rare valvular heart diseases. Both can be treated medically but often require more invasive intervention such as surgical repair of the valve. Percutaneous intervention, or transcatheter valve repair, has become a more popular method than surgery for nonsurgical candidates in recent years. Over the last several years, percutaneous intervention on the aortic and mitral valve has helped to look for more percutaneous ways to repair the cardiac valves.

Tricuspid valve disease can result primarily from structural changes or secondarily from myocardial, pulmonary, or other valvular diseases. Tricuspid regurgitation is most often well-tolerated in the mild to moderate stages but will lead to decreased cardiac output, central venous hypertension leading to hepatic congestion, and eventually death in the later stages if left untreated.
