Fibromyalgia is not only a difficult disorder to diagnose but its treatment is not satisfactory. To make matters worse, the patients are also difficult and constantly searching for new providers to prescribe them pain and other controlled substances. The condition is best managed by an interprofessional team dedicate to pain management and should include the primary care physician, physicianÂ assistant, pain specialist, internist, mental health nurse, and nurse practitioner.

Since there is no cure for the disorder, it is important for the clinicians to educate the patient on limiting the triggers. Besides reducing stress, the patients should improve sleep, eat a healthy diet, enroll in an exercise program and join support groups.

It is equally important that they utilize the resources available in the community like physical exercise programs and relaxation programs. Psychosocial interventions like CBT can be useful in patients with inadequate responses. Referral to a physiatrist and/or a physical therapist is helpful in these patients. Specialty consultations which include consultations for rheumatologists and psychiatrists are also recommended in patients not responding adequately to initial therapies.

The pharmacist should educate the patient on the harms of opioids and encourage other methods of pain control. The key is to develop a trusting relationship with the patient so that compliance is maintained with treatments.

The nurse should encourage the patient to quit smoking and abstain from alcohol and caffeine. A dietitian should recommend healthy foods and the need to maintain a healthy weight. Finally, clinicians should refrain from being critical of alternative healthcare; if it works and is not harmful, the patient should be encouraged to participate.

A coordinated interprofessional team approach including physicians, mid-level practitioners, nursing staff, and where needed, pharmacists and physical therapists will produce the best results. [Level 5]
