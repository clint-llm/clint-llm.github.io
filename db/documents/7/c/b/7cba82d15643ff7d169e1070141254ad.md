Subclinical hypothyroidism and hypothyroidism share the same etiologies. Worldwide iodine deficiency is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. However, in the United States, autoimmune thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. Other causes include post-surgical or post-ablative hypothyroidism, central hypothyroidism, and medication-induced hypothyroidism.
