Approach to management should start with supporting the airway, breathing, and circulation. If the patient is unstable, they should immediately be placed on a cardiac monitor with supplemental oxygen, with two large-bore IVs placed. Endotracheal intubation is necessary if the patient is unable to protect their airway due to depressed mental status.

There is no specific antidote to iodine poisoning; therefore, management is largely supportive. If the patient is stable, alert, and protecting their airway, activated charcoal should be given to decontaminate the gastrointestinal tract.
