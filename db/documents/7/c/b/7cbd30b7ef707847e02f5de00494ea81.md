Uveitic macular edema needs to be differentiated from other causes of edema in case of uveitis. These are uveitis secondary to a choroidal neovascular membrane, underlying active choroiditis lesion, and secondary to disc edema. Traction due to the epiretinal membrane or vitreous traction can also lead to edema. The OCT is used for diagnosisÂ as management is surgical.
