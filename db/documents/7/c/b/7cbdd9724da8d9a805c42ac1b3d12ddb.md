Felbamate is an anti-epileptic drug (AED) approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1993 to manage focal seizures and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.Â Several small class III studies have suggested felbamate may be an effective treatment for absence seizures, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and infantile spasms.

Felbamate's approval for focal seizures had its basis in trials which showed it was an effective monotherapy and add-on therapy to phenytoin and carbamazepine for patients with uncontrolled focal epilepsy

A major multicenter trial in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) led to its approval for LGS.

Roughly 4000 patients had exposure to felbamate prior to approval.
