Remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent that has previously demonstrated antiviral activity against filoviruses (Ebola viruses, Marburg virus), coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-Co-V, SARS-CoV-2), paramyxoviruses (parainfluenza type III virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, measles, and mumps virus), and Pnemoviridae (respiratory syncytial virus).

**FDA Approved Indication (with clinical trial summaries)**

- Adults and pediatric patients (over age ≥ 28 days and weighing  ≥ 3 kgs or more) with a laboratory-confirmed positive  SARS-CoV-2 test who ARE hospitalized patients OR in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are non-hospitalized but are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death
            
              
- Results of a randomized, open-label trial of hospitalized patients admitted with moderate COVID-19 illness who were randomized to receive a 10-day course of remdesivir(n=197), a 5-day course of remdesivir(n=199), or standard of care(n=200) reported that patient is receiving the 10-day course of remdesivir did not have a statistically significant difference in clinical status compared to patients receiving standard of care. 
              
              
- However, patients randomized to a 5-day course of remdesivir had a statistically significant difference in the clinical status compared to the standard of care.
              
              
- Final results of another double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of remdesivir in hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 pneumonia demonstrated that remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to clinical recovery.
              
              
- However, results from the WHO Solidarity Trial conducted at 405 hospitals spanning 40 countries involving 11,330 inpatients with COVID-19 who were randomized to receive remdesivir (2750), hydroxychloroquine(954), lopinavir(1411), and interferon regimens(2063), and no trial drug(4088) reported that remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and interferon regimens had little or no effect on overall mortality, initiation of mechanical ventilation, and length of hospital stay.
              
              
- Based on the encouraging data from three randomized, controlled clinical trials that evaluated the clinical efficacy of remdesivir in patients hospitalized with mild-to-severe COVID-19, the US Food and Drug Administration(FDA) approved remdesivir for treatment in adults and pediatric patients with COVID-19.

- The latest National Institutes of Health (NIH) Covid-19 treatment guidelines panel recommends the use of either remdesivir alone or dexamethasone plus remdesivir or dexamethasone alone if combination therapy (remdesivir and dexamethasone) is not available in hospitalized patients who require supplemental oxygen but are not receiving HFNC or NIPPV or IMV or ECMO.

**Pertinent studies against SARS-CoV-2 variants and ongoing trials/information**

- The efficacy of remdesivir alone or in combination with other drugs has not been evaluated in the SARS-CoV-2 variants- UK variant **(B.1.1.7 lineage/VOC 202012/01)**, South African variant**(B.1.351 lineage/501Y.V2)**, Brazil variant**(B.1.1.248/B1.1.28/P1/501Y.V3)**and the Californian variant**(B.1.427/B.1.429)**lineage and clinical trials are ongoing. However, as with any other antiviral drug, there is always a concern about acquiring resistance against mutant viruses.

- The clinical efficacy and safety of remdesivir combined with tocilizumab compared with remdesivir with placebo in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 illness; combination therapy did not reduce the time to hospital discharge or "ready for discharge" by day 28 compared with placebo plus remdesivir in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

- Remdesiivr has demonstrated in vitro antiviral activity against the omicron variant **(B.1.1.529)**.
