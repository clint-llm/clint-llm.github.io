Pneumothorax is when air collects in between the parietal and viscera pleurae resulting in lung collapse. It can happen secondary to trauma (traumatic pneumothorax). When mediastinal shifts accompany it, it is called a tension pneumothorax. This is a life-threatening emergency that needs urgent management. Early recognition of this condition is life-saving both outside the hospital and in modern ITUs. Knowledge of necessary emergency thoracic decompression procedures is essential for all healthcare professionals. This activity reviews the presentation of tension and traumatic pneumothoraces, outlines evaluation and management strategies, and highlights the importance of early intervention and the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of tension pneumothorax.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation of tension pneumothorax.
- Review the management options available for tension pneumothorax.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to provide the best outcomes for patients with tension pneumothorax.
