Urinary retention is a common urological condition that will frequently be encountered by clinicians, nurses, and physicianÂ assistants. Pharmacists may be the first to discover it as a side effect of a medication. It is particularly common in those who treat the elderly. Recognizing post-obstructive diuresis is critical because the condition can occur in up to 50% of these patients and may progress to the potentially dangerous pathological form which can be life-threatening if not identified and treated properly. Resolution often requires a Foley catheter and an interprofessional team to provide insertion and care until the condition resolves. [Level V]
