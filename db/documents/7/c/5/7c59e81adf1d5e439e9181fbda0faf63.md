There are few studies on discitis and other infections of the spinal column due to the rarity of the disease and usually delayed diagnosis. Early recognition is ideal and provides patients the best outcome. Healthcare providers including nurse practitioners, emergency department physicians, orthopedic surgeons, and rheumatologists must, therefore, be aware of the broad differential of back pain, and presentations of different age groups, including children and neonates, given the predilection of disease in that age group. Appropriate consultations should be ordered, especially when systems persist without a confirmed diagnosis. Overall management includes all of the above specialists in an interprofessional team approach, along with specialty-trained nursing for pediatric and infectious disease as appropriate, and infectious disease pharmacy specialists.
