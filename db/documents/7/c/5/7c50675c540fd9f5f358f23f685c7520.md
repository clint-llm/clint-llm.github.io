Dysphonia is the impairment of voice production as diagnosed by a clinician, often used interchangeably with the complaint of hoarseness, which is a symptom of altered voice quality. While many patients experience dysphonia as a natural part of the aging process, it can be a symptom of a serious underlying condition. Clinicians need to recognize that when patients present with dysphonia for longer than four weeks and/or when it is associated with risk factors or other concerning signs and symptoms, further evaluation is warranted.
