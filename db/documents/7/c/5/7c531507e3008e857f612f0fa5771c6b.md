Vohwinkel syndrome, also known as keratoderma hereditarian mutilans, is classified as a type of hereditary palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK). Classically, it is associated with starfish keratoses on the knuckles, PPK in a honeycomb pattern, hearing impairment, and pseudoainhum, mutilating digital constriction bands that often lead to autoamputation of affected digits. This activity describes the treatment and management of Vohwinkel syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiology of Vohwinkel syndrome.
- Outline the common physical exam findings associated with Vohwinkel syndrome.
- Review the treatment options available for managing Vohwinkel syndrome.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration among the interprofessional team to optimize the care for patients affected by Vohwinkel syndrome.
