Demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis and Guillain-Barre syndrome have a progressive and devastating effect on affected patients. There has not been an approved treatment to reverse the demyelinating process in these diseases. However, there is an array of medications that can be used to slow the progression and to treat the symptoms that may arise from them. That said, these medications are not without potential shortfalls and side-effects. For example, beta interferons are commonly prescribed to the patients to help slow the progression of disease in multiple sclerosis. However, the use of beta interferons have been shown to induce flu-like symptoms as well as liver damage, but it is still widely used in many patients due to the therapeutic effects of the drug outweighing its potential adverse side-effects.
