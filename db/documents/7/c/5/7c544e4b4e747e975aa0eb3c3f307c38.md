The femoral artery nourishes the quadriceps muscle. It represents the continuation of the external iliac artery (behind the inguinal ligament). It descends in the anteromedial portion of the thigh to the ring of the adductor channel, where it becomes a popliteal artery. It is possible to imagine the femoral artery as a straight line connecting the center of the inguinal canal to the posterior portion of the medial condyle of the femur. Among its most important branches for the quadriceps muscle, we mention the superficial and deep femoral artery.

The femoral vein is the continuation of the popliteal vein, to arrive, following the path of the femoral artery, up to the inguinal ligament, and become the external iliac vein.

The lymphatic vessels of the lower limb reach the lumbar aortic lymph nodes, which are part of the right and left lumbar trunks; drainage will reach the cisterna chyli.
