Hand injuries constitute approximately 20% of emergency room visits.

Dependent upon the severity and degree of laceration, patients may present with loss of active digital flexion or painful digital flexion. Decreased or absent digital sensibility and motor strength can also be appreciated. Closed injuries associated with loss of finger motion often present with a loss of distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint movement following injury. A painful nodule in the region of tendon retraction may be appreciated in patients with closed tendon avulsion injuries. Flexor tendon injuries occur in greater prevalence within zones II-V, most commonly in the index or small finger.
