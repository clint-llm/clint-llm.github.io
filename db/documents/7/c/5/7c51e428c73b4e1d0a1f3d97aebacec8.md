The halo vest immobilizer (HVI) is a device that restrains the cranium to the torso for both adult and pediatric patients. This device provides the most rigid form of external immobilization for the upper cervical spine (occipitocervical and atlantoaxial junction). When compared to conventional cervical orthoses (CO), it is the best choice for immobilizing the upper cervical spine since it can restrict atlantoaxial joint flexion-extension by 75% versus only 45%, respectively.

Examples for definitive treatment are occipital condyle fractures, occipitocervical dislocation, C1 (most common), and C2 fractures, with an anticipated average healing time of 3Â to 4 months.
