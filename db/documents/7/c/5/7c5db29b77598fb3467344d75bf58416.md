Overall, dysphagia increases the morbidity and mortality of patients. Therefore, dysphagia must be diagnosed and managed early to maintain the best possible quality of life for the individuals concerned. By making a prompt diagnosis and identifying the cause, healthcare professionals can personalize management to the individual patient.

Speech and language therapists will determine the abnormal stage(s) of a swallow and can make suggestions to the clinical team/carers/patient themselves. Management plans can include: advising that the patient becomes ‘Nil by Mouth’ and fed via a tube, e.g., nasogastric tubes or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, requesting the patient avoid food of certain consistencies, e.g., ‘soft diet only’ or using maneuvers when eating.

Interprofessional healthcare team members need to keep up to date with the latest guidelines and skillsets required to manage patients presenting with swallowing disorders. The American Board of Swallowing and Swallowing Disorders provides specialty certification. Speech and language pathologists/therapists have expertise in assessing, diagnosing, and managing individuals with dysphagia and work inter-professionally with dieticians, radiologists, nurses, doctors, and carers to improve the quality of life and minimize risk.
