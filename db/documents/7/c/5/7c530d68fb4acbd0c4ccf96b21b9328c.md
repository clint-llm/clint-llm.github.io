The approximate rates of the most common postoperative surgical complications are as follows.

**Biceps Tenotomy**

- Cosmetic (“Popeye”) deformity

- 
              
- Reported rates during follow-up: 10% to 70%
              
              
- Rates of patient dissatisfaction secondary to the deformity: Less than 5% to 10%

- Muscle spasm/cramping: 15% to 25%

- Biceps pain: 10% to 20%

- Residual weakness:

- 
              
- Mild: Up to 30%
              
              
- Moderate to severe: 10% to 15%

**Biceps Tenodesis**

- Residual anterior shoulder/groove pain:

- 
              
- Currently heavily debated in the literature. Previous reports have documented as high as a 45% revision surgery rate for residual biceps/groove pain following biceps tenodesis
              
              
- A 2015 study from Burkhart and colleagues contrasted previous reports suggesting high revision surgery rates and postoperative persistent/residual groove pain following tenodesis procedures. Burkhart's study was a retrospective multicenter study that reported follow-up results from 7 different surgeons performing an all-arthroscopic biceps tenodesis procedure
              
              
- 
                  
- 1083 patients, mean follow-up of 136 weeks
                  
                  
- Revision surgery rate: 4.1%
                  
                  
- Revision related to complications or symptoms attributed to the actual biceps tenodesis: 0.4%

- Cosmetic (“Popeye”) deformity: 5% to 10%

- Muscle spasm/cramping: 5% to 10%

- Biceps pain: 5% to 10%
