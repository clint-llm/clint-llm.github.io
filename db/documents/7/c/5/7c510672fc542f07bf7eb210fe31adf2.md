Parkinsonism prognosis is highly dependent on the cause and its potential for reversibility, and some other prognostic factors, like the age of onset of symptoms.

Late-onset PD may have a faster progression rate and earlier cognitive dysfunction. On average, PD has a duration of ten years. Individuals have a shortened life expectancy. Early initiation of therapy can help to increase life expectancy.

Other causes of parkinsonism also have a quicker onset and progression.
