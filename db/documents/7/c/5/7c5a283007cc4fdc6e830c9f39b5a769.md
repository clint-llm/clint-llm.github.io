The history and physical examination may be unhelpful in idiopathic polyhydramnios cases, usually discovered incidentally. For pregnant women with clinical symptoms consistent with or ultrasound findings diagnostic of polyhydramnios, the history obtained should focus on risk factors for polyhydramnios. Screening is recommended for impaired glucose intolerance, sexually transmitted diseases, congenital infections, maternal or fetal anemia, and alloimmunization. Evaluating the persistent decreased maternal perception of fetal movements may prompt a further workup for neurologic conditions that cause decreased neuromuscular function.

Clinical examination findings in symptomatic patients with severe polyhydramnios include the tightness of the maternal abdomen and swelling of the lower extremities. A fundal height three centimeters above the expected gestational age or rapid uterine enlargement warrants fetal growth assessment and fluid assessment to rule out macrosomia or polyhydramnios. In the context of fetal growth scans using ultrasound to evaluate other pregnancy-related conditions, the diagnosis of polyhydramnios is often made.
