Alginate impressions play a key role in daily dental practice due to their easy manipulation, fast set times, and affordable price. Understanding the properties, mode of setting, and manipulation of dental alginates is essential to achieve correct and predictable impressions, translating into good dental casts and avoiding the need to repeat the impression. Furthermore, decontaminating and disinfecting dental impressions to decrease the risk of cross-contamination must be emphasized. The selection of the appropriate disinfection method is dictated by the properties of the material, namely imbibition, syneresis, and evaporation.Â Thorough knowledge of the mechanical properties of alginates enables clinicians to selectively utilize these materials to optimize outcomes.
