Ulnar collateral injuries of the thumb are common.  These injuries can range from a mild sprain, partial to complete ligamentous tear.  Avulsed fragments from the proximal phalanx can also be present.

Full-thickness ruptures are further characterized as being non-displaced or displaced.

This distinction is important because the relationship of the displaced torn UCL ligament to the aponeurosis of the adductor pollicis muscle has clinical implications.

The primary function of the UCL of the thumb is to create ulnar stability of the MCP joint and acts as a counterbalance to any force directed radially during a forceful grasp.  The UCL is made up of the proper collateral ligament (PCL) and the accessory collateral ligament.

A stener lesion occurs when there is forceful abduction of the thumb, leading to avulsion of the distal ulnar collateral ligament from its insertion at the base of the proximal phalanx of the thumb. The severed end of the tendon then become entangled in the adductor aponeurosis and unable to return to its normal anatomical position. This leads to an unstable thumb that is often seen in skiers and gamekeepers.
