The formation of somite begins as the paraxial mesoderm starts to spiral into an organized cell called somitomere. These somitomeres cluster together by epithelium and separate from the presomitic paraxial mesoderm to form individual somites. The differentiation in somite forms the cartilage of the vertebrae, ribs, the muscle of the rib cage, limb and even dermis of the skin.
