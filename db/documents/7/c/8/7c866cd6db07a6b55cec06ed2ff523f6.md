**Erythropoiesis**

Red blood cells are produced in bone marrow with the help of nutrients (iron, B12, folic acid), cytokines, erythroid-specific GF, and EPO (erythropoietin, produced by kidneys). Once RBCs are released into the blood, they have a lifespan of about 110 to 120 days. Approximately 1% of RBCs are removed every day from the circulation. Under normal conditions, there is a balance between the number of RBCs released into circulation by the bone marrow to the number removed from circulation. Imbalance of production and release by the bone marrow to loss of RBC leads to anemia as below.

**Decreased Red Blood Cell Production**

- Lack of nutrients (malnutrition and malabsorption)

- Bone marrow problems (suppression and lack of RBC precursors)

- Lack of hormones (CKD, hypothyroidism)

- Ineffective erythropoiesis (defective RBC production)

**Increased Red Blood Cell Destruction (Hemolytic Anemia)**

Inherited hemolytic anemia

- Sickle cell anemia

- Thalassemia

- Hereditary spherocytosis and elliptocytosis

- G6PD deficiency

- Pyruvate kinase deficiency

Acquired
 hemolytic anemia

- Immune hemolytic anemia

- Mechanical hemolytic anemia

- Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria

**Blood Loss**

- Gastrointestinal

- Menstrual cycles (menorrhagia)

- Surgery

- Trauma

Some conditions can cause anemia by over one mechanism (two or even all the three mechanisms).

Anemia of chronic disease is a common form of anemia seen in hospitalized patients caused by long-standing diseases, infections, inflammations, and malignancies. These chronic conditions cause increased production of hepcidin
