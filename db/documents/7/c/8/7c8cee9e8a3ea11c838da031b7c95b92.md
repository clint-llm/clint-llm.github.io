Perichondritis of the pinna is inflammation of the perichondrial layer surrounding the cartilage of the ear. Penetrating trauma to the ear, such as transcartilagenous high ear piercings, is the commonest cause of perichondritis. Non-medical practitioners carry out the majority of ear piercings, and if sterile conditions are not maintained, this can precipitate infection.

If the infection is neglected, an abscess can form, which causes perichondrial elevation from the cartilage, resulting in devascularisation. This will cause necrosis and alteration to the shape of the pinna. If blood collects in this space, it may organize and form hard scar tissue, giving the appearance of a cauliflower ear. It can also progress to a serious soft tissue or systemic infection if left untreated.
