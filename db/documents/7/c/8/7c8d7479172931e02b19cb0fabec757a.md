Striae are a form of dermal scarring associated with stretching of the dermis. They often result from a rapid change in weight (gain and loss) or are associated with endogenous or exogenous corticosteroids. Proposed mechanisms relate to hormones, physical stretch, and structural alterations of dermal collagen and elastic tissue. Adrenocorticotropic hormones promote fibroblast activity and increase protein catabolism. Pregnancy-related hormones may also contribute. Serum relaxin has been described to be lower in women with striae distensae.
