The branches of the facial nerve (CN VII) are the most anatomically relevant nerves that lie in the vicinity of the SMAS and the facial muscles & associated fascial layers. The facial nerve exits the skull inferior to the tragus of the ear. The proximal branches of the facial nerve, primarily the temporal, zygomatic, and marginal mandibular nerves, course deep to the SMAS after exiting the parotid gland. Despite the anatomic disparity that exists, the superior masseteric retaining ligament and zygomatic ligament form a groove through which the upper zygomatic branch of the facial nerve traverses.

Another nerve of relevance to the SMAS is the greater auricular nerve. This nerve originates from the cervical plexus, passes inferiorly to traverse the sternocleidomastoid muscle about 6 cm inferior to the auditory canal, and runs just deep to the SMAS along the course of the external jugular vein.

The only nerves which traverse superficial to the SMAS are the sensory branches from the trigeminal nerve.
