Prognosis of untreated disease is dismal with death being invariable.

Among patients with Chagas disease, cardiomyopathy may occur in up to a third of infected patients and be devastating. Megaesophagus occurs less frequently, but when present,Â contributes tremendous morbidity. Treatment of the acute disease may result in a cure rate up to 80% and treatment with benznidazole may reduce the occurrence of ECG abnormalities and serological titers. The success of treating patients with chronic stage Chagas disease is uncertain.
