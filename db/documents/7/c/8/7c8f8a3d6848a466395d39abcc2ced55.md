In grade 1 and some grade 2a burns, the function of the esophagus usually recovers over time. Grade 2b and grade 3 burns may result in dense scar tissue leading to stricture formation. Strictures require long-term management, including dilations, stenting, and sometimes surgery. Poor prognosis is associated with grade 3 esophageal injury, systemic complications, or age greater than 65.
