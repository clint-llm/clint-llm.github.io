Physicians can suspect PAH based on clinical grounds. However, it is difficult to diagnose primary pulmonary hypertension based on history and exam alone because of the nonspecific presentation, and the signs and symptoms overlap with many heart and lung diseases. It is, therefore, important to exclude other possible causes of pulmonary hypertension.

Chest x-ray shows large central pulmonary arteries, right ventricular hypertrophy, clear lung fields. On ECG, there may be right ventricular hypertrophy with right atrial enlargement, right axis deviation, increased the amplitude of P wave due to right atrial enlargement (lead II). Echocardiography is the most sensitive test which helps assess the right ventricular size and pressure-volume overload. It also gives an estimate of pulmonary artery pressure. There is right atrial and ventricular enlargement, tricuspid regurgitation.

Arterial blood gas may reveal increased A-a gradient, low pO2. On pulmonary function test (PFT), impaired DLCO is seen. Perfusion lung scan (V/Q scan) to rule out pulmonary thromboembolism. Liver function tests, autoimmune tests, and HIV testing (in high-risk patients) exclude other possible causes.

Cardiac catheterization of the right heart to measure accurate pressures (at end-expiration) is the gold standard test. It measures pulmonary artery pressure, left ventricular filling pressure, and cardiac output. IPAH patients have high mean pulmonary artery pressures (greater than 25 mmHg at rest and greater than 30 mmHg with exercise) with normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (18 and below). Pericardial effusion confers poor prognosis.

The patients with pulmonary artery hypertension on cardiac catheterization should undergo vasoreactivity testing with short-acting pulmonary vasodilatory medications at the same time as cardiac catheterization. A decrease in the mean pulmonary artery pressure by at least 10 mmHg to reach an absolute value of 40 mmHg or less without a decrease in cardiac output. This is important as the patients who respond to these drugs can be treated with calcium channel blockers and have a more favorable prognosis.
