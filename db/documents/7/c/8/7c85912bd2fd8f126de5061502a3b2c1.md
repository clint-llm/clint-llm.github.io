Hemoptysis is the most common presentation, as well as a complication of pulmonary aspergilloma. It can turn into a massive fatal hemorrhage in 30% of patients.

Chronic mycetoma can induce inflammation in the surrounding parenchyma, thus developing a variable extent of pulmonary fibrosis.

Among extrapulmonary manifestations, CNS aspergilloma can be dreadful in its varied presentations as intracerebral abscess, meningitis, intra-aortic thrombosis, and mycotic aneurysm and even subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Cardiac aspergilloma, as reported so far, is also almost universally fatal.
