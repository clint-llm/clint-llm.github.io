There is no standardized treatment for Riedel thyroiditis due to the lack of outcome studies due to the rarity of the disease.

Surgery with subtotal or partial thyroidectomy is indicated only to relieve compressive symptoms. Due to the lack of tissue planes between the fibrotic and normal thyroid tissue, surgical extirpation of the fibrotic tissue is rendered difficult. Unfortunately, complication rates as high as 39% have been reported even with limited surgical interventions. The consensus is to use minimal surgical intervention for the relief of compressive symptoms.

Glucocorticoids are the mainstay of medical treatment. The anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids are most effective when used early in the disease process. There is no dosing guideline available; however, prednisone 15 mg to 100 mg daily has been shown to be effective in various reports. Response to the treatment is variable, with some cases showing dramatic improvement with a reversal of dysphonia and upper airway symptoms while others showed a complete lack of response. Nonresponse to glucocorticoids could be due to the increase in fibrosis seen in late disease compared with early disease, where inflammation is prominent.

Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) used in the treatment of Riedel thyroiditis and other systemic fibrosing disorders. It induces tumor growth factor-beta (TGF-ß), which is a potent growth inhibitor. A dose of 10-20 mg, given alone or in combination with prednisone, has been successful in decreasing the mass size.

Mycophenolate mofetil is an immunosuppressive agent with anti-fibrotic properties which has therapeutic use in systemic fibrosis. It converts to mycophenolic acid, which inhibits the antibody production from T and B lymphocytes. Levy et al. successfully used a combination of mycophenolate and prednisone in a case of Riedel thyroiditis not responsive to tamoxifen and prednisone; however, further studies are needed to assess the role of mycophenolate in the treatment of Riedel thyroiditis.
