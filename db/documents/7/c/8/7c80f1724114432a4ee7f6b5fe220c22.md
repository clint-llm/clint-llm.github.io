Methylxanthines are a purine-derived group of pharmacologic agents that have clinical use because of their bronchodilatory and stimulatory effects. This class includes several drugs, including the world’s most widely used caffeine. The FDA has approved the use of several methylxanthine derivatives for the treatment of reversible airway obstruction diseases such as chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma. However, it is worth noting that the new GOLD criteria for the treatment of COPD (released in 2018) relegated methylxanthines from its treatment algorithm due to an imbalance between benefits and side effect profile. Non-FDA approved indications currently include sleep apnea and infant apnea (due to theoretical benefits from bronchodilation), cardiogenic pulmonary, and anosmia (according to one 2008 study, they showed potential benefits in improving the sense of smell in anosmic patients).
