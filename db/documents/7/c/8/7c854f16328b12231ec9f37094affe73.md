Clinicians need to evaluate the severity of alcohol withdrawal based on history and clinical presentation. The best-validated tool to assess the severity of alcohol withdrawal is the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, Revised (CIWA-Ar). It is a 10-item questionnaire tool to evaluate, monitor, and treat alcohol withdrawal. It includes symptoms of withdrawal such as anxiety, nausea, and sweating, among others. A score of 8 points or lower corresponds to mild withdrawal, while a score of 9 to 15 corresponds to moderate withdrawal, and a score of 15 or greater corresponds to severe withdrawal symptoms, being at risk for seizures and DT.

Additional evaluation of a patient with DT involves identifying electrolyte, nutrition, and fluid abnormalities. Most of these patients present with severe dehydration (up to 10 L fluid deficit) and severe electrolyte abnormalities, including hypoglycemia and severe hypomagnesemia and hypophosphatemia. Multivitamins and thiamine should be supplemented before glucose is given to prevent or precipitate Wernicke’s encephalopathy.
