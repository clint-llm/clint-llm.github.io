A generally accepted model is a triple-risk model: SIDS occurs in infants with underlying vulnerability who undergo a trigger event at a vulnerable developmental stage.

**Underlying Vulnerability**

Infants dying as a result of SIDS display suboptimal physiologic regulatory responses. Post-mortem examination of the brainstems of SIDS victims demonstrates abnormalities in serotonergic signaling abnormalities in the arcuate nucleus and tissues that modulate ventilation and blood pressure in response to hypoxia and hypercarbia.

**Trigger Event**

The exact nature of the trigger is unknown. Studies suggest that the prone positioning predisposes to suffocation, resulting from decreased arousal, the type of bedding material, and overheating.

**Vulnerable Developmental Stages**

SIDS occurs most frequently between 2 and 4 months of age, a period marked by important changes in the cardiac, ventilatory, and sleep-wake patterns. A nadir in blood pressure, as well as impaired blood pressure responses to cardiovascular challenges induced by the head-tilt challenge, are known to occur during this period.
