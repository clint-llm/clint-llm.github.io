The use of PCA has been proven to be more effective at pain control than non-patient controlled opioid injections and results in higher patient satisfaction. PCA has also been found to be preferred by nurses because it allows for a reduction in their workload. PCA will enable patients to be in more control over their pain and helps them shift toward a more internal locus of control over their care.

PCA has been found to be less cost-effective than traditional dosing and does not affect the average length of hospital stay. When comparing PCA to traditional dosing, it was documented to result in higher opioid consumption, but those same studies also found no significant difference between opioid-related side effects, potentially indicating that the amount of opioid consumption is irrelevant.
