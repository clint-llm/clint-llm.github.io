The differential diagnosis includes:

- CMV retinitis- Salient differentiating features include

- Immunocompromised patient
- Clear media (minimal or no vitritis)
- Prominence of hemorrhage
- Early involvement of posterior pole/arcades though in granular CMV retinitis periphery may be involved early

- Progressive outer retinal necrosis (PORN)- PORN has specific characteristics including

- Immunocompromised patient
- No vitritis
- Outer retinal involvement
- Posterior pole involved early
- Minimal retinal hemorrhage
- Paravascular clear area

- Syphilis

- Granulomatous inflammation
- Posterior placoid chorioretinitis
- Retinal arterial involvement
- Round vitreous opacities
- Systemic features of syphilis including skin changes at the palms and feet

- Toxoplasmosis- It is characterized by

- Intense vitritis
- Area of focal retinitis visible through vitritis as 'headlight in the fog'
- Pigmented scar of old retinochoroiditis near the active area of retinitis, however, some cases may not have an adjacent scar
- In immunocompromised/AIDS, the features may be atypical with multiple lesions, less vitritis, and cerebral involvement.

- Behcet Disease

- Most cases will have oral aphthous ulcers
- Skin and genital lesion
- Panuveitis
- Hypopyon
- Severe media haze/vitritis
- Vasculitis with few retinal hemorrhages
- Patches of retinitis
- HLA-B51
- Pathergy test may be positive

- Fungal or bacterial Endophthalmitis

- Pain, redness, lid edema, photophobia may be severe
- Hypopyon, corneal edema, corneal infection
- History of previous ocular surgery, or intravenous infusion of drugs, sepsis
- Discharge from eye
- Severe visual decline, media haze, with echoes in vitreous with or without choroidal thickening on ultrasound
- Vitreous tap positive for bacteria or fungus in stain and/or culture

- Panuveitis due to other causes

- Large Cell Lymphoma/Intraocular lymphoma

- Old age
- Vitreous opacity with no cystoid macular edema
- Sheet-like vitreous on slit-lamp examination
- Subretinal ill-defined orange lesions
- History of behavioral change
- The vitreous biopsy may show lymphoma cells, though the yield is typically not great and needs excellent collaboration with the pathologist
- MRI brain may reveal central nervous system lymphoma
