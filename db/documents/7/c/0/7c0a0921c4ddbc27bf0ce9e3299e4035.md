Planned or emergent hospitalizations can occur at any time during the care of a patient with dementia. Hospital visits are a source of anxiety for the patient and their family members. It is imperative for nurses to coordinate with physicians, social workers, and family members to plan ahead for discharge.

Prior to hospital discharge, the healthcare team should evaluate for long-term care needs. Recommendations should include referrals for in-home services, referrals to rehabilitation facilities, or outpatient services as warranted.Â  The discharge plan should include a current list of all the medications that the patient is taking, a list of his allergies, copies of all legal papers to include: living will, advanced directives, power of attorney, or do not resuscitate orders, and a follow-up appointment after discharge with the patient's primary care provider.
