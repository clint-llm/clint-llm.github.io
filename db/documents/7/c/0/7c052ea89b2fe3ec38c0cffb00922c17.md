Monitor the effect of pharmacotherapy over time using GAD-7 (generalized anxiety disorder-7) and the HAM-A (Hamilton Anxiety Scale) for anxiety disorders.

Monitor and quantify depression severity using PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9).

Electrolyte disturbances (SSRI-induced SIADH) and EKG changes (QT prolongation) should also be assessed in subsequent visits with a basic metabolic panel and EKG, especially in patients 65 years or older or with a family history of arrhythmias.
