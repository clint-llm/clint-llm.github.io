The structure of proteins determines their function. Therefore, an incorrectly folded protein in the human body can have catastrophic effects on the individual. The tertiary structure of a protein can be affected by misfolding of a protein or by a change in the primary structure of the protein. Misfolding of a protein can lead to type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer disease, Huntington disease, and Parkinson disease. For all of these listed conditions, a soluble protein that is normally secreted from the cell is misfolded and secreted as an insoluble protein. This insoluble form is called an amyloid fiber, and all the diseases that result from this condition are collective known as amyloidoses.

Another way in which the tertiary structure of proteins can be incorrect is if there is a mutation in the gene that encodes for a specific protein. One disease that is caused due to this reason is cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disorder in which mucus becomes thick and sticky. Normally, the mucus created by epithelial cells is watery and acts as a lubricant to protect tissues. However, the thick and sticky mucus does not move so easily and can cause infections in the body. Some of the other symptoms include difficulty absorbing nutrients for children and infertility for men. One misfolded protein causes all of these issues. Cystic fibrosis occurs because of mutations in the gene that makes a protein called cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). A person with cystic fibrosis produces abnormal CFTR protein and sometimes no CFTR protein at all. This, as stated, causes the body to make thick, sticky mucus instead of the thin, watery kind.

The primary structure of a protein determines its secondary and tertiary structure, and it can be mutated in many ways. Some of these altering mechanisms include mutations in the gene which can be brought about by environmental factors such as ultraviolet (UV) radiation or by errors in DNA replication. Furthermore, the primary structure can be incorrect if the process of translation on the ribosome does not go entirely correctly. It is important to understand that all structure and function of a protein depends on its primary structure and if it is incorrect, it can lead to sometimes devastating effects on the human body.
