Trauma to the primary dentition and oral cavity are common occurrences in children and young people. A recent international epidemiological study on traumatic dental injuries (TDIs) involving primary teeth revealed a worldwide prevalence of 22.7%.

Children and their caregivers may present to various healthcare settings, including emergency departments, general dental practitioners, community dental services, specialist dental services, and pharmacists. Consequently, each service provider needs to have the appropriate knowledge, skills, and training to care for children withÂ traumatic injuries to their primary dentition.
