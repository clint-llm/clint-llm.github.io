The mission and goals of various simulation centers vary tremendously. They all, however, share the objective of providing ongoing training to allow participants to learn, improve, and maintain skills. Once again, the accreditation process provides each simulation site an opportunity to independently and internally review its quality of teaching and facilitating and to optimize these elements in preparation for an accreditation review. The accreditation process itself provides accreditors who are highly experienced and knowledgeable in simulation education to examine the site with a critical eye. The accreditors judge the adequacy of preparation of a given site and make expert recommendations for future improvement of a site’s activities and teaching.

Many sites also provide formal faculty development courses in skills training, simulation history and culture, debriefing techniques, and practice workshops.  In promoting and advertising such events, having obtained formal SSH accreditation lends legitimacy and an element of prestige to a simulation site and supports a site’s claims of providing high-quality, best-practice training and workshop experiences.
