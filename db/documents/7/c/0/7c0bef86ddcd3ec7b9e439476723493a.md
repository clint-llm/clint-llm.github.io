Ropivacaine is generally well tolerated. A pooled analysis from controlled clinical trials (n=1,661), in which patients received ropivacaine concentrations from 0.125 to 1% for nerve blocks, indicates that the most common adverse reactions are hypotension (32%), nausea (17%), vomiting (7%), bradycardia (6%), and headache (7%). A similar side effect profile occurred in patients who received bupivacaine concentrations of 0.25 to 0.75%. Overall, adverse events with ropivacaine are rare when it is properly administered.

Patients 61 years or older who received epidural ropivacaine 1% had a higher incidence of bradycardia than patients aged 41 to 60 years (58% vs. 15%); they also had a higher incidence of hypotension than patients aged 18 to 40 years old (74% vs. 20%).

The overall incidence of adverse reactions in children one month to 15 months is low; the most common adverse effects of ropivacaine in this age group were nausea and/or vomiting.

The most common fetal or neonatal adverse reactions following the use of ropivacaine in women undergoing cesarean section or labor were fetal bradycardia (12%), neonatal jaundice (8%), and unspecified neonatal complications (7%).
