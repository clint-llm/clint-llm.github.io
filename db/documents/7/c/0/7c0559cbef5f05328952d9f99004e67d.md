The diagnosis of most bone lesions is on the basis of their clinical, radiological, and biopsy characteristics. Enneking and others have proposed a staging system for benign and malignant musculoskeletal tumors.

Benign tumors staging is as follows:

Stage 1: Latent (intracapsular, asymptomatic, and incidental) lesions. Radiograph shows a well-defined lesion with a thick sclerotic rim and no cortical destruction or expansion. These lesions do not necessitate treatment because they do not compromise the strength of the involved bone. For example, small asymptomatic non-ossifying fibroma diagnosed incidentally.

Stage 2: Active (intracapsular, actively growing, presents with symptomatic pain or pathological fracture) lesions. They have well-defined margins but may expand and thin the cortex. They usually have a thin rim of reactive margin. Treatment involves extended curettage.

Stage 3: Aggressive (extracapsular) lesions. They are known to breach natural anatomical barriers, usually have broken through the cortex. Extended curettage, marginal resection, or wide resection if needed.

Musculoskeletal sarcomas are also staged according to histological grade, local extent, presence or absence of metastasis by Enneking as follows:

- Stage IA/B: low-grade lesions, intracompartmental/extracompartmental, no metastasis

- Stage IIA/B: high grade, intracompartmental/extracompartmental, no metastasis

- Stage IIIA/B: any tumor that has metastasis regardless of grade or size of the tumor

Alternatively, many orthopedic oncologists stage musculoskeletal tumors according to American Joint Committee on Cancer System (AJCC) which is periodically updated.

Treatment of bone lesions must be undertaken by experienced surgeons who are well aware of the basic principles of management of different bone tumors. The choice of treatment depends on a variety of factors. Surgical intervention versus conservative treatment, single-drug therapy or a combination of curettage, bone grafting, and cyst injections, management of difficult areas like tumor involving spine and effect of therapy on continued skeletal growth, must be considered while deciding on treatment. As an example, ABC is managed by curettage and bone grafting or injection and embolization while infection needs appropriate antibiotic treatment and surgical debridement if necessary.

There are specific benign bone lesions that do not need any intervention; they are better left alone. These are benign lesions and normal variants. A good example of obviously benign lesions like nonossifying fibroma. It is a lytic lesion located in the cortex of metaphysis of a long bone with a well-defined sclerotic border. Their involuting nature may show increased activity in a bone scan. When diagnosed by a radiologist, it does not need a biopsy. Another similar frankly benign lesion is a unicameral bone cyst of the calcaneus. They are asymptomatic and rarely undergo fracture as other limb lesions. Bone infarct also never causes a diagnostic dilemma to a reporting radiologist, hence don't need a biopsy.
