The etiology of OSSN is multifactorial. Various studies have implicated human papillomavirus (HPV), ultraviolet B (UVB) light rays, human immunodeficiency (HIV) 1 and 2 viruses, and Hepatitis B and C as the most common associations. The various predisposing factors are chronic cigarette smoking, use of petroleum products, hypopigmented hair and eyes, xerophthalmia (vitamin A deficiency), chemicals like arsenic and beryllium, ocular surface trauma, and people from British, Austria, and Switzerland are at high risk.

Another etiological factor is the failure of the DNA repair mechanism as seen in xeroderma pigmentosa, which is linked with OSSN, UVB rays induce p53 gene mutations, and various studies have reported raised nuclear p53 in individuals with OSSN.  Lee et al., in their analysis, reported pale skin, hypopigmented iris, and high incidence of sunburns as the probable risk factors for OSSN.
