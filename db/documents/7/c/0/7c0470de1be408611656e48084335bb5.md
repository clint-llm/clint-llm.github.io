Relapse prevention is a central goal of almost every addiction treatment team. Unfortunately, no single intervention has demonstrated effectiveness for each individual. Also, the process of recovery from addiction can be highly variable and unpredictable. The key is to identify the patient early. The primary care clinicians first see the majority of these patients. Nurses with specialty training in addiction can help with patient counseling, assessing risk, monitoring treatment, and watching for signs of a relapse in advance. The pharmacist can check the dosing and interactions of any pharmaceutical interventions as outlined above, and report concerns to the rest of the team. As a result, an interprofessional team that is highly adaptable and responsive to the individual’s current needs will often be the most effective and prevent or mitigate relapses. [Level 5]
