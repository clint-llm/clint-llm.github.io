Pneumocystis jirovecii is a common and potentially lethal opportunistic pneumonia-causing fungus in immunocompromised patients. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is classically associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), but it also affects patients with malignancy, rheumatologic conditions, or transplantation.

Due to the advent of combined antiretroviral therapy and routine use of chemoprophylaxis for opportunistic infections, there has been a steady decline in PCP among people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWHIV). PCP was initially thought to be caused by reactivation of fungal infection during childhood, but recent studies have shown evidence that new-onset infection appears to be more common than previously thought. These findings stress the importance of adequate and effective chemoprophylaxis in immunosuppressed patients.
