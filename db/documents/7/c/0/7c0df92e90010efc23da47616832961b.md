The origin of the RGEA is usually posterior to the first part of the duodenum, arising from the gastroduodenal artery. Its course varies, but often, it parallels the gastroduodenal artery distally along the pylorus, turns medially and travels between the greater curvature of the stomach and the greater omentum. After turning medially, the RGEA commonly lies about 2 centimeters below the stomach, sandwiched between layers of the gastrocolic omentum anteriorly and posteriorly. The artery gives off superior branches that supply the anterior and posterior gastric antrum and the distal body of the stomach. The RGEA also gives off inferior branches that supply the greater omentum, and a few of these branches can sometimes supply the final segments of the duodenum.

The LGEA originates from the splenic artery (or as a branch with the inferior splenic artery) near the pancreatic tail. The artery originates slightly medial to, and then courses toward, the gastrosplenic ligament; it runs toward the stomach reaching the greater curvature at the level of the anterior pole of the spleen. It then turns and runs left-to-right and caudally about 2 centimeters below the stomach letting off superior gastric and posterior omental branches.

Through instrumental evaluations using computed tomographic angiography, we highlight the presence of lymphosomes and lymph nodes relative to the gastroepiploic artery.
