The mother or caregiver and the patient's family should receive education on natural history, medical management, complications, and NAS prognosis. Any women of the childbearing age group must be informed about the potentially harmful effects of drug abuse, including NAS. It is a preventable condition if the woman stops drug usage before becoming pregnant or stops the drug usage once pregnant. It may be necessary to enroll the woman in a safe, supervised medical program - MAT if it is not safe to stop the drugs during the pregnancy. Symptoms of NAS can happen within 24 to 48 hours of life or as late as one week after birth. So it is necessary to look out for such symptoms even after discharge from the hospital. Management during hospital stay includes supportive care for the baby, and the mother should be actively involved in their baby's care. Some babies may require medications to relieve discomfort and other problems of withdrawal. Breastfeeding is strongly encouraged as the benefits are immense, and it does not affect the symptoms of NAS. Breastfeeding is a contraindication only if the mother has any medical contraindication. After discharge from the hospital, it is crucial to have close follow-up with medical providers to avoid NAS complications. More information for the patient's family is available at the American Academy of Pediatrics website.
