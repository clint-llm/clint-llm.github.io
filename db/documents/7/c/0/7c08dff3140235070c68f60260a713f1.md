The Dakin solution bactericidal antiseptic is very popular. Clinicians (MDs, DOs, DPMs, NPs, and PAs), surgeons, nurses, and pharmacists shouldÂ be familiar with its use, appropriate concentrations, and potential adverse effects. It is used to treat or prevent infections from cuts, abrasions, lacerations, skin ulcers, stage I to IV pressure ulcers, first- and second-degree burns, and even during surgery. An interprofessional team approach to its use will provide the best patient outcomes.
