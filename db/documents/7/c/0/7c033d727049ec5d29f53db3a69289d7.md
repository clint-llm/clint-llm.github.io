Some contraindications to drawing blood can be specific to the location of the blood draw or the overall condition itself. Studies suggest that phlebotomy can be an inappropriate treatment for non-hereditary mutation association etiologies of hyperferritinemia leading to complications such as iron deficiency anemia and fatigue.

In terms of location, previously attempted sites with residual scar tissue are a contraindication. Conditions such as cellulitis or an abscess can increase the risk of bacteria directly infiltrating the blood. Other contraindications for phlebotomy procedures include the presence of a vascular graft, a hematoma, venous fibrosis on palpation, a history of ipsilateral radical mastectomy, and any device used for venous access such as a venous port,Â central catheter, or an intravenous catheter.
