Prognosis depends on the initial presentation of the infection, with allergic bronchogenic aspergillosis being the milder end of the spectrum and invasive aspergillosis being the severe end of the spectrum.Â Treatment course and response largely depends on the site of infection as well as the patient's immune state. Longer treatment periods might be required for immunocompromised patients who have a slower response to treatment.
