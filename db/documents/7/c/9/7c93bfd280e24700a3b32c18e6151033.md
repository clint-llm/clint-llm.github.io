Deferoxamine (DFO) is a medication used for iron (approved indication) and aluminum toxicity (off-label). It is in the chelator class of drugs. Deferoxamine chelates non-transferrin bound iron (free iron), iron in transit between transferrin and ferritin (labile chelating iron pool), hemosiderin, and ferritin. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse reactions, interactions, and other factors such as off-label use, dosing, indications, monitoring, and pharmacokinetics. The information is pertinent for members of interprofessional teams in the treatment of iron toxicity and aluminum toxicity.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of deferoxamine.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of deferoxamine.
- Review the appropriate monitoring for patients using deferoxamine.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the use of deferoxamine and improve outcomes.
