Classically, the foundation of management for shoulder impingement syndrome has been rehabilitative exercise programs with subsequent surgical intervention if indicated by underlying anatomy, pathology, or failure of response to physiotherapy. Without known structural damage, non-operative therapies with a controlled exercise program, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and subacromial injections are considered the treatment of choice for the first 3 to 6 months of treatment.

In one study, exercise therapy was found to have better results when compared to a control/placebo in the sub-acute injury phase.

Numerous methodologies and approaches for corticosteroid injections exist, but the commonly used posterior subacromial approach requires less precision and is often viewed asÂ most straightforward.

A systematic review of randomized controlled trials comparing surgical intervention versus conservative therapy yielded moderate evidence that surgical intervention was not more effective for reducing pain than impingement-directed physical therapy.

When comparing surgical intervention with physiotherapy to that of surgery alone, no statistically significant or clinically significant difference between the two arms was observed with respect to pain at 3 months, 6 months, 5 years, and 10 years. Further, no statistical or clinically significant difference in function was noted at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year follow-up between the groups.
