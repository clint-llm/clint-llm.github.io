Providers should educate patients about controlling hypertension and lipids, chronic kidney disease, and options for renal replacement therapy, such as hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplantation. Patients should be made aware of the signs and symptoms and when to seek medical help. Dietary modifications should also be advised to the patients. Salt intake should be restricted.

As high protein intake could further aggravate proteinuria, affecting renal function, current guidance calls for an intake of 1 to 1.3 grams of high biologic-value protein/kg of body weight. In addition, reduction of fat intake could help with dyslipidemia.
