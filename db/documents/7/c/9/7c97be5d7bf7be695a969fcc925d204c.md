Acyclovir is an agent used to treat infections caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). Acyclovir is FDA-approved to treat genital herpes and HSV encephalitis. Non-FDA-approved indications are mucocutaneous HSV, herpes zoster (shingles), and varicella zoster (chickenpox). Acyclovir is the first-line treatment for HSV encephalitis. Currently, no other medications are indicated for treating this condition. It is in the antivirals class of drugs. This activity describes the indications, action, and contraindications for acyclovir as a valuable medication in treating HSV infections. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (eg, off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, and clinically relevant drug interactions) pertinent to members of the interprofessional healthcare team in the management of HSV infections.

**Objectives:**
- Verify dosing and perform medication reconciliation when necessary. 
- Strategize to reduce the potential adverse effect profile of acyclovir.
- Apply best practices when selecting and modifying treatment regimens using acyclovir.
- Collaborate with the interprofessional when initiating and monitoring acyclovir to enhance patient care.
