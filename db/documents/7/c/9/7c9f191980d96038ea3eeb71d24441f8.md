Lamivudine is a prescription nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that is used in combination with other drugs as antiviral treatment for human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) and as a monotherapy for hepatitis B virus (HBV).

Lamivudine, also termed 2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine or 3TC, was approved to treat HIV-1 in 1995, then for HBV in 1998.

Treatment of HIV-1 by lamivudine is in combination with lamivudine, raltegravir, or zalcitabine.

As a virustatic agent, lamivudine has been studied as a possible treatment for SARS-CoV. However,Â in all known published trials and research, lamivudine has not been shown to be an efficacious treatment for SARS-CoV.
