As most patients with COPD and severe asthma will require lifetime treatment with long-acting beta-2 agonists, a patient-centered approach involving multi-disciplinary coordination is requisite. At the level of primary care, the employment of respiratory therapists has shown improvement in the quality of asthma care. Patient outcomes have improved with more specialized care, decreasing the necessity for rescue inhaler use and overall symptom reduction. Additionally, proper inhaler device technique and spirometry for diagnosis increased in facilities with a designated respiratory care specialist (RCS). Pharmacists assist in verifying medication dosing and reinforcing proper inhalation technique. Nurses can educate, monitor care, and assess therapeutic effectiveness. In geriatric populations, long-term care facilities ensure medication compliance and appropriate outpatient care.
