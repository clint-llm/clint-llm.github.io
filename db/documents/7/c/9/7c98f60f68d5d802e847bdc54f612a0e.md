Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of the brain represents the gold standard test for cerebellar infarction. This can visualize both poor perfusion and signs of tissue injury. Also, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) can localize a vascular obstruction and guide endovascular treatment in the presence of large vessel occlusion, which can be particularlyÂ helpful in cases of basilar artery occlusion. Unenhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging can be helpful to assess for hemorrhagic lesions and can occasionally demonstrate findings suggestive of infarction. However, it is greatly hampered by the radiopaque temporal and occipital bones that surround the cerebellum, and thus has limited resolution, sensitivity, and specificity compared with other areas of the brain. It is nevertheless usually performed initially, in part to assess for other causes, but also because it is often much more readily available than MRI or MRA. If MRI is not available, enhanced CT angiogram and perfusion imaging can be helpful in its place. Apart from a standard bedside neurological exam, the oculomotor "HINTS" exam (Head Impulse, Nystagmus, and Test of Skew) can be helpful to rule-in peripheral vertigo or suggest cerebellar infarction if the included "alternate eye cover test" shows skew deviation.
