Management of restrictive lung disease varies depending on the etiology of the restriction. Patients diagnosed with IPF have been traditionally treated with immunosuppression; however, new anti-fibrotic drugs such as pirfenidone and nintedanib are increasingly used as they have shown to slow down disease progression.

Patients with acute exacerbations are usually treated with steroids overÂ several days; however, prolonged steroid therapy is not recommended due to their associated complications.
