The long thoracic nerve, which originates from the upper portion of the superior trunk of the brachial plexus and is typically composed of cervical nerves C5, C6, and C7, is responsible for the innervation of the serratus anterior. The long thoracic nerve courses inferiorly on the surface of the serratus anterior and, as such, is susceptible to damage during specific surgical procedures, especially with axillary lymph node dissection. The nerveâ€™s relatively smaller diameter compared to other nerves of the brachial plexus, its minimal connective tissue, and superficial course over the surface of the serratus anterior muscle leads to greater exposure along its course. Injury to the long thoracic nerve may be due to other non-surgical causes, including nerve compression by the middle scalene muscle, second rib, or fascial sheath; entrapment within the middle or posterior scalene muscles; and traction on the nerve itself.

If the long thoracic nerve is damaged, a clinical phenomenon known as a winged scapula occurs as the serratus anterior is no longer able to hold the scapula against the chest wall. The winging is medial scapula winging that has to be differentiated from lateral winging due to a weakness of the rhomboids or the trapezius muscles.

Innervation of the serratus anterior differs depending on the part of the muscle, which suggests that the superior part may be intimately related to the levator scapulae, while the middle and inferior segments may serve as the true serratus anterior muscle.
