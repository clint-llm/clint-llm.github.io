Volume expansion with crystalloid fluids may cause iatrogenic fluid overload. The risk of this complication becomes particularly elevated in patients with impaired kidney function (acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, etc.), and these patients should, therefore, receive treatment with judicious use of intravenous fluids. Patients with congestive heart failure are at elevated risk for serious adverse effects of crystalloid fluid administration. Fluid overload can cause life-threatening pulmonary edema and the worsening of diastolic or systolic heart failure, leading to end-organ damage or even death. It is vital for the clinician to monitor these patients carefully and administer the minimum required volume to maintain volume homeostasis.

**Normal saline (0.9% Saline)**

Normal saline has a higher concentration of chloride ions (154 mmol/L) than in human serum (98 to 106 mmol/L). With the administration of large volumes of normal saline, hyperchloremia occurs. While there is still some debate on the exact mechanism of this pH disturbance, the thinking is that the increase in chloride concentration adjusts the substantial ion difference in plasma, resulting in more free water in the intravascular space. As a result, the hydrogen ion concentration in the serum would increase to maintain electrochemical neutrality. Excessive renal bicarbonate excretion can occur, resulting in metabolic acidosis.

Acetate buffered crystalloid solutions have been the subject of much debate in the medical literature. Studies performed on dogs have shown that even small volumes of acetate-containing crystalloids can significantly increase the serum concentration of acetate to 10 to 40 times the physiologic level. Some suggest that acetate may potentiate hemodynamic instability by decreasing both myocardial contractility and blood pressure.

Unlike acetate buffered solutions, lactated crystalloid fluids have the potential to induce hyperglycemia. Lactate is a metabolically active compound that is utilized during gluconeogenesis to produce glucose. Hence, excessive administration of lactated crystalloids may be of concern in patients with diabetes.
