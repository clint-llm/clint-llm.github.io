The suprachiasmatic nucleus is one of many nuclei of the hypothalamus. During the early embryonic development of the nervous system, the prosencephalon or forebrain differentiates into the diencephalon and telencephalon. Originating from the ventral part of the diencephalon, the hypothalamus subdivides into four rostrocaudal segments: the preoptic, anterior, tuberal, and mammillary segments.Â Each region three mediolateral zones, known as the lateral, medial, and periventricular zones.
