The care of an amputee begins and ends with nursing actions and interventions. Whether it involves an emergency medicine admission or a clinic visit, the nursing staff is usually the first point of contact for a patient. Diabetic or peripheral vascular disease patients with foot or leg wounds can often be undergoing wound care with the assistance of a home-health nurse. Should there be a lack of progression in wound healing or early signs of infection, they are the first to refer the patient to a medical provider and in some instances, the emergency department. After that, an ER or hospital nurse is generally the first to greet a patient and obtain vital signs which can indicate the severity of disease and will, therefore, dictate the hospital setting in which this patient receives their care. With the assistance of nursing staff, the wound is exposed, and the patient is assessed from head-to-toe looking for pressure ulcers,Â ecchymosis, or hematomas in patients who are wheelchair or bed-bound. Nursing actions also include obtaining adequate intravenous access, medication dispensing and administration, serial symptom assessment including pain, monitoring vital signs, providing wound care and patient hygiene, as well as being a liaison between the patient, their families, and medical providers.
