Patients receiving treatment with warfarin should have close monitoring to ensure the safety and efficacy of the medication. Periodic blood testing is recommended to assess the patient's prothrombin time (PT) and the international normalized ratio (INR).

The laboratory parameter utilized to monitor warfarin therapy is the PT/INR. The PT is the number of seconds it takes the blood to clot, and the INR allows for the standardization of the PT measurement depending on the thromboplastin reagent used by a laboratory. Therefore, monitoring a patient's INR while on warfarin is preferable to PT because it allows for a standardized measurement without variations due to different laboratory sites. Routine assessment of INR is essential in managing patients receiving warfarin therapy. The INR of a patient who is not on anticoagulation therapy is approximately 1.0. If a patient has an INR of 2.0 or 3.0, that would indicate that it takes two or three times longer for that individual's blood to clot than someone who does not take any anticoagulants. The therapeutic INR goal for patients on warfarin therapy is dependent on the indication but may vary based on the patient's clinical presentation and provider preference. Most patients on warfarin have an INR goal of 2 to 3. However, specific indications, such as a mechanical mitral valve, require an INR goal of 2.5 to 3.5.

Close monitoring of a patient's INR is a strong recommendation when initiating warfarin. The INR requires more frequent monitoring when starting warfarin. For hospitalized patients, INR monitoring commonly occurs daily. Once a patient has reached the maintenance phase of therapy, the INR assessment is typically at least every four weeks but up to the provider's discretion. More frequent monitoring is necessary for patients with supratherapeutic or subtherapeutic INR to evaluate safety and efficacy. Also, the INR requires assessment when initiating, discontinuing, or changing doses of medications known to interact with warfarin.

Patients also require close monitoring for signs and symptoms of active bleeding throughout their treatment. Close monitoring for signs and symptoms of bleeding, such as dark tarry stools, nosebleeds, and hematomas, is necessary. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit level should be assessed before initiating warfarin and approximately every six months while on therapy. Other laboratory tests may be recommended based on the patient's clinical presentation and INR result. Monitoring liver function, renal function, and occult blood may be indicated in specific patient populations.
