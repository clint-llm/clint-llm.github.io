Glanders has been eliminated from the United States but is still present in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Central America, and South America. Melioidosis is endemic to southeast Asia and northern Australia but has also occurred in South America, Central America, Africa, and the Middle East. In 2016, a statistical model estimated that there would be 165,000 new cases of melioidosis worldwide and suggested that the disease is significantly underreported. Because it resides in soil and water, weather events such as flooding and typhoons have been implicated in outbreaks of melioidosis. No vaccine is available for either disease. Humans may contract glanders from contact with infected animals; animals without clinical symptoms can still be infectious to humans. Glanders can be transmitted by contact with mucous membranes, inhalation, and contact with breaks in the skin. Person-to-person transmission is rare for both glanders and melioidosis but can occur.
