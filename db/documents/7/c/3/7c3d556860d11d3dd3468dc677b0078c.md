**Electrocardiogram**

Findings on electrocardiogram include:

- Right bundle branch block (RBBB)

- Delta waves due to pre-excitation from the accessory pathway

- Tall P waves that suggest right atrial enlargement

- First-degree AV block is observed in approximately 42% due to intra-atrial conduction delay resulting from right atrial enlargement as well as from structural abnormalities of the atrioventricular conduction system

- Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, most commonly atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia; but also atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and atrial tachycardia

**Cardiothoracic Imaging**

Chest radiography usually shows cardiomegaly with right heart enlargement, giving the cardiac silhouette a globular appearance. An increased cardiothoracic ratio from right atrial enlargement can also be present.

Echocardiography is the imaging study of choice to evaluate Ebstein anomaly. The first echocardiographic criteria to detect Ebstein anomaly is the apical displacement of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve greater than 8 mm/m^2 in the apical 4-chamber view. The mitral valve annulus is used to calculate the hinge point of the nondisplaced tricuspid septal leaflet.

Echocardiographic assessment of the RV size and function can also be difficult using traditional methods. Typically, only a qualitative assessment based on ventricular function and septal motion is used to evaluate the RV. RV strain can also be used to evaluate RV function. Transesophageal echocardiography can aid in better visualizing the tricuspid leaflet anatomy and the characteristics of the color Doppler jet. It can also be of great utility for surgical planning. Transesophageal echocardiography is usually superior to transthoracic echocardiography in detecting intracardiac shunts.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can also add valuable information regarding tricuspid leaflet anatomy and is superior to echocardiography in assessing RV function because it allows quantifying RV ejection fraction (this appears to correlate well with echocardiographic RV strain measurements).

Cardiac computed tomography is another modality used to assess RV ejection fraction and tricuspid valve anatomy and can be used for periprocedural imaging of coronary anatomy prior to surgical intervention on the tricuspid valve.
