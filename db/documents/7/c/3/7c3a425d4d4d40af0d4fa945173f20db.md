The role of the nurse in the pre and postoperative period should include finite management of intravenous fluids, administering intravenous antibiotics, pain control, wound/dressing care and encouraging patient ambulation, initiate necessary lifestyle changes and participate in an early treatment regimen.

Perioperative nursing monitoring is essential in this outpatient procedure, such as accurate follow-through of instructions/development of preventable complications.

After the procedure is completed, monitoring of vital signs is also performed by the nurse.
