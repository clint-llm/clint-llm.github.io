The pain and autonomic symptoms seen in chronic paroxysmal hemicrania are the results of communication via neuropeptides between hypothalamic nuclei and the trigeminal and facial nerves. The pain in paroxysmal hemicrania is mediated by trigeminovascular pathways via activation of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve, with cranial autonomic symptoms mediated by activation of facial nerve parasympathetic fibers.
