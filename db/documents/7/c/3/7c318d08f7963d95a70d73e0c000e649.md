Celiac artery compression syndrome is also known as Dunbar syndrome or median arcuate ligament syndrome. It is a rare medical condition characterized by recurrent abdominal pain. The condition results from the compression of the celiac artery by a fibrous band of the diaphragm known as the median arcuate ligament. Lipshutz first reported the anatomical compression of the celiac artery in 1917. As a clinical entity, median arcuate ligament syndrome was first described by Harolja in 1963. Dunbar described the first clinical study on this entity in 1965.
