When alkaline phosphatase is the only liver biochemical test that presents as elevated (i.e., when the serum aminotransferases are within normal limits), or when alkaline phosphatase is disproportionately elevated compared to other liver biochemical tests, evaluation of the patient should focus on identifying the cause and the source for the isolated or disproportionate alkaline phosphatase elevation. In asymptomatic patients with isolated elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase, it is essential to identify the primary source of abnormality.

One approach utilizes the measurement of the activity of those enzymes, which increase in concordance with the liver alkaline phosphatase such as 5’-nucleotidase (5NT) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). These enzymes are not elevated in disorders of bone and correlate well with hepatobiliary disorders. Serum GGT is very sensitive to biliary tract disease but is less specific for liver disorders.
