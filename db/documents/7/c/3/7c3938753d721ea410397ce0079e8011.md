Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) can present on physical exam as acute or chronic. Acute ACD is typically characterized by an erythematous, eczematous, or vesicular dermatitis. Although ACD may present with a localized, well-demarcated skin eruption, it can also be more widespread. For example, rinse-off products such as shampoo or body washÂ may come into contact with many parts of the body, leading to a more diffuse presentation.
