Overall, many patients with AD do improve with time. However, at the same time patients with AD may also have allergic rhinitis and asthma, which may not improve. In most cases of childhood-onset AD, the disorder persists for decades. The condition has relapses and remissions; relapses often require the use of medications. Individuals who are continuously exposed to smoke, tobaccos, pet dander, fumes, pollen, soap, detergent, and wool will have continual symptoms and the overall quality of life is poor.

Persistent and recurrent itching not only is irritating but is costly to manage. A well-known complication of AD is Kaposi varicelliform eruption,Â  that is linked to a primary herpes infection. The vesicular lesions appear in the eczematous area and can quickly spread to healthy skin. Treatment with acyclovir can help lower the morbidity.

Patients with AD are also prone to skin infections with Staphylococcus and streptococcus.
