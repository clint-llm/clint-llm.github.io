Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell disorder characterized by clonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells producing monoclonal proteins and causing organ damage. The involvement of the kidney in plasma cell dyscrasias, including multiple myeloma, is widespread. Renal disease in patients with multiple myeloma is sometimes referred to as myeloma kidney. At the time of presentation, about 50 percent of patients have renal involvement. Renal involvement is associated with higher mortality. This activity examines when myeloma kidney should be considered, how it should be managed, and the role of interprofessional teams in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of multiple myeloma involving the kidneys.
- Explain why early diagnosis of kidney involvement of multiple myeloma is important.
- Review the pathology of myeloma kidney.
- Summarize the treatment of multiple myeloma of the kidney and coordination of interprofessional team in its management.
