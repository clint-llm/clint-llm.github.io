Pharmacotherapy targeted at different steps of the pathogenesis of neointimal hyperplasia can be used to prevent and treat this condition. Graft surveillance in high-risk patients with serial Doppler ultrasound within the first two years after the vascular intervention can detect and repair neointimal hyperplasia.

- **Platelet activation and thrombus formation:**Aspirin, P2Y12 (clopidogrel), glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (abciximab), heparin, or hirudin targets this step to prevent neointimal hyperplasia.

- **Leucocyte recruitment:**Probucol is an antioxidant that prevents neointimal hyperplasia by blocking leukocytes recruitment into the sub-endothelial area of an injured vascular wall.

- 
**SMC migration and proliferation:**

- NO deficiency secondary to ED has been linked with the neointimal hyperplasia development. Local NO-based perivascular powder therapy and poly (diol-co-citrate) elastomeric vascular wraps are superior to systemic NO therapies, which have adverse outcomes.

- Drug-eluting stents (DES) containing paclitaxel or everolimus also blocks SMC migration and proliferation. DES recently has been used in post-carotid endarterectomy restenosis cases in addition to their well-known use in coronary angioplasty with stenting.

- Gene therapy targeting SMC migration, proliferation, and NO production have also been studied.

- Beta vascular brachytherapy has been proven to reduce neointimal hyperplasia burden after a few months.
