A blighted ovum, also known as an anembryonic pregnancy, occurs when a fertilized egg implants and a gestational (embryonic) sac forms and grows, but the embryo fails to develop. A blighted ovum is the single leading cause of miscarriage. This activity outlines the management of blighted ovum and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in educating the patient on this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the risk factors for a blighted ovum. 
- Describe the clinical presentation of a patient with a blighted ovum.
- List the treatment and management options available for a patient with a blighted ovum.
- Employ interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance fertility rates in patients with a history of miscarriage.
