Burchell et al. first described the condition in 1949, and the term was first used in 1969.

Platypnea may co-exist with or be caused by orthodeoxia which is defined as oxygen desaturation in the upright position. Both constitute a syndrome named platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome.

No data currently exists to estimate the incidence of platypnea and most cases go undetected unless clinicians specifically ask about the symptoms. Additionally, measuring the degree of dyspnea or the oxygen saturation in the upright and sitting position is not usually part of the routine vital signs measurement or physical examination; hence, positional alterations in oxygenation can be easily overlooked.
