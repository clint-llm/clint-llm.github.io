Amniotic fluid embolism is a very severe condition, its onset is sudden although there are few preventive measures that could be taken beforehand.Â To prevent amniotic fluid embolism, trauma to the uterus must be avoided during maneuvers such as insertion of a pressure catheter or rupture of membranes. Incision of the placenta during cesarean delivery should also be avoided if possible.
