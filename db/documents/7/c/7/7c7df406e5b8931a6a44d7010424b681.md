Gliomas in general, specifically glioblastomas, are very difficult to treat. Despite advances in understanding the molecular biology and genetics of gliomas, no significant impact has been made towardÂ preventing the lethality of high-grade gliomas. Therefore, there is a continuing need for clinical and basic science investigations to advance the care of this lethal disease.
