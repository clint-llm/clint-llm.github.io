The feared complication of WPW syndrome is sudden cardiac death (SCD). Population studies suggest that SCD is most often a result of ventricular fibrillation leading to cardiac arrest or with atrial fibrillation or circus movement tachycardia. The mechanism for deterioration to ventricular fibrillation leading to SCD is an accessory pathway that is capable of rapid antegrade conduction that allows rapid transmission of atrial impulses to the ventricle. This can be exacerbated or initiated by the use of AV nodal blocking agents, and care should be taken to avoid these medications in the setting of WPW pattern on resting ECG with rapid atrial arrhythmias; atrial fibrillation and flutter are the most dangerous given their excessively rapid rates. Recurrent or prolonged tachyarrhythmias can predispose to heart failure. Hemodynamic instability during a tachyarrhythmia can initiate or exacerbate comorbid medical conditions. Patients that experience syncope with acute arrhythmia are at risk for traumatic injuries.
