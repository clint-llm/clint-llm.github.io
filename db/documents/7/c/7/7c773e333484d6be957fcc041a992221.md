Congenital heart disease (CHD) are structural abnormalities of the heart or intrathoracic great vessels occurring during fetal development. CHD is the most common type of birth defect and the leading cause of death in children with congenital malformations. CHD can be subdivided in non-cyanotic CHD and cyanotic CHD which is also called critical congenital heart disease (CCHD). CCHD can be further classified into 3 different type of lesions: right heart obstructive lesions, left heart obstructive lesions, and mixing lesions.
