Azilsartan comes in an oral tablet form as 40 and 80 mg tablets that are commercially available to be taken once daily, and it can be administered with or without food.

Azilsartan is formulated as its prodrug, azilsartan medoxomil. It absorbs rapidly in the gut, and biotransformation in the liver leads to the prodrug being hydrolyzed to its active metabolite, azilsartan, primarily by the enzyme CYP2C9.
