- Subclinical hypothyroidism characteristically has an elevated TSH and normal T4. While most patients are asymptomatic, some may have symptoms of hypothyroidism.

- Subclinical hypothyroidism requires differentiation from other causes of a transient elevation of TSH (age, medications, renal failure, non-thyroidal illness, and assay interference)

- Subclinical hypothyroidism has potential correlations with anÂ increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline, and a decrease in functional capacity.

- Treatment with levothyroxine should commence if the level of TSH is >10 mIU/l, with positive thyroid peroxidase antibody, the presence of hypothyroid symptoms, or cardiovascular risk factors.
