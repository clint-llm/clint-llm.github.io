Treatment of patients with GT with platelets can result in anti-HLA antibodies as well as antibodies against integrinÂ alpha IIb beta 3. Treatment with HLA-compatible platelets can be beneficial, and immunoadsorption techniques for anti-alpha IIb beta 3 are available. Patients with GT can experience the same reactions (i.e., anaphylaxis or transfusion-related acute lung injury) as other patients receiving blood products and need to be treated accordingly.

Treatment with rFVIIa can result in thromboembolic complications, although this is rare in patients with inherited bleeding disorders.
