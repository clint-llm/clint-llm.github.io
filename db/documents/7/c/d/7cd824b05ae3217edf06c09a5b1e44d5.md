Microtia is usually unilateral (77% to 93%), more often right-sided (60%), and occurs more frequently in males (2.5:1). The prevalence per 10,000 births in the United States ranges from 1.8 to 3.5, and worldwide from 0.4 to 8.3. In the United States, there is a higher risk of microtia among Asians, Pacific Islanders, and Hispanic patients.
