The general mechanism of heavy metal toxicity results from disruption of metabolic homeostasis at a cellular level. This results from an excess of the heavy metal in the body, leading to deposition and accumulation in various tissues. The metallic deposits then hinder biological function via enzymatic, metabolic, and mitochondrial interference.
