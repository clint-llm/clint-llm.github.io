HAV, first identified in 1973 by Feinstone et al., is classified in the family Picornaviridae and genus Hepatovirus. It is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus which replicates primarily within hepatocytes. Animal studies showing HAV antigen in the epithelial cells of intestinal crypts and cells of the lamina propria in the small intestine suggest replication might also occur at these sites. Once ingested orally, the virus is taken up from the gastrointestinal tract and the HAV particles are carried to the basolateral membrane of the hepatocyte via the portal circulation. The hepatocellular injury in acute HAV infection is mediated by various immune mechanisms. It has been shown that patients with acute HAV infection have the virus-specific T-cell mediated release of cytotoxic interferon-gamma. Additionally, recent mice-models have demonstrated HAV-induced hepatocellular apoptosis and inflammation associated with the innate immune response.Â  The humoral immune response is responsible for the diagnostic serologic assays. Following replication in the liver, HAV is excreted in bile and released into the stool. The concentration of the virus is highest in the stool during the 2 weeks before the onset of jaundice, at which point the individual is most infectious. Most people are no longer infectious 1 week after jaundice appears at which time stool shedding and viremia are decreased.
