The complications of calcium oxalate stones in the urinary tract include:

- Urosepsis

- Hydronephrosis

- Anuria

- Formation of abscesses

- Urine extravasation

- Post-renal obstruction and the gradual decline of kidney function

The development of nephrocalcinosis, further leading to ESRD, is the most dangerous complication. Along with the kidneys, the involvement of the other organ systems is also seen as a complication of the long-term buildup of oxalate in the serum.
