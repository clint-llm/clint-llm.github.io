MCL injuries are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an orthopedic nurse and a physical therapist.

MCL injuries are quite common in sporting individuals. However, it is important for clinicians to remember that this is one injury that can heal with conservative treatment. The patient should be encouraged to enter a rehabilitation program after the acute symptoms have subsided. Return to sports is possible in most athletes. However, professional athletes may want to consider surgery as the repair is more durable.
