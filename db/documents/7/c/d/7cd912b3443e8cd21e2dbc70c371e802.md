**New Drugs/Therapies Being DevelopedÂ to Tackle Obesity**

These are not yet FDA-approved drugs but target parts of the hedonistic and homeostatic pathways in the peripheral and central nervous system to induce weight loss. They include tesofensine-a serotonin-noradrenaline-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, RNA inhibitor against RIP140, CDDO-imidazolide, antibodies against ghrelin, high dose systemic PYY antagonists, cetilistat-a gastric and pancreatic lipase inhibitor, beloranib-MetAP2 inhibitor, KD026-microsomal transfer protein inhibitor in the intestine, fecal microbiota transplant, bile acid receptors-TGR5, FXR, GSK1521498-selective mu-opioid receptor antagonist, PRX-07034-a 5-HT6 antagonist, SNAP-94847-MCH-1 antagonist, oxyntomodulin-a glucagon + GLP 1 agonist, ghrelin antagonist and vaccines, GIP receptor antagonist, monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH)-appetite suppression-degradation of endocannabinoids anandamide, 2-arachidonic acid glycerol, a long-acting amylin analog, an FGF21 analog, licogliflozin-SGLT1 inhibitor, PYY 3-36 analog, oxytocin receptor agonist and a Type 4 FGF receptor antagonist.

**Caution About Dietary Supplements and Unproven Treatments for Weight Loss**

Some advertised supplements available over the counter are not FDA-approved for weight loss and have not undergone rigorous testing and review to prove their efficacy or safety. These contain substances like green tea, caffeine, yohimbine, bitter orange, guar gum, glucomannan, pyruvate, chromium, and calcium. In addition, techniques like liposuction are typically sought for their aesthetic value but do not improve metabolic parameters or change insulin sensitivity and cannot reduce ectopic fat deposits, which influence cardiovascular outcomes.
