Among Alaskan Natives and American Indians who entered an alcohol detoxification treatment facility, seventy-five percent of individuals had successful completion. Alaskan Natives and American Indians who exhibited an older age of onset with first alcohol consumption and longer length of stay in the treatment facility were more likely to achieve successful detoxification.

Individuals treated for alcohol use disorder who also had a substance use disorder were 50% less likely to complete the detoxification treatment. After detoxification facilities, only 36% of Alaskan Natives and American Indians accepted a referral to another inpatient or outpatient substance treatment program. When comparing genders, women were 38% percent less likely to accept. However, individuals who were facing legal issues were twice as likely to accept a referral. After accepting a referral, only 58% of individuals entered substance abuse treatment programs.
