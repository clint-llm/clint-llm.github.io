At altitudes above 2500 meters, the barometric pressure is lower, which results in a decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen in the air. Even though the FiO2 remains 21% at high altitudes, the actual amount of oxygen that reaches the alveoli is much less than at sea level, resulting in hypoxia and hypoxemia.
