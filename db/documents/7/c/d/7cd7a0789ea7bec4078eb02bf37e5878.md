Hurthle cell thyroid neoplasms were until recently considered a variant of follicular neoplasms of the thyroid. WHO has recognized them as a distinct type of thyroid neoplasm because of significant molecular, histological, and prognostic differences. Since the distinction is new, clinicians must recognize the differences between Hurthle cell and follicular neoplasms. The clinical and translational data for Hurthle cell carcinomas are also limited because it was treated as a part of follicular neoplasms due to the low incidence compared to other differentiated thyroid neoplasms.

Health professionals need to recognize this as a distinct neoplasm in reporting cases, outcomes, or complications and designing clinical trials to have quality data reported on Hurthle cell carcinoma in the literature in the future to improve targeted therapy, response rates, and eventually improve patient outcomes.
