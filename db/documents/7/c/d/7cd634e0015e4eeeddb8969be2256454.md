Ocular complications of onchocerciasis include blindness as a result of keratitis, the formation of pannus, and corneal scarring. Other causes of blindness include optic atrophy, open-angle glaucoma, and chorioretinitis, as previously stated. Posterior segment complications have been noted to be responsible for over half of the blindness from onchocerciasis in a report. Specific posterior segment complications reported in this study include; chorioretinal changes including intraretinal pigment (IRP) clumping and retinal pigment epithelium atrophy, retinitis, subretinal fibrosis, and optic neuritis.

Other ocular complications include live and dead microfilariae presence in anterior chamber and cornea, punctate cornea opacity, sclerosis keratitis, pannus formation, and uveitis (iridocyclitis).
