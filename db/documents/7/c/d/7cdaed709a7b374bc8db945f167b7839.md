Frequent monitoring of BUN, creatinine levels, and hepatic function is necessary for individuals taking levodopa. Good hepatic function is crucial in patients taking levodopa because it is where the drug is decarboxylated. Also, it is essential to test for intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma. Testing patients for peripheral neuropathy before and while on levodopa is also necessary. Patients should also have regular monitoring of dyskinesia. Patients need to be observed for psychotic behavior and hallucinations while taking dopaminergic medications. Hallucinations can accompany confusion and excessive dreaming. Thus, patients with a history of past psychiatric disorders should not receive treatment with levodopa. As an extra precaution, patients require monitoring for melanoma. It is unknown whether the risk of melanoma increases due to levodopa use or Parkinson disease.
