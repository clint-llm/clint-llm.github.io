Blepharitis is managed by an interprofessional team that consists of a nurse practitioner, primary care provider, ophthalmologist and the internist.  Blepharitis is characterized by an inflammation of the eyelid margins, which can be acute or chronic. The main treatment for blepharitis is good eyelid hygiene and elimination of triggers that exacerbate symptoms. Topical antibiotics may be prescribed. Patients refractory to these measures require referral to an ophthalmologist. The goal of treatment is to alleviate symptoms. Because most blepharitis is chronic, patients need to maintain a good hygiene regimen to prevent recurrences. While there is no definitive cure, the prognosis for blepharitis is good. Blepharitis is a more symptomatic condition than a true health threat. Most patients do respond to treatment but the condition is characterized by exacerbations and remissions.
