Balloon valvoplasty is a cardiac intervention technique that is widely used today to manage stenotic lesions. However, the preoperative work is usually done by an interprofessional team. The patients need to meet the indications for valvuloplasty to derive the most benefits. The nurse practitioner, physician assistant, anesthesiologist, and cardiologist should ensure patient fitness for the procedure. Usually, the nurse practitioner orÂ physician assistant does the initial screening and reports back to the clinical team leader if there are concerns. The cardiologist should ensure and confirm with the nurse practitioner or physician assistant that the patient has the right indications for valvuloplasty. A nurse in the cardiac catheterization lab is dedicated to the monitoring of the patient during the procedure and should report to the cardiologist if any abnormal changes in vital signs develop. After the procedure, the recovery room nurses need to monitor the patient's vital signs and the site of puncture for hematoma formation and distal leg pulses. If there is an elevation in heart rate or drop in blood pressure, the physician should be contacted immediately. Only through an interprofessional team approach can the morbidity of this procedure be decreased and the outcomes improved. [Level V]
