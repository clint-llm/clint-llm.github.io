To understand the pathophysiology of PCT, we should discuss the interplay between the various cell processes that take place to give rise to the cutaneous manifestations of this condition. The deficiency or absence of the enzymeÂ uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase causes an accumulation of porphyrins. This spills into the bloodstream, where it interacts with external sources of light, especially blue light, with a wavelength of 410 nm. This initially excites the porphyrin molecules. They subsequently go back to their original ground state after releasing energy. This energy is transferred to molecular oxygen and creates 'singlet-excited oxygen,' which is implicated in oxidizing several essential biological compounds like lipids, proteins, and causes peroxidation of cell membrane lipids, disintegrates cell membrane, and eventually leads to cell death.

This situation presents clinically as skin fragility and blister formation.
