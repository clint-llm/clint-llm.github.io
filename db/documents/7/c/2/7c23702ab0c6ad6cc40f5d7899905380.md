Glucagon has a half-life of 3-6 minutes. Hence, the sample collection should be in chilled tubes with a proteolytic enzyme inhibitor. In adults and children, the normal plasma levels are less than 120 pg/ml, while in cold blood, the levels can go as high as 215 pg/ml. The sample collection should be in chilled ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) or dipotassium EDTA plus aprotinin tubes after overnight fasting. Storage pending the taking of measurements should be at -70 degrees celsius after separation from the cells.

In patients with kidney failure, there may be increased levels of Â N-terminally elongated proglucagon (1-61 aa); thus, glucagon measurements in subjects with impaired kidney function may lead to an overestimation of endogenous glucagon secretion. The stability of the glucagon molecule and the sensitivity of the assay are considerations when measuring glucagon levels.
