Postoperative care involves close collaboration between the parents, treating ophthalmologists, optometrists for regular refraction, and the counselor. The nurses and counselor play an essential role in making parents understand how to use postoperative eye drops, maintain hygiene, cleaning of eyelashes and lid margins to prevent infection. The involvement of parents in the immediate postoperative period and during follow-ups is important to ensure treatment compliance. These patients need long-term close follow-ups, keeping in mind the need for correcting refractive errors, cycloplegic refraction at least once every six months, maintenance of amblyopia therapy, orthoptics exercise, repeat six-monthly squint evaluation for the development of under or overcorrection.
