The larynx begins to form around the fourth week of development as an outpouching of the ventral wall of the primitive pharynx called laryngotracheal groove (or foregut). The development follows a craniocaudal progression, with the more superior thyroid cartilage arising from the fourth branchial arch, and the more caudal cricoid cartilage arising from the sixth branchial arch. The cartilaginous tissues from the fourth and sixth branchial arches merge and form the arytenoid, thyroid, cricoid, corniculate, and cuneiform cartilages, except the epiglottis which comes from the third arch. The fifth branchial arch may play a role in the origin of the arytenoid and corniculate cartilages, but due to its rapid degeneration during the human development, its function is still unclear. The laryngeal cartilages, including the epiglottis, originate from the mesenchymal tissue adjacent to both the entoderm and endoderm. In this tissue, small foci of cells show a trend towards chondroitic differentiation. The complete confluence of these foci and the formation of the definitive cartilages occur mostly postnatally. Arytenoid cartilages are of hyaline type (except the vocal processes) as well as thyroid and cricoid cartilages; the other cartilages consist of elastic cartilage. Hyaline cartilages tend toÂ ossify after the age of 18 years, earlier in men than in women. In contrast to hyaline cartilages, ossification does not occur in elastic cartilages.
