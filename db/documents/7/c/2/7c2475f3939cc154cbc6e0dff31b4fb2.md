Syrup of ipecac is contraindicated in patients who are unable to protect their airway or in whom medical personnel cannot adequately maintain an airway. It should be avoided after the ingestion of caustic substances, such as acids or bases, as vomiting can further increase upper GI and airway injury. It should also not be used in patients with significant debility in whom the induction of emesis may worsen their condition. Syrup of ipecac should not be given if the toxic ingestion has occurred more than one hour before the patient presents for care. In general, if signs of absorption and toxicity are evident, the administration of syrup of ipecac is unlikely to be beneficial.
