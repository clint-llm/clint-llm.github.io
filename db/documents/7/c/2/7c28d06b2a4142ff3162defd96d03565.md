A multidisciplinary team involving a primary care physician, nutritionist, and neurologist should manage the patient. Routine newborn screening for Hartnup disease is not standard at present. Patients presenting with skin rash similar to pellagra, tremors, or ataxia at a young age should be evaluated for Hartnup disease as it is easily treatable. Interprofessional collaboration is important to improve patient outcomes in Hartnup disease.
