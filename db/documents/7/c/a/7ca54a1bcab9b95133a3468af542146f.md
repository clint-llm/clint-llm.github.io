Staging of the tumor is necessary to address issues like the surgical resectibility of the tumor, which depends upon the size and anatomical location of the tumor, the extent of the tumor, structures such as blood vessels and lymph nodes involvement, assessment of the direct involvement of the surrounding organs and whether the tumor is advanced enough for surgical treatment.

Previously, for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC)-TNM classification system of malignant liver tumors was applied, which differed from the UICC-TNM classification of the extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder carcinoma. However, with the rise in the incidence of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and given the fact that it arises from the malignant transformation of the cholangiocytes or progenitor cells which in either case have distinct histological and biological characteristic features from hepatocellular carcinoma, the American Joint Union on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control (AJCC/UICC) recognized intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma as a separate entity and was assigned a different TNM staging than malignant liver tumors.

According to the American joint committee of cancer (AJCC), the intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC) TNM classification and staging include:

**Primary tumor**

**pTx -**Primary tumor cannot be assessed

**pT0 -**No evidence of primary tumor

**pTis -**Carcinoma in situ (intraductal tumor)

**pT1 -**Solitary tumor without vascular invasion, ≤5 cm or >5cm

**pT1a -**Solitary tumor ≤5 cm without vascular invasion

**pT1b -**Solitary tumor >5 cm without vascular invasion

**pT2 -**Solitary tumor with intrahepatic vascular invasion, or multiple tumors with or without vascular invasion

**pT3 -**Tumor perforating the visceral peritoneum

**pT4 -**Tumor involving local extrahepatic structures by direct invasion

**Regional Lymph Nodes**

**Nx -**Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed

**N0 -**No regional lymph nodes metastasis

**N1 -**Regional lymph nodes metastasis present

**Distant metastasis**

**M0 -**No distant metastasis

**M1 -**Distant metastasis present

Stage 0: Tis, N0, M0: Stage IA: T1a, N0, M0: Stage IB: T1b, N0, M0: = Stage II: T2, N0, M0: Stage IIIA: T3, N0, M0: Stage IIIB: T4, any N, M0; or any T, N1, M0; Stage IV: Any T, Any N, M1

For extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, several staging systems including Bismuth-Corlette system, American joint committee for cancer (AJCC), and Memorial Sloan-Kettering cancer center clinical staging system (MSKCC) have been proposed all of them with some modifications in the T-staging.

The AJCC staging and classification for extrahepatic (EHCC) includes;

For Perihilar (Klatskin tumor) cholangiocarcinoma:

**Primary tumor (T)**

**pTx -**Primary tumor cannot be assessed

**pT0 -**No evidence of primary tumor

**pTis -**Carcinoma in situ / high-grade dysplasia

**pT1 -**Tumor confined to the bile duct, with extension up to the muscle layer or fibrous tissue

**pT2 -**Tumor invades beyond the wall of the bile duct to surrounding adipose tissue, or tumor invades adjacent hepatic parenchyma

**pT2a -**Tumor invades beyond the wall of the bile duct to surrounding adipose tissue

**pT2b -**Tumor invades adjacent hepatic parenchyma

**pT3 -**Tumor invades unilateral branches of the portal vein or hepatic artery

**pT4 -**Tumor invades the main portal vein or its branches bilaterally or the common hepatic artery; or unilateral second-order biliary radicals with contralateral portal vein or hepatic artery involvement

**Regional lymph nodes (N)**

**Nx -**Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed

**N0 -**No regional lymph node metastasis

**N1 -**One to three positive lymph nodes typically involving the hilar, cystic duct, common bile duct (choledochal), hepatic artery, posterior pancreatoduodenal and portal vein lymph nodes

**N2 -**Four or more positive lymph nodes from the sites described for N1

**Distant metastasis (M)**

**M0 -**No distant metastasis

**M1 -**Distant metastasis

Stage 0: Tis N0 M0; Stage I: T1 N0 M0; Stage II: T2a-b N0 M0; Stage IIIA: T3 N0 M0; Stage IIIB: T4 N0 M0; Stage IIIC: any T N1 M0; Stage IVA: any T N2 M0; Stage IVB: any T any N M1

For distal cholangiocarcinoma:

**Primary tumor**

**pTx**: Primary tumor cannot be assessed

**pTis**: Carcinoma in situ/high-grade dysplasia

**pT1**: Tumor invades the bile duct wall with a depth less than 5 mm

**pT2**: Tumor invades the bile duct wall with a depth of 5-12 mm

**pT3**: Tumor invades the bile duct wall with a depth greater than 12 mm

**pT4**: Tumor involves the celiac axis, superior mesenteric artery, and/or common hepatic artery

**Regional lymph nodes**

**Nx -**Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed

**N0 -**No regional lymph nodes metastasis

**N1 -**Regional lymph nodes metastasis present

**Distant metastasis**

**M0 -**No distant metastasis

**M1 -**Distant metastasis present

Stage 0: Tis N0 M0; Stage I: T1 N0 M0; Stage II: T1, N0, M0; Stage IIA: T1 N1 M0 or T2 N0 M0; Stage IIB: T2 N1 M0 or T3 N0-1 M0; Stage IIIA: T1-3 N2 M0; Stage IIIB: T4 N0-2 M0; Stage IV: Any T, Any N, M1
