Patient education has a profound impact on the overall outcome of major depressive disorder. Since MDD is one of the most common psychiatric disorders causing disability worldwide and people in different parts of the world are hesitant to discuss and seek treatment for depression due to the stigma associated with mental illness, educating patients is very crucial for their better understanding of the mental illness and better compliance with the mental health treatment. Family education also plays an important role in the successful treatment of MDD. Psychoeducation plays a significant role in improving patient compliance and medication adherence. Recent evidence also supports that lifestyle modification, including moderate exercises, can help to improve mild-to-moderate depression.

Nurses can also provide education about the side effects and expected treatment response when patients are prescribed anti-depressant medications. Important points of education include:

- Initially, it takes 2 - 4 weeks to see improvement in symptoms; do not discontinue the medication unless you have talked to your provider

- Notify the provider or go to the hospital immediately for suicidal thoughts

- Side effects may include tiredness, sexual dysfunction, weight gain, dry mouth, nausea, and more

- Do not stop taking anti-depressants abruptly for any reason. Discuss with provider; tapering off medication may be required to avoid withdrawal symptoms
