There are few reports in the literature for Holmes tremor. This could be because due to misdiagnosis as it can be categorized as another type of tremor or because single case reports have not been published. A study in 2016 identified only 155 patients reported since the original 1904 description until 2016.

In a series of twenty patients, the average age at diagnosis is 30.6 years (range 8-64), with a female to male ratio of 2:1.
