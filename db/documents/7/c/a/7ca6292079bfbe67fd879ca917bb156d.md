Classically, nonunion is of greatest concern in the management of isolated fractures of the ulnar shaft; however, it appears that rates of nonunion may be lower than previously thought. For non-operatively managed fractures, one meta-analysis reports a nonunion rate ranging from 2% to 4%. In nightstick fractures that were managed surgically, the nonunion rate was 0% to 2% for fractures treated with plate fixation, while fractures treated with intramedullary fixation had a 5% rate of nonunion.
