There are eight nasal muscles identified; however, only two of these muscles affect the nasal profile - these are the procerus and the nasalis. The procerus muscle has two parts; only the superior medial part covers the nasal bones which inserts to the skin covering the eyebrow and the forehead. The nasalis muscle originates from the maxilla, which is transverse to the dorsum of the nose, and it inserts in the nostrils and the greater alar cartilages. However, the muscles and the soft tissue is not thought to influence the nose contour, but the cartilages do.
