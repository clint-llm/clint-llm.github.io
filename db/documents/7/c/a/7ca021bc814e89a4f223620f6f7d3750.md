The American College of Cardiology (ACC), the American Heart Association (AHA), and the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) have jointly established national guidelines to direct the implantation of artificial cardiac pacemakers.

- Symptomatic bradycardia from sinus node disease

- Symptomatic bradycardia from atrioventricular node disease

- Long QT syndrome

- Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy

- Dilated cardiomyopathy

- During AV node ablation

- Cardiac resynchronization therapy with biventricular pacing

- Advanced 2nd or third-degree heart block

- Recurrent syncope

Pacemakers are programmed noninvasively today. Pacemaker generators have an x-ray code which can be visualized on the chest x-ray.
