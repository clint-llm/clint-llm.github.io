- Hepatocellular carcinoma is the fifth leading cause of cancer worldwide and the second cause of cancer deaths in men.

- Risk factors for HCC include chronic hepatitis B virus infection, chronic hepatitis C virus infection, alcohol abuse, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

- NAFLD is now a leading cause of HCC worldwide, especially in western countries. This is due to the increase in metabolic syndrome.Â Metabolic syndrome occurs in patients with insulin resistance, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, and abdominal obesity, which increases cardiovascular risk.

- HCC is diagnosed by elevation of serum biomarkers, including alpha-fetoprotein, imaging including ultrasound, contrast CT/MRI, and biopsy.

- Five-year survival of HCC is 18% and second to pancreatic cancer.
