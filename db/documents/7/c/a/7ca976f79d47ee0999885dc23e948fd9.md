A convenient non-invasive first test is ultrasonography of the upper extremities. This will demonstrate thrombus in the deep venous system. Acute thrombus will be non-compressible on ultrasound. Additionally, it will be echogenic with a distended appearance of the vein and absent spectral/color flow. A vein with chronic thrombus will have an irregular and more collapsed appearance with the development of collaterals on ultrasound. Ultrasonography will not allow for complete demonstration of the central veins. Computed tomography (CT) venography and magnetic resonance (MR) venography can demonstrate thrombus in the venous system as well. Contrast venography is a more invasive test that can demonstrate patency of the central venous system.

Laboratory workup includes a thrombophilia panel (protein C and S levels, antithrombin levels, prothrombin gene mutation analysis, factor V Leiden mutation testing, among others) and D-dimer levels. D-dimer levels will be elevated in a patient with deep venous thrombosis; however, this elevation can also be seen in other infectious, inflammatory, and physiologic conditions. If the patients have any symptoms concerning for a pulmonary embolism, a CT angiogram (CTA) thorax with pulmonary embolism protocol should be obtained. Alternatively, a ventilation-perfusion study can diagnose pulmonary embolism as well, but CTA thorax remains the study of choice.
