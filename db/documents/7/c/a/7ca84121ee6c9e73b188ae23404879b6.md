The presentation of mesenteric artery thrombosis is fairly consistent. The most common presenting complaint is abdominal pain which is classically out of proportion to the physical exam findings. Pain is typically moderate to severe, diffuse and constant. Other presenting symptoms may include nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding.  In a study of acute mesenteric ischemia, 95% of patients presented with abdominal pain, 44% presented with nausea, 35% presented with vomiting, 35% presented with diarrhea, and 16% presented with rectal bleeding.
