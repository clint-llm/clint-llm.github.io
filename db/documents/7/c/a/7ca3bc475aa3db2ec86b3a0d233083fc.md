In general, meningiomas account for approximately 37% of all primary central nervous system tumors and 50% of all benign primary central nervous system tumors.

Intraventricular meningiomas typically present between 30 and 60 years of age. The mean age at diagnosis is 42.2 +/- 8.2 years old.

The lateral ventricle is the most common location (88.4%), with a minority found in the fourth ventricle (8.7%) or third ventricle (2.9%).

In the pediatric population, intraventricular location is common, occurring in approximately 20% of the meningioma cases at a mean age of 12 to 14 years.
