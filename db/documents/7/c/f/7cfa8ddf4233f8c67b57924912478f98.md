Suturing is a foundational surgical skill that must be mastered to provide optimal outcomes for our patients. Unfortunately, there often is a lack of suturing guidance within the dental field. We can learn from our medical colleagues who frequently use silicone suturing molds in medical school and residency before suturing real human tissue. As dentoalveolar surgeons, we can utilize silicone training models to hone our skills and practice the basic knots and suturing methods previously discussed in the article. This enables us as clinicians to develop competency before suturing within a patient’s mouth. In addition, many suturing materials and instructions are available to those pursuing a surgical specialty or general practitioners desiring to perform more dentoalveolar surgery.

A study where 38 medical students completed surveys regarding confidence before and after completing a suturing lab with silicone models unsurprisingly revealed that all students felt more comfortable with their suturing capabilities after performing the suturing labs. The study's goal was to perform a quantitative measure of the competence and confidence gained by the students.

Practice on silicone models before live patients is not only optimal, but ethical. There are numerous resources to improve suturing competency. It is our responsibility as dental professionals to utilize the resources available and take the initiative to hone our suturing skills before performing dentoalveolar surgery on patients.
