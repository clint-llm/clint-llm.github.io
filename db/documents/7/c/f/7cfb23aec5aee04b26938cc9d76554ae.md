Fentanyl is an extremely potent opioid and requires monitoring due to the low therapeutic drug concentration. A blood concentration of 0.6 ng/ml to 3.0 ng/ml is appropriate for analgesia. The gold standard method of determining fentanyl concentration for monitoring is Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Alternative methods of monitoring included radioimmunoassay. However, it is known to overestimate concentrations of fentanyl by 29 to 100%. Monitoring Fentanyl is increasingly important when the patient is subject to polypharmacy. Notable drugs to pay special attention to are those which inhibit CYP3A4 metabolism and cause an increase in Fentanyl concentration leading to toxicity. Examples of such medications include azole class antifungals as well asÂ macrolide antibiotics.

CYP3A4 inducers may also reduce the level of fentanyl to a non-therapeutic level causing the patient inadequate analgesia and distress. Such drugs include rifampin, phenytoin, and carbamazepine.
