The management of Swyer-James-MacLeod syndrome is patient-centered and delivered using the interprofessional team approach.

Conservative management is the mainstay of treatment.

Prevention and prompt treatment of recurrent respiratory infections: Primary prevention such asÂ pneumococcal and influenza vaccination is necessary.

Surgical intervention is reserved for (1) patients with recurrent pulmonary infections, (2) patients who fail to respond, or (3) patients whose symptoms are not adequately controlled with optimal medical management. Surgical options include pneumonectomy or lung volume reduction surgery, such as lobectomy or segmentectomy.

An interesting new approach has also been proposed in one study, where patients underwent occlusion of the main bronchus while the lung was left in place.
