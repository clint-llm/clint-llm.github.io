Evaluation of dental caries involves using various techniques like the visual-tactile method, radiographs, fiberoptic illumination (FOTI), and digital fiberoptic illumination (DIFOTI). The most common and easiest method is the conventional visual-tactile method. Several radiographic techniques are effective to detect caries radiographically, such as intraoral periapical radiograph and bitewing radiograph for occluso-proximal caries.

The International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS) is a useful tool for detecting and recording caries. This system classifies carious lesions into six categories, where a higher score correlates with a more advanced lesion. The ICDAS tracks the progression of carious lesions and is an accurate and reproducible caries classification system.

Newer diagnostic devices, including laser fluorescence detection and light-induced fluorescence, provide extra information on the carious lesion. Light-induced fluorescence can show the lesion’s extension, specific location, and bacterial activity
