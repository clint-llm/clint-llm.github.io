Bisacodylâ€™s target of action is the gastrointestinal tract.

BPHM has a dual activity in the colon, including an anti-absorptive-secretory effect and a direct prokinetic effect by stimulating parasympathetic nerve endings in the colonic mucosa.

Ratnaike et al. demonstrated that bisacodyl impairs fluid absorption by activating adenylate cyclase in the small intestinal enterocytes, which increases the amount of cyclic AMP, and causes the active secretion of Cl- and HCO3-, passive efflux of Na+, K+ and water, and inhibition of Na+ and Cl- absorption into the enterocyte.

Bassotti et al. investigated the effect of a 10 mg bisacodyl solution. They found that about 90% of patients with slow transit constipation showed motor response characterized by one or more high amplitude propagated contractions (HAPCs).
