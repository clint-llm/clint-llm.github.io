Sarcocystosis is considered a zoonotic disease with a complex interplay between animals and humans. Only two species, including S. hominis and S. suihominis,Â have humans as definitive hosts in their life cycles. There may be multiple species that have humans as an intermediate host or as a dead-end host. Sarcocystosis is also considered an emerging disease, which, coupled with the zoonotic aspects of the disease, highlights the importance of a one health approach to treating, controlling, and preventing the disease.
