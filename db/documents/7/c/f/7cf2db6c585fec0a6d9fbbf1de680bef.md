A complete history of modifiable etiologies and risk factors is important. Ascertain about prenatal care and the date of the last menstrual cycle and calculate the due date. This is crucial because the further along the fetus, the more complications will develop, and intervention may be more surgical than expectant or medical treatment. The amount of bleeding and evaluation for ongoing bleeding should be elicited, as well as if any tissue or clots have been passed. Saturating more than one pad an hour suggests heavy bleeding and requires emergent attention. A large amount of blood clots also is indicative of heavy bleeding.

Cramping is rhythmic similar to labor, but less intense. Obtain and monitor vital signs frequently for early signs of shock from blood loss. A fever is concerning for infection and possible septic abortion, which requires emergent surgical intervention. An incomplete abortion usually presents with moderate to severe vaginal bleeding and isÂ frequently accompanied by lower abdominal and/or pelvic pain that is suprapubic, which may radiate to the lower back, buttocks, genitalia, and perineum.

In almost all cases, the pelvic exam will reveal an open cervical os with products of conception readily visible. There may have already been the expulsion of some fetal tissue.
