Clinical applications of the ABR include identification of suspected neurological abnormalities of the cranial nerve VIII as well as the associated auditory pathways and the estimation of hearing sensitivity for those who are not able to accurately provide behavioral hearing evaluation information.

ABR has been the gold standard for assessing and confirming hearing loss in infants who fail their newborn hearing screen. Testing takes place while the infant is asleep or sedated with thresholds highly correlative with those of conventional behavioral audiometry.

ABR is also indicated for young children or even adults with inconclusive audiometric thresholds or who are unable to tolerate conventional behavioral audiometry testing.

In addition to hearing loss, ABR can be used to diagnose vestibular schwannomas, brainstem lesions, de-myelination disease, and auditory neuropathy. ABR has a diagnostic accuracy of 92 to 98% for large acoustic tumors (> 1.5 cm),

ABR can identify neural dysfunction in non-tumor, demyelinating diseases such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, syphilis, Wilson’s disease, and viral infections.
