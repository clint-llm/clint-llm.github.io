The anterior cruciate ligament is one of the two cruciate ligaments that aids in stabilizing the knee joint. It is the most commonly injured ligament in the knee, commonly occurring in football, soccer, and basketball players. Treatment consists of the "RICE" therapy, which includes rest, ice, compression of the affected knee, and elevation of the affected lower extremity. This activity describes the evaluation and management strategies for such injuries and stresses the role of team-based interprofessional care for patients with anterior cruciate ligament injuries.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the clinical features of anterior cruciate ligament injuries.
- Outline the detailed evaluation in patients with anterior cruciate ligament injuries.
- Explain the management and long-term rehabilitation of patients with anterior cruciate ligament injuries.
- Review the need for improved care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to enhance care delivery and prevent long-term disability in patients with anterior cruciate ligament injuries.
