The majority of zipper injury cases are in children and younger teenagers. The overall incidence is quite low, comprising less than 0.5% of all emergency room pediatric visits. The most common cause is having the foreskin becomes caught between the two sides of the zipper during closure due to distraction or inattention. This also occurs in adults who are unable to dress themselves due to dementia, congenital disabilities, traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy, spinal cord injuries, and similar conditions. Other people will need to close the zipper when dressing in these patients.

The exact incidence of penile ring entrapments is unknown, but it is considered quite rare, with less than 100 cases reported in the medical literature.
