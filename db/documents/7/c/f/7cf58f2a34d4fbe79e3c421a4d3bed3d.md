Balloon valvuloplastyÂ is a cardiac intervention to open up a stenotic or stiffed heart valves (e.g., aortic or mitral) using a catheter with a balloon on the tip. It is also known as balloon valvotomy. It is a less invasive procedure because it is done by inserting a catheter into the blood vessel from groin percutaneously rather than valve replacement with cardiothoracic surgical or other open methods. Balloon valvulotomy has several types, depending upon which heart valve is involved for example:

- Percutaneous balloon tricuspid valvuloplasty

- Percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty

- Percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty

- Percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty
