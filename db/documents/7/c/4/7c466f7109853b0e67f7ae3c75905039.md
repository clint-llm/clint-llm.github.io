Sensory neuropathies refer to a host of diseases that result in loss of sensation throughout the body. Collectively, sensory neuropathies can result from a plethora of conditions that this review will discuss. These may further sub-divide into small fiber (pain-dominant) and large fiber (ataxia-predominant) pathologies.

When classifying sensory neuropathy for appropriate treatment and management, nerve size and degree of myelination play a pivotal role. When assessing small fiber neuropathies, the small somatic fibers (Aδ and small unmyelinated C fibers) are of particular interest. These fibers transmit noxious and thermal signals and regulate preganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic function (Aδ fibers), as well as postganglionic autonomic function (C fibers).

In contrast, large fiber neuropathies result from the attenuation of Aβ fibers, which regulate the proprioceptive signals of vibration and touch. Grossly speaking, patients with sensory ataxia likely possess deformation to the dorsal columns of the spinal cord as well as the dorsal root ganglia.
