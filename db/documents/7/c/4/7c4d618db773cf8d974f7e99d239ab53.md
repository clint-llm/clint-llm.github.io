Smokeless tobacco keratosis results from chronic irritation from the placement of smokeless tobacco, usually in the buccal vestibule. This irritation results in the deposition of excess fibrin-like material throughout the submucosa and an increase in keratin production, which results in the characteristic white corrugated appearance of the epithelium (the mucosa).

Leukoplakia and erythroplakia are clinically diagnostic terms. These lesions can be the result of multiple pathophysiological processes that result in their appearance.

Verrucous carcinoma, a low-grade presentation of squamous cell carcinoma, has an increased keratin production giving a verrucous, wart-like appearance. In addition, there is the thickening of the epithelium (hyperplasia); however, very little if any dysplasia is seen within the epithelium.

Squamous cell carcinoma develops due to dysplastic changes throughout the epithelium, disrupting the basement membrane and invasion into the connective tissue. These changes cause abnormal growth or atrophy of epithelial tissue.
