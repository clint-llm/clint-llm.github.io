Prevention bundles have proven effective in reducing morbidity and mortality associated with VAE. Activities based on a patient-centered approach, such as ward rounds targeted at the evaluation of prevention bundle execution, active steps to ameliorate deficiencies in bundle execution, staff educational activities, and participation of hospital administration and physicians in multidisciplinary efforts may lead to significant improvements in the rate of VAE.

Further research in the domain of VAE prevention, treatment, epidemiology, quality-of-care, and related aspects requires the skills and participation of scientists, physicians, nurses, and other multidisciplinary professionals and contributes to the collective body of knowledge and advancement of the cause of improving clinical outcomes of mechanically ventilated patients.
