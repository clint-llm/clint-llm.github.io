The prognosis of AMI is poor, with patients experiencing high morbidity and mortality rates. While there is a downward trend in mortality rates since the 1960s, the AMI mortality range remains high, occurring at rates between 60% and 80%. The specific AMI classification affects the likelihood of mortality, with acute embolism having a better prognosis, followed by NOMI and acute thrombosis. Factors associated with mortality include advanced age, bowel resection during second-look surgery, metabolic acidosis, renal insufficiency, and symptom duration.

A study by Gupta et al. found a 30-day morbidity rate of 56%. Major postoperative 30-day complications included ventilator use over 48 hours, septic shock, pneumonia, and sepsis. Follow-up surgical interventions were common, with 30% of patients revisiting the surgicalÂ department in 30-days, and 14% of patients having a hospital stay longer than 30 days.
