Dysfunction in aqueous humor circulation, leading to high IOP, is a significant risk factor for glaucoma. Glaucoma is a progressive, irreversible disease of the eye in which IOP becomes pathologically high, which can ultimately lead to visual field loss and blindness. The normal IOP is 12 to 20 mmHg, with pressures maintained above 25 to 30 mmHg for long periods leading to vision loss. In most cases of glaucoma, the high IOP results from increased resistance to fluid outflow, though an increased production of aqueous humor is also a factor.

Glaucoma is a set of optic neuropathies associated with, but not exclusively caused by, high IOP. As pressure within the eye rises, optic nerve axons become compressed at the optic disc. Compression of the optic nerve blocks the flow of cytoplasm down the axon into the optic nerve fibers. Lacking the oxygen and nutrients needed from the cytoplasm, the optic nerve becomes ischemic, ultimately leading to visual field loss and blindness of the individual. It is important to note that high IOP alone does not cause glaucoma. When the IOP is above normal, but the individual does not show signs of glaucoma, this is termed ocular hypertension.

The two most common forms of glaucoma are primary open-angle glaucoma and primary angle-closure glaucoma. The term "angle" refers to the angle between the iris and cornea, the location of aqueous humor drainage.

Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is characterized by progressive loss of peripheral visual fields, followed by central field loss. In many but not all instances, POAG may be present in the presence of elevated IOP. Two possible mechanisms explaining POAG include decreased aqueous humor outflow and increased aqueous humor production. Findings on ophthalmoscopic examination include "cupping" of the optic nerve.

Primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) occurs when the peripheral aspect of the iris obstructs aqueous outflow, leading to increased IOP and damage to the optic nerve. Patients typically experience sudden and painful vision loss due to acute elevation of IOP.
