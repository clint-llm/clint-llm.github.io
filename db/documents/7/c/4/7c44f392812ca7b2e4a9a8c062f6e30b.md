As previously mentioned, the spleen is an organ of high vascularity. The splenic artery primarily supplies the organ arterially, entering the splenic hilum near the middle of the visceral surface. The splenic artery branches off of the celiac trunk and runs within the splenorenal ligament, lateral and across the superior pancreatic aspect. Upon approaching the spleen, the splenic artery divides into 5 branches which supply blood to different regions of the organ. The result of this is vascular segmentation of the spleen as the 5 sub-branches do not anastomose. The splenic vein allows for the venous drainage of the spleen. It also runs from the hilum and runs posteriorly to the pancreas and later joins with the superior mesenteric vein to constitute the portal vein. The spleen is a major organ of the lymphatic system, and as such contains lymphatic vessels not necessarily in proper splenic tissue, but rather some arisen from the capsule region. However, the lymphatic vessels of the spleen are solely efferent lymphatic vessels, with the spleen acting analogously to a large lymph node supplying lymph material to neighboring nodes such as the pancreaticosplenic lymph nodes.
