Females frequently develop UTIs due to the urethra being close to the vagina and rectum, which can lead to the unintentional introduction of fecal flora into the urinary tract. The bacteria ascend from the urethra to the bladder in cystitis. If the bacteria ascend from the bladder via the ureters to the kidneys, then pyelonephritis develops. Pyelonephritis can also occur due to the seeding of the kidneys from bacteremia via the lymphatic system. When males develop UTIs, including prostatitis, it is usually due to an obstruction such as a urinary stone or enlarged prostate. The insertion of a chronic indwelling urinary catheter is also a risk factor for the development of UTIs. Organisms can be introduced into the urinary tract from a catheter via a patient's fecal or skin contaminants or healthcare personnel contact. Urinary catheters can lead to the growth of uropathogens by providing a site for adhesion in addition to disrupting normal host defenses.
