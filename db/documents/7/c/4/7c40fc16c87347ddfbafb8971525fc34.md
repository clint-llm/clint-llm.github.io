Cholesterol embolization syndrome occurs either spontaneously or after intraarterial procedures such as aortic or cardiac surgery or thrombolytic therapy. About 80% of cholesterol embolism results from the intraarterial procedure, while less than 5% atheroembolism is due to spontaneous cholesterol embolism.

The exact incidence of CES is not known, but the reported incidence of clinically evident cholesterol embolism in the literature is generally less than 3.5%. Cholesterol emboli are much more common in patients 60 years or older who have atherosclerotic heart disease. For instance, studies that have looked at the incidence of CES by doing an autopsy in elderly who died after some form of intraarterial procedure found evidence of atheroembolism 10% to 77% of the time. In contrast, few autopsy studies of the generalized patient population reported CES incidence of only 0.31 to 2.4 percent.
