The following are recommendations when health professionals terminate the patient-provider relationship.

- Sending a termination letter to the patient by certified mail with a return receipt requested. Keep a copy of the termination letter and all documentation of communication about the termination. If the physician works in a group, the termination letter should specify if the termination is between a specific provider or all the provider group.

- Providing the patient with an explanation for termination, however, providing a reason is not required and up to the provider's discretion, depending on what the reason may be. The AMA advises not to disclose the reason for dismissal. Another option is the include a vague phrase such as "the therapeutic benefit or alliance between patient and physician no longer exists."

- Agreeing to continue to provide treatment and medication refills for a reasonable period of time, such as thirty days since being notified, until the patient can secure care from another provider. Up to ninety days may be needed if there are no other providers available within reasonable driving distance of the patient. For example, patients living in rural areas may need more time to obtain a new provider located within a reasonable driving distance.

- Providing resources and recommendations to the patient about other physicians who may accept the patient and patient's insurance.

- Offering to transfer and promptly transferring records to the new provider upon signed patient authorization and being available to discuss the case to avoid lapses of patient care.
