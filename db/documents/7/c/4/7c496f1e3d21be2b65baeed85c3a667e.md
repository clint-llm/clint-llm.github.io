**Oral Candidiasis**

Oral candidiasis has a good prognosis when treated appropriately.

**Aspergillosis**

The prognosis of disseminated aspergillosis is poor for immunocompromised patients.

**Mucormycosis**

Mucormycosis has a poor prognosis and is fatal in almost all cases of immunocompromised patients if dissemination occurs.

**Histoplasmosis**

Prognosis is dependent on the immune status of the patient. HIV patients presenting with severe pulmonary and renal impairment have a poor prognosis. Disseminated histoplasmosis can be fatal if not treated.

**Blastomycosis**

The mortality rate is approximately 2 to 6%. It is higher in patients with disseminated disease. Immunocompromised patients have a poor prognosis.

**Cryptococcosis**

Cryptococcosis can be life-threatening in patients with AIDS. Prognosis in HIV patients depends on antiretroviral therapy. Treatment with antiretrovirals during antifungal therapy can cause cryptococcal immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Cryptococcal meningitis has a poor prognosis and a high mortality rate.

**Paracoccidiomycosis**

The prognosis depends on the severity of the disease.

**Geotrichosis**

Oral geotrichosis responds well to treatment.
