# Continuing Education Activity

Dysphonia occurs when there is an alteration in normal voice quality which can be due to structural and/or functional causes. Dysphonia is common and can develop at any age. This activity reviews the evaluation and underlying etiologies of dysphonia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the process of evaluating and treating patients with dysphonia.

**Objectives:**
- Explain common physical exam findings and other symptoms associated with dysphonia.
- Identify risk factors associated with laryngeal malignancy.
- Identify indications for further evaluation of dysphonia.

# Introduction

Dysphonia is the impairment of voice production as diagnosed by a clinician, often used interchangeably with the complaint of hoarseness, which is a symptom of altered voice quality. While many patients experience dysphonia as a natural part of the aging process, it can be a symptom of a serious underlying condition. Clinicians need to recognize that when patients present with dysphonia for longer than four weeks and/or when it is associated with risk factors or other concerning signs and symptoms, further evaluation is warranted.

# Etiology

The pathophysiology of dysphonia is characterized by irregularities in vocal fold oscillations related to muscle tone irregularity, which may be due to hypertonicity, incomplete closure of the glottis during phonation, a change in vocal fold bulk, or a vocal fold lesion or tumor.

The main risk factor for premalignant and malignant laryngeal cancer is smoking, with squamous cell carcinoma cited as the most common vocal fold malignancy, comprising 85-95% of vocal fold cancers.

# Epidemiology

Dysphonia has a lifetime prevalence of 30% and can affect patients of all ages and genders, with an increased prevalence in patients who use their voice more often such as with singers, teachers, coaches, and telephone operators.

# History and Physical

The history obtained in voice evaluation should include the description of the voice problems, such as the quality of the voice, fatigability, pitch range, loudness, phonatory effort, breathlessness or presence of conversational dyspnea, and/or impaired singing voice. Patients should also be questioned about past voice disorders and treatments, surgeries, medical history, current medications, environmental factors, and voice habits (hygiene). Understanding which component the patient finds most bothersome is critical.

Associated signs and symptoms with dysphonia that would be concerning for laryngeal malignancy may include weight loss, aspiration, and/or dysphagia. In later stages of laryngeal cancer, dyspnea and otalgia may be present. Other symptoms to ask about include cough and hemoptysis, which could indicate signs of malignancy. Questions about the history of reflux such as heartburn are also pertinent. Patients presenting with dysphonia should be screened for a history of smoking, alcohol use, neck radiation, and/or family history of head and neck cancer.

Hoarseness may be the only abnormal physical exam finding. Voice can be assessed both formally and informally while engaging the patient in conversation, at which time the clinician can evaluate the following components of voice: quality, pitch, nasality, loudness, prosody, and articulation. It is also important to note if any of the following are present: aphonia, tremor, glottic fry, diplophonia (two spontaneous pitches perceived simultaneously), and wet voice.

An auditory-perceptual evaluation of the voice is performed; the two most common systems are the GRBAS and CAPE-V scales. The GRBAS scale is the gold standard in evaluating the perception of voice and assesses the following components: grade (degree of voice dysfunction), roughness (irregularity), breathiness (air escape), asthenia (weakness), and strain (excessive effort) with each parameter graded on a 4 point scale with 0 being normal and 3 being severe.

In addition to the perceptual voice assessment, a full head and neck examination should be performed at the initial encounter. Attention should be given to the patient’s respiratory pattern, noting any patterns of breath-holding or habitual use of residual air.

# Evaluation

Several patient questionnaires have been created and validated to help with the initial evaluation and ongoing management to assess for response to treatment. The Voice Handicap Index (VHI-10) provides insight into the functional and emotional aspects of the patient’s voice disturbance and is the most widely used patient survey.

Patients are referred to the Otolaryngologist for an in-office laryngoscopy, which evaluates both the laryngeal structure and function. The most commonly used instruments are mirrors, flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopes, or rigid endoscopes. During a flexible or rigid endoscopy, patient examinations can be easily recorded and documented while the patient is vocalizing. These examinations provide valuable knowledge as the vocal folds can be directly visualized and may identify mucosal abnormalities that may not necessarily be seen on computed tomography scans or magnetic resonance imaging.

Videostroboscopy uses pulsed light synchronized with the patient’s vocal frequency to give the illusion of slow-motion mucosal oscillation of the vocal fold. This is the single best diagnostic instrument in evaluating dysphonia to obtain information on mucosal pliability. The following components of the glottic cycle are obtained through stroboscopy: uniformity of glottic cycles (regularity), mucosal waveform, the symmetry of the folds in both the lateral and vertical planes, and pattern of incomplete versus complete versus partial closure. Stroboscopy is useful because it can detect abnormalities that may not be seen on a flexible or rigid endoscopy exam. Patients with malignant tumors may also benefit from surveillance via stroboscopy.

# Treatment / Management

Treatment options for the underlying diagnosis of dysphonia may include speech and language therapy, medical management, surgery, and/or a combination of the above.

Generally, steroids and antibiotics are not given for dysphonia with unclear etiology.

Speech and language therapy is typically the first-line treatment option for patients with dysphonia who do not otherwise meet indications for surgical intervention (e.g., no suspicion of malignancy and/or vocal cord immobility identified on laryngoscopy or video stroboscopy examination). Speech therapy is often successful and still the first line, even when patients present with benign vocal fold nodules.

Surgery is an option for patients with benign vocal fold lesions that do not respond to speech therapy. Meanwhile, patients who present with laryngeal dystonias may require interventions such as botulinum toxin injections, which have shown benefit in patients with disorders such as laryngeal dystonia/spasmodic dysphonia.

Patients diagnosed with laryngeal cancer may require chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, or a combination of these modalities, depending on the stage of their presentation.

# Prognosis

The prognosis for patients presenting with dysphonia is variable and dependent on the underlying condition. Patient prognosis can range from poor to excellent. Patients who have acute laryngitis only requiring symptomatic treatment will usually recover in 1 to 3 weeks. Meanwhile, patients with muscle tension dysphonia, vocal fold nodules/polyps, or other functional dysphonia may require voice rest and/or several sessions of speech therapy to experience improvement in symptoms.

Patients with early-stage laryngeal cancer have reported 5-year survival rates of up to 95% while those with late-stage laryngeal cancer have 5-year survival rates ranging from 30% to 63% with the most frequent cause of death being due to metastasis. The stark difference in prognosis between early and late-stage laryngeal cancer prognosis demonstrates the significance of identifying laryngeal cancer early.

# Complications

Complications from an injection of any type of material into the vocal fold are typically due to the inability to fully visualize the vocal folds and include excessive secretions, paraglottic hemorrhage, bleeding, postoperative hematoma, and edema. Airway compromise and aspiration are rare complications of vocal fold injections, reported to be less than 5%.

Complications of laryngeal surgery such as procedures to medialize the vocal fold include postoperative hematoma, edema, infection, need for tracheostomy due to airway obstruction, implant migration or extrusion, failure to achieve adequate medialization, and need for revision surgery.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Laryngeal cancer should be on the differential for any patients who present with prolonged hoarseness or with risk factors to include worsening dyspnea, aspiration, and/or weight loss. Clinicians should seek consultation with an Otolaryngologist for further referral to exclude malignancy.

Patients presenting with persistent dysphonia that does not resolve after four weeks or worsens should seek attention from their medical provider. Voice rest and speech therapy is often the first-line treatment option for benign laryngeal lesions and muscle tension dysphonia.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Dysphonia is a common complaint that can affect up to one-third of the adult population. All healthcare providers must recognize that dysphonia may be an underlying symptom of a condition that requires prompt medical attention and further evaluation. Failure to evaluate the larynx promptly can delay cancer diagnosis resulting in poorer patient outcomes. Dysphonia may be the first presenting symptom of an underlying neurological condition warranting further evaluation by a neurologist.
