Atypical mycobacteria contain a hydrophobic mycolic acid layer in their cell wall. Due to this property, they are not typically seen using Gram staining. The best method for detecting atypical mycobacteria is fluorochrome staining, a type of acid-fast staining where these bacteria will appear as yellow to orange bacilli. Of note, rapidly growing mycobacteria are frequently not seen even with fluorochrome staining, and atypical mycobacteria overall are visualized in only 30% to 60% of cases. Rapidly growing mycobacteria are noted to be more sensitive to the decolorization process in acid-fast staining. It is thought that using more delicate methods for decolorization can increase the chance of visualizing these bacteria. Other less sensitive staining methods that may also be used include the Ziehl-Neelsen method and the Kinyoun stain.
