In pediatric cases, a pediatrician and pulmonary pediatrist coordinate among themselves to plan a treatment option. Cardiothoracic surgery is needed for lobectomy, chest tube, pigtail catheter, and fibrin sealant injections.

In adult cases, surgeons (trauma, cardiothoracic), pulmonologists are needed to make a decision in terms of management that varies from case to case. The ICU team is involved in critically ill and hemodynamically unstable patients.
