The diagnosis of LSD intoxication is clinical. A thorough history and physical requires emphasis; this is not to say other testing modalities are not necessary. In complicated cases, coagulation studies and serum electrolytes should be obtained, especially when seizures are present or neuroleptic malignant syndrome is suspected. Imaging studies are warranted to rule out other diagnoses. Electrocardiography is appropriate to evaluate tachycardias, bradycardias, and other arrhythmias, not necessarily caused by LSD itself, but possibly from coingestion with other potent stimulants, such as MDMA.

Any routine drug test does not detect the substance. However, a recent study in 2015 by Dolder et al. sought to quantify LSD and its main metabolite, 2-oxo-3-hydroxy LSD (abbreviated as O-H-LSD), in the serum, as well as in urine samples, primarily in the emergency setting. Their methods were both accurate and precise in quantifying the expected concentrations in subjects intoxicated by LSD, but their approach has not found wide adoption in clinical settings.

Berg et al. used ultra-performance liquid chromatography to determine concentrations of LSD in serum in a 2013 study. Concentrations of 1.5 to 5.5 ng/mL were present 24 hours after patients ingested 300-microgram doses of the substance. Due to the complexity surrounding the methods, this method is also not adopted to an appreciable degree.
