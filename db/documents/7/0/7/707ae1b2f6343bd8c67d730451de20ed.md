Mastalgia refers to a common breast pain that a female suffers from during her lifetime. Approximately two-thirds of women develop this pain during their reproductive life and seek medical attention either because it adversely affects their daily life or out of the fear of any serious underlying pathology like breast cancer. The breast pain ranges from mild to severe, could be intermittent or constant; but requires adequate evaluation and proper treatment. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of mastalgia and highlights the role of the health care team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of mastalgia.
- Describe the evaluation of mastalgia.
- Summarize the management options available for mastalgia.
