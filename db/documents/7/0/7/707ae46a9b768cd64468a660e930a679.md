Nipple inversion is a condition with cosmetic and psychological implications for the patient, and it is best managed with an interprofessional team approach. The treating clinician should be mindful of the primary reason for the correction, whether it is the establishment of functionality or improving the physical appearance. Proper patient counseling regarding the condition, along with the available treatment options, helps them make an informed choice about their management. The most important distinction is between benign, congenital, nipple inversion, and malignancy. There should be a low threshold for the surgeon to obtain a biopsy or other intervention to ensure malignancy is not overlooked.
