Vasovagal syncope is the most common type of syncope.

Mostly benign but can be life-threatening in patients with underlying cardiac arrhythmia.

ECG is the most useful test in syncope, but its diagnostic yield is only 5%, leaving careful history and physical examination as the most valuable tools in evaluating a syncopal event.

Following a syncopal event, patients should be instructed not to drive or operate heavy machinery at least until the completion of their workup or follow up with their primary care provider.

Mental illness and substance abuse should be considered in syncope patients where the etiology of syncope remains unclear.
