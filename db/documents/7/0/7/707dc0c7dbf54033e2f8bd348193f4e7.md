**Monitoring**

**ICU Delirium Assessments:**

The Confusion Assessment Method-ICU (CAM-ICU) and the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) are both extensively validated and used for delirium diagnosis and evaluation of delirium over time.

The CAM-ICU provides two steps. In the first one, the level of consciousness/arousal is evaluated through a standardized sedation scale such as the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS). This latter is a 10-point scale ranging from +4 to -5, where a RASS value of 0 indicates a calm and alert patient; RASS scores of -4 and -5 are indicative of coma and cannot be further assessed for delirium. All other individuals (moderately sedated, RASS score -3 or more alert) should also be evaluated through the second step assesses patients for four characteristics of delirium. The categories include acute onset of altered mental status, inattention, disorganized thinking, or altered level of consciousness. Three out of four features are required for a diagnosis of delirium. The tools, validated in 1990, has been updated by Marcantonio et al.

Through the ICDSC, the level of consciousness is firstly evaluated on a 5-point scale (A to E) that ranges from unresponsive (A) to exaggerated response (E). Patients who are scored in the categories 'A=No response' or 'B=Response to intense and repeated stimulation' are no further assessed. The other patients (C to E levels of consciousness) are checked for information collected during the previous 24 hours, investigating eight items (rated present or absent) with a total score of 0 to 8. A score of 4 or greater is considered diagnostic of delirium.

Other evaluations

In addition to the tools for ICU detection, a careful clinical assessment must be performed. For instance, it is mandatory to perform frequent vitals and/or neuro checks.

**Pharmacological and Non-pharmacological Management Strategies:**

It is generally accepted that there are no identified therapies (medications or interventions) proven to decrease the duration of delirium. As a consequence, treating the underlying physiological insult is of key importance. Also, other interventions should be considered for delirium management:

- Treatment of the underlying cause

- Correction of potential electrolyte disturbances

- Removal of offending pharmacological agents

- Maintain proper sleep/wake cycles

- Manage pain

- Address sensory impairments (hearing, vision)

- Encourage family visits and frequent reorientation.

- Early mobilization

Interventions for symptomatic ICU treatment can be divided into pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies.

Medications

There is much debate regarding the utility of antipsychotics and other medications such as physostigmine, rivastigmine, and donepezil in preventing and decreasing the duration of delirium. In the ICU setting, although there is no evidence that treatment with haloperidol will reduce the duration of delirium, it is the most commonly adopted treatment. Moreover, there is some evidence that atypical antipsychotics may be useful.

- Antipsychotics. This category includes haloperidol and atypical antipsychotics. Haloperidol is a dopamine (D2) receptor antagonist. It is given at the dosage of 2-10 mg (IV every six h); it is useful, especially in the hyperactive form. Atypical antipsychotics used for this purpose are olanzapine (IM 5-10 mg; max: 30 mg/d), risperidone (0.5-8 mg), quetiapine (orally 50 mg; max 400 mg/d), and ziprasidone. A special issue concerns antipsychotics-related toxicity. For instance, cardiotoxicity such as QT interval (QT) prolongation, torsade de pointes, hypotension is reported at high doses haloperidol, whereas a dosage of 2 mg can be safely administered.

- Dexmedetomidine. This alpha-2-adrenergic agonist with sedative, analgesic, and anxiolytic actions is useful in adults under MV when hyperactive delirium can obstacle the weaning. Due to the low-quality evidence of investigations assessed, a panel of experts did not recommend its use.

- Short-acting benzodiazepines (BDZs). These agents, such as midazolam and lorazepam, can have a neurogenic effect. They are exclusively useful in patients with alcohol or sedative withdrawal, or for delirium resulting from seizures.

- Other drugs. Although rivastigmine, donepezil, physostigmine has been proposed for ICU delirium management, evidence of effectiveness is currently very scarce.

Non-pharmacological interventions

- Behavioral strategies. This category includes several strategies focused on patient reorientation useful in cooperative patients with delirium. Occupational therapy

- Mobilization. Early ICU mobility therapy can accelerate MV weaning, ICU length of stay, and delirium duration.

- Use of restraints. Careful use of soft restraints only if and after behavioral and pharmacological interventions fail if reasonably possible. The use of restraints should be used for the shortest possible time and should be focused to deter a specific behavior that is impeding the delivery of care.

**Prevention**

In the general medical ward, there is some evidence that targeting modifiable risk factors and multicomponent patient-centered approaches may decrease the incidence and average duration of delirium. These include interventions improving cognitive impairment, good sleep hygiene, mobility, vision, and hearing. Besides, strategies for preventing infection, dehydration, constipation, and hypoxia are mandatory.

A mnemonic ABCDEF bundle was proposed for assessing and preventing the complication.

- A=Assess, prevent and manage pain

- B=Both Spontaneous Breathing Trials and Spontaneous Awakening Trials

- C=Choice of sedation and analgesia

- D=Delirium: assess, prevent and manage

- E=Early mobility and exercise

- F=Family engagement and empowerment
