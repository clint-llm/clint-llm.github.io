Cystitis cystica and related pathologies have no unique symptoms. They may present with non-specific symptoms similar to many other urinary diseases and conditions, making the diagnosis more challenging.

The patient may complain of various symptoms.

- Hematuria

- Symptoms of a urinary tract infection

- Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) include frequency, urgency, incomplete emptying, and hematuria

- Pain (suprapubic or perianal)

- Obstructive urinary symptoms

- Rarely, urine retention and hydronephrosis

Other differential diagnoses need to be excluded with detailed history taking, including medical, social, sexual, and family history, accompanied by a focused genito-urinary examination.
