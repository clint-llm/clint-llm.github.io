Diabetes and subsequent hyperglycemia results in the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). The specific etiology of diabetic retinopathy is unclear and likely, the result of many interplaying factors. AGEs are osmotically active, and they may be responsible for fluid accumulation in the macula. Diabetes also results in disruption of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB), and this is likely critical in the pathogenesis of diabetic associated macular edema. AGEs are also associated with increased inflammatory markers such as VEGF, leukocyte adhesion, and protein kinase C.
