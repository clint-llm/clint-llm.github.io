Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by behavioral changes and language deficits with frontal and temporal cortical degeneration. It is a heterogeneous condition featuring a variegated constellation of overlapping clinical, genetic, and pathological variables resulting in an individual phenotypic expression of disease. Often referred to as Pick's disease, this dementia syndrome commonly occurs in pre-senile patients and is divided into behavioral variant (bvFTD) and primary progressive aphasia (PPA) subtypes. PPA is further categorized as nonfluent/agrammatic variant (nfvPPA), semantic variant (svPPA), and logopenic aphasia. Motor neuron disease (FTD-MND), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP-S), and corticobasal syndrome (CBS) are overlapping syndromes falling within the spectrum of the frontotemporal diagnosis.

The natural history of frontotemporal dementia is marked by an insidious onset followed by a steady decline from diagnosis to death characterized by a significant physical, mental, social, and financial burden for patients, families, and caregivers.
