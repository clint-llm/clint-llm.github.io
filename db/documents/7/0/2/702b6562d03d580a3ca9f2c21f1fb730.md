Ptosis is classified into congenital or acquired based on the age of presentation; the latter is usually further categorized into five types based on etiology

- **Neurogenic:**It results from defective innervation of the levator muscle of upper eyelid. For example, third nerve palsy, Horner syndrome, Marcus Gunn jaw-winking syndrome, multiple sclerosis, etc.

- **Myogenic:**Levator muscle myopathy or defect at its neuromuscular junction causes the myogenic ptosis which includes myasthenia gravis, ocular myopathy, simple congenital, blepharophimosis syndrome, etc.

- **Mechanical**: Levator function bis impaired due to the mass effect of some abnormal external structure such as neoplasm, chalazion, contact lens in the upper fornix, scarring, etc.

- **Aponeurotic:**Also known as Involutional ptosis, it results from a defective levator aponeurosis due to aging, trauma, or postoperative complication.

- **Traumatic:**Any kind of direct or indirect trauma to the eyelid leading to levator transection, cicatrization, eyelid laceration or orbital rooftop fracture with ischemia can cause ptosis.
