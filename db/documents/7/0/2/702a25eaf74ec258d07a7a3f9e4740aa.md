Inappropriate endometrial tissue proliferation within the myometrium leads to symptoms through a variety of mechanisms. Normal endometrial tissue is responsible for prostaglandin production which drives the contractions of menstruation. Ectopic foci of adenomyosis lead to increased levels of prostaglandins which result in dysmenorrhea which characterizes the disease. Estrogen also drives endometrial proliferation, which medical therapies aim to reduce.

Heavy menstrual bleeding is thought to be caused by a combination of factors which include increased endometrial surface area, increased vascularization, abnormal uterine contractions, and increased cell signaling molecules such as prostaglandins, eicosanoids, and estrogen.
