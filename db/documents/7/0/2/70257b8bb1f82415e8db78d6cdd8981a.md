Oral supplementation of vitamin C has been hypothesized to lower the risk of development of CRPS after fractures due to its antioxidant properties. A meta-analysis of 3 trials in 2015 found that available evidence failed to demonstrate a definitive preventive role of vitamin C in CRPS development after distal radial fractures, although the level of evidence was low.
