In the World Mental Health Survey Initiative, the use of mental health services for the bipolar spectrum (BD-I, BD-II, and subthreshold BD) concluded, “Despite cross-site variation in the prevalence rates of bipolar spectrum disorder, the severity, impact, and patterns of comorbidity were remarkably similar internationally.” The aggregate lifetime prevalence of BD-I was 0.6%, BD-II 0.4%, subthreshold BD 1.4%, and bipolar spectrum 2.4%.

There are two peaks in the age of onset: 15-24 years and 45-54 years, with more than 70% of individuals manifesting clinical characteristics of the condition before 25 years of age.

Cyclothymia is associated with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 0.4-1% and a male-to-female ratio of 1:1.
