Infantile colic is one of the more distressing challenges for new parents and is a reason for 10% to 20% of pediatrician visits during the early weeks of an infant's life. Colic is estimated at affecting 5% to 40% of infants worldwide. The condition typically presents in the second or third week of life, peaks around 6 weeks, and usually resolves by the age of 12 weeks. Inconsolable crying, irritability, and screaming without an obvious cause characterize colic; during these episodes of fussiness, which occur more frequently in the evenings, the affected infant classically appears red-faced, draws up the legs and clenches the fists. The traditional methods of soothing the infant often fail to relieve the infant's distress. First described in 1954, the original "Rule of Three" diagnostic criteria (symptoms lasting for 3 hours per day, 3 or more days per week, for 3 or more weeks), has undergone a transition in recent years. The Rome IV criteria describe colic in infants from birth to 5 months of age to make the definition of infantile colic more consistent for research purposes. The criteria are as follows:

- Episodes of fussing or crying that start and stop without obvious causes

- Episodes lasting 3 or more hours daily, 3 or more days a week for 1 or more weeks

- Episodes without evidence for failure to thrive

While benign and self-limiting, the condition is frustrating for parents and has been linked to maternal postpartum depression and shaken baby syndrome. Since treatments for colic are controversial and inconsistent, the role of the physician as a counselor and educator to parents is critical.
