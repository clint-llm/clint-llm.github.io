Diabetes is a chronic disease that has a significant number of life-threatening complications, of which one of them is a foot ulcer. Diabetic foot is a common scenario in which healthcare workers will come across in daily practice.  Besides a lack of blood flow, many patients with diabetes mellitus with a foot ulcer also have neuropathy for which there is no cure. The diagnosis and subsequent management of a diabetic ulcer are optimally effective when utilizing an interprofessional approach to achieve the best outcome.

Many patients with diabetes mellitus with a foot ulcer end up with amputations and become disabled. Thus, today the key is preventing the foot ulcer with education. The pharmacist, nurse practitioner, the primary care provider should educate the patient on the harms of smoking and the need for better control of blood glucose. In addition, patients with diabetes mellitus need to be taught about appropriate shoe wear, podiatric care, and control of hyperlipidemia. The team, including the diabetic nurse educator and clinicians, must work together toward educating the patient and family on preventative measures to minimize morbidity and improve outcomes.

The social worker should be involved in the care to ensure that the patient with diabetes mellitus has support systems and finances so that care is not jeopardized. The dietitian should educate the patient on a healthy diet and the importance of maintaining a healthy weight. At every clinic visit, the feet must be examined for skin integrity, pulses and sensation. Appropriate referrals must be made if there are any deficiencies in the foot exam. Patients with diabetes mellitus should be told that anytime they have an open wound, they should seek immediate care and avoid homemade remedies. Only through an interprofessional approach with open communication can the morbidity of diabetic foot be reduced.
