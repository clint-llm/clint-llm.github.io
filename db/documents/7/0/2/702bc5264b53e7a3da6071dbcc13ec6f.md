In the United States, PKU is usually detected at birth by newborn screening tests and dietary therapy started in consultation with a dietitian and geneticist/metabolism specialist. Mild forms of PKU in a newborn can, however, go undetected if the mother is discharged too soon or if the newborn has not consumed any protein. Signs and symptoms of the disease that become more pronounced when untreated include delayed developmental milestones, microcephaly, hypopigmentation, hyperactivity/behavior problems, seizures, and a musty odor to skin and urine. However, affected children who are diagnosed and appropriately treated at birth are less likely to show symptoms. Long-term care focuses on adherence to dietary therapy, monitoring of blood Phe and Tyr levels and assessing for potential cognitive impairments.
