X-linked agammaglobulinemia is inherited in an X-linked manner. Most mutations in the BTK gene are familial; in those cases, the mothers of the affected individuals are healthy carriers. Approximately 50% of patients have a history of previously affected family members, while 15% to 20% of mutations occur de novo.

XLA a very rare disorder with an occurrence rate of approximately 1 in 200,000 live births and a frequency of about 1 in 100,000 male newborns.

Only about 10 cases of X-linked agammaglobulinemia with growth hormone deficiency have been reported. The boys in these families have reduced or undetectable numbers of B-lymphocytes. Speculation among clinicians and geneticists is that a second mutation in the BTK gene, very close to the mutation that causes XLA, is responsible for the combination of agammaglobulinemia and very short stature.
