Without question, urethral injury places the patient at risk for future morbidity. Complications can subdivide into early and late. Early complications center around secondary infection, including abscess formation, and in extreme cases, Fournier's gangrene.

Management of small strictures of the anterior urethra is by dilatation, whereas more extensive strictures (greater than 2 cm) may require urethrotomy or urethroplasty.
