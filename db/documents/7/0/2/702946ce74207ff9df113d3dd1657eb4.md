Wound hypoxia is defined as a TcPO level less than 40 mmHg. A more pronounced hypoxia, i.e., less than 20 mmHg, is termed critical limb ischemia. Patients with a TcPOlevel less than 40 mmHg are potential candidates for HBOT. Not all patients with hypoxia, however, will benefit from HBOT and identifying those who are most likely to benefit from HBOT requires additional assessment, again using TcPO measurement, either at sea level or preferably inside the hyperbaric chamber.
