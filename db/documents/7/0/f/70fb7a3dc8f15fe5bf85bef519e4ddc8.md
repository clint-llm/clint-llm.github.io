Both hypofunction and hyperfunction can result. Measurement of pituitary hormones and target hormones can help define the defects. In Cushing disease, there is an increase in both ACTH and Cortisol. In Prolactinomas, there are very high PRL levels, generally greater than 200 ng/mL. In Acromegaly IGF-1 levels are increased, and Â GH fails to suppress during an oral GTT. In hypopituitarism, there is decreased GH, IGF-1, LH FSH, testosterone in males, ACTH, cortisol T4 and TSH levels and PRL in Sheehan Syndrome.
