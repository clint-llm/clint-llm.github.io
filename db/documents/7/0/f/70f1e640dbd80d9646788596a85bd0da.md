Drug-induced esophagitis is a self-limiting disease with a good prognosis following conservative treatment. Patients are generally symptom-free within a week of stopping the causative drug and start of symptomatic therapy. Esophageal mucosa also recovers within this time. In most cases, repeat endoscopy or any additional measures are not necessary.
