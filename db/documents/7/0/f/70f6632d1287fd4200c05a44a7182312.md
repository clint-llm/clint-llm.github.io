Fecal incontinence has multiple causes and is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a pediatric surgeon, colorectal surgeon, dietitian, internist, a pediatrician, colorectal nurse, and a mental health worker. The treatment depends on the cause; the majority of non-congenital causes can be managed with conservative treatment and a change in diet but most congenital disorders require corrective surgery.

Because of severe depression and anguish, a mental health nurse should be consulted. The dietitian should educate the patient on a high fiber diet. The pharmacist should educate the patient on drugs that will slow down colonic motility and avoidance of laxatives. The nurse should also educate the patient on kegel exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. Long term follow-up is necessary as only a few patients obtain a cure from fecal incontinence. Close communication between the team members is essential in order to improve outcomes.

The outcomes do depend on the cause, but in a significant number of people, recurrence is common and the quality of life is poor
