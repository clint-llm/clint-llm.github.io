Frey syndrome usually occurs in adults with auriculotemporal nerve injury due to surgical manipulation or trauma in the parotid region.

The auriculotemporal nerve consists of two roots. The superior somatosensory root arises from the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve, providing innervation to the auricle, external auditory canal, temporomandibular joint, lateral tympanic membrane, and the temporal scalp. The inferior parasympathetic root arises from the postganglionic fibers at the otic ganglion, which originate from the glossopharyngeal nerve; it is responsible for the visceral secretomotor actions of the parotid gland.

After the two roots join, the auriculotemporal nerve travels posterior to the mandible and parotid, where it gives off the secretomotor parotid branch before coursing across the superior border of the mandibular condyle, below the temporomandibular joint, and terminating in the temporal region. Frey syndrome can occur if the auriculotemporal nerve is proximal to the parotid branch or the parotid branch itself is injured.

Salivary gland neoplasms comprise 3-10% of all head and neck tumors and up to 86% of tumors located in the parotid gland.

Aside from parotidectomy, other causes of Frey syndrome include direct trauma to the parotid region, mandibular condyle fractures, temporomandibular joint fractures, infection, submandibular gland excision, and radical neck dissections.

Frey syndrome is less common in children and may occur during early infancy without a history of trauma or surgery. Symptoms usually occur around the age of 5 months and can be misdiagnosed as food allergies since the Frey syndrome appears during the same period as food diversification. It can be distinguished from allergies, especially if there is a history notable for instrumented vaginal delivery, quick onset after a meal compared with allergic reactions, occurrence with specific foods (sweet and sour) not related to common food allergens, rapid recovery without treatment, consistent and persistent location, and absence of other atopic symptoms.

Bilateral symptoms are more likely idiopathic in origin. Familial bilateral Frey syndrome has been described in patients without a history of trauma, leading to the hypothesis that congenital dysfunction of the auriculotemporal nerve is the culprit.
