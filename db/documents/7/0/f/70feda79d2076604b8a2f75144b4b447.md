Blood transfusion practice has come a long way over the centuries, with many advancements made to its safety. The transfused blood component can be a cellular component such as red blood cells (RBC), platelets, white blood cells (WBC), or it can also be non-cellular components like plasma or plasma-derived products. There is no suitable substitute available for these components making their use inevitable in the patients who need these products. When transfused, these components are foreign materials that impose a risk of a reaction.

Blood transfusion has never been safer than it is today, but still not completely free of adverse events. Advancements in technology for blood testing over the years and much emphasis on donor screening have reduced transfusion-related adverse events, especially the transmission of infectious agents; however, non-infectious complications continue to be a serious risk.

Non-infectious transfusion-related adverse events could happen due to a wide variety of reasons specific to a blood component, amount of transfusion, and human error. Therefore, understanding the etiology and pathophysiology of these reactions is crucial for medical professionals involved with blood transfusions. In addition, modifications to clinical and laboratory practices can mitigate the incidence and impact of these adverse events.
