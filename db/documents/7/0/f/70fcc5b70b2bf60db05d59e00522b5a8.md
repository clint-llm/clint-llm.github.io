A hemiplegic migraine is a rare form of migraine in which the migraine headache attack is accompanied by unilateral weakness. Typically, migraine aura has visual symptoms, but motor symptoms are rare. Hemiplegic migraine is a rare subtype of migraine with aura, characterized by the presence of motor weakness as aura manifestation. The motor weakness is often accompanied by other forms of aura, like impairment in vision, speech, or sensation. Hemiplegic migraine can run in the family (familial hemiplegic migraine) or occur sporadically in one individual (sporadic hemiplegic migraine). This activity reviews the cause of hemiplegic migraine and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its diagnosis and management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the clinical features of hemiplegic migraine.
- Summarize the treatment of hemiplegic migraine.
- Review the diagnostic criteria for hemiplegic migraine.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by hemiplegic migraine.
