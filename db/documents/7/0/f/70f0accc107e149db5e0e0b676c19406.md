Although amoxicillin-clavulanate is an excellent antimicrobial, it is one of the most frequent causes of idiosyncratic drug-induced hepatic injury.  Men are at increased risk when compared to women, as well as patients greater than 50 years of age.  Other factors include genetic polymorphisms, HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy, or concomitant use of medications that influence the cytochrome P450 pathway.  The time of symptom onset is generally 2 to 3 weeks after the initial dose but may occur more rapidly or even be delayed up to 12 weeks. Treatment involves immediate discontinuation of the offending agent and limiting the use of other hepatotoxic drugs. N-acetylcysteine and corticosteroids are also considerations; however, the benefits are likely marginal.  Administration of a bile acid sequestrant, such as cholestyramine, may provide symptomatic relief from pruritis. Full recovery, although prolonged, is achieved by the majority of patients; however, a select few will go on to develop liver failure requiring a liver transplant to survive.
