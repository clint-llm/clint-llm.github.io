Patients with GT and chronic mild bleeding may develop iron deficiency anemia, but the majority of GT complications are related to its treatment rather than the disease itself.

Approximately 17% of patients with GT who receive leukocyte-reduced platelets develop anti-HLA antibodies, and that percentage increases significantly if the platelets are not leukocyte-reduced. Of the patients who develop anti-HLA antibodies, roughly half are refractory to future platelet transfusions. Patients with certain mutations may develop antibodies to the surface antigens of the alpha IIb beta 3 integrin.
