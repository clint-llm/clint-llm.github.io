There are many modes by which to evaluate a Richter hernia.

Outside of physical examination is the use of various imaging modalities. Ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scans are useful adjuncts in diagnosis. However, as a Richter type hernia only involves a portion of the bowel wall, these imaging modalities can result in a false-negative result.

The inclusion of laboratory data is requisite, with the evaluation including complete blood count (CBC) and basic metabolic panel (BMP) to evaluate for leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, or electrolyte derangements. A PT/INR and/or PTT should be obtained to assess for any coagulopathy that needs to be corrected preoperatively in patients with hepatic dysfunction or patients on anticoagulation.
