About 30% of children with a previous febrile seizure remain at an increased risk of recurrent febrile seizures.

Children less than 12 months at the time of the first febrile seizure have a 50% chance of having a second seizure within the first year. This risk drops to 30% the following year. Other than young age during the first febrile seizure, a family history of febrile seizure, low degree of fever during the seizure, and a shorter interval between fever and the seizure may indicate a higher probability of recurrent febrile seizures. However, features associated with complex febrile seizures do not necessarily increase the risk of recurrence of febrile seizures.

AboutÂ 1-2% of children with simple febrile seizures - only slightly higher risk than the general population- develop subsequent epilepsy. However, children with complex febrile seizures, abnormal neurodevelopment, or with a family history of epilepsy have a higher risk of epilepsy(approximately 5-10%).

There is no evidence that febrile seizures are linked to learning disabilities or lower intelligence.
