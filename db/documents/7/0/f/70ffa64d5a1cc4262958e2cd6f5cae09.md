Chronic widespread pain seen in centralized pain occurs between 10 to 40% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, osteoarthritis, spondyloarthritis, and lupus. Centralized pain occurs between five and fifteen percent of the general population, most of whom have fibromyalgia.

The reported centralized pain in rheumatoid arthritis is estimated to be between 13% and 40%. One concern with this patient population is overtreating their rheumatoid arthritis because of increased symptoms, which are actually due to centralized pain. Inflammatory markers are lower in patients with comorbid fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis, while simultaneously, they reported decreased quality of life compared to those with rheumatoid arthritis alone.

Centralized pain syndrome appears in 10 to 30% of patients with spondyloarthritis. Separately, 13 to 20 percent of patients with ankylosing spondylitis meet the criteria for fibromyalgia.

Over a third of women with chronic back pain suffer from centralized pain. The daily impact of central pain is significant in patients with chronic back pain, including severe limitations in their activity level. Given the considerable prevalence of widespread, centralized pain in women with chronic low back pain, it is reasonable to consider central pain syndrome as part of the differential diagnosis in this patient population.
