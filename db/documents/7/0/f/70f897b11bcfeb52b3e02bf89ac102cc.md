Iridocorneal dysgenesis (ICD) refers to the spectrum of disorders secondary to the developmental abnormality of anterior segment structures.

A defective migration or differentiation of neural crest cells during the development of the above-said structures can lead to the development of anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD) and subsequently to glaucoma. Depending on the origin of the developmental abnormalities, the disease can be classified further as anterior segment dysgenesis of neural crest origin (ASD-nc) or non-neural crest origin (ASD non-nc).
