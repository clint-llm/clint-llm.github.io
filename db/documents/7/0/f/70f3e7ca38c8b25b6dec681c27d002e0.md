Anxiety disorders are veryÂ common and can have diverse presentation of signs and symptoms. The condition has a very high morbidity and mortality and thus is best managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes a mental health nurse, pharmacist, psychologist, a psychiatrist and the primary care provider. Overall, anxiety disorders are underdiagnosed and undertreated. When left untreated, anxiety disorders often lead to severe depression and abuse of drugs and alcohol. In addition, there is a high rate of suicide among these patients. Many patients with chronic anxiety have a poor quality of life. The education of both the patient and family is important to reduce the high morbidity. Family members should help ensure medication compliance and provide a supportive environment. Unfortunately, despite optimal treatment, relapse rates are high.
