The prognosis of Balint syndrome depends mostly on the underlying etiology. In acute etiologies such as stroke, infectious origin, or PRES, with appropriate management, a good prognosis may be seen in patients. On the other hand, Balint syndrome secondary to neurodegenerative etiologies such as corticobasal degeneration or posterior cortical atrophy correlates with poor prognosis.
