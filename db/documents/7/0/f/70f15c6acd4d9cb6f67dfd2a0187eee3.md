Gallstone ileus is not a benign disorder and most patients also have several comorbid features. High morbidity and mortality rates have been reported for patients with gallstone ileus. An urgent repair is often associated with postoperative complications. The longer the operating time, the higher the risk of postoperative complications. The one-stage procedure has higher morbidity but the two-stage procedure means that the patient has to undergo general anesthesia again.
