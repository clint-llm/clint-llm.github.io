- Cri-du-chat is a rare genetic disorder caused by the deletion of the short arm of chromosome 5.

- Differences in phenotype are attributable to differences in genotype, which also plays a role in the severity and prognosis.

- The most characteristic finding is a high-pitched, monotonous cry. Other features include microcephaly, low birth weight, hypotonia, psychomotor retardation, and craniofacial malformations.

- A clinical diagnosis is possible. However, a karyotype analysis can confirm the diagnosis if clinical suspicion is high.

- In the presence of a normal karyotype, and if the clinical suspicion is high, more specific cytogenetic studies can be carried out, such as FISH or CGH.

- Management revolves around physical therapy and rehabilitation programs as early as possible that will improve prognosis and social adaptation.

- Morbidity and mortality are the highest in the first few years of life. Ninety percent of deaths occur in the first year.
