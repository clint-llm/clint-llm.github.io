Consultation with an infectious disease specialist, a board-certified infectious disease pharmacist, or nurse practitioner experienced in caring for HIV-infected patients is recommended for the management of HAART regimen. Psychiatric consultation may also be indicated as HIV-infected patients with HAD commonly have comorbidities including generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, and agitation and may present with psychosis. A neurologic evaluation may be necessary to fully complete workup for alternative causes of cognitive deficits.

To improve outcomes in HIV patients, the key is to encourage compliance with HAART. Appropriate treatment of HIV infection shows improvement in cognitive function in patients diagnosed with severe deficits. The incidence of HAD has also decreased over time with the widespread use of ART in observational studies. ART should be initiated for any untreated patient with HIV infection who is beginning to experience cognitive decline. The selection of a specific ART regimen should follow standard protocols based on viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) load, genotype, drug interactions and presence of comorbidities. Continual monitoring of neurophysiological function is recommended to ensure that the patient is not deteriorating. Interprofessional healthcare team dynamics will drive optimal outcomes for these patients. [Level 5]
