A modest amount of oral intake of clear liquids may be allowed for uncomplicated laboring patients up to two hours before anesthetic induction. While the volume of liquid ingested is unimportant, the presence of particulate matter is of significance in terms of aspiration risk. Laboring patients are to avoid solid foods, especially those with additional risk factors including diabetes, morbid obesity, and a difficult airway. Patients should fast for 6 or 8 hours before undergoing elective surgery depending on the meal's fat content. Excessive sedation and some antipsychotic medications should be avoided as they can increase aspiration risk.
