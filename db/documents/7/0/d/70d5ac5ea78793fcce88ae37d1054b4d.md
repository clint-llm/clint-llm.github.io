Parathyroid adenomas tend to be encapsulated and are typically composed mostly of chief cells. Adenomas of oxyphilic cells are rare but have been reported in a few cases of primary hyperparathyroidism.

Newer non-invasive imaging technologies suggest that the effects of hyperparathyroid hormone excess on skeletal bone may be more significant than previously thought. Trabecular bone score (TBS) is an indirect analysis of trabecular microstructure taken from the DEXA scan. TBS demonstrates the deterioration of the trabecular spinal microstructure in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, although this appears normal on the DXA scan.

High-resolution peripheral quantitative CT scans of the distal radius and tibia show fewer, thinner, and more widely spaced trabeculae in primary hyperparathyroidism patients.
