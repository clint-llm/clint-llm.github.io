The most common presenting symptom in patients with IMSCT is pain, which classically worsens at night when the patient is recumbent and can be diffuse or radicular in nature. If the dermatomal distribution is unusual for a disk herniation, IMSCT should be suspected. The pain also can be local, causing stiff neck or back, and can be described as burning and bilateral. As IMSCT can impinge on the motor or sensory nerves, sensory changes such as paresthesia can be seen, followed by motor disturbances as the second or third most common complaint. In children, gait disturbance frequently is seen. In addition to motor weakness, patients also can have clumsiness and ataxia, atrophy, muscle twitches, fasciculations, and decreased deep tendon reflexes. Loss of bowel and bladder function can occur at a later stage and can lead to retention, incontinence, or impotence. In children, diagnosis is especially difficult, where IMSCT can remain asymptomatic for a long time. Children can have nonspecific complaints, and their symptoms can be misperceived as clumsiness, although scoliosis can be seen in 30% of patients.
