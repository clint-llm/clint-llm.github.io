Parenteral nutrition is the intravenous administration of nutrition outside of the gastrointestinal tract. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is when the IV administered nutrition is the only source of nutrition the patient is receiving. Total parenteral nutrition is indicated when there is impaired gastrointestinal function and contraindications to enteral nutrition. Enteral diet intake is preferred over parenteral as it is inexpensive and associated with fewer complications such as infection and blood clots but requires a functional GI system.

- Chronic intestinal obstruction as in intestinal cancer

- Bowel pseudo-obstruction with food intolerance.

- TPN can also be used to rest the bowel in cases of GI fistulas with high flow

- When an infant’s gastrointestinal system is immature or has a congenital gastrointestinal malformation

- When there is a post-operative bowel anastomosis leak

- When the patient is unable to maintain nutritional status due to severe diarrhea or vomiting

- Small bowel obstruction

- Hypercatabolic states due to sepsis, polytrauma, and major fractures

- An anticipated period of nothing by mouth (NPO) status greater than seven days as in patients with inflammatory bowel disease exacerbations as well as critically ill patients

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates parenteral nutrition in the United States, and the FDA requires statistically significant evidence of the efficacy and safety of parenteral nutrition products. Consequently, there are postapproval clinical trial requirements for parenteral nutrition products.
