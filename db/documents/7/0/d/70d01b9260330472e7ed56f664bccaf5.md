The tensor veli palatini originates from the inferior surface of the cartilage of the Eustachian tube, the scaphoid fossa, and the sphenoid boneâ€™s spine. The muscle then wraps around the pterygoid hamulus, becoming tendinous, becoming a fan-like aponeurosis attaching to the palatine aponeurosis and horizontal aspect of the palatine bone.

The tensor veli palatini is also a component of the soft palate at its midline.
