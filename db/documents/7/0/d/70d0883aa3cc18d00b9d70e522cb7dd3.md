Infant jaundice, also known as hyperbilirubinemia, is a frequently encountered clinical problem in neonates. Estimates are that between 60-80% of all term or late-term, healthy newborns exhibit physiologic jaundice with no cause found (idiopathic).

Breast milk jaundice was first described in 1963 when it was noted thatÂ some breastfed infants had prolonged, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that persisted beyond the third week of life. Breast milk jaundice typically presents after day 3 or 4 in the first or second week of life and usually spontaneously resolves even without discontinuation of breastfeeding. However, it can persist for 8-12 weeks of life before resolution.
