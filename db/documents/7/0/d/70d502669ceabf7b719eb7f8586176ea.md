Complications associated with CHRPE are exceedingly rare and are generally secondary to nodular growth within the lesion. Subretinal fluid or exudation from nodules may occur, causing retinal detachment: a separation of the RPE from the neural retina. In addition, nodules may cause secondary vitreomacular traction and decreased central vision.
