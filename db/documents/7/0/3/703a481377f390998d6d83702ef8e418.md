The Ross procedure, also known as the switch procedure or pulmonary autograft procedure, is a cardiac surgery in which a diseased aortic valve is replaced with the patient's own pulmonary valve. This is followed by the replacement of the pulmonary valve with a pulmonary allograft. The Ross procedure was first developed in the late 1960s and has been performed many times since. It is the only operation that allows for an aortic valve replacement with a living valve substitute. This activity describes the indications, contraindications, and steps involved in the Ross procedure and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with aortic valve disease.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for the Ross procedure.
- Describe the technique involved in performing the Ross procedure.
- Review the complications associated with the Ross procedure.
- Identify the role of the interprofessional team in providing effective care and surveillance of patients undergoing the Ross procedure.
