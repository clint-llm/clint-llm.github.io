Hearing loss is a common condition that affects millions of people regardless of age, ethnicity, and health status. Appropriate treatment for hearing loss depends greatly on the underlying pathophysiology and the severity of the condition. Pure-tone audiometry is a critical means of obtaining diagnostic information to guide healthcare providers toward appropriate treatment. Appropriate treatment for hearing loss depends significantly on the pathophysiology and the severity of the condition, and a detailed hearing assessment provides the healthcare team with the necessary diagnostic information to guide treatment. This activity reviews the details of pure-tone audiometry evaluation, including clinical appropriateness and utility, and examines the role of the interprofessional team in the evaluation and management of patients with otologic complaints.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the difference between air conduction and bone conduction pure-tone evaluation.
- Describe the clinical utility of pure-tone audiometric threshold assessment.
- Identify when a clinically significant asymmetry of pure-tone thresholds is present.
- Review when pure-tone audiometry evaluation is or is not an appropriate method to assess hearing status.
