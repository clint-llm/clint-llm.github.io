**Idiopathic Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss**

**Primary Treatment**

- Immediately following diagnosis

- Most studies suggest that early treatment is associated with a better outcome.

- A clinical study in 2011 monitoring 250 patients found no difference between intratympanic and oral steroids as first-line treatment.

**Salvage (rescue) Treatment**

- Offered when patients have incomplete recovery after initial therapy for SSNHL.

- Some studies suggest better hearing outcomes when it is used after failed systemic therapy.

- Recommended within 2 to 6 weeks after the onset of symptoms.

- The most commonly used option in ISSNHL.

- Haynes, et al. found with intratympanic dexamethasone for SSNHL, after failed systemic therapy, 40% of patients showed improvement in hearing compared to 9.1% in the control group.

**Combined Treatment**

- This involves ITS in combination with oral corticosteroids.

- Some studies have shown benefits, especially for patients with moderate to severe hearing loss, while others found none.

**Meniere Disease**

In 2018 The International Consensus (ICON) on the treatment of Meniere's Disease recommended ITS as second-line therapy when medical treatment has failed.

There is good evidence suggesting that ITSI can be used as an effective treatment for refractory Meniere disease, particularly for vertigo control, reducing the number of attacks.

**Refractory Tinnitus**

In a study by Yener et al., high concentrations of steroid in the inner ear from an ITS injection could reduce tinnitus by increasing blood flow to the inner ear. The majority of papers suggest that ITSI is most effective in acute tinnitus rather than chronic.

**Autoimmune Inner Ear Diseases**

In autoimmune inner ear diseases (AIED), a corticosteroid is a first-line treatment.
