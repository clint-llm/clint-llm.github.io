There are slight variations in the diagnostic criteria of schizophrenia depending on the classification system used.

**Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM-5)**

Two or more of the following symptoms must be present for a significant portion of time during a one-month period:

- Delusions

- Hallucinations

- Disorganized speech

- Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior

- Negative symptoms.

There must also be social/occupational dysfunction, while signs of disturbance must persist for at least six months, including at least one month of symptoms.

**International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10)**

The patient must exhibit at least one of the following, for a period greater than or equal to a month:

- Thought insertion, echo, broadcast, or withdrawal

- Delusions of control, influence, or passivity

- Hallucinatory voices providing a running commentary of the patient

- Persistent delusions that are culturally inappropriate or implausible

Or, at least two of the following symptoms must be observed, for a period greater than or equal to a month

- Persistent hallucinations in any modality when accompanied by fleeting delusions

- Breaks of interpolations in thought resulting in incoherence or neologisms

- Catatonic behavior

- Negative symptoms

- Significant and consistent transformation in the overall quality of behavior manifesting as anhedonia and social withdrawal

Unlike DSM-5, ICD-10 further subcategories schizophrenia based on the key presenting symptoms as either paranoid schizophrenia, hebephrenic schizophrenia, catatonic schizophrenia, undifferentiated schizophrenia, post-schizophrenic depression, residual schizophrenia, and simple schizophrenia.

In addition to asking about these symptoms, it is also important to elicit:

- Past medical history, drug history, and family history

- Social history, including the use of recreational drugs and alcohol

- Any recent neurological impairments such as altered consciousness or memory problems, head injury, stroke, seizures, faints, dizzy spells, visual impairment, marked tremor, or muscle stiffness

- Potential organic causes of psychosis such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, syphilis, AIDS, brain lesions, heavy metal toxicity, delirium, metabolic/endocrine disorders, and dementias including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy body dementias

A thorough risk assessment must also be undertaken to determine the risk of harm to self and others. The first schizophrenic episode usually occurs during early adulthood or late adolescence. Individuals often lack insight at this stage; therefore, few will present directly to seek help for their psychotic symptoms. Common presentations include a relative noticing social withdrawal, personality changes, or uncharacteristic behavior; deliberate self-harm or suicide attempts; calling the police to report their delusional symptoms, or referral via the criminal justice system. The use of screening tools such as COPS (Criteria of Prodromal Syndromes), SIPS (Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes), and PACE (Personal Assessment and Crisis Evaluation Clinic) has been shown to increase the detection rate of schizophrenia in premorbid states although there is controversy surrounding indicating treatment at this stage.
