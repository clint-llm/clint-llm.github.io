Three "rules of masking" indicate when masking should be employed, as discussed by Studebaker in 1964.

**Rule 1**

This rule applies when there is a difference in non-masked air conduction between each ear, equal to or greater than 40dB (55dB if using inserted earphones).

**Rule 2**

When there is a difference between the non-masked bone conduction threshold and the air conduction threshold of either ear is greater than 10dB.

**Rule 3**

When rule 1 has not been applied, but where the bone conduction threshold of one ear is better by 40dB (or 55dB if using insert earphones) than the air conduction threshold of the contralateral ear.
