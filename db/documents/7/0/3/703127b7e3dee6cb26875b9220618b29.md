Initially, hypersensitivity reactions were noticed in 30% of patients who received paclitaxel and docetaxel; however, the use of premedication has decreased the incidence to 1 to 2%. Typically, these occur within the first 10 minutes during the first or second infusion, and the incidence is negligible afterward.

The incidence of bradycardia with paclitaxel is about 30%, while 30 to 40% of patients experience mucositis. Skin rash and onycholysis are relatively less common and occur in 5 to 10% of patients.

Docetaxel results in characteristic skin toxicity in about 80% of patients.

The incidence of haematologic toxicity is very high, with cabazitaxel with neutropenia being observed in greater than 90% of patients.
