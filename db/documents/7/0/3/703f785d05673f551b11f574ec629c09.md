Breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women worldwide. Breast cancer care/management has increased in complexity throughout the years, with an interprofessional approach adopted by the majority, if not all, institutions. A breast cancer team is usually comprised of multiple disciplines including physicians, surgeons, breast cancer nurses, medical physicists, psychiatrists, and technicians. In literature, this interprofessional approach has demonstrated decreased mortality.
