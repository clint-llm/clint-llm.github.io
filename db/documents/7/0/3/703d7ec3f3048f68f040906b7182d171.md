With the drastic increase in opioid abuse and overdose-related death, there has been a lot of focus on the “opioid epidemic.” All healthcare workers (including nurse practitioners) who prescribe controlled substances have a role to play in decreasing the opioid epidemic.

New research is focusing on finding effective interventions and identifying risk factors for overdose. Examples of some of these efforts include treatment programs, take home intranasal naloxone, and monitored injection facilities. A review article of research exploring overdose education and naloxone distribution suggests a reduced fatality for patients who receive counseling and prescription of home naloxone.

Naloxone has been shown to have a very safe side effect profile. There have been several studies on opiate-naive patients who were given large doses of the drug without significant effects, but when given to patients who are opioid-tolerant, acute, opioid withdrawal symptoms can develop. Individuals administered naloxone in the setting of opioid overdose can experience a sudden withdrawal syndrome, which includes sudden aggression, agitation, restlessness, diaphoresis, and tachycardia. GI symptoms such as nausea and vomiting also occur in about 30% of patients. Most symptoms are not very severe or sustained, and less than 1% of patients require admission. Acute withdrawal symptoms are more likely when larger doses of naloxone are used.
