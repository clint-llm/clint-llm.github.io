- The hallmark of HBS is profound and persistent **hypocalcemia**that persists**beyond four days postoperatively**. It presents with hypomagnesemia,**hypophosphatemia,**and**normal parathyroid hormone level.**

- Symptomatic patients or those with profound hypocalcemia less than 7.6 mg/dL will need emergent intravenous (IV) calcium treatment.

- The syndrome can require significant amounts of calcium supplementation and for prolonged periods, up to 1 year in some reported cases.

- Small retrospective studies, case reports, and case series suggest that bisphosphonates may help reduce the incidence of hungry bone syndrome and do not appear to increase this risk.Â However, data are lacking to elucidate the long-term effects on bone mineral density if utilized in this patient population.

- In patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D supplementation merits consideration. Thus far, it appears that vitamin D supplementation will help to improve bone mineral density, bone resorption markers, and reduce parathyroid hormone levels before parathyroidectomy without causing adverse effects.
