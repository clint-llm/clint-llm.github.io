In general, the ceruloplasmin molecule is a catalyst for redox reactions in plasma. It can oxidize iron from ferrous (2+) to ferric iron (3+), which assists in iron binding to transferrin. Neurological disorders in hereditary ceruloplasmin deficiency may be caused by disordered iron transport in the brain. It is also thought to be involved in controlling membrane lipid oxidation. In the presence of superoxide, ceruloplasmin promotes LDL oxidation in vitro and is colocalized with oxidized LDL in atherosclerotic lesions.

The liver is the crucial organ in copper homeostasis, and more than 90% of the copper exported from the liver to the plasma is in the form of ceruloplasmin. However, ceruloplasmin's role in copper transport from the peripheral tissues is limited. Albumin is the main protein responsible for ionic copper transport from the tissues (such as absorbed copper in the digestive tract). The copper-albumin complex is directed to the liver via the portal system in circulation. Albumin and transcuprein appear to be the other major copper transport proteins, especially immediately post-gastrointestinal absorption.
