Patients diagnosed with MIRM will have pulmonary symptoms that may prompt ordering of a chest radiograph, which may demonstrate evidence of pneumonia.

Results for other laboratory markers in the currently-proposed MIRM diagnosis criteria, such as M. pneumoniae IgM antibodies (elevated), M. pneumoniae in oropharyngeal or bullae cultures or PCR, and/or serial cold agglutinins may not be available in most acute care settings when the diagnosis of MIRM may not yet be established.
