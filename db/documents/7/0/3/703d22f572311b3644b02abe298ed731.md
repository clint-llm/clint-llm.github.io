Fluorescein toxicity is low. Proper doses of epinephrine and antihistamines can manage cases of significant hypersensitivity after flushing the affected area with plenty of water. Prevention of anaphylaxis is possible by providing a minimal dose of fluorescein to determine if a minor reaction would occur.

If enough fluorescein is issued intravenously, precautionÂ is necessary for nursing mothers because another route of excretion is through human milk, causing it to turn yellow.
