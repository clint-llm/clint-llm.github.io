The fibrous pericardium is derived from the septum transversum in the embryo. The septum transversum is a thick mass of cranial mesenchyme that is formed on day 22. During craniocaudal folding, it assumes a position caudal to the developing heart. Both the diaphragm and the pericardium, among other structures, develop from the septum transversum.
