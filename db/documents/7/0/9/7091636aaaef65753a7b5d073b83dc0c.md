Hydatidosis can mimic a large number of conditions, depending on the site of the cyst.

Liver hydatidosis differential diagnoses include:

- Liver abscess

- Liver cysts

- Budd-Chiari syndrome

- Biliary colic

- Biliary cirrhosis

- Tuberculosis

- Primary hepatic carcinoma

A detailed history and physical exam, alongside proper workup including serology and imaging, is key in making the diagnosis and ruling out diseases that may mimic hydatidosis.
