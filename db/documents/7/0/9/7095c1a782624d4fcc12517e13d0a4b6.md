Primary hepatic angiosarcoma has an aggressive clinical course, and the prognosis is poor in inoperable cases. The majority of patients die within six months of diagnosis, and even with treatment, only around 3% of patients live more than two years. Complete hepatic resection or radical resection of the tumor is the most effective form of treatment for single lesions; however, it is not always feasible in metastatic disease. Liver transplant is not recommended in these cases due to the high rate of recurrence and the rapid progression of the disease. Survival after liver transplant is less than seven months. Unfortunately, no effective chemotherapy has been established. There has been one report thatÂ showed the efficacy of using 5-FU-carboplatin with doxorubicin or ifosfamide in patients with unresectable hepatic angiosarcoma and distant metastasis. A study with a large patient population showed a significant survival benefit of surgical treatment for stage I hepatic angiosarcoma and the prognosis of patients that underwent surgical treatment were better than patients who received non-operative treatment. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) can also be used with palliative intention or to control bleeding. Unfortunately, there are no established guidelines on optimal treatment modalities regarding surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, as there are different outcomes that have been studied.
