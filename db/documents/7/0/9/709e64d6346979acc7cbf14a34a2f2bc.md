Patients with congenital lobar emphysema develop air-trapping and hyperinflation in the affected lobes, but they are poorly perfused. It is vital for pediatric as well as adult radiologists to be familiar with radiological features of congenital lobar emphysema to maximize diagnostic accuracy. Patients with congenital lobar emphysema could even be diagnosed prenatally. The lungs of a fetus affected with congenital lobar emphysema show hyper-echogenicity without abnormal blood flow. This may also be accompanied by polyhydramnios or mediastinal shift. Magnetic resonance imaging is also safe to use prenatally to confirm the diagnosis.

A chest x-ray is the first examination of choice in patients with respiratory distress. The affected lobe shows overinflation and hyperlucency in the case of congenital lobar emphysema. Computed tomography (CT) of lungs is the gold standard for the diagnosis of congenital lobar emphysema. It helps in the evaluation of the affected lobe as well as surrounding structures. CT-scan of the chest with IV contrast can help evaluate the vascular anomalies related to CLE.

High clinical suspicion for congenital lobar emphysema should be present too to be able to diagnose the patients presenting with symptoms.
