The combination of determining an indication, obtaining and interpreting a cTTE certainly requires interprofessional collaboration. For starters, a pediatrician must obtain a good history to clearly offer an appropriate indication. Once the cTTE is ordered, a certified ultrasound technician must perform the cTTE. This task can be difficult, especially in the setting of a young child. Nurses are needed to help distract the patient, and at times, a pharmacist may be consulted to provide mild sedation as the image quality is key for interpretation. Lastly, a cardiologist is needed to actually read and interpret the images.

The need for such an interprofessional team approach has been demonstrated inadvertently.  A recent study demonstrated the significance of sedation via comparison of sedated vs. non-sedated pediatric cTTEs regarding providing optimal images. The conclusion was that sedated cTTEs provide a significant improvement in image quality. Without a multidisciplinary approach, obtaining optimal images in pediatric patients would not be possible.
