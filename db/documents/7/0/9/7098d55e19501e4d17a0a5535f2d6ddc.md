The acute phase presents as visible endothelial damage in superficial vessels of the dermis. However, in the chronic phase, there are repeated episodes of small vessel damage in the upper epidermis and deposition of periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) positive diastase-resistant specific hyaline material in the blood vessel wall of both upper and papillary dermal vascular plexuses. Immunofluorescence study shows immunoglobulin G deposition.

Electron microscopy shows replicated hyaline material, a fragmented basement membrane, layered with fine fibrillar material that permeates the capillary connective tissue sheath and extends beyond the vessel wall.
