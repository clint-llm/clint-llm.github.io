# Introduction

The development of the eye is a complex multifactorial symphony of signaling molecules, receptors, and molecular gradients organized in a melody of the time and space during embryogenesis. Understanding this process within the eye allows us to have a better understanding of the basis of congenital eye diseases. The optic cup is particularly important to the proper formation of the eye, as it forms all major structures of the globe, except for the lens. Congenital glaucoma, retinal detachment, and coloboma are phenomena related to defects in the optic cup or its associated structures, and all of these can have serious consequences for the sight of the patient.

# Development

The development of the primitive eye begins at approximately week 3 of gestation with the burgeoning of the optic sulcus from the periocular mesenchyme. The optic sulci are bilateral invaginations on both sides of the anterior neural tube at the diencephalon. As the sulci deepen, they become optic pits and eventually transform into the optic vesicles as they extend toward surface ectoderm. Both surface ectoderm and the optic vesicles secrete/excrete extracellular matrix and adhere to each other. As the optic vesicles extend outward, the proximal attachment to the forebrain becomes the optic stalk. The optic vesicles aid in the migration of neural crest cells, which contribute to future development. At approximately 5 weeks, a portion of the optic vesicle will undergo auto-invagination to produce a “cup” with two cell layers. This invagination is asymmetric, and a groove forms in the inferior border. This structure is called the optic fissure, and early vasculature and periocular mesenchyme are introduced to the eye via this structure. The optic fissure closes by the end of week 6.

The two layers forming the optic cup is a continuous tissue that gives bends at a hinge point known as the optic cup lip, and that marks the border of the outer pigmented layer and inner neural layer.

# Cellular

Neuroectoderm cells comprise the optic cup.

# Molecular Level

Multiple genes have been shown to interact during the development of the primitive eye, as is the case with the rest of the developing embryo. In the eye, the PAX6 gene is the primary control gene, with the WNT gene and FGF gene playing a supplementary role during the development of the optic vesicles. Another prominent gene in embryonic development of the eye is the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) gene, which is responsible for the suppression of PAX6. If Shh becomes inhibited, then PAX6 deregulation results in cyclopia. Conversely, overexpression of Shh has been shown to result in a loss of eye structures. Retinoic acid also plays an important role in the development of the eye, mainly through its use as a paracrine inhibitor of the mesenchyme around the optic cup. Lack of retinoic acid can thus lead to defects in the anterior segment and results in blindness.

However, the interplay between genes and molecular signaling factors are so complex that it does not fit in the scope of this article. Some of the other genes involved in development include but are not limited to PITX2, PITX3, FOXC1, FOXE3, LMX1B, GPR48, TFAP2A, and TFAP2B.

# Function

The optic cup gives rise to the entire globe, along with its associated inner structures except for the lens, which includes the ten layers of the retina that contains rods, cones, bipolar cells, amacrine cells, horizontal cells, and the complex interplay between these cells that help process photons into three-dimensional vision.

# Clinical Significance

Because the optic cup gives rise to so many ocular structures, it has broad clinical significance. One classic example of a condition that can result from defective optic cup embryogenesis is coloboma. A coloboma is a defect with absent tissue in part of an ocular structure. Colobomas are thought to be caused by failed closure of the optic fissure.

Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome (ARS) is a rare genetic condition that may be due to defects affecting the optic cup. ARS is an autosomal dominant syndrome that has multiple effects on the anterior segment and may lead to glaucoma.

Defects in the development of the optic cup also contribute to numerous rare ocular diseases.

Morning glory syndrome is another rare anomaly that may be due to optic cup dysgenesis.

Retinoic acid is essential to proper optic cup development. Thus deficiency or mutations in retinoic acid signaling can lead to anomalous development; this can range from relatively mild disorders, such as Fundus albipunctatus, to very severe disorders such as Matthew-Wood syndrome or Leber congenital amaurosis.

In summary, the optic cup is an embryologic structure that gives rise to many structures in the globe. Also, signaling from the optic cup leads to the development of additional intra-ocular and extra-ocular structures. Dysgenesis can result in a wide array of disorders, from retinal detachment to glaucoma to anterior segment dysgenesis.
