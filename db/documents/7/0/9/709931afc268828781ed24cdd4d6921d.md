Computed tomography (CT) uses axial-acquired helical x-rays to generate cross-sectional images. Post-processing reconstruction generates sagittal, coronal, and 3D-rendered images. Because CT uses X-rays, it depends on differences in the number of X-rays absorbed, also known as attenuation, of various tissues to generate the adequate contrast needed for image formation. The differences in attenuation of bone and calcified products to liquids and soft tissues make CT ideal for evaluating calcification or ossification within suprasellar lesions. This property is useful in distinguishing calcifications within a craniopharyngioma from hemorrhage within a pituitary adenoma since both may appear similar on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

In contrast to soft tissue mass lesions, non-contrast CT can quickly identify the presence of cystic lesions of the pituitary, which predominantly represent either Rathke’s cleft cysts or arachnoid cysts. The increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure in patients with intracranial hypertension may cause a small amount of arachnoid and CSF to herniate through the aperture of the diaphragm sellae, the reflection of the dura mater which separates the pituitary fossa from the intracranial compartment. The arachnoid cyst results in partial effacement of the pituitary gland, with flattening of the gland on the posteroinferior aspect of the sella. Noncontrast CT can easily distinguish between the attenuation of CSF compared to the soft tissue of the pituitary gland in patients with a partially or completely empty sella. However, the presence of an arachnoid cyst is usually an incidental finding on non-contrast head CT, and it may be difficult to distinguish from other cystic lesions of the pituitary fossa.

Noncontrast CT offers limited delineation of soft tissue structures both within and adjacent to the brain, given their similar attenuation characteristics.  CT is inferior to MRI in distinguishing soft tissue from small structures, such as the optic pathways.

Presurgical evaluation for patients undergoing transsphenoidal surgery requires CT imaging for image co-registration with bony landmarks. Additionally, evaluation for anatomic variants such as under-pneumatization of the sphenoid sinus or dehiscence of the bony roof overlying the internal carotid arteries is better using CT than MRI.

Despite the utility of CT in evaluating pituitary lesions, it is not the first-line initial imaging modality for evaluating the pituitary fossa. The acquisition speed of CT makes it an ideal study for ruling out many pathologies on an emergent basis, such as intracranial hemorrhage from pituitary apoplexy. These non-contrast CT studies often reveal incidental pituitary lesions, requiring a follow-up MRI for further characterization. In rare circumstances, patients with severe claustrophobia may not tolerate a full MRI of the brain. In these cases, performing a CT with IV contrast optimized for imaging the pituitary (sella protocol) is the next best option.
