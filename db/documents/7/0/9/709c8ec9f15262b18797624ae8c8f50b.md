While some recent studies have shown comparatively lower rates of osteoporosis and fractures among transplant recipients, these rates continue to remain significantly higher than their age and sex-matched controls. The lower rates in recent studies are most likely the result of increased awareness, early diagnosis, and treatment of osteoporosis in addition to improved immunosuppressive regimens. A large cohort studyÂ in 2014 showed that the overall hazard ratio (HR) of osteoporosis after solid organ transplantation (SOT) was as high as 5.14, and HR of related fractures was 5.76 in comparison to age and sex-matched controls. The highest HR was observed in male patients (HR of 7.09) and patients aged 50 years or younger (HR of 7.38).

The rate of bone loss after transplantation is found to be highest in the first 3 to 6 months

The occurrence of fractures in the first post-transplant year was lower in kidney transplant recipients among all SOT recipients.
