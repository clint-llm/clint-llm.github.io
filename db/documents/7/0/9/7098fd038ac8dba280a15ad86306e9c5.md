The lionfish belongs to the subfamily Pteroinae and is native to the Indo-pacific coastal waters. However, it is more commonly encountered by aquatic fish tank handlers across the United States who try to hand-feed, transfer, or catch the fish. They are prized aquarium fish because of their beautiful, yet foreboding, coloration and whimsical fins and rays, which contain the spines. Pterois volitans) was likely introduced off the coast of Florida around 25 years ago. As a result, 2 of 15 species of Pteroinae, including the common lionfish (Pterois miles), are well-established across the east coast of the United States posing a monumental threat to coral reef life in the Caribbean. It is important for divers in these areas to recognize and avoid skin contact with lionfish due to the consequences of their envenomation. Many divers hunt lionfish as a service to the health of the reef, but this should be done very carefully wearing gloves and other protective gear to avoid getting pierced by the spines.

The scorpionfish belongs to the subfamily Scorpaeninae which, like the lionfish, is native to the Indo-pacific coastal waters but can be found westward off the coast of California down to South America and eastward off the coast of North Carolina through the Caribbean down to Brazil. Scorpionfish are less aggressive than the lionfish but are much more camouflaged (see figure 1). Although they often pose a threat as aquarium occupants, they typically cause injuries when caught by fishermen or encountered by divers.

The stonefish, a member of the subfamily Synanceinae, is most commonly encountered in the Indo-pacific region, although a few species are reported in the Caribbean Sea and waters of the Florida Keys. The stonefish, like the scorpionfish, is well-camouflaged with an uglier appearance. As opposed to the scorpionfish and lionfish, the stonefish is rarely spotted before causing harm. It lies flat on the ocean floor and most often causes injury when its rigid dorsal spines are kicked or stepped on. The stonefish is widely known as the world’s most venomous fish.
