Skin is part of the integumentary system and considered to be the largest organ of the human body. There are three main layers of skin: the epidermis, the dermis, and the hypodermis (subcutaneous fat). The focus of this topic is on the epidermal and dermal layers of skin. Skin appendages such as sweat glands, hair follicles,Â  and sebaceous glands are reviewed in-depth elsewhere.
