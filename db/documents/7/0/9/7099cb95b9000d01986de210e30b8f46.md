A Polish retroactive study showed that over 44% of patients who had adrenal insufficiency were diagnosed only after they had presented in an acute adrenal crisis.

Prevention strategies to avoid Addisonian crisis include

- Close routine follow-up with the physician managing their adrenal insufficiency

- IndividualizedÂ care plans

- Educating the patient in the event of acute illness; for example, to increase their usual steroid dose by 2 to 3 times.

- Those who plan for elective surgeries should be aware that they may need post-operative stress-dose steroids and notify the operating surgeon or anesthesiologist.

- An emergency dose of parenteral hydrocortisone at home when the patient cannot tolerate oral steroids but still needs the cortisol replacement. The family should be taught how to give an emergency steroid injection via IV administration.

- Having some identification detailing the patient having adrenal insufficiency or a history of Addisonian crisis, such as a bracelet or ID card
