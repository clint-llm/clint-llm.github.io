The list of differential diagnoses for tardive dystonia is extensive and includes primary and secondary etiologies of dystonias. Secondary forms of dystonia include metabolic abnormalities, toxic states, neurodegenerative disorders, and structural abnormalities of the brain.

Drug-induced dystonic syndromes can be distinguished by acknowledging a history of neuroleptic treatment, negative family history of primary dystonia, and the absence of associated neurological signs. It is not uncommon for patients on chronic neuroleptics to present with tardive syndromes. Furthermore, patients can experience more than one of these tardive syndromes simultaneously, further complicating matters. These latent motor abnormalities can be further subdivided into three major subtypes, including tardive dyskinesia, tardive dystonia, and tardive akathisia.

Tardive dyskinesia is characterized by truncal, appendicular, or orobuccolingual choreiform movements; whereas tardive dystonia manifests as stereotyped twisting and turning muscle spasms. Tardive dyskinesia also tends to have aÂ later age of onset than tardive dystonia.
