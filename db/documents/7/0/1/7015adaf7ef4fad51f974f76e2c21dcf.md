There are currently many FDA-approved clinical applications of HBOT with quality evidence of its effectiveness. Most recently, the treatment of acute sensorineural hearing loss with HBOT was recognized in 2011. A number of other approved indications such as severe anemia, crush injuries, necrotizing soft tissue infections, and osteomyelitis have been mentioned above; however, not all health care providers are aware of the effectiveness of HBOT and often refer patients after the critical window of opportunity has passed.

Therefore, it is essential to educate the medical community that HBOT reaches beyond DCS in divers and carbon monoxide poisoning. Surgeons can use HBOT preoperatively and postoperatively to improve surgical outcomes. Internists can better treat diabetic foot ulcers or refractory anemia, while otolaryngologists can treat hearing loss with HBOT. The list of approved and experimental conditions continues to grow, and it is essential for providers to not only familiarize themselves with HBOT but to educate their patients about its potential and offer it as supplementary therapy when appropriate.
