While this disease process is not inherently dangerous, effective treatment may improve the patient's quality of life. While all-comers with suspected sphincter of Oddi dysfunction may undergoÂ ERCP and possible sphincterotomy, this is not necessarily warranted. Those that see the greatest improvement in symptoms are types I and II, particularly with abnormal sphincter manometry. However, even in these patients, symptoms generally do not resolve entirely, suggesting a multifactorial cause for pain.
