When suspecting C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency, it may present with airway compromise from laryngeal edema or a more benign presentation of unexplained hands and foot swelling. First, care should be taken to ensure the airway is secured; this can be via traditional airway methods but will be made difficult due to airway swelling. Further evaluation should take place on a trial basis of classic allergic airway swelling management (epinephrine, steroids, antihistamines). In the case of C1 inhibitor deficiency, these methods will not work. At this point, a presumptive diagnosis can be made, but for a definitive diagnosis, clinicians can obtain C4 levels. In the case of C1 inhibitor deficiency, C4 levels will be low. Further testing can include C1NH protein levels and function studies for definitive diagnosis.
