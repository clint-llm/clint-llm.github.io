Nephron pathologies are as complex as their structure. Each section of the nephron is susceptible to different forms of damage; for instance, glomerular diseases are often immunologically mediated, whereas tubular and interstitial disorders are more likely to be caused by toxic or infectious agents. However, a sole disease can affect more than one structure, and the structure interdependence in the kidney affects other components when only one part is damaged.Â Immune disorders affecting glomeruli can be either 1) mediated by antibodies against glomerular antigens, 2) mediated by complement, or 3) pauci-immune. The clinical manifestations and the microscopic appearance of the glomerulus will depend on the mechanism of damage.
