Group 3 PH onset is silent due to signs and symptoms similar to the underlying lung disease and long-standing hypoxia. Progression of pulmonary hypertension can affect the patientâ€™s quality of life and worsen mortality. Thus, it is imperative to recognize the development of PH in the early stage of the disease, which may improve long-term patient outcomes and survival.

Managing pulmonary hypertension requires an interprofessional team of clinicians, including a primary physician, pulmonologist, PH expert, specialty pharmacist, radiologist, and echocardiography expert. Patients with PH require close follow-up with regular lab work, echocardiography, 6MWD, and oxygen saturation on exertion to track the progression of the disease. Shared decision-making between the multiple specialties is required to plan and advance the treatment. Group 3 PH can overlap with group 1 (PAH) and group 2 PH (left heart disease) and requires referral to centers with expertise in treating PH with ongoing clinical trials.
