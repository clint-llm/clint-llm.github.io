Diffusion tensor imaging is an advanced magnetic resonance imaging modality that uses the Brownian motion of water molecules to provide data for images. Diffusion tensor imaging has been shown to help with increased sensitivity of and improving identification of pathology earlier in its process. This activity outlines the clinical significance and issues of concern with a relatively young and diagnostically powerful submodality of magnetic resonance imaging.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the clinical significance of diffusion tensor imaging.
- Review the physics of diffusion tensor imaging.
- Identify the issues of concern for diffusion tensor imaging.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance awareness and utilization of this relatively new and diagnostically powerful submodality of magnetic resonance imaging called diffusion tensor imaging.
