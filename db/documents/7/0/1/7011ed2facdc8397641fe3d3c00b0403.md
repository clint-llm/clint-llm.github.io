**Laboratory Tests**

Laboratory testing involves both blood and urine testing. Specific hormonal level testing is usually dictated by correlating symptoms; however, more commonly, a panel of hormone testing is performed when incidental or nonfunctioning tumors are involved. An endocrinologic workup is performed primarily to rule out hypersecretory tumors. Routinely tested levels include prolactin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1). Early morning cortisol levels are reserved for patients with symptomatic manifestations of Cushing disease.

Hyposecretory adenomas are tumors that cause the hyposecretion of hormones from the pituitary gland and can involve one or more hormones. Hyposecreting tumors require measuring levels of multiple hormones such as thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), free T4, total testosterone (in men), and cortisol. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism requires magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain at the time of diagnosis to rule out a pituitary tumor as the underlying etiology. Confirmatory testing with stimulatory testing follows basic laboratory testing, and these tests are specific to the hormone of interest.

**Imaging**

A sellar MRI is the recommended radiographic imaging technique for evaluating the pituitary gland. On imaging or gross pathology, they can be classified according to their size as macroadenomas when greater than 1 centimeter or microadenomas when less than 1 centimeter.
