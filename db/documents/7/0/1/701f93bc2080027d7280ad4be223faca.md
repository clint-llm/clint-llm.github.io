Prevention of gene expression is one way in which antibiotics can kill bacteria. Since transcription is an essential process for all organisms, the transcription machinery is an extremely attractive target for the development of new antibiotics. Rifampicin is a commonly used antibiotic against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Belonging to the ansamycin class of antibiotics, rifampicin binds to the beta subunit of RNAP within the DNA/RNA channel and prevents the formation of the second or third phosphodiester bond, inducing the release of short abortives and subsequently blocking nascent RNA extension.Clostridium difficile RNAP. Instead of the beta subunit, fidaxomicin binds to the switch region of RNAP.

Along with prokaryotic transcription inhibition, researchers have discovered several compounds that target eukaryotic RNAP. Actinomycin D is a bacterial antibiotic used as an antitumor reagent. It intercalates DNA, thereby preventing the progression of both bacterial and eukaryotic RNAP I.
