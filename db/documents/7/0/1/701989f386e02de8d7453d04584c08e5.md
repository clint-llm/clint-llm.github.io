The pathophysiology of Mondor Disease is incompletely understood. Inciting factors such as direct trauma from tight clothing, surgery, or underlying system diseases such as breast cancer or hypercoagulable states have been described as causes for the resulting sclerosing thrombophlebitis of affected superficial veins. This process evokes an inflammatory response including pain, swelling, and redness at the site with a resultant fibrosed cord-like superficial vein visible and palpable. The process of re-cannulization can take between four and eight weeks, with most patients having a complete resolution of symptoms.
