Most instances of Turner syndrome are not inherited. When monosomy X is the cause, the chromosomal abnormality is a random event during the formation of reproductive cells in the person’s parent. An error in cell division is called nondisjunction and can result in reproductive cells with an abnormal number of chromosomes. For example, a sex chromosome can become lost from an egg or a sperm cell due to nondisjunction. If an atypical reproductive cell contributes to the genetic makeup of a child, each cell will possess a single X chromosome, and the other sex chromosome will be missing.

Mosaic Turner syndrome is likewise not an inherited condition. It occurs due to a random event during the cell division stage in the early fetal development of the affected individual. As a result, some of a person's cells have the usual two sex chromosomes, while other cells contain only one copy of the X chromosome. Other sex chromosome abnormalities are possible in females with X chromosome mosaicism. Rarely, Turner syndrome can result from a partial deletion of the X chromosome, and this can pass from one generation to the next.
