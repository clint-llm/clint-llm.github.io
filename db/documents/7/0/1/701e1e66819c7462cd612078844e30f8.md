Carbidopa is indicated for combination use with levodopa (L-dopa) for the treatment of motor symptoms encountered in Parkinson disease (PD), post-encephalitic parkinsonism, and parkinsonism symptoms resulting from intoxication by carbon monoxide or manganese.

Parkinsonâ€™s disease is a disorder of decreased dopamine-secreting neurons of the substantia nigra, causing several motor symptoms, including bradykinesia, cogwheel rigidity, resting tremor, shuffling gait postural instability.

More recently, there have been suggestions that carbidopa has potential anticancer properties through its role as a selective aryl hydrocarbon receptor modulator (SAhRM).
