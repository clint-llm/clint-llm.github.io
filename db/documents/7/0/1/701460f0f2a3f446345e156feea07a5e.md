Electrode array placement into the cochlea is a current treatment option for high-grade sensorineural hearing loss. Surgical complications are typically associated with surgical technique or device failure. Complications classified as either minor or major. The most common minor complications include infections, vestibular problems, and persistent tinnitus. Major complications include more serious infections such as coalescent mastoiditis or meningitis, damage to middle or inner ear structures, and device failure problems.

During electrode array surgery, surgeons should be aware of the location of the petrous portion of the internal carotid artery as well as the jugular bulb. These structures lie near the tympanic cavity and should be avoided during surgery. Although not common, anatomical variations for both of these structures occur including the absence of the bone dividing these vessels and the middle ear and positioning of one or more vessel in either a superior or lateral direction from normal. During surgery, these structures can be damaged, or damage may occur due to post-surgical inflammation. To avoid these complications, CT or MRI imaging of the region should be performed prior to surgery to identify anatomical abnormalities. If imaging reveals anomalies, surgery within the tympanic cleft should be avoided.
