VFS most frequently occurs with intravenous vancomycin but may rarely occur from oral or intraperitoneal vancomycin.

The increased incidence of methicillin/oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, multiresistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and metronidazole-resistant Clostridium difficile has led to an increase in the use of vancomycin. Vancomycin is commonly used to treat bacterial endocarditis, abscesses with cellulitis, postoperative wound infections, infected surgically placed devices, and central line-associated bloodstream infections.

There are case studies of VFS occurring from other antibiotics such as rifampin, cefepime, teicoplanin, ciprofloxacin, and amphotericin B.
