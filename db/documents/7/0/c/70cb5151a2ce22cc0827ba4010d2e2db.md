- Early miscarriage or intrauterine fetal demise due to hydropic changes in the fetus

- Fetal or neonatal anemia: Severe hemolytic anemia (hemoglobin <7 g/dL) can develop due to the exaggerated immune response by the maternal body. This leads to a decrease in oxygen saturation and a delay in pulmonary maturation prenatally and cyanosis with high output cardiac failure in postnatal life due to compensatory changes in cardiac myocytes due to a decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.

- Kernicterus can developÂ as unconjugated bilirubin can get deposited in the central nervous system of the neonate, causing neurological degeneration, which can persist later in life even in 83% of the neonates after the resolution of anemia and jaundice.

- Potential recurrence of complications in future children of the mother
