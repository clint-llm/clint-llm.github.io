The termÂ atrioventricular (AV) dissociation describes a family of arrhythmias where independent pacemakers control the atria and ventricles. The standard activation of the cardiac circuits works in the order of impulse transmission from the sinoatrial (SA) node to the atria, the AV node, and ventricular activation via the His-Purkinje system.

Disruption in this pathway leads to a dissociation between the conduction rates of the atria and ventricle. The severity of this event varies, from benign in cases of isorhythmic AV dissociation to complete heart block, which in cases might be fatal if not treated with a permanent pacemaker. Another important cause of this condition is ventricular tachycardia, which is lethal if not recognized or treated appropriately.
