Before the implementation of closed-chest compressions in the early 1960s, open cardiac massage was a common procedure performed during cardiac arrest. Open cardiac massage is typically performed when there is inadequate cardiac output, after emergency thoracotomy for penetrating chest trauma, during pericardial tamponade, or during cardiac arrest following recent chest surgery. This activity describes the utility of cardiac massage and the technique involved in performing it. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients who are receiving or who have received open cardiac massage.
