The monitoring of ventilator bundle implementation is often required for mechanically ventilated patients. Continuous education regarding the importance of monitoring and implementation of preventative strategies has shown to improve multidisciplinary awareness and adherence, thereby facilitating improved patient outcomes.

Nursing staff typically play a key role in monitoring patients’ vital signs and clinical stability to detect acute deterioration in clinical status; alerting attending physicians to such deterioration; monitoring ventilator settings alongside respiratory therapists; responding to ventilator alert signals (for example alarm activation from acutely decreasing oxygen saturation); monitoring for decubitus ulcers and other complications and, monitoring patient requirements for sedation and analgesia.

Attending physicians and critical care specialists have the responsibility establishing diagnoses, instituting appropriate holistic management of patients; communication with patients and their relatives; monitoring of patients’ response to treatment in respect to clinical, laboratory and radiologic findings; conducting VAE surveillance in clinical settings; and keeping informed of up-to-date, safe treatment protocols (for example, local antibiotic programs on empiric treatment for VAP).

Ultimately, the responsibility of interprofessional team monitoring, communication, and care coordination is shared among attending physicians, nursing staff, dieticians, respiratory therapists, speech therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, and all other involved health professionals to facilitate optimal patient outcomes.
