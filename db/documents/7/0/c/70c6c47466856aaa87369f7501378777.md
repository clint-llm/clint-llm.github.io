Ocular hypotony can arise from several causes, including trauma, surgery, intraocular inflammation, and the use of systemic and topical medications. It can result in severe vision loss, especially if complicated by hypotony maculopathy or hypotony keratopathy. However, treatment, which can be medical or surgical, can be rewarding and result in the reversal of hypotony and return of vision. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of ocular hypotony and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of ocular hypotony.
- Summarize the clinical features and evaluation of ocular hypotony.
- Review the complications of ocular hypotony.
- Explain the management of ocular hypotony.
