Often corneal arcus are benign findings in the elderly. In individuals under 50 (especially men), the condition is associated with a greater incidence of underlying atherosclerotic disease. These associations warrant a lipid analysis in individuals with corneal arcus in patients under the age of 50, which is not necessary for individuals greater than 50. Although the association between corneal arcus in men younger than 50 and underlying lipid metabolism disorders is significant, it is important to note that sometimes arcus can be clinically insignificant even in men less than 50. The presence of unilateral corneal arcus may be indicative of advanced carotid vascular disease.
