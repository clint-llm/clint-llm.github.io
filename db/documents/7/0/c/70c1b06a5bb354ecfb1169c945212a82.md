Along with endobronchial ultrasound with biopsy, mediastinoscopy is an important clinical procedure performed in the diagnosis of disease pathologies that occur in the mediastinum, most notably bronchogenic carcinoma. It is recommendations that patients that patients initially receive an endobronchial ultrasound biopsy before induction therapy, and then mediastinoscopy following the therapy. Many centers are using video-assisted mediastinoscopy as it improves surgical visualization and allows the surgeon to use multiple instruments at once. These are both methods for staging non-small cell lung cancer. It is expected that both treatment modalities will increase in number in the future. A single institution study showed that mediastinoscopy was marginally cheaper than the endobronchial ultrasound biopsy.
