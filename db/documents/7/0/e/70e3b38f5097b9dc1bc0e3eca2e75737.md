Ommaya reservoir is a ventricular access device for the purpose of repetitive access to the intrathecal space. This device is named after its inventor, a Pakistani neurosurgeon Ayub Khan Ommaya in 1963.

For many decades, the Ommaya reservoir was inserted by a freehand technique. If ventriculomegaly is not present, accurate placement of the ventricular end may often be difficult. Multiple attempts through the brain cortex can result in complications such as hemorrhage, intracranial infection, and seizures. Computed tomography-assisted stereotactic placement of the Ommaya reservoir for small or normal-sized ventricles formed the basis for future neuronavigation techniques.
