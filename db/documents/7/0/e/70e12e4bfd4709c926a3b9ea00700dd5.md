Optic pathway gliomas are benign CNS tumors that primarily affect children. Although typically slow growing, the location of these tumors makes resection impossible without loss of vision in at least one eye. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients with optic pathway gliomas. There is particular emphasis placed on the currently evolving treatment options and recommendations, which highlights the role of an interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of optic pathway gliomas.
- Outline the presenting clinical signs and symptoms of optic pathways gliomas.
- Review the current management options available for optic pathway gliomas. 
- Describe the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to ensure all treatment options for optic pathway gliomas are considered.
