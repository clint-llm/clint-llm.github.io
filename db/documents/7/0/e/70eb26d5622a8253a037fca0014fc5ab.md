The most typical cause of esophageal ulcers is gastroesophageal reflux with a majority of patients having some degree of a hiatal hernia on endoscopic evaluation. The lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is usually responsible for inhibiting the reflux of gastric content, but when it becomes weak, this protective mechanism is lost, resulting in exposure of the esophageal mucosa to gastric acid causing ulceration. Also, repeated induced vomiting as seen in a patient with bulimia nervosa, periodically cause exposure of the esophageal mucosa to gastric contents thereby causing ulceration or worsening existing ulceration.

Infections causing inflammation of the esophagus includes Candida species, Herpes simplex, and cytomegalovirus. These infections are commonly seen in immunocompromised individuals who are prone to opportunistic infections.

Several drugs have been implicated in causing pill-induced esophagitis as a result of prolonged contact with the esophageal mucosa. Culprit drugs include NSAIDs, bisphosphonates, and some antibiotics. Chronic consumption of acid rich foods such as caffeinated drinks, alcohol, cigarette smoking can worsen esophageal ulcers by destroying the esophageal mucosa lining and delaying the regeneration of a healthy mucosa. Corrosive or caustic agents and ingested foreign bodies can cause direct esophageal mucosa damage on contact. Idiopathic marginal ulcers have also been reported.
