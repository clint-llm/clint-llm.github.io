When individuals are categorized as obese, additional testing should be performed. For those with a BMI > 30 kg/m^2, a fasting lipid panel, thyroid function tests, liver function tests, fasting glucose, and hemoglobin A1c should always be performed. For individuals with a BMI < 18 kg/m^2, thyroid level, comprehensive metabolic panel, psychiatric screening for an eating disorder, and malabsorption conditions should be assessed. Screening for malignancy should be performed if a patient experiences rapid and unintentional weight loss.
