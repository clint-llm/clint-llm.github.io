Accidental hypothermia occurs when the body dissipates more heat than it absorbs or creates, leaving the body unable to generate sufficient heat to maintain homeostasis and proper bodily function. While the underlying cause of accidental hypothermia is excessive cold stress and inadequate heat generation from the body (thermogenesis), other factors increase the risk of developing hypothermia. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of hypothermia and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of accidental hypothermia.
- Identify the typical presentations of a patient with accidental hypothermia.
- Summarize the treatment options available for accidental hypothermia.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by accidental hypothermia.
