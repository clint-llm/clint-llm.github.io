Studies in the United States have indicated a 61 per 100,000 incidence rate of meniscal tears in the general population and up to an 8.7 per 1,000 incidence rate in the active-duty military population.  Given the etiology of tears, it is not surprising that infantry-related duties, occupations that require frequent squatting/kneeling, and sports such as soccer, rugby, football, basketball, baseball, skiing, and wrestling all increase the risk of meniscal tears. Male gender and age over 40y/o are also associated with increased risk of meniscal tears. Medial meniscal tears are more common than lateral meniscal tears, possibly due to the relatively decreased mobility of the medial meniscus secondary to its connection to the MCL. In addition, people with ACL-deficient knees are more at risk for the development of medial meniscal tears, especially if ACL reconstruction is delayed for longer than one year from the time of initial injury.  Meniscal tears in children under the age of 10y/o are uncommon. However, the presence of a discoid meniscus, an anatomic variant most often occurring in the lateral meniscus that involves the additional central extension of the meniscus over the tibial articular surface, may predispose someone to tears at a younger age.
