A multidisciplinary approach to treatment strategy is recommended in patients with cicatricial pemphigoid to achieve optimal care. A thorough physical examination and a full review of systems will guide the determination of appropriate specialty care. Dermatology, ophthalmology, dentistry, otolaryngology, gastroenterology, colorectal surgery, and gynecology may comprise the treating team. It is important to recognize that control of disease activity through medical therapy should be achieved before embarking on surgical correction of adhesions or strictures. Surgical interventions may further flare the active disease.
