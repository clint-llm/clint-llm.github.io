**Skin & Mucosa**

Keratohyalin granules are typically present in the stratum granulosum of the epidermal layer of the skin (and epithelium of the mucosae). KHG are protein structures found in the keratinocytes of the stratum granulosum that appear in two main variants.  Globular KHG are found in quickly dividing epithelia, such as the oral mucosa; whereas, stellate KHG are in the slowly dividing normal epidermis.

**Thymus**

Additionally, KHG is also present in the cytoplasm of Hassall’s corpuscles of the thymus gland.
