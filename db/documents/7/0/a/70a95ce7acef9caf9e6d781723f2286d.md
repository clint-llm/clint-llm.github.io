It is crucial to distinguish esotropia from other close differentials, as discussed below:

- **Pseudoesotropia**can be distinguished from true esotropia by the presence of prominent epicanthal folds, small interpupillary distance, negative angle kappa, or an excessive broad nasal bridge.

- **Ciancia syndrome**– This is characterized by the presence of large-angle esodeviation (>60 prism diopters). Both eyes appear to be stuck towards the nose, limited bilateral abduction with good abduction saccades, jerk endpoint nystagmus on attempted abduction, with no nystagmus on adduction, face turn towards fixing eye, and a tight medial rectus muscle on forced duction test.

- **Congenital fibrosis syndrome**– This is also called strabismus fixus. The patient usually presents with large-angle esotropia with severe limitation of abduction of one or both eyes. Often, family history is present in these cases and shows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.

- **Congenital sixth nerve palsy**– These can present as unilateral or bilateral cases. Doll's head maneuver reveals limited abduction based on laterality.

- **Nystagmus blockage syndrome**refers to a condition in which esotropia occurs in a child with congenital nystagmus. It is proposed that esotropia occurs secondary to an adduction or excessive convergence to reduce nystagmus. Few authors have proposed the two components of esotropia in these cases – a static angle of infantile esotropia and a superadded dynamic angle of esotropia due to convergence to dampen the nystagmus.

- **Cyclic Esotropia**– Alternate repeated strabismic and non-strabismic phases characterize this form. The cycles may vary from 24 hours of strabismic and non-strabismic phases or 48 hours or 72 hours cycles each. This form of strabismus can be acquired at any age but is most commonly seen between 2 to 6 years.

- **Microtropia**– This is characterized by a slight angle of heterotopia in the range of 1 to 5 degrees. Other clinical features include a relative scotoma on the fovea, abnormal retinal correspondence, mild amblyopia, defective stereo acuity, and a normal or near-normal peripheral fusion with amplitudes.
