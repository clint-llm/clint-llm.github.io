This case presents an excellent opportunity to discuss the importance of an interprofessional team management in managing patients with renal failure and HIV. Having either HIV or renal failure can overwhelm patients due to the complexity of care required for proper management and the need for long-term treatment. Patients with renal failure who depend on hemodialysis experience extraordinarily high burdens of stress which adversely affect treatment compliance and subsequent outcomes. Thankfully,Â interprofessional management of dialysis patients delivers a multitude of benefits including better clinical outcomes, cost savings, and improved patient quality of life.
