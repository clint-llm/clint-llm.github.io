The prevalence of obesity continues to rise with the United States of America (USA) currently ranking second in the world. According to CDC data, in 2015-2016, the prevalence of obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 30) was 39.8% affecting approximately 93.3 million adults in the United States. Almost 5% of the population was extremely obese (BMI greater than or equal to 40). Obesity predisposes to multiple comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes, cancer, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, heart disease, and increased risk of stroke gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), osteoarthritis, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

Treatment options for obesity include nonoperative management or bariatric surgery. The nonoperative management is a multimodality approach, including dietary changes, increasing physical activity, behavioral modifications, and pharmacotherapies. Dietary and exercise advice has little proven benefit for the majority. A cross-sectional study assessing 109000 people in the USA using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance found that while the majority of people were attempting to lose weight, only 20% can reduce their energy intake and do 150 minutes of exercise per week.

Different options for bariatric operations are malabsorptive, restrictive, or both and include Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and gastric banding.  In a meta-analysis evaluating 11 studies with 796 patients (BMI range 30-52), individuals allocated to bariatric surgery lost more bodyweight with a mean difference of 26 kg compared to those treated with non-surgical management. Researchers noted that the surgical group had a higher remission rate of type 2 diabetes, lower plasma triglyceride, greater improvement in the quality of life, and reductions in medicine use.

Roux-en-Y Gastric bypass is a restrictive-malabsorptive procedure that was introduced in 1966 by Mason. It accounted for over 60 to 70% of all bariatric operations in the United States since 2003. However, FDA approval in 2001 has led to a slow uptake of banding, which in 2011 exceeded bypass (46% vs. 44%) in estimated figures.

Obesity is defined by WHO according to body mass index - BMI (kg/m^2) 18.5 to 24.9 normal range, 25 to 25.9 overweight (pre-obese), 30 to 34.9 obese class I, 35-35.9 obese class II, 40 to 49.9 obese class III.
