Patients with toxoplasmosis often present with cervical and/or generalized lymphadenopathy, cerebral encephalitis, and ocular toxoplasmosis. The histological findings of the viscera commonly involved are discussed below:

- Lymph-node biopsy - The triad of follicular hyperplasia, micro-granulomas, and monocytoid B-cell hyperplasia are highly specific to T. gondii infection.

- Brain biopsy - Histology usually reveals necrotic areas with patchy diffuse encephalitis, cyst-containing lesions, microglial nodules, granulomas, and lymphocytic vasculitis.

- Ocular biopsy - Characterized by necrosis in the setting of segmental panophthalmitis with associated tissue cysts and tachyzoites.

Hematoxylin and eosin staining of tissue demonstrateÂ T. gondii parasites (either in the form of tachyzoites or tissue cysts) in both healthy and necrotic areas. These were often noticed to be closer to blood vessels, indicating hematogenous dissemination of infection.
