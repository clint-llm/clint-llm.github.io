The familial form of HOCM is an autosomal dominant genetically transmitted disorder.  It is the most common genetically transmitted cardiomyopathy.  It can also occur in individuals without family history secondary to de novo mutations. HOCM results from a mutation in genes that encode for one of the nine sarcomere proteins, such as B-myosin heavy chain, troponin, actin, and titin. The mutations cause structural abnormalities in myofibril and myocytes that have the potential to lead to abnormal force generation and conduction abnormalities. The consequences of which are a phenotype for asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy in the absence of other causes.

Other causes of HOCM include:

- Heightened sympathetic stimulation due to excess catecholamine secretion or decreased uptake

- Abnormally thickened coronary arteries which may not dilate normally. This may lead to ongoing myocardial ischemia, that eventually leads to ventricular fibrosis and compensatory hypertrophy

- Abnormal microcirculation that prevents the normal contractile function of the myofibrils
