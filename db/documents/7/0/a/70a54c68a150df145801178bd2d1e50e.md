Prognosis and successful management of early pregnancy loss depends on a variety of factors including gestation age. Prognosis is generally considered good with all three management options.

- **Expectant management:**in a meta-analysis of 20 studies, expectant management and medical management were both determined to be acceptable treatment options for incomplete abortion.

- **Medical management:**medical management is more successful with multiple-dose regimens of misoprostol. Patients with incomplete abortion are treated more successfully with medical management than with expectant management.

- **Surgical Treatment:**at least one large randomized control trial determined a higher success rate in surgical treatment than with medical management, with a general conclusion of the general safety of both treatment options.
