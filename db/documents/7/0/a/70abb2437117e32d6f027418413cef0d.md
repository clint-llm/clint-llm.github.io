Nephrotoxicity with the use of aminoglycoside antibiotics occurs primarily through renal tubular toxicity. Additional mechanisms are a decrease in glomerular filtration and a reduction of blood flow to the kidneys. If discontinued, this damage is usually temporary. Patient-specific risk factors for increased toxicity include age, impaired renal function, and dehydration. In contrast, treatment-specific risk factors are often related to prolonged therapy or high dosage, and they should always merit consideration before administering neomycin. It is also essential to consider concurrent medications that impair renal function, such as NSAIDs, diuretics, iodine contrast media, and other aminoglycosides.

The possibility of ototoxicity is a serious consideration with neomycin, as hearing loss is often permanent. The feared complication is bilateral; high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss is secondary to cochleotoxicity.

According to the manufacturer's labeling, there is no antidote for neomycin, but hemodialysis can remove neomycin from the blood.
