**Autonomic function assessment:**Valsalva maneuver is an integral part of the Ewing battery of tests used for the evaluation of cardiac autonomic neuropathy.

**Assessment of heart failure:**VM is useful for the assessment of heart failure. Patients with heart failure show an abnormal blood pressure overshoot in response to the Valsalva maneuver due to impaired ventricular function.

**Termination of Arrhythmias:**VM is also useful for the termination of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) with variable success. Increased vagal activity, leading to increased refractoriness of atrioventricular (AV) nodal tissue interrupting re-entry, has been proposed as the mechanism for the termination of PSVT.

**Diagnosis of murmurs:**VM may be used to differentiate between different murmurs. Since the maneuver reduces preload and thus end-diastolic volume, it can help accentuate some murmurs while diminishing others. The murmur of aortic stenosis (AS) is reduced in intensity on the administration of VM because reduced end-diastolic volume (EDV) diminishes the blood available for ejection through the stenosed aortic orifice.
