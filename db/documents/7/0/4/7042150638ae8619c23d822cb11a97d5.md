The brachioradialis muscle can be palpated in the anterolateral forearm. The brachioradialis originates proximally from the lateral supracondylar ridge of the humerus and inserts distally to the radial styloid process of the radius. Given these attachments, the brachioradialis only crosses the elbow joint. The muscle has a fusiform shape where it widens at the muscle belly andÂ narrows distally to become a thin tendon at its distal insertion point. The brachioradialis contributes to the muscle mass overlying the anterolateral forearm.

The brachioradialis muscle contributes to the boundaries of the cubital fossa, forming the lateral boundary along with the wrist extensors. The cubital fossa is on the anterior surface of the elbow and contains important structures such as the brachial artery, median nerve, and biceps tendon.

There are five compartments of the forearm which include the volar superficial, volar deep, dorsal superficial, dorsal deep, and mobile wad. The brachioradialis is located in the mobile wad compartment along with the extensor carpi radialis longus and extensor carpi radialis brevis muscles.

The brachioradialis primarily acts as a flexor of the elbow. The muscle has been shown to be active during elbow flexion whether the forearm is supinated, neutral, or pronated. The brachioradialis functions to stabilize the forearm during elbow flexion.
