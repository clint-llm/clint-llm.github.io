Variations in hamstring muscles and their attachments are rare. One variation noted in current research is the distinct origination of the biceps femoris long head and semitendinosus from separate tendons attached to the ischial tuberosity as opposed to their more common shared origination from the common (conjoint) tendon to the ischial tuberosity.

Additional isolated variations have appeared through cadaver dissections. Of note on one cadaver was the lack of union between the short and long head of the biceps femoris while still inserting into the fibular head. On another, two anomalous muscles, one arising as a “third head of biceps femoris” and another as an independent muscle inserting into semitendinosus, were seen on post-mortem dissection.
