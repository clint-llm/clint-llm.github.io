Donor tendons are attached to recipient tendons most commonly using the Pulvertaft weave. Utilizing this method, the donor tendon is woven back and forth through the substance of the recipient's tendon with each pass 90 degrees perpendicular to the previous pass and fixed to the tendon using a mattress suture of 2-0 or 3-0 ticron or fiberwire depending on surgeon preference and the size of the tendon. A minimum of three passes should be used for appropriate strength.

Complications are related mainly to an improper initial graft tensioning and repair site rupture or loosening as a result of slit propagation or knot failure. Alternative repair techniques (spiral linking and loop-tendon suture) can be used based on surgeon preference to help improve the biomechanical strength of the repair site with the tradeoff of increased bulk of the repair.
