If untreated, HIV can increase the rate of morbidity and mortality. However, due to the advancement of ART, increase in monitoring, and data from clinical trials, pediatric and adult patients have better prognosis and outcomes. The average survival rate is about 10 years of age with approximately 15% of children having a rapid progression of the disease. The clinician should collaborate with the patient to optimize their nutrition, control viral replication, initiate aggressive treatment for opportunistic infections, and decrease social stressors. The risk of complications is greater with co-infections and hematological disturbances, such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia.
