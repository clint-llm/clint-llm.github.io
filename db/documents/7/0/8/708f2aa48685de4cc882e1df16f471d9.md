KB testing has obstetrical implications in the diagnosis and prognosis of preterm labor, fetal demise, and other conditions.

There is some controversy on KB testing in the setting of trauma in pregnancy. This test has been historically only recommended for the Rh-negative pregnant patient with major trauma. However, the term ‘major’ is not specifically defined by most authors. Intuitively, however, the risk of FMH would increase with higher magnitude blunt force, anterior placental location, and coagulopathies, among other factors. Some advocate its use in all pregnant trauma patients, including those who are RhD negative. It has been shown that a positive KB test accurately predicts the risk of preterm labor following trauma, whereas clinical assessment does not.

A study found that the Kleihauer Betke test was not useful to screen for fetal anemia, but instead, it could be used to explain fetal anemia.
