PHFs most commonly occur in the elderly.  The three most common osteoporotic (i.e. fragility) fractures include:

- vertebral compression fractures

- distal radius fractures

- proximal humerus fractures

While high-energy mechanisms are more likely to result in associated soft tissue and/or neurovascular injuries, increasing age has been associated with more complex fracture types.  The latter can include increasing degrees of comminution, displacement, and fracture/dislocation patterns.  The overall incidence is reported at 4% to 6% with a 2:1 female to male ratio
