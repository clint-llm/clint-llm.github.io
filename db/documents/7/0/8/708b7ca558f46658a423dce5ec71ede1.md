Lidocaine is a local anesthetic agent commonly used for local and topic anesthesia, but it also has antiarrhythmic, and analgesic uses and can be used as an adjunct to tracheal intubation. It is a tertiary amine and is a class Ib antiarrhythmic agent on the Vaughan-Williams classification. This activity reviews the indications, actions, and contraindications for lidocaine as a valuable agent in anesthesiology, cardiology, and pain management. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse effect profile, dosing, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and relevant interactions that are pertinent for members of the interprofessional teams in these specialties and all users of local anesthesia.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the mechanisms of action of lidocaine as an anesthetic, antiarrhythmic, and during airway management.
- Identify the various indications for the use of lidocaine.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with lidocaine toxicity.
- Describe strategies to reduce pain when injecting lidocaine topically.
