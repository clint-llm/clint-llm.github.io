Hemispatial Neglect(HSN) results in multiple complications not only for the patients but for the caretakers as well.

- Occupational insufficiency. HSN makes patients unable to perform their duties because of visual and motor perception deficits in the contralesional field.

- A tendency to develop delirium increases in post-stroke patients with neglect. A study reported up to 48% of patients who have had a stroke develop delirium.

- Safety issues can arise because of the inability of a patient to articulate properly or to act spontaneously in emergency situations making such individuals unable to drive on the road.

- Spatial neglect lengthens the stroke survivors' recovery time to be an independent person again that results in increasing caregivers' stress levels.
