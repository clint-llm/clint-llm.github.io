Complications following lung transplantation can be categorized as:

**1. Immediate**

- Hyperacute rejection

- Donor-recipient mismatch

**2. Early**

- Bleeding

- Primary graft dysfunction - (as a consequence of ischemia-reperfusion injury) is the most common cause of mortality in the early postoperative period and long-term complications like chronic rejection. PGD grade 3 should be expeditiously treated with ECMO.

- Pleural complications- pleural effusion, hemothorax, pneumothorax, chylothorax, air leak,

- Acute kidney injury

**3. Intermediate**

- Acute rejection - it can be classified as acute cellular rejection (ACR), which is T-cell mediated, and antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), which is B-cell mediated.

- Airway complications -Â  bronchial stenosis or dehiscence, which can be treated with either bronchoscopy or surgical intervention

- Vascular complications - pulmonary vein stenosis or occlusion

- Pulmonary thromboembolism

- Infections - CMV, RSV, bacterial, fungal

- Metabolic - hyperammonemia, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease

**4. Late**

- Chronic allograft lung rejection (or bronchiolitis obliterans)

- Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease

- Recurrence of primary disease

- Bronchogenic carcinoma
