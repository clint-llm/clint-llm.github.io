Pelvic fractures, no matter the grade, have the potential to become life-threatening. Treatment for pelvic fractures starts with the ABCs (airway, breathing, and circulation) during the primary survey. Adequate resuscitation is crucial in any trauma patient. Two large-bore IVs should be placed in all patients arriving at the trauma bay. Hypotension should be addressed with aggressive fluid resuscitation, followed by blood products if the patient remains hypotensive.

Pelvic binders should be placed when there are signs of pelvic ring disruption in either stable or unstable patients. The binder acts in two ways to decrease bleeding. It compresses the bleeding from the bones, but they also decrease the volume within the pelvis. By decreasing the volume, it promotes a tamponade effect. Pelvic binders are a temporary measure until a more definitive repair can occur. The pelvic binder is only useful if it is applied correctly; The binder must be placed around the greater trochanter and pubic symphysis to adduct the legs and decrease pelvic volume correctly.

**Hemodynamically Stable Pelvic Fractures**

Evidence of arterial bleed on CT should go directly for angioembolization. Pelvic angiography is usually performed by interventional radiology (IR). Angioembolization is successful in 85% to 100% of cases.

Patients with hemodynamic stable pelvic fractures should be admitted to the hospital for observation.

**Hemodynamically Unstable Pelvic Fractures**

Generally, patients will go for immediate laparotomy if they remain unstable with concern for injury. However, many authors argue angioembolization should be done prior to going to the operating room (OR). The basis of the argument is there is a high likelihood of finding an arterial bleeding source, and because there is a strong correlation between time to embolization and survival as stated above.

Preperitoneal packing (PPP) involves putting packing up against the peritoneum to create a tamponade effect. It is less time consuming than angioembolization. Preperitoneal packing is useful for hemodynamically unstable patients at centers without IR. It can also be used as a bridge to more time-consuming procedures, such as angioembolization, at level 1 trauma centers. Another important use is in patients that are hemodynamically unstable and require other life-saving surgical intervention. Packing is performed through a vertical midline incision of 6 to 8 cm or Pfannenstiel incision. Dissection continues down to fascia; fascia is then incised in the midline to access the preperitoneal space. Ringed forceps are then used to put three surgical pads into the space, with the first being pushed all the way to the sacrum. The same is performed on the contralateral side. Six surgical pads are typically enough to complete the packing. The fascia is then quickly closed over the surgical pads, and the skin is closed in a running fashion.

Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) is an alternative to cross-clamping the aorta. REBOA has emerged in recent years at trauma centers around the world. It uses a balloon catheter to occlude the aorta in an attempt to minimize life-threatening hemorrhage. It has been speculated that REBOA can be useful in pelvic trauma. Literature has shown zone III (infra-renal) occlusion is useful in pelvic trauma as it has little visceral organ insult.

Unstable pelvic fractures require surgical fixation. Early fixation has been shown to improve pain, improved fracture reduction, earlier mobilization, and control of bleeding from fractured bones.

Definitive repair, if needed, is undertaken once the patient has been adequately resuscitated and stabilized. Patients that are hemodynamically stable or “borderline” can be safely taken for definitive repair within 24 hours of injury. Physiologically deranged polytrauma patients should not be taken for definitive repair until they are stable. Studies show post-injury complication rates are increased if definitive repair is completed within four days of injury in polytrauma patients. Complications decreased when surgery was delayed until six to eight days post-injury.

Associated bladder injuries may require repair. The location of the injury dictates the management. Generally, extraperitoneal bladder injuries are treated nonoperatively; intraperitoneal bladder injuries require surgical repair. A foley catheter remains in place for about 14 days. A repeat cystogram should be performed prior to catheter removal.

Sigmoid and intraperitoneal rectal injuries should be debrided and primarily repaired when able. An injury comprising less than 50% circumference is eligible for primary repair. This has been shown to reduce complications. For injuries that cannot be primarily repaired, resection with primary anastomosis is usually performed with or without fecal diversion.

Vaginal laceration treatment is dependent on the degree. First-degree injuries generally only require gauze packing. Second and third-degree injuries require surgical repair, typically by a gynecologist.
