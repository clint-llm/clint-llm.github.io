Cholesteatoma is a confusing misnomer which means fatty bile tumor; however, cholesteatomas are benign collections of keratinized squamous epithelium within the middle ear. There are two major types of middle ear cholesteatomas, congenital and acquired. Congenital cholesteatomas are derived from remnants of epithelium that get trapped behind the tympanic membrane during development. Acquired cholesteatomas do not result from an embryologic phenomenon, but are the result of pathologic changes that cause the uncontrolled growth of squamous keratinized epithelium in the middle ear.Â While the lesions are benign, they can erode into the CNS and cause severe complications. When the cholesteatoma is infected, it is very difficult to cure. Since the lesion has no blood supply, systemic antibiotics cannot get inside the center of the mass. Topical antibiotics only clear superficial infection and thus the ear discharge continues or is recurrent.

This activity will focus on the most common type of cholesteatoma, acquired middle ear cholesteatoma.
