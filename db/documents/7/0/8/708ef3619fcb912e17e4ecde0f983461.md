Headache is a nearly universal complaint. Most headaches are benign, and most patients can be safely treated and discharged with minimal workup. However, many serious and life-threatening conditions may present with headaches. Recognition, evaluation, and appropriate management of these dangerous secondary headaches are critical to preventing long-term disability or death. This activity describes the assessment and medical management of headaches in the emergency department and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in assessing and appropriately treating patients with this chief complaint, with specific emphasis on differentiating benign from concerning presentations.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of common causes of headaches.
- Outline the important exam findings of headaches.
- Describe a management strategy for the treatment of headaches in the emergency department.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for the identification of life-threatening versus benign causes of headaches to improve patient outcomes.
