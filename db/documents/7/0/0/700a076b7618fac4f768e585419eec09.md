The prognosis of hypercalcemia mostly depends on the cause. Hypercalcemia caused by a benign disorder often has a good prognosis. Hyperparathyroidism-induced hypercalcemia is often less severe and of prolonged course. Cases of mild hypercalcemia rarely lead to death if appropriately treated. Cancer-related hypercalcemia often occurs in the later stages of the disease and poses a bleak prognosisÂ with multiple ER visits and frequent hospitalizations.

Hypercalcemia often leads to death in patients with ectopic PTHrP production. These patients rarely survive more than a few weeks or months. Osteolytic metastases tend to cause death from nerve compression and other orthopedic complications.
