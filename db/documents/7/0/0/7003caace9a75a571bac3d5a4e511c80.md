A therapeutic trial confirmed riboflavin deficiency by measuring the rate of urinary excretion of riboflavin. Urinary excretion increases when consuming riboflavin supplements. If urinary riboflavin excretion is lower than 40 micrograms per day, then riboflavin deficiency can occur. Measuring erythrocyte glutathione reductase can aid in detecting riboflavin deficiency. When enzyme activity coefficient with FAD is 1.4 or higher, it indicates riboflavin deficiency.
