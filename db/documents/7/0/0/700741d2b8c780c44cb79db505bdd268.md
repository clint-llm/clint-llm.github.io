Angiotensin II is only available in an intravenous form for IV administration through a central venous line. The drug is available in vials of 2.5 mg/mL and 5 mg/2mL. One vial of the medication gets diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride solution to a concentration of either 5000 ng/mL or 10000 ng/mL before infusion. The higher concentration is for patients who are fluid restricted.

It is started at an infusion of 20 ng/kg per minute and titrated up as needed to a maximum dose of 200 ng/kg/min during the first 3 hours of use and a maximum maintenance dose of 40 ng/kg/min.
