The mucosa of the diverticulum and the surrounding colon exhibit changes on histologic and tissue levels. Diverticular mucosa undergoes expansion of the lamina propria due to the accumulation of lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates. Histologic changes also include mucin depletion, the development of lymphoglandular complexes, and focal Paneth cell metaplasia. Acute inflammation is seen in the form of cryptitis and crypt abscesses. Hemorrhage may be seen in the diverticula and surrounding tissue. Scarring is evident in areas of resolved inflammation.Â  In the mucosa surrounding the orifices of diverticula, we see additional changes, including pseudohypertrophy of the circular muscle leading to mucosal fold exaggeration and muscularization of the lamina propria, hyperplasia of the glands, and hemosiderin deposits, which are seen in the submucosa. The features are usually indistinguishable from those of inflammatory bowel disease.
