Vagus nerve stimulation is an effective antiseizure treatment, albeit without significant treatment-related side effects. Based on the evidence from randomized controlled trials, VNS therapy is an adjunctive treatment aimed towards a maximal reduction in seizure frequency with reduced use of antiepileptic medications.

According to the American Psychiatric Association (APA) adjuvant long-term VNS therapy is specified by FDA in treatment-refractory depression, either unipolar or bipolar, with a history of failure to respond to at least four antidepressant medications. Better efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for treatment-resistant depression should be discussed with the patient and should be considered before the use of the VNS.

The extensive interface of the vagus nerve, between mind, body, gut, and brain, opens a plethora of therapeutic possibilities from seizures and depression to immune modulation. As Dacher Keltner puts it: "The vagus nerve is one of the great mind-body nexuses in the human nervous system."

Overall, an interprofessional team effort involving multiple specialists (neurologists, epileptologists, neurosurgeons, psychiatrists) and medical staff personnel are essential to provide and enhance patients care to achieve good outcomes. Patient education is crucial since these devices require active involvement when there is a need to intervene and provide on-demand stimulation.
