Treatment and prevention of trichinellosis require an interprofessional team effort. Collaboration and effective communication between the healthcare team is crucial to ensure excellent patient care. Infectious disease consultations should be sought when necessary to provide the best treatment options for the patient. Nurses should educate patients on risks of transmission when consuming undercooked or raw meat. Pharmacists, nurses, and clinicians should be aware of the potential side effects of antihelminthic medications used in the treatment of trichinellosis and should explain the associated side effects to the patients. When a patient is diagnosed with trichinella, the team should communicate so that the standard of care treatment is provided.
