Most IgA patients remain asymptomatic their whole life. Coincidentally, they are often diagnosed during routine laboratory screening. However, some patients present with different complaints and clinical phenotypes, mainly with recurrent sinopulmonary infection, allergies, autoimmune diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, malignancies, and other severe complications.Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. More severe symptoms occur when selective IgA deficiency is combined with IgG2 and IgG3 subclass deficiency.

Autoimmune diseases have been observed in roughly 20 to 30% of patients with selective IgA deficiency. With selective IgA deficiency, allergic conjunctivitis, eczema, rhinitis, urticaria, food allergy, and asthma are commonly noted. There is an association of IgA deficiency with type 1 diabetes.

Some autoimmune diseases can have manifestations that can cloud or cover IgA deficiency necessitating an additional workup. Certain conditions like ataxia-telangiectasia can be problematic based on their multiple immunoglobulin deficiencies (IgA, IgG, and IgE are all decreased, unlike in IgA deficiency, where the IgG is normal). Patients with Hyper-IgM syndrome will present with decreased IgA as part of a hypergammaglobulinemia where only the IgM is elevated. These patients present with severe infections and hyperviscosity (due to the increased IgM) and are inherited in either an X-linked or autosomal recessive format.
