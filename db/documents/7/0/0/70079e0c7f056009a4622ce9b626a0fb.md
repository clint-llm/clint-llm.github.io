In recent years, diagnostic strategies increasingly use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to aid therapeutic plans. MRI helps in high-resolution investigations of soft tissues without the use of ionizing radiation. This safe modality currently becomes the imaging technique of choice for diagnosing musculoskeletal, neurologic, and cardiovascular disease. However, there are restrictions and contraindications caused by MRI magnetic fields, machine structure, and gadolinium contrast agents. Healthcare professionals need to be trained in magnetic resonance imaging safety to protect patients as well as other healthcare workers from the potential risks of MRI. It is essential to establish a close collaboration between the radiology team and physicians who provide care for the patient.
