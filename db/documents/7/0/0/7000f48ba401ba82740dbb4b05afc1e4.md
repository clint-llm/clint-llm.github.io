TTP is an infrequent condition, with an annual incidence of 3 to 11 cases per million people and an annual prevalence of 10 cases per million people. It is predominant in women, with a relation 2:1 to 3.5:1. The peak of incidence is in the fifth decade in the United States; meanwhile, in Europe, its peak is in the third decade.

Autoimmune manifestations and other disorders are related to the disease, especially systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The first acute episode affects adults in 90% of cases. In this subgroup, the acquired form is the most frequent. Childhood-onset forms account up to 10%, with the majority of these cases being genetic via recessively inherited mutations. Pregnant women are an exception, as they show a high frequency of inherited forms about 33%, reaching 25% to 66% when considering only the first pregnancy.
