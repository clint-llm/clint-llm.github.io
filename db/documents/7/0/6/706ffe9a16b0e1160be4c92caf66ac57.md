Complications can be encountered in a number of special circumstances. In women with atrophic vaginitis, the speculum exam may be very painful and liberal lubrication, and a narrow speculum is recommended for these patients.

There may be challenges when encountering a patient with a history of sexual trauma; a pelvic examination may trigger anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder. Consent must be acquired. Especially during these examinations, thorough explanations of the procedure should be emphasized. Mental health counseling, anxiolytics, and various alternatives to the exam can be suggested such as only removing the underwear, having a chaperone present, self-insertion of the speculum, offering the option to have a female provider present or having a friend or family member in the room for comfort. It should be stressed that the examiner can stop the exam at any time when requested by the patient.
