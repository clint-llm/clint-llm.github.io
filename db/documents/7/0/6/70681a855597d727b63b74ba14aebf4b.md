The pituitary gland produces and secretes various hormones that play a vital role in regulating endocrine function within the body. The pituitary gland consists of 2 lobes: an anterior and a posterior lobe. Hormones produced by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland include growth hormone (GH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicular stimulating hormone (FSH), adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), and prolactin. Hormones stored and released from the posterior pituitary are antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin, and oxytocin. ADH and oxytocin are produced by neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus. Hyperpituitarism is defined as an excessive secretion or production of one or more of the hormones produced by the pituitary gland. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of hyperpituitarism and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of hyperpituitarism.
- Review the typical presentation of a patient with hyperpituitarism.
- Outline the management options available for hyperpituitarism.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the diagnosis and treatment of hyperpituitarism and improve patient outcomes.
