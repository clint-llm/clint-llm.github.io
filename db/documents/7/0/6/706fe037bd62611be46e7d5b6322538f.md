Testing is not available to aid in the diagnosis of anticholinergic toxicity.  It is a clinical diagnosis based on a thorough history and physical exam.  The anticholinergic reaction can present with symptoms of non-muscarinic drug effects that can further complicate the syndrome. Clinical exam and testing focus on patient presentation and evaluation for all possible causes of delirium. Basic screening tests should include a pregnancy test in childbearing age women, drug levels of acetaminophen, and salicylates to rule out common co-ingestions and fingerstick glucose. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is crucial to evaluate the QT and QRS intervals to rule out cardiotoxicity.
