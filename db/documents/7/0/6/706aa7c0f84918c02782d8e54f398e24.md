Several B-cell and T-cell lymphomas can affect the skin, most of which are T-cell lymphomas. Among primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas, primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL) is the most common. Primary cutaneous lymphomas are classified based on the involvement of the skin without evidence of systemic or nodal disease at the time of diagnosis. B-cell lymphomas, which make up 25% of cutaneous lymphomas, have a distinct clinical course and prognosis compared to histologically comparable systemic lymphomas.
