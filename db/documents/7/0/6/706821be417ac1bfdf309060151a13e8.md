As pregnancy is the most common cause of amenorrhea, young girls should be taught to monitor their cycles and use contraception to avoid unwanted pregnancy. Moreover, it is important to take gynecological history on regular visits as amenorrhea may be a result of an endocrinological disorder. A woman should contact her provider if irregularities in menstruation arise.
