A special situation exists in the management of G6PD patients with methemoglobinemia. Methemoglobin (MetHg) forms in red blood cells when the iron in the heme group of hemoglobin molecules undergoes oxidation from the normal ferrous (Fe 2+) state to the ferric (Fe3+) state. This ferric state is a poor binder of oxygen. Symptoms of hypoxia begin to develop when the level of methemoglobin reaches 10%, and death can occur when the level reaches greater than 50%.

Methemoglobinemia should be considered in patients presenting with central cyanosis and hypoxia whose symptoms are resistant to supplemental oxygen. A specific antidote for severe acute methemoglobinemia is methylene blue. Intravenously injected methylene blue is reduced to leucomethylene blue through NADPH-dependent mechanisms. Leucomethylene blue is then used as a substrate to reduce methemoglobin back to hemoglobin. However, patients who are deficient in G6PD lack sufficient NADPH to properly reduce methylene blue. Unreduced methylene blue can cause further oxidative damage in the G6PD-deficient patient resulting in hemolysis and even death. Therefore, it is important that patients who are known or suspected to have any degree of G6PD deficiency not receive methylene blue. Alternative therapies for G6PD deficient patients presenting with methemoglobinemia include transfusing packed red blood cells or providing hyperbaric oxygen therapy.
