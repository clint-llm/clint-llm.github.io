The prognosis after tetanus depends on the time from the first symptom to the first spasm. In general, with a short time to symptom manifestation, the prognosis is poor. The recovery after tetanus is slow and it can take months. Both neonatal and cephalic tetanus have a poor prognosis.

Some patients develop hypotonia and autonomic dysfunction that lasts for months or years. Even those who survive, need tetanus toxoid as the infection does not confer immunity. Usually, patients survive this illness although recovery is slow and some patients may remain hypotonic.

An established scale can be used to predict the prognosis of tetanus. One point is given for each of the following:

- Incubation - shorter than 7 days

- Onset - less than 48 hours

- Causes of tetanus - burns, surgical wounds, septic abortion, umbilical stump, open fractures, or intramuscular injection

- Addiction to opiates

- Generalized tetanus

- Temperature - more than 104 F (40 C)

- Tachycardia - more than 120/min (150/min in neonates)

The total score indicates disease severity:

- 0-1 - mortality of less than 10%

- 2-3 - mortality of 10-20%

- 4 - mortality of 20-40%

- 5-6 - mortality of more than 50%
