Numerous Streptococcus bacteria can cause meningitis. The most significant one is Streptococcus pneumoniae, probably the leading etiologic agent of meningitis worldwide, both in adults and children. In the beta-hemolytic group, the most notable is group B Streptococcus (GBS) â€“ the most common cause of meningitis in neonates and young infants. Other Streptococci, i.e., belonging to the S. viridans group or group A are very rarely causative pathogens of meningitis in adults or children.
