Healing and protecting the ligaments is vital in all grades of injury. Recommendations include:

Grade 1 & 2: Passive and active prone knee flexion should be initiated in the immediate weeks following injury to help prevent stiffness or contracture. Around six weeks post-injury, the hinged knee brace is removed, and the patient should begin physical therapy. Patients may return to sports only when meeting the following criteria: full, painless knee motion, complete reduction of lateral knee tenderness, and complete resolution of ligamentous laxity. In general, return to sports is approximately four weeks for grade 1 injuries, and ten weeks for grade 2 injuries.

Grade 3: Patients should be non-weight bearing in a knee immobilizer for six weeks after surgical interventions. Like grade 1 and 2 injuries, quadriceps strengthening is imperative throughout recovery. Hamstring strengthening should be avoided for at least four months to prevent damage to the reconstruction. Sport-specific therapy may commence after four months postoperatively.
