The majority of the pertinent anatomy encountered during a vasectomy is within the scrotum. Multiple layers of the scrotum must be entered to gain access to the vas deferens. The tissues that will be encountered, superficial to deep, include the skin, Scarpa’s fascia, dartos, external spermatic fascia (continuation of external oblique), cremaster muscle (continuation of internal oblique), internal oblique fascia (continuation of transversalis fascia), tunica vaginalis (derived from peritoneum), tunica albuginea, and the testicle. The epididymis is on the posterior aspect of the testicle with the head on the superior aspect and the tail on the inferior aspect of the testicle. The epididymal body is between the head and tail. The vas deferens or ductus deferens starts at the tail of the epididymis and runs superiorly and medially with the spermatic cord through the external inguinal ring and the inguinal canal, then into the peritoneum through the internal inguinal ring. The vas deferens enters the ejaculatory duct where it meets with the seminal vesicles. It then travels through the prostate and enters the urethra at the seminal colliculus and ejaculatory duct. It is covered by a vas sheath with its own arterial blood supplied by the artery of the vas deferens. Venous drainage is through the pampiniform plexus, with innervation by short adrenergic neurons.
