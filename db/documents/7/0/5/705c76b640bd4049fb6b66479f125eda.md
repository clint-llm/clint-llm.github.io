Spinal dysraphism encompasses congenital problems that result in an abnormal bony formation of the spine and/or the spinal cord. It is caused by the maldevelopment of the ectodermal, mesodermal, and neuroectodermal tissues. The two major types of spinal dysraphism are based on the appearance, i.e., aperta (open) if the lesion is visible and occulta (closed) if the lesion is not visible on the surface.

This condition also correlates with cutaneous conditions including port-wine stain, hemangioma, hypertrichosis, fibroma pendulum, pigmentary nevus, lipoma, dermal sinus, and deviation of the gluteal furrow. Myelomeningocele is a spinal dysraphism in which the spinal cord and its contents herniate through a congenital bony defect at the posterior elements of the spine, in most cases, the spinous process.
