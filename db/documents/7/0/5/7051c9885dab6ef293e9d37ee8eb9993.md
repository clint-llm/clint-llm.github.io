Autonomic dysreflexia develops in 48% to 70% of patients with a spinal cord injury above the T6 level and is quite unlikely to develop if the injury is below T10.

PatientsÂ prone to this disorder will usually have a documented or personal history of prior episodes, but health professionals need to be alert to an initial presentation without any known prior history of autonomic dysreflexia.
