As with all medical diagnoses, diagnostic tests, medication trials, and interventional treatments, patients should have the condition explained to them in a manner they understand based on their education level and background. It is important to consider important aspects of the patientâ€™s lifestyle and how the condition and any proposed treatment may affect them. The risks, benefits, and alternatives of any medication trial or procedure should be conveyed, and a shared medical decision-making model should be utilized with the patient.
