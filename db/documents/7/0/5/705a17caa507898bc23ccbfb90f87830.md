Tubular carcinoma is a special type of invasive carcinoma with a distinctive morphologic appearance and excellent prognosis. Management of tubular breast carcinoma needs an interprofessional approach involving a team that consists of a surgical oncologist, an oncologist, a pathologist, a radiologist, and a specialty trained nurse. Careful planning and discussion with other professionals involved in the management of patients with tubular carcinoma will improve patient outcomes. Despite its excellent prognosis, careful long-term follow-up is essential for tubular carcinoma because local recurrences can occur after many years. Moreover, the mammographic monitoring of the contralateral breast is critical. The primary care provider and nurse practitioner must refer patients with suspected breast masses to an oncologist for further workup. Pharmacists evaluate prescribed medications, check for drug-drug interactions, and educate patients and their families. Oncology nurses are involved in treatment and education. They also inform the team about changes in the status of the patients.

Tubular carcinoma requires an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. [Level V]
