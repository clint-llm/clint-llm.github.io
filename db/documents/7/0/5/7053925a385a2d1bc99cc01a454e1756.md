Differential diagnosis entirely depends on the presenting symptoms, but generally, when a patient presents with chest pain, a cardiac workup should be immediately done to rule out coronary artery disease. While suspecting esophageal motility disorders, the following differential diagnosis can be made and must be ruled out:

- Coronary artery disease (CAD)

- Chagas disease

- Pseudoachalasia

- Diffuse esophageal spasm

- Hypercontractile esophagus

- Xerostomia

- Globus sensation

The major objectives of history are to differentiate oropharyngeal dysphagia from esophageal dysphagia, xerostomia (hyposalivation), or globus sensation.

Globus sensation, in particular, is frequently confused with dysphagia. Unlike dysphagia, which occurs only during swallowing, globus sensation is prominent between swallows.

Patients relate the nearly constant sensation of having a lump in their throat or feeling a foreign object caught in their throat. In some instances, globus is associated with reflux symptoms, and in others, with substantial anxiety. It is the linkage with anxiety that led to the older nomenclature “globus hystericus.”

Unfortunately, studies have failed to define an objective anatomic or physiologic cause for globus, and we are left with the crucial data being the history; globus sensation persists regardless of the act of swallowing.
