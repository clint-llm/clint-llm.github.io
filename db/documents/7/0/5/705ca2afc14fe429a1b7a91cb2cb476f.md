Eyelid morphogenesis is a complex process involving the coordinated movement of neural crest-derived periocular mesenchymal cells during embryonic development. These cells form eyelid structures, including the levator palpebrae superioris, smooth muscle, and tarsus.

In congenital ptosis, the levator palpebrae superioris muscle is maldeveloped, resulting in a droopy upper eyelid. Genes associated with congenital ptosis include ZFH4 and FOXL2. Mutations in FOXL2 disrupt actin gene expression in the smooth muscle cells of periocular mesenchyma. This results in severe hypoplasia of the levator palpebrae superioris and other craniofacial defects, causing blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus.

The FOXL2 transcription factor also plays a role in sexual development and ovarian function. The expression is highest in granulosa cells of the ovary, and it plays a vital role in folliculogenesis, hormone signaling, cell regulation, proliferation, and apoptosis. In the absence of FOXL2, primary follicle formation in the ovaries is disrupted, and the number of follicles recruited during fetal ovarian development is depleted. The decreased number of follicles formed during ovarian development causes POF and sequelae of reduced estrogen.
