Hemineglect syndrome is a disabling condition with high morbidity and mortality. Hence the health care providers need to educate the other healthcare team members and caregivers regarding different aspects of neglect with its probable side effects in routine functioning. Absence of activity, speech, and emotions may mimic the situation as depression and lack of motivation, so thorough counseling sessions should be set up for the immediate family members involved in patient care. It is crucial to make the patients, families, and caregivers realize that some functional and navigational problems can persist even after the recovery.
