Dizziness is a common complaint in the ambulatory and inpatient settings. Caloric testing is a useful clinical tool in the assessment of dizziness. Caloric testing can assess and quantify the functional status of individual vestibular systems. Caloric testing utilizes the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) to identify a unilateral peripheral deficit as a cause of the patient's symptoms. Because the VOR requires an intact brainstem, caloric testing can also be used to assess brainstem function in comatose patients. This activity describes the indications, contraindications, techniques, and clinical relevance of caloric testing.

**Objectives:**
- Report the indications for performing caloric testing.
- Delineate the technique of caloric testing.
- Apply alternate methods of caloric testing in patients with contraindications to water as a testing medium.
- Implement processes to improve care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients with dizziness.
