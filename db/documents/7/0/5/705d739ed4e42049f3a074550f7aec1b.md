A computed tomography (CT) scanner may be utilized if indicated. This is often the case when an interventional radiologist performs the procedure.

A bone marrow kit should be utilized containing:

- Sterile drapes

- Needles

- Syringes

- An aspiration needle

- A biopsy needle. If performed on the posterior iliac crest, a Jamshidi needle is often preferred for biopsy.

- 1% to 2% lidocaine with or without epinephrine

- Specimen slides

- Specimen containers will be required as well. The number of required pathology slides and specimen containers will vary depending on the type of pathology under investigation and whether or not a biopsy will be performed in addition to the aspiration.
