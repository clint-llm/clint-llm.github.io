Ultrasound is the most common modality and usually the first modality for evaluating the uterus. The anatomy and the contour can be well assessed on ultrasound. The probe can be placed trans abdominally or transvaginally. Transvaginal images offer a better view of the endometrium and the entire myometrium. Color Doppler can be used to evaluate vascularity within the lesions.
