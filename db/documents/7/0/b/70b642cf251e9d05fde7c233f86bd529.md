An interprofessional team consists of a sports medicine team physician, the team's athletic trainer, the physical therapist, and any other associated medical staff.  The medical team must work in conjunction with the athletes, coaches, and, in the case of young athletes, the parents/guardians to achieve the best possible outcomes.

The ultimate goal of the preparticipation screening is to identify at-risk athletes for morbidity and mortality commonly associated with athletes. Therefore, providers have an ethical responsibility to rely on the entire healthcare team to provide high quality care and screening for athletes they serve.
