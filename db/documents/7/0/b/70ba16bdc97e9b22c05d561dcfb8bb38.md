Pathophysiologic processes can vary widely depending on etiology. These can be irritant, allergic, infectious, autoimmune-mediated, and secondary to trauma or malignancy. The majority of cases commence with moisture such as urine, sweat, or smegma (physiologic secretion from genital sebaceous glands) becoming trapped within the preputial space secondary to adhesions and poor hygiene, which in turn creates a nidus for bacteria and fungi. Balanoposthitis can also be commonly provoked by irritants and allergens, causing non-specific inflammation leading to erythema and pruritis.
