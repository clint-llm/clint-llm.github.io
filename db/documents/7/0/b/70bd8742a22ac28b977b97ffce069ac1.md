An electrocardiogram should be performed to assess for myocardial ischemia and tachydysrhythmia. Complete blood count, comprehensive chemistry panel, troponin, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), creatine kinase (CK), and urinalysis are helpful tests to obtain for patients presenting with acute methamphetamine toxicity. Methamphetamine users are rarely forthcoming about their most recent drug use, and a urine toxicology screen is extremely helpful, as the differential diagnoses for sympathomimetic signs and symptoms is quite wide. Computed tomography of the head for acute headache or altered mental status may be necessary to rule our hemorrhage. A chest radiograph is essential for those patients presenting with chest pain or dyspnea.
