ARDS is diagnosed clinically based on the diagnostic Berlin criteria

- Development of new-onset respiratory symptoms within one week of known clinical insult

- Bilateral opacities are apparent on chest radiograph or computed tomography which are not fully explained by other condition such as lobar or lung collapse, pleural effusions, and pulmonary nodules

- Respiratory failure not fully explainable by cardiogenic pulmonary edema or fluid overload - objective assessment such as echocardiography is needed to rule out left ventricular dysfunction and hydrostatic edema in the absence of risk factors for ARDS

- Hypoxemia defined as partial arterial oxygen pressure to a fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio is less than or equal to 300 mmHg

The severity of ARDS is classified according to the PaO2/FiO2 ratio on a mechanical ventilator with minimum positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) or continuous positive airway pressure of 5 cm water.  Classifications are mild (PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than or equal to 300 but greater than 200), moderate (PAO2/FiO2 ration less than or equal to 200 but greater than100) and severe (PaO2/FiO2 less than or equal to 100mmHg).

Diffuse bilateral opacities and infiltrates classically present on chest radiograph, but these findings could be variable showing lobar, dependent or unilateral opacities. Computed tomography usually shows widespread patchy airspace opacities more evident in the dependent areas.

In most situations, the diagnosis and etiology will be evident and confirmed after an initial evaluation. In a small number of patients, the diagnosis and/or etiology is unclear, so further evaluation and diagnostic testing are warranted to confirm the diagnosis and etiology or rule out other diagnoses. These tests could include echocardiography to assess for ventricular function and valvular abnormalities, right side heart catheterizations and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and possibly lung tissue biopsy.
