With the advent of antibiotics, neurosyphilis became a rare diagnosis. However, syphilis has recently made a resurgence because untreated neurosyphilis causes potentially irreversible sequela. Interprofessional team members must consider it in their differential diagnosis for a wide variety of presentations. This will allow for proper diagnosis and treatment and thus improve patient outcomes. This activity explains when neurosyphilis should be in the differential diagnosis and describes the epidemiology, disease manifestations, evaluation, and management of neurosyphilis. Further, this activity reviews the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology and of neurosyphilis.
- Describe the history and physical findings suggestive of neurosyphilis.
- Explain the importance of proper evaluation and treatment of neurosyphilis.
- Outline the importance of a well-coordinated, effective interprofessional team approach in caring for patients affected by neurosyphilis.
