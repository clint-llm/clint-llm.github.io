Juxta-articular lesions in the hips and shoulders are the most likely to become symptomatic. The patient may have increased pain on movement and weight bearing which could end up resulting in the collapse of the articular surface or fracture. The patient may report pain that radiates from the joint down the limb as well as restriction of the range of motion. Non-articular lesions commonly occur in the femoral and humeral shafts and are much less likely to become symptomatic as they rarely involve the cortex or lead to pathologic fracture. A thorough orthopedic examination focusing on the joints is merited, and other causes of bony lesions (including malignancy in addition to other etiologies of osteonecrosis) explored given the relatively uncommon nature of this condition. Specific attention should be paid to whether or not the patient has functional pain.
