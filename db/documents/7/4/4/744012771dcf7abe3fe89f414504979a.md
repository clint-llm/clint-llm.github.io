The degree of monitoring for patients prescribed opioid analgesics is highly provider-dependent. All providers should see patients on opioid therapy for routine follow-up visits that include a history and physical exam to monitor for adverse effects listed previously. Many providers employ a wide variety of other tactics to monitor for signs of abuse, including assessment surveys, state prescription drug monitoring programs, frequent visits with urine toxicology screens, use of adherence check-lists, motivational counseling, and pill counts.
