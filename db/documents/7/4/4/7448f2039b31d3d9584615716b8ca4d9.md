Advanced Lemierre syndrome is a life-threatening condition. Even with appropriate antibiotics and therapy, mortality has been reported to be between 5% and 18%. Hospital admission usually requires intensive care unit (ICU) status, and the average length of stay in the hospital is approximately 3 weeks. Septic emboli and end-organ effects can result in long-term morbidity.
