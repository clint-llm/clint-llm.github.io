Because the potential causes of hypoxic brain injury are diverse, the precise incidence is difficult to quantify. The best data comes from cardiac arrest and resuscitation literature. According to data from the American Heart Association, over half a million patients in the U. S. suffer a cardiac arrest each year. Unfortunately, the vast majority of patients who experience a cardiac arrest do not survive till hospital discharge; of those who do, the majority (50Â to 83%) experienced clinically significant cognitive symptoms.

Clinical outcomes among survivors are variable, but some degree of neurological disability is common; even with state-of-the-art post-resuscitation care, only about 10% of cardiac arrest survivors presenting with non-shockable rhythm achieved a good neurological outcome, defined as neurological function adequate to perform activities of daily living, at 90 days.
