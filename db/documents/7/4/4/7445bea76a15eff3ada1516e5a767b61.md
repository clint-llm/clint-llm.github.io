Hybrid imaging with Positron emission tomography (PET/CT) is emerging as a powerful tool to assess the biochemical profile of cancerous tissues. It evaluates the morphology and function of cancers in one sitting, which has a decisive impact on their treatment planning. This activity focuses on the role of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT in the detection, staging, and follow-up of gastrointestinal malignancies, highlighting the indications and techniques of scanning. Various pitfalls in image interpretation are emphasized, with suggestions for avoiding them. The role of gallium PET/CT in assessing neuroendocrine tumors has been explained. Furthermore, this activity summarises the interprofessional best practice strategies to enhance healthcare outcomes in gastrointestinal malignancies.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the basic principle of PET/CT imaging.
- Review the anatomy of the gastrointestinal tract.
- Outline the indications for PET/CT in gastrointestinal malignancies.
- Summarise the PET/CT findings in gastrointestinal cancers.
