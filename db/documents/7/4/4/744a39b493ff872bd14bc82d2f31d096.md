Patients with gas gangrene (myonecrosis) present with signs of infection such as fever, chills, pain, and less superficial inflammation at the site of infection than one would expect given the deep penetrating nature of these infections. The condition of the patient can rapidly progress to sepsis and death if not treated aggressively. The wound discharge is often dishwater looking with a musty order. It can involve the vasculature that supplies large areas of infected tissue leading to necrosis of the subcutaneous fat down to the fascia and extends into the deeper muscle. If the nerves are damaged, the severity of the pain is less than expected for the extent of infection. The drainage from the necrotic tissue often has a dishwater appearance and musty order.

Signs of severe sepsis include septic shock, adult respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and hemolysis which may cause hemolytic anemia are often how patients present.  Any patient with a cellulitis infection who develops additional signs of crepitus secondary to gas in the tissue and necrotic or dusky looking skin should be evaluated for gas gangrene.
