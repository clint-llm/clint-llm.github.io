The only FDA-approved usage for tranexamic acid (TXA) is for heavy menstrual bleeding and short-term prevention in patients with hemophilia.; this includes tooth extractions in patients with hemophilia as well as menorrhagia in these patients. Off-label uses of oral, topical, and intravenous TXA includes severely bleeding patients requiring massive transfusion protocols (MTP) or when hyper-fibrinolysis is demonstrated and combat trauma patients requiring at least one unit of blood within 24 hours of presentation. Another off-label intravenous use of TXA is in surgical operations to reduce blood loss. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, toxicity, and monitoring, of tranexamic acid so providers can direct patient therapy where it is indicated as part of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism by which tranexamic acid works to control bleeding in patients with hemophilia.
- Describe the approved and some of the many off-label indications for tranexamic acid.
- Summarize a patient factor that would indicate increased monitoring when dosing tranexamic acid.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to properly use tranexamic acid to improve patient outcomes when it is necessary for therapy.
