Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is characterized by diastolic dysfunction of a non-dilated ventricle. Multiple types of restrictive cardiomyopathies exist and vary in their pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, treatment, and prognosis. Three of the leading causes of RCM are cardiac amyloidosis, cardiac sarcoidosis, and cardiac hemochromatosis. This activity reviews restrictive cardiomyopathy with particular emphasis on these three major etiologies and outlines the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Define restrictive cardiomyopathy.
- Review the types of restrictive cardiomyopathies and their causes. 
- Review the management strategies for restrictive cardiomyopathies. 
- Describe how enhanced coordination of the interprofessional team can lead to more rapid detection of restrictive cardiomyopathy and subsequently allow for more prompt treatment when indicated.
