The first identification of Eastern equine encephalitis virus in humans dates from 1938 during an important outbreak affecting Massachusetts, U.S. As previously described, humans do not usually participate in the natural cycle but rather get affected sporadically in the geographic region along the Atlantic, and Gulf coasts of the U.S. The largest EEEV outbreak recorded is from 1959 in New Jersey, U.S., and involved 32 cases during 8 weeks. E.E.E. is now a nationally notifiable condition and is monitor through ArboNET, a national arboviral disease surveillance disease system since 2003.

As per ArboNET reports, non-human active areas are much greater than what human data suggests. Some researchers hypothesize this is likely due to the lack of necessary conditions for the EEBV to escape the enzootic cycle (non-human animal endemic) and then enter the epizootic cycle (non-human animal epidemic). It could also be related to surveillance and/or testing biases.
