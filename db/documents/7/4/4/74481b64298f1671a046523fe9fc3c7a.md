Cavernous angiomas also referred to as cavernous malformations (CMs), cavernous hemangiomas, or cavernomas are a type of intracranial vascular malformation with a developmental origin. The terms 'haemangioma' and 'cavernoma' are a misnomer as the lesions are nonneoplastic.

Vascular malformations involve invariably every organ of the body and are grouped into the following four types by their gross and histopathologic characteristics:

- Capillary malformations (or telangiectasias)

- Cavernous malformations (cavernous angiomas/hemangiomas)

- Venous malformations

- Arteriovenous shunting malformations

All the types mentioned above involve the brain with various manifestations.
