Risk factors associated with post-obstructive diuresis include the presence of other lower urinary tract symptoms, diabetes, history of multiple urethral catheterizations, prostatic hyperplasia, fecal impaction, and the use of anticholinergic medications.

The exact etiology is unclear, but it certainly involves several mechanisms such as the following:

- Progressive reduction in medullary concentrating ability due to vascular washout

- Down-regulation of the sodium transport mechanism in the thick, ascending loop of Henle

- Reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) leading to ischemia and damage to juxtamedullary nephrons

- Diminished response to antidiuretic hormone.

Causes of urinary obstruction include phimosis, prostatic hyperplasia, meatal stenosis, urinary stones, posterior urethral valves, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, blocked Foley catheters, urological malignancies such as prostate cancer, fecal impaction, diabetes, and neurogenic disorders such as spinal cord disorders and multiple sclerosis.

Patients with bilateral hydronephrosis on ultrasound or CT and bladder distension should be presumed to have urinary retention until proven otherwise.
