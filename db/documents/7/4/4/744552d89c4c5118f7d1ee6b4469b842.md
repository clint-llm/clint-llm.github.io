Accurate interpretation of the I-131 scan is essential to identify the correct clinical course of action.

**Physiological Uptake**

I-131 whole body scan counts on the fact that thyroid tissue has a high affinity to uptake and trap the Iodine, which is performed by NIS. Some extra-thyroidal tissues like stomach, salivary glands, breast (especially if lactating), and urinary tract also express NIS and show physiologic uptake. Similarly, as absorbed radioiodine is metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urinary tract, visualization of the liver, gall bladder, kidney, bladder, and ureters is common.

Ectopic thyroid tissue may be an embryological remnant or malformation during the development that can be captured with an I-131 scan. Common examples are lingual or sublingual thyroid, thyroglossal duct, or a mediastinal thyroid gland. Ectopic thyroid tissue in ovaries is called struma ovarii.

**Pathologic Uptake**

In a patient who has undergone thyroidectomy, any uptake apart from physiologic distribution on a post-therapy I-131 scan may be considered as a remnant (if localized in the thyroid bed after the first I-131 ablation/therapy) or metastasis (out of the thyroid bed). Post-therapy whole-body scan is very valuable and may change the plan of care with additional information.
