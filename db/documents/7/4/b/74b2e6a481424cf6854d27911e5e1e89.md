The workup of suspected TB cases begins with a chest radiograph. The workup should be initiated in any patients with more than three weeks of cough and additional symptoms such as fever, night sweats, hemoptysis, or weight loss. The workup should also be initiated in at-risk groups with prolonged unexplained illnesses. These at-risk groups include the following: HIV-positive patients, individuals with known recent exposure to a case of active tuberculosis, low socioeconomic status, chronic illnesses (such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, malignancy, or patient on immune suppressive), and IV drug users.

If imaging is suggestive of infection three sputum samples should be collected and sent for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) staining with one sample tested with nucleic acid amplification (NAAT). If both AFB culture and NAAT are positive, TB is likely and treatment should be initiated. Tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) should be added to the workup as they support the diagnosis, however, negative results don't exclude the infection.

**Radiological Findings**

Early in the disease, chest radiographs are usually normal. Hilar lymphadenopathy is a hallmark of radiological findings in tuberculosis. Other common findings include perihilar and right-sided infiltration and pleural effusion.
