All health care team members need to recognize that the presence of the grasp reflex can contribute to a patientâ€™s disability and decrease their level of independence. As such, members of the health care team should be ready to assist patients with various tasks involving the hand and dexterity that may be difficult.

As previously discussed, there have been proposals that an orthotic may play a useful role in helping patients with a grasp reflex.

Physiotherapy and occupational therapy can greatly improve this non-physiological reflex in adults, such as in people affected by stroke.
