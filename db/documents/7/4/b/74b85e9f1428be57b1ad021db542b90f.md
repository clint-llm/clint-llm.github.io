After completing a thorough history and physical examination, diagnostic nerve blocks serve as the next step in evaluating CN. Isu et al. outlined five diagnostic criteria for SCN entrapment: low back pain with involvement of the iliac crest and gluteal region, worsening pain with movement of the lumbar spine, tenderness over the posterior iliac crest at the location of nerve entrapment, reproduction of pain and/or numbness with compression at site of nerve entrapment, and symptom relief with a diagnostic block.

ICN entrapment can be evaluated per the Nantes criteria, with the understanding of the almost 25% coexistence of pudendal neuralgia with ICN entrapment to determine the likelihood of ICN involvement.

As with SCN, and MCN involvement, it is critical to ensure other etiologies for the patient's pain have been thoroughly evaluated and considered, as well as to consider SCN/MCN/ICN involvement in the patient's pain complaints to avoid treatment courses for causes better explained by SCN/MCN/ICN involvement.
