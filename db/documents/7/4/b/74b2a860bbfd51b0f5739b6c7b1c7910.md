Important differential diagnoses of cardiac masses are other more common findings as thrombus or vegetations. In these situations, the clinical scenario is vital to determine the origin of the cardiac mass.

The presence of intracardiac devices or prosthetic devices in the setting of infection increases the suspicion of vegetations.

Heart failure symptoms in patients with underlying malignancy can also be related to cardiotoxicity from chemotherapy, and this requires evaluation before determining possible metastasis or invasion of the primary tumor.

Infectious diseases can also produce intracardial and pericardial masses or effusion, and microbiological assessment is necessary.
