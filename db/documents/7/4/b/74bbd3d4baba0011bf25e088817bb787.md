Amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia is a rare disease. It can either be congenital due to genetic defects or acquired due to various diseases. In CAMT cases, parents must be educated about the importance of early diagnosis with invasive procedures like a bone marrow biopsy and the need for HSCT once the diagnosis is confirmed. In AAMT cases, patients must be educated about avoiding activities like skiing or gymnastics due to the high risk of intracranial bleeds. The treatment of AAMT is sometimes frustrating due to the failure of multiple immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory agents, and patients may ultimately land up needing supportive platelet transfusions more than once a week.
