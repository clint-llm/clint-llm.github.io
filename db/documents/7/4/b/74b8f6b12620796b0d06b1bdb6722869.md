Patients with this condition should be admitted and managed based on their clinical presentation. If the patient is managed non-operatively, they should be monitored with serial abdominal exams, trending labs (WBC, lactic acid, acute phase reactants), and repeat imaging to rule out the need for operative management. Patients with stercoral colitis and concomitant perforation should have emergent surgery to remove the affected colon. These patients have a very high risk of mortality and should be monitored postoperatively in the intensive monitoring unit.
