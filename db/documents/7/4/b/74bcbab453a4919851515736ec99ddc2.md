Regardless of the specific sarcoma and therapy goals, the patient will need regular follow-up appointments, including physical exams and blood testing, to check for any signs of cancer recurrence. Radiological exams may also be part of the follow-up, depending on the type of sarcoma and location. Follow-ups will typically initially be every few months, then less frequently as the risk of recurrence diminishes over time. In general, high-risk sarcomas are expected to recur in the first two or three years following treatment, with sarcomas relapsing later but with lower odds. The exact follow-up routine will depend on tumor grade, size, and site.
