Hypodontia of any severity may be detected early in life. They may be discovered when deciduous dentition begins to erupt and a tooth is missing. However, many are discovered later in life as the permanent dentition develops and the tooth fails to erupt. Beyond the clinical examination, a panoramic radiograph is a key diagnostic tool in determining a missing tooth or teeth.

It is rare for patients to present with multiple supernumerary teeth without an underlying syndrome or developmental condition. With a single supernumerary tooth being such a relatively common dental anomaly, a further workup for the patient is not warranted. These teeth are typically found either in the anterior maxilla, mandibular premolar, or third molar regions.
