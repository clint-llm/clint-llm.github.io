Symptomatic relief and avoidance of secondary infection are the mainstays of therapy for herpetic whitlow. The natural course of the infection in an immunocompetent patient is a spontaneous resolution of symptoms in 2 to 4 weeks.

While there are few studies specific to herpetic whitlow, antivirals have been shown to shorten the duration of symptoms by up to 4 days in one study and decreased days of positive viral culture. Data is especially favorable if the antiviral is started within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms.
