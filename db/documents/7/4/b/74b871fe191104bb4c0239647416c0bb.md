Adrenal insufficiency is the most common cause of debilitation and mortality in patients with Allgrove syndrome. Appropriate education and advice are necessary regarding effective dosing and compliance with glucocorticoids. Medical bracelets or necklaces stating "adrenal insufficiency" should be worn all the time. The clinical team should provide parental education about the injectable steroids in case of emergency or unavailability of medical personnel.

Counseling regarding compliance with topical ocular lubricants and consistent follow-up with ophthalmology should be stressed to avoid future opportunistic infections and dehydration-induced corneal ulcers. Patients and their families should also receive a brochure detailing risk factors of gastroesophageal reflux disease in case of isolated achalasia. In the case of recurrent vomiting, cough, eating difficulties, physician follow-up is recommended.
