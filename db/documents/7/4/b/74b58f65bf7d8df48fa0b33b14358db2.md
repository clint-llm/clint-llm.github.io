The toxicokinetics varies significantly depending on if warfarin itself was ingested compared to specific superwarfarin agents ingested.

Warfarin toxicity secondary to a chronic overdose presents in a stable state with similar underlying pathophysiology to warfarin dosing.  Unfortunately, the toxicokinetics of an acute overdose has not been well described in the literature.  Typical warfarin use has a T ½ of 36-42 h, with time to peak effect of 36-72 h, and 2-5 days duration following cessation of the drug.  Acute overdose of warfarin has been noted to have a potential delay of PT/INR elevation for 12 hours following ingestion with coagulopathy seen up to 9 days post ingestion.

One difficult aspect of the toxicokinetics is the correlation to clinical signs and complications.  Despite being able to follow the INR as a marker of coagulopathy, complications from warfarin use do not routinely occur at one set level.  One study of acute overdoses with multiple patients having an INR >10 found only one major bleeding event, no thrombotic events, and no fatal events.

Another difficult aspect in considering the toxicokinetics is the potential for rebound toxicity. There have been case reports of patients being treated for acute warfarin toxicity with Vitamin K with normalization of INR, that present to hospital for readmission >3 days after discharge with bleeding events and a supratherapeutic INR.

Since warfarin is metabolized in the liver by the Cytochrome C-450 system, patients with renal insufficiency are not considered to be at a higher risk of toxicity than the standard population. However, it has been reported that patient with renal insufficiency has required lower doses than the standard population to achieve therapeutic INRs.

In contrast to patients with renal insufficiency or failure, patients with potential hepatic dysfunction can have an unpredictable clinical course.  While warfarin has a T ½ of 36 – 42 h, these numbers can be greatly affected by liver disease or alcohol use.  Studies have shown that while acute alcohol use may decrease the metabolism of warfarin, chronic alcohol use may cause an increase in the metabolism. Patients with some degree of hepatic dysfunction will have varying rates of warfarin metabolism as well as responses to Vitamin K administration. At this time, there are no set guidelines to predict the metabolism rates or Vitamin K responses in these patients.
