Research has yet to identify a precise pathophysiologic mechanism. There are, however, several theories postulated on the pathophysiology of PFEs. One oft-mentioned hypothesis is that these lesions are an acquired entity and that they begin as microthrombi. These microthrombiÂ join at sites of minor endothelial damage on valvular surfaces. Over time, these microthrombi evolve into excrescences and, eventually, PFEs.
