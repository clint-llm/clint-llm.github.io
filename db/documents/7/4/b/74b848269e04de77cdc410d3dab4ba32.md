BCC is rarely associated with a fatal outcome. Its prognosis is mainly related to its potential risk of recurrence after initial therapy. The risk of recurrence depends on BCC location and BCC clinical and histopathological features.

**BCC Location**

- Low-risk location: trunk and limbs

- Intermediate risk location: forehead, cheeks, chin, neck, scalp

- High-risk location: centrofacial areas, nose, ears, periorificial areas, embryonic fusion planes

**BCC Clinical and Histopathological Features**

- These include the size, the histopathological type, and the fact that the tumor is primary or recurrent.

**Tumor Prognosis**

- Good prognosis: primary superficial BCC, primary nodular BCC <1cm in intermediate-risk location or <2cm in low-risk location;

- Intermediate prognosis: recurrent superficial BCC, nodular BCC <1cm in high risk location or <2cm in intermediate-risk location or >2cm in low risk location;

- Poor prognosis: nodular BCC >1cm in high-risk location (high risk of recurrence), morpheaform, infiltrative or histologically aggressive (very high risk of recurrence), recurrent tumor, except superficial BCC (very high risk of recurrence)
