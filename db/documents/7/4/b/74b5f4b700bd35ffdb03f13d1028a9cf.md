Grossly, aneurysmal bone cysts are composed of blood and hemosiderin-filled cystic cavities, enclosed in a subperiosteal shell of reactive bone. The cavities contain septa of trabeculated bone or osteoid tissue, without endothelium. The stroma is comprised of fibroblasts, spindle cells, osteoid, and multinucleated giant cells.
