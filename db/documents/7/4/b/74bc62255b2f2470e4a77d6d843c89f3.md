Since there is no exact definition of ACO, it is difficult to estimate the epidemiology of the disease. However, some estimates from self-reported physician diagnoses and a combination of PFTs and clinical presentations showed that the prevalence is 2 to 3%.

To determine the exact epidemiology of the disease, we need first to establish a clear definition. In a population with asthma or COPD alone, it is estimated that up to a third have ACO (10 to 30% and 25%, respectively).

Studies also showed a higher incidence of ACO among those with lower education and socioeconomic status than those with COPD alone.
