Most cholesterol synthesis occurs at night, reflecting the fasting state. Thus, prompting the statins to be administered at evening or bedtime.

Ezetimibe may be taken with meals and can be safely administered along with a statin or a fibrate. It may be taken at the same time as fenofibrate or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, but the recommendation is to take it at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after taking bile acid sequestrants.

Fibrates dosing is usually 30 minutes before meals.

Nicotinic acid is given orally with a meal and usually started at 100 mg three times a day and gradually increased as tolerated to 2.0g/dL.

Bile acid sequestrants are available as granules or tablets. Cholestyramine should ideally be taken with breakfast when given to treat pruritus associated with cholestasis. Symptoms of pruritus are less frequent in the morning as the belief is that the pruritogenic factors concentrate in the gallbladder during overnight fasting.

PCSK9 inhibitors are administered by subcutaneous injections, with enzyme inactivation occurring within four to eight hours. Cost is the primary limiting factor for PCSK9 inhibitors.
