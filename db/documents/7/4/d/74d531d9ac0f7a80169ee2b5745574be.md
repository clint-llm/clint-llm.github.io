The diagnosis of postpartum thyroiditis depends on clinical presentation and thyroid function tests (level of TSH and free T4). Patients with postpartum thyroiditis have similar biochemical findings that can be detected in the patients with painless thyroiditis: high or upper limit of normal serum free T4 and T3 levels and low serum TSH level in the hyperthyroid phase, which could be subclinical or overt. In patients with hyperthyroid state followed by hypothyroid state, serum T4 level could be low for days to weeks before serum TSH level rises beyond the normal range, as a result of prolonged suppressed TSH which had occurred in the hyperthyroid state. Serum levels of anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody are high in 60 to 85 percent of patients with postpartum thyroiditis and are highest in the hypothyroid state or soon thereafter. Some of the patients may have a slight increase in C-reactive protein and/or erythrocyte sedimentation rate.
