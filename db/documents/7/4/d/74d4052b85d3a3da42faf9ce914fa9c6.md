Though found throughout the world, most Vibrionaceae are found in warmer marine environments. The summer months have higher incidence rates of disease, and areas with subtropical monsoon-type climates are particularly prone to the proliferation of Vibrionaceae. The countries with the most documented cases of V. vulnificus are the United States, South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Mexico.Â  Disease in the southern hemisphere is minimal compared to the northern hemisphere and is thought to be related to the paucity of monsoon climates in that hemisphere. One study found the prevalence of V. vulnificus in shellfish in Mexican coastal seafood markets to be 32%.

Host factors are a major determinant of who develops sepsis from the initial infection. Patients with chronic hepatic disease (hepatitis, cirrhosis, hemochromatosis), diabetes, malignancies, renal disease, HIV, or other immunocompromise represent 80% to 90% of all patients presenting with primary sepsis.

Males are infected more frequently than females, and patients aged greater than forty are at increased risk. This age and sex disparity may link to the higher prevalence of liver disease in older males.

The effect of global warming has been correlated with the increasing prevalence and virulence of the organism. This is thought to be related to rising sea temperatures and melting of polar ice caps causing increasing salinity of the water.
