Although not completely understood, as the embryo grows between the amnion and the chorion, the amnion eventually obliterates the extracoelomic space, the incomplete obliteration of the extracoelomic space may render the amnion fragile and susceptible to rupture. The ruptured amnion could attachÂ itself to body parts, leading to clinical features of amniotic band syndrome. Theories of defective germ plasma and vascular disruption have been proposed to explain the pathophysiology, especially in cases involving internal organs.
