The most common complication is a patient complaining of pain during any subsequent procedure. This can either represent an incomplete block, the patient feeling the sensation of touch, or typically not enough time being left for the block to take full effect (which is typically 10 to 15 minutes). Pain during injection can be reduced by slowing the rate of injection of local anesthetic.

Bleeding and hematomas are common, and most can be controlled with pressure and dressings.

Local anesthetic with adrenaline/epinephrine should never be used as this has been associated with tissue damage and ischemia.
