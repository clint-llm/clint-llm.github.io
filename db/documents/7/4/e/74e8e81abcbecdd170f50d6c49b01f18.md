The incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus is increasing in most western nations, and most believe this is due to Barrett's esophagus. The progression of the lesion to cancer is slow, but once cancer occurs, the prognosis is very poor. Over the years, multiple societies have developed guidelines for screening, surveillance, and management of Barrett's esophagus.

**Outcomes**

There are many case series reporting on Barrett's outcomes, which are good to excellent. However, there are veryÂ few studies on long-term outcomes. Even though there are several types of treatments for Barrett and GERD, there is no solid evidence to indicate which one is the best or most effective. With the ability to deliver laser and radio-frequency wave therapy via the endoscope, more long-term studies are needed to determine not only the safety of these procedures but also their effectiveness in preventing the progression of Barrett's esophagus to a malignancy.
