On gross inspection, these lesions are characteristically chocolate brown, soft, spongy, and fragile.

Histologically, the lesions are cellular. Although the multinucleated giant cell is the characteristic cell type, these lesions have a background network of mononuclear stromal cells.

Three types of cells are found in benign bone GCT:

- Type I cells look like interstitial fibroblasts, make collagen, and can proliferate. This cell is probably the tumor component of GCT. Type I cells share features of mesenchymal stem cells. They have characteristics that suggest they could represent an early differentiation into osteoblasts.

- Type II cells are also interstitial but resemble the monocyte/macrophage family and could be recruited from the peripheral bloodstream.

- Type III cells are the multinucleated giant cells. They share many characteristics of osteoclasts and have similar morphologies.

Significant level activity for insulin-like growth factors I and II are found in type II and type III cells but absent in type I cells, which suggests that these factors are essential in the development and regulation of GCT.

Genetically, 80% of individuals with GCT of the bone exhibit the cytogenetic abnormality of telomeric associations (tas), whereas half of the cells in the tumor show the tas abnormality.
