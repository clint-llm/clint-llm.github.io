**Limbal Transition Zone/Stem Cell Theory**

The nasal limbus in the eye receives the highest intensity of UV B rays. The nasal limbus has epithelial crypts and contains limbal stem cells in the basal epithelial layer. These are labeled as precursor cells for OSSN. OSSN initially arises from basal epithelial cells and then spreads towards the ocular surface and later invades the basement membrane.

UV radiations cause DNA damage. This results in the formation of pyrimidine dimers in the DNA base chain. There is a transformation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in OSSN. The UV B radiations have been implicated in the reactivation of the Â HPV virus and also cause systemic and local immunosuppression. It has been reported that E7 proteins of the HPV genome cause proliferation of infected epithelial cells with the assistance of the retinoblastoma gene, and at the same time, E6 proteins restrict the p53 gene in causing cell cycle arrest of infected and damaged cells.

Additionally, the immunosuppression induced by HIV, xerophthalmia, and UV B radiations impairs immune surveillance of tumors, thus promoting the survival of aberrant cells. The increase in tumors size and metastasis is promoted by telomerase reactivation. The activation of vascular endothelial growth factors and matrix metalloproteinases also destroy the cellular matrix. The mechanism by which HPV reaches conjunctiva still needs to be elucidated.
