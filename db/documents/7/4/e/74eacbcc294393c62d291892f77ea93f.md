Patients with aniridia will, almost of necessity, undergo ocular surgical procedures to restore or improve vision. Of these, some may develop postsurgical fibrotic membranes, which can cause intraocular damage and decreased visual acuity. Patients with aniridia should be counseled to maintain frequent and regular follow up with their ophthalmologist.
