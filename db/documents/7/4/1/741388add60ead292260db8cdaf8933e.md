Penicillin was the first antibiotic ever introduced during World War II by Alexander Fleming in 1928. Penicillin does not cover Staph or Enterococcus but used mainly streptococcal infections. The penicillinase-resistant organisms (nafcillin, oxacillin, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin) cover Staph (MSSA) and Strep. Anti-pseudomonal penicillins include piperacillin and ticarcillin effective against gram-positive, gram-negative, pseudomonas, and anaerobes. Carbapenems cover gram-positives, gram negatives, and anaerobes.

Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, clindamycin, and doxycycline are oral antibiotics used for mild to moderate MRSA infections. It is important to note that trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole increases warfarin levels leading to increased INR. Vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline cover moderate to severe community and hospital-acquired MRSA. Vancomycin requires renal dosing with trough levels between 15 to 20. Linezolid is an option if a patient is allergic to vancomycin. CBC needs to be checked weekly to avoid bone marrow suppression, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline are options to treat vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
