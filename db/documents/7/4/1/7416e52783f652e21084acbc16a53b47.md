Cutaneous endometriosis is best managed by an interprofessional team approach. The team may include a primary care clinician, a dermatologist, a gynecologist, a pathologist, and a pharmacist. The presentation of cutaneous endometriosis can be confusing. The patient may first present to aÂ clinician who may be unaware of the cyclical nature of the disease presentation. Once the proper diagnosis is made, treatment can be started. Even after treatment, patients need regular follow up to look for recurrences.
