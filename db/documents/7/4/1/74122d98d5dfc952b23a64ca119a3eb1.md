The upper limb bud starts forming 26 days after fertilization and is regulated by the secretion of Shh by the notochord.

The lateral plate mesoderm of the bud forms the components of the joint (bone, cartilage, tendon). The mesenchyme then condenses into a blastema in the limb bud core, and these cells differentiate into chondrocytes and osteoblasts. At 36 days, the chondrification of the upper limb starts proximally. At sites of future joints, chondrification becomes repressed. Research has found that these interzones to express proteins WNT1, WNT14, and GDF5. The proximal radioulnar joint interzone and annular ligament form 51 days after fertilization.
