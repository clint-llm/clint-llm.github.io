The underlying cause of marasmus is insufficient total calorie intake.

**Precipitating Factors in Children**

The underlying social cause of marasmus in children is poverty.

Maternal education is another key factor in the likelihood of childhood malnutrition occurring. Nairobi mothers with a primary level of education have been shown to have a 94% lower chance of growth stunting compared to mothers with no education.

Biological causes of malnutrition in children include HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases, as mentioned earlier.

Malaria is associated with poor growth and stunting in children below the age of 2 years but is not associated with protein-energy deficiency.

**Precipitating Factors in Adults**

Marasmus typically affects children; however, there are circumstances in which adults may also be affected.

There is a pattern of reduced intake of food with age, typically declining by 30% in males and 20% in females, otherwise known as physiological anorexia of aging.

Malabsorption may occur in adults. Typical causes of malabsorption in adults include coeliac disease and pancreatic insufficiency.
