**Tolerance/Dependence**

Exogenous opioids continue to be the most potent and effective class of agents for the acute treatment of trauma and surgery-related pain as well as for moderate to severe cancer pain. Tolerance and dependence/addiction are significant issues complicating the long-term medical use of opioid compounds. Tolerance isÂ a phenomenon where increased doses are needed to produce the same physical effects. This opioid-related effect is a long-observed clinical entity. Further, it has been noted that the development of tolerance to specific effects of opioid administration occurs at different rates. For example, it has been observed that tolerance to respiratory depression, sedation, and nausea typically occurs more rapidly, whereas constipation and miosis are not subject to tolerance. Proposed mechanisms of opioid tolerance include opioid receptor-G protein uncoupling, decreased receptor internalization/recycling, and increased sensitivity of the NMDA receptor involved in the transmission of nociceptive signals.

The use of opioids in the long-term management of chronic non-malignant pain has come into question due to epidemic levels of addiction, overdoses, and mortality associated with their use. The process of opioid addiction appears to be driven by a 3 stage cycle beginning with initial intoxication, abstinence which results in dysphoria and hyperalgesia, followed by a strong compulsion to seek opioid drugs to relieve the negative symptoms of withdrawal.
