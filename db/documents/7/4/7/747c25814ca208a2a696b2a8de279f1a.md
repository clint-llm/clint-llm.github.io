Due to its hepatoxic effects, patients taking oral ketoconazole should have their hepatic function monitored, which is through hepatic function tests such as aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin, albumin, and prothrombin time (PT).

Hepatic function tests should take place at baseline, frequently during ketoconazole therapy, and after therapy has ceased. Period calcium and phosphorous levels are recommended for patients on long-term therapy with ketoconazole. The adrenal function also requires monitoring during treatment with ketoconazole. This monitoring is possible by measuring blood levels of sodium, potassium, cortisol, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).
