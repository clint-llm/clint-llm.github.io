The spinal cord, along with the rest of the CNS, develops from the neural plate which forms during the third and fourth weeks of intrauterine life.

Between post ovulation days 27 and 54, the caudal end of the neural tube experiences retrogressive differentiation causing it to become thinner, less well developed, and eventually it contains only a rudimentary mantle zone and no marginal zone. The caudal neural tube thinning makes it appear that the end of the conus, relative to the adjacent vertebral column is gradually ascending.

Beyond post ovulation day 54, retrogressive differentiation ends, and the further ascent of the conus is caused exclusively by a disparity in growth of the vertebral column compared to the spinal cord. Therefore the conus medullaris inhabits a position that is opposite to the progressively higher vertebral levels and nerve roots exiting a specific spinal cord level thus have to travel farther caudal in the thecal sac; towards their eventual exit foramina.

Eventually, the conus medullaris occupies its “adult level,” by birth or within 2 months after birth. This location is most commonly cranial to or opposite the L1–L2 disk space.
