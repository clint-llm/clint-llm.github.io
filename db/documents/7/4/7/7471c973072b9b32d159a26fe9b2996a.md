The treatment of trigeminal neuralgia is challenging in the field of neurology and neurosurgery.

Lamotrigine (200 to 400 mg/day), pregabalin (150 to 600 mg/day), gabapentin (1800 to 4200 mg/day), or topiramate (100 to 400 mg/day) may be considered. If the combination therapy fails, a switch to baclofen (40 to 80 mg/day) may be considered.

Intravenous infusion of a combination of magnesium and lidocaine can be very effective in some patients. Botulinum toxin type A injections may be offered before surgery or to those unwilling to undergo surgery and in cases where drug treatments failed. Tetracaine nerve block may be used as an additional treatment after carbamazepine, as can acupuncture and/or peripheral nerve stimulation.

For patients with refractory pain, various surgical procedures are available, including MVD, percutaneous radiofrequency rhizotomy, percutaneous glycerol rhizotomy, percutaneous balloon compression, and stereotactic radiosurgery.
