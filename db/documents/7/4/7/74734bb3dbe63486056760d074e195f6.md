In general, biochemical testing is indicated when two of the four main symptoms are present in an individual. The four main clinical features that help clinicians diagnose CTX are infantile-onset diarrhea, childhood-onset cataract, adolescent to young adult-onset tendon xanthomas, and adult-onset progressive neurologic function.

As CTX presentation varies significantly, neuroimaging and genetic testing are necessary to confirm the clinical suspicion. Molecular genetic testing is also used to evaluate for mutations of the CYP27A1 gene. Diagnostic imaging provides supplementary clinical information. Computed tomographic scan of the head and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may show bilateral focal cerebellar lesions or diffuse brain and cerebellar atrophy. Typical brain MRI findings of a patient with CTX may include white matter signal abnormalities, such as bilateral hyperintensity of the dentate nuclei and cerebral and cerebellar white matter.

Mignarri et al. created a suspicion index for early diagnosis of CTX. This diagnostic tool accurately identifies patients with CTX significantly earlier than previous studies; the investigators achieved a diagnostic age in their study of only 10.6 ± 9.8 years, which compares favorably to the previous average age at diagnosis of 35 years.
