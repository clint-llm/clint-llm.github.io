Healthcare workers, including nurse practitioners and clinicians, should not empirically encourage patients to take niacin. It is only recommended if there is a deficiency. For hyperlipidemia management, the vitamin often causes intolerable side effects, and its use is declining. The majority of the public should be encouraged to eat fresh fruit and vegetable to obtain their niacin. Reliance on supplements is not recommended because of fake and counterfeit products.

The clinician initiates the therapy with niacin for pellagra or dyslipidemia. Here, excellent communication between clinician, nurse, pharmacist, and dietician is necessary. For dyslipidemia leading to coronary artery disease, a referral to a cardiologist may be necessary. Pharmacists will verify the dosing based on the condition and counsel the patients regarding the adverse drug reactions. For example, It is sometimes recommended to take a baby aspirin before dosing niacin to help prevent flushing. The nurse should counsel the patient on what to expect with niacin therapy and monitor compliance and treatment effectiveness. The clinical dietician can design a patient-centered diet plan to improve dyslipidemia and pellagra. Thus, with an interprofessional collaborative team approach, niacin therapy can deliver optimal therapeutic results with minimal adverse effects to the patient.
