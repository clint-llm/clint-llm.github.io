A germline mutation of FLCN, which encodes the tumor-suppressor folliculin, is responsible and is located on chromosome 17p11.2. Multiple distinct mutations have been identified. Folliculin is thought to be a tumor suppressor, but its exact function is unknown. FLCN has been linked to the mTOR pathway.
