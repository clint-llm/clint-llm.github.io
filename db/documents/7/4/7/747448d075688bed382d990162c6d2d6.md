Although uncommon, an epidural abscess is a potentially devastating infection, and its neurologic complications are life-changing. The positive is that prompt diagnosis and treatment can often prevent or reverse all this.

Once diagnosed with an SEA, clinicians should treat patients with the same urgency accorded to the most critical patients. Occasionally, even with recognition and intervention, the affected patient can still suffer devastating neurological complications. The feared neurological complications of the SEA could arise from either pressure causing compression of the spinal cord or septic thrombophlebitis causing ischemic necrosis. The former mechanism is probably more common, but vascular compromise is likely responsible for the sudden deterioration of otherwise stable patients.

Physicians rarely use antibiotics alone because some patients will suffer neurologic deficit progression despite antibiotics. Complications can ensue abruptly and unpredictably, without warning. The resultant paresis or paralysis may not be reversible even if surgery is performed urgently.
