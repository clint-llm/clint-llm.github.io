Hypovolemic shock in the trauma setting occurs mainly due to the massive hemorrhage. The following hemodynamic responses are predicted. Cardiac index, venous capacitance, central vein pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure would decrease, and the systemic vascular resistance increases. The following characteristics are predictable in the distributive shock; 1. flash capillary refill in less than one second, 2. presence of bounding pulses, 3. warm and dry extremities on the physical examination, 4. widening of the pulse pressure, which would be greater than 40 mmHg.
