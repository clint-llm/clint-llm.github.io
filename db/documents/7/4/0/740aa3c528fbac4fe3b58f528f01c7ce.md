In 1947, James Hamilton of Yale University published an article on male hormone stimulation as a prerequisite to common baldness after examining 104 men with testicular insufficiency. In 1974, Julianne Imperato-McGinley, of Cornell University published reports on Caribbean children with a mutation leading to deficiencies in 5-alpha-reductase and dihydrotestosterone. When these male children matured, they had smaller prostate sizes and a lack of male pattern baldness. These observations and findings ultimately led to the development of finasteride.

Finasteride is an FDA-approved pharmacologic agent for treating benign prostate hyperplasia and androgenic alopecia (male pattern hair loss) in men. Finasteride was first used in 1992 to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia at a dose of 5 mg. In 1997, it received approval to treat male pattern hair loss at a dose of 1 mg. Finasteride has also been used to treat signs of hyperandrogenism, such as hirsutism, and may find use in transgender women in combination with estrogen for its anti-androgen properties. However, Finasteride use is not recommended for use in women who may become pregnant or are pregnant.
