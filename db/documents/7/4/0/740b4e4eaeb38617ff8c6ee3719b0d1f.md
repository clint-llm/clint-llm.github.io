Bimalleolar fractures are a type of ankle fracture that involve both the lateral and medial malleoli at the distal ends of the fibula and tibia, respectively. These two bones articulate with the talus to form the ankle or tibiotalar joint. The bimalleolar fracture accounts for 60% of all ankle fractures, with an incidence of 187 fractures per 100,000 people. This fracture is a bimodal distribution, most likely to affect older women and young males and those over 60 years old. Surgery is the primary treatment of bimalleolar fracture because it is an unstable fracture. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of bimalleolar fractures and studies the interprofessional team's role in evaluating and treating patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of bimalleolar fractures.
- Review the appropriate process for the evaluation of bimalleolar fractures.
- Summarize the management options available for bimalleolar fractures.
- Outline some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance bimalleolar fractures and improve outcomes.
