Hypoglycemia and weight gain are the most frequently encountered side effects of glyburide. Although glyburide is one of the most popular sulfonylureas prescribed, a systematic review conducted by the ADA supports evidence that glyburide correlates with a significantly higher risk of hypoglycemic episodes than other insulin secretagogues sulfonylureas by 80% and 44%, respectively.

Due to the risk of severe prolonged hypoglycemia with long-acting sulfonylureas (and subsequent risk for falls), glyburide is listed on the 2019 American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria as a potentially inappropriate medication in older adults (i.e., those aged 65 years and older).

Possible weight gain can also be a distressing side effect for patients taking glyburide, as with all sulfonylureas. Although the ADAâ€™s systematic review states that weight gain was not a major outcome for glyburide compared with other insulin secretagogues if weight gain occurs, co-administration with metformin is a weight-neutral biguanide agent, can aid with the issue.

A cohort study on patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 compared all-cause and cardiovascular mortality for patients on either glyburide or metformin for blood glucose management.

Adverse effects that are less likely to occur with glyburide and other sulfonylureas include skin rashes, nausea, and sensitivity to light on rare occasions.
