Cardiorenal syndrome includes multiple subtypes based on underlying pathology and chronicity. Each subtype involves unique pathophysiology, and thus, the management strategy for each subtype is different management strategies. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of the five subtypes of cardiorenal syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiologies of cardiorenal syndrome.
- Describe the expected history and physical findings in a patient with each subtype of cardiorenal syndrome.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for patients with each subtype of cardiorenal syndrome.
- Explain the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of cardiorenal syndrome and improve patient outcomes.
