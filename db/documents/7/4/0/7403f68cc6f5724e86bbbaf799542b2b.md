Ocular astigmatism accounts for 13% of the total refractive errors encountered in patients.

The cause of astigmatism is still not known; several etiologies, including genetics, the pressure of eyelids over the globe, tension due to extraocular muscles, and visual feedback mechanisms, have been attributed.

Initially, the estimation of corneal astigmatism was based on the measurement of anterior corneal curvature by keratometry and videokeratography. The calculation of the refractive power was based on empirical estimation of the posterior corneal surface.

Modern-day cataract surgery has emerged as a refractive procedure that aims to eliminate spherical and cylindrical power and achieve spectacle independence.

The various methods of correcting corneal astigmatism during cataract surgery include toric intraocular lenses (IOL), the placement of the clear corneal phacoemulsification incision on the steeper corneal axis, paired opposite clear corneal incisions over the steeper meridian, and limbal relaxing incisions over the steeper meridians.

Toric IOLs are considered the most predictable way of correcting corneal astigmatism.
