Kyrle disease typically occurs during adulthood between the age of 30 and 50 years. There is a higher incidence in females with a female-to-male ratio of up to 6:1.

Kyrle disease is most commonly associated with chronic renal disease and diabetes mellitus, particularly in those with associated diabetic nephropathy. It is estimated that 10% of hemodialysis patients will eventually develop Kyrle disease.
