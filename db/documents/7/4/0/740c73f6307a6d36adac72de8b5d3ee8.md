The results of the PFTs might not be accurate if there is a lack of cooperation or poor understanding of instructions from the patient. Also, if the patient has an acute illness or symptom (for example, altered mental status, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal or chest pain, or cough) are likely to have suboptimal results.
