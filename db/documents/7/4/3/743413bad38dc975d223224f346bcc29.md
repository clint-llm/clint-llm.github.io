Various imaging modalities have been used to evaluate for the presence of a branchial cleft cyst. Three commonly used techniques are ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scanning, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Larger cystic lesions can be seen with ultrasound. A CT with contrast will also show a cystic appearing, well circumscribed, enhancing lesion. CT imaging can also assist with identification of structures both deep and superficial to the lesion to better categorize the type of branchial cleft cyst. MRI with gadolinium may show a (KA21) branchial cleft with wall enhancement. MRI is typically better for evaluation of type II first branchial cleft cyst because it provides for better evaluation of the parotid gland and involvement of surrounding neural structures.
