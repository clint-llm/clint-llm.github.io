The three most common etiologies of hyperthyroidism include:

- Graves disease (GD)

- Toxic multinodular goiter (TMNG)

- Toxic adenoma (TA)

Other less common etiologies of hyperthyroidism:

- Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism

- TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone)-secreting pituitary adenomas

- Conditions associated with high human chorionic gonadotrophin levels: choriocarcinomas and hydatiform moles in females and germ cell tumors in males

- Ectopic thyroid in struma ovarii (excess thyroid hormone production from ovarian teratomas)

- Extensive metastasis from functional differentiated thyroid carcinoma (follicular or papillary)

- Drug-induced thyroiditis: amiodarone, lithium, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, interferon-alpha, immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy

- Other thyroiditis: Hashitoxicosis, painless thyroiditis, painful subacute thyroiditis, suppurative thyroiditis, and Riedel thyroiditis

- Factitious thyroiditis (due to excess exogenous thyroid hormone: intentional or unintentional use)

Graves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in the United States and most western countries.

Factitious thyroiditis is thyrotoxicosis associated with inappropriate or excessive use of pharmaceutical thyroid hormone.
