Pathogenesis of PRP remains unclear though several prominent hypotheses exist including dysfunction in keratinization or vitamin A metabolism, autoimmune mechanism, abnormal immunologic triggers, such as infection or ultraviolet (UV) exposure given evidence of does photo triggered and/or photoactivated cases or trauma.

Genetics seem to play a role in the development of at least some cases of PRP, most prominently noted in the type-V PRP variant. A clear association with a gain-of-function mutation in the CARD14, also known as the psoriasis susceptibility (PSOR2), a gene that encodes for the member 14 protein which is an activator of NF-kappa beta. Incidentally, similar mutations have been noted in patients with sporadic PRP.  Further research is needed.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been associated with the development of type-VI PRP.
