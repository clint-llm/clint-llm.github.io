The right ventricle (RV), LV, right atrium (RA), and left atrium (LA), in the decreasing order of frequency, are the cardiac chambers involved. In the most common cause of the LV rupture (AMI), hemodynamic factors such as increased intracavitary pressure and structural weakness of the myocardium as demonstrated by the necrosis of myocytes, collagen matrix resolution and intense inflammation play important roles in leading to the rupture. It is most commonly observed within 3 to 5 days post-AMI. In the LV, rupture most commonly occurs in the anterior or the lateral wall at the mid-papillary level. Patients can rarely experience ventricular septal and papillary muscle rupture along with the LV free wall rupture. Other consequences are ventricular septal defect (VSD), acute mitral regurgitation (MR), pericardial tamponade, and formation of a pseudoaneurysm. The rupture is sealed by the epicardium or by a hematoma on the surface of the heart of certain patients who survive LV free wall rupture post-AMI. This is identified as LV diverticulum and indicates a subacute pathological state involving free rupture through the pericardial cavity and pseudoaneurysm development.

AMI is the most common cause of LV pseudoaneurysm development. It can also develop following surgical operations, in particular following the mitral valve replacement. As a consequence of cardiac compression between the sternum and the spine, direct impact on the heart (sternal trauma), or deceleration in the setting of an automobile collision, myocardial rupture can occur. This may cause a rupture of the free-wall, interventricular septum, and the papillary muscles. The myocardial injury occurs more often as a consequence of stabbing or gunshot wounds. In the setting of blunt trauma, the ventricular free-wall rupture will result in either pericardial tamponade (when the pericardial wound is obliterated) or intrathoracic hemorrhage which is common in stab wounds and gunshot wounds respectively.Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis.
