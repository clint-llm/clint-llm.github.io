The tendon is a "mechanical bridge." It allows the transmission of muscle strength to the bones and joints. On the other hand, it enables the contraction of the muscle to make the final tangible movement. Different types of tendons reflect the morphology of the muscle and their specific function. Tendon tissue is not just about the terminal or initial area of each muscle but involves the entire muscular tissue. The connective layers (epimysium, perimysium, and endomysium) merge into a single organization to contact one or more fixed osseous points. The same tendon near the muscle has contractile fibers. The muscle affects the tendon, and the tendon affects the functional expression of the muscle.

Within the context ofÂ manual therapy, rehabilitation, or surgery, it is a mistake not to consider these close relationships between anatomy and function. Depending on the systemic hormonal environment and age, the tendon tissue can adapt its cellular structure under physiological (training) or pathological (traumatic) stimuli.
