The Weber test has been mainly used to establish a diagnosis in patients with unilateral hearing loss to distinguish between conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. It is a useful, quick, and simple screening test for evaluating hearing loss. The test can detect unilateral conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. The outer and middle ear mediate conductive hearing. The inner ear mediates sensorineural hearing. The Weber test is often combined with the Rinne test to detect the location and nature of the hearing loss. This activity describes the technique of the Weber test and its clinical relevance and highlights the interprofessional team's role in the management of patients with deafness.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the technique for conducting the Weber test.
- Review the indications for the Weber test.
- Summarize the clinical relevance of the Weber test.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by deafness.
