There is a long list of differentials for patients presenting with an initial or subsequent episode of alveolar hemorrhage; those include infectious etiologies, rheumatic disease, drug-induced injury, thromboembolic disease, bleeding disorders, and neoplasms.

Alveolar hemorrhage that occurs in the setting of infections typically presents as an acute respiratory distress syndrome. Infections associated with hemorrhage include bacterial pneumonia such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Legionella. Viral types of pneumonia associated with pulmonary hemorrhage have also been documented, specifically with influenza A. Pulmonary hemorrhage has also been seen with fungal infections likeÂ Pneumocystis jirovecii.

Rheumatic disease associated with alveolar hemorrhage includes disease processes such as systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, Goodpasture disease, microscopic, and granulomatous polyangiitis, and mixed cryoglobulinemias. These are often diagnosed based on extrapulmonary and serologic manifestations rather than alveolar hemorrhage being the initial presentation.

Virtually any disease process can be associated or attributed to drug-induced injury, including alveolar hemorrhage. Acute lung toxicity with diffuse alveolar damage has been seen with medications such as amiodarone, nitrofurantoin, and infliximab. Penicillamine has been known to cause both acute lung toxicity, and drug-induced lupus, both complications can lead to hemorrhage.
