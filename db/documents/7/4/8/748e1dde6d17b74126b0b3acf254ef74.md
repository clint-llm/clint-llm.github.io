Upon excitation, these cells deviate from their resting membrane potential to undergo a rapid action potential before coming returningÂ to rest.

For neurons, the firing of an action potential allows that cell to communicate with other cells via the release of various neurotransmitters. In muscle cells, the generation of an action potential causes the muscle to contract.
