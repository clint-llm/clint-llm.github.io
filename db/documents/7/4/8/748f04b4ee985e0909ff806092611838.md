Abacavir is administered as 300 mg twice daily or 600 mg once daily. It is also available as part of several co-formulated tablets. These different co-formulationsÂ are part of nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) drug combinations.

There are no dosage adjustments recommended in patients with renal impairment, and abacavir is well-tolerated in patients that would benefit from NRTI use with renal pathology from other antiretrovirals.
