Addisonian crisis secondary to adrenal insufficiency can be difficult to diagnose in acutely ill patients as the initial presentation is usually nonspecific with symptoms of fatigue, weakness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, back pain, diarrhea, dizziness, hypotension, syncope, and if not treated, progression to obtundation, coma, and shock. Usually, the Addisonian crisis is not at the top of the differential compared to other more common diagnoses, and more education is needed to ensure healthcare providers are aware of this diagnosis.

If the patient has a known history of adrenal insufficiency, the Addisonian crisis is near the top of the differential, and immediate care can be initiated. The diagnosis is often multifactorial; the difficulty in diagnosing the Addisonian crisis is due to identifying the underlying event that triggered the crisis while simultaneously treating and providing supportive care. The stress event may be secondary to recent surgery, cardiac event, infection, malignancy, medication, or physical and mental stress.  Treatment will need to address this underlying cause for full resolution. The differential diagnoses are broad and include:

- Shock

- Cardiogenic
- Obstructive
- Distributive
- Hypovolemic
- Septic

- Cardiac

- Acute myocardial infarction

- Endocrine

- Thyrotoxicosis
- Diabetic ketoacidosis
- Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state
- Myxedema coma
- Pituitary adenoma

- Gastrointestinal

- Dehydration
- Gastroenteritis
- Poor oral intake
- Acute Abdomen (such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, obstruction)

- Heme/Onc

- history of melanoma, breast cancers, on Immunotherapy with a checkpoint inhibitor
- Malignancy

- Obstetrics

- Pregnancy
- Hyperemesis gravidarum

- Infectious

- Acute localized or systemic infection

- Other:

- Trauma
