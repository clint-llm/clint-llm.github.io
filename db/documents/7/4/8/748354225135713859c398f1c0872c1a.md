As part of the quadriceps muscle group, the VL contracts during the termination of the swing phase of gait to prepare the knee for weight-bearing, the muscle group as a wholeÂ is responsible for absorbing the vast majority of the force generated by the heel strike. The muscle group continues to contract through the early portion of the stance phase as part of the loading response. Lastly, as part of the quadriceps muscle group, the VL eccentrically contracts during downhill walking and descending steps.

The VL is the strongest member of the quadriceps muscle group, and thus it is one of the main contributors to anterior knee pain syndromes. The VL is estimated to contribute approximately 40% of the overall strength of the quadriceps muscle group, with RF and VI accounting for 35% and the VM totaling the last 25%.
