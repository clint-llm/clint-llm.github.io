An interprofessional team approach to ventricular septal rupture is recommended to optimize timely recognition and delivery of care in this devastating complication of MI. All patients with transmural infarctions require monitoring by a cardiology specialty nurse to maintain adequate hemodynamics. Any change in the patient's vital signs or cardiac examination should be communicated urgently by the nurse to the clinician. The trained specialty nurse can assist the medical team in the early diagnosis of a VSR with timely treatment to prevent adverse outcomes. In patients who require an intra-aortic balloon pump, close observation by the critical care nurse is essential in preventing its complications. A collaborative interprofessional team can optimize care and greatly decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. The clinician needs to maintain a high index of suspicion for this disease in patients at risk. Timely communication and care coordination between interventional cardiology and the cardiothoracic team can greatly increase the chance of a favorable outcome for the patient. [Level 5]

Despite adequate treatment, some patients may have the persistence of a shunt. When possible, the clinician should manage residual shunts with a percutaneous closure device. Studies report that despite optimal treatment, the condition carries a mortality of 20% to 50%.
