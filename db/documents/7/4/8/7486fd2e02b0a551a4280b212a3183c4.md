While minocycline use has decreased due to safety concerns such as irreversible pigmentation, high cost, and teratogenic effects, it is vital to understand both the indications and adverse effects when considering this medication. Increased antibiotic resistance in the community might make this antibiotic more useful and commonly prescribed again in the future.

Using targeted drug-susceptibility therapy will benefit not only the patient but also society as a whole. The entire healthcare team must work collaboratively to ensure that minocycline is the appropriate agent and that the patient understands both the risks and benefits of the medication. Patients should receive instruction from the physician and pharmacist on what signs and symptoms to watch out for, pertaining to the possible adverse effects.

Collaboration within the interprofessional healthcare team will improve patient outcomes in reducing adverse drug reactions, which will increase the likelihood of patient compliance to medication and decrease morbidity and mortality.
