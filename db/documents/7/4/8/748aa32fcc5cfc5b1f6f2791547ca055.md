The pathophysiology of atypical moles is poorly understood, but it is generally accepted that its pathogenesis is a complex interaction of environmental and genetic factors.

Genetic alterations known to contribute to the pathogenesis of atypical moles include allelic loss of specific chromosomal regions, including 9p21-22 and 1p36. Additionally, mutations in the tumor suppressor melastatin and protooncogenes BRAF and CDK4 have a direct correlation with pathogenesis. DNA mismatch repair mechanisms contribute to melanocytic cellular atypia of these moles, through excessive telomerase activity, as measured by Ki-67 and cyclin D1.

Atypical moles often do not display the CDKN2A mutation that is common in melanomas.
