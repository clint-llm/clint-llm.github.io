Platelets can become activated in response to exposed collagen, thrombin, ADP, or other compounds. In response to tissue injury, exposed collagen on the subendothelial surface can bind directly to either the platelet or to vWF. The vWF is a molecule that can bind to both collagen and the platelet, via the GPIb receptor on the platelet surface. As a result, vWF acts as a bridge, forming a complex of collagen, vWF, and platelet, which results in adhesion to the vascular surface. Also, exposed collagen can bind directly to the platelet by binding to the GPVI receptor.

Binding to the GPIb and GPVI receptors causes activation of the platelet, beginning intracellular signaling cascades. These cascades result in the release of both alpha and dense granules, as well as activation of other enzymes, such as cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), which synthesizes thromboxane A2 (TXA). The release of alpha and dense granules is crucial for the recruitment of nearby platelets and further activation of the platelet.

As a result of degranulation, ADP, TXA, serotonin, fibrinogen, and P-selectin are secreted into the plasma. ADP and TXA are especially important in the activation of platelets. Released ADP binds to P2Y and P2Y receptors on the platelet surface, further increasing signal transduction and activation in the platelet, while TXA binds to thromboxane prostanoid receptors, increasing activation of nearby platelets. Both of these are critical in the recruitment of other platelets to form a large platelet plug. Serotonin acts in a similar, but less potent, way on 5HT receptors.

During activation, GPIIb/IIIa receptors are activated on the platelet’s surface, entering a high-affinity state. GPIIb/IIIa receptors are responsible for binding to fibrinogen. Since two platelets may bind a molecule of fibrinogen, platelets begin cross-linking, forming a larger platelet plug. Additionally, by activating the coagulation cascade with the release of clotting factors earlier during activation, the platelets cause an increased level of thrombin in the blood. Thrombin is a very potent platelet activator of platelets itself but also results in the cleavage of fibrinogen to fibrin. This conversion causes the formation of a stronger link between platelets, converting the soluble fibrinogen into an insoluble fibrin mesh.
