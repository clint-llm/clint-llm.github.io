The presence of bullae can be a nonspecific finding and resemble various dermatoses depending on the timing in the clinical course. Drug reactions, contact dermatitis, urticarial dermatoses, arthropod reactions, other autoimmune bullous disorders such as pemphigus vulgaris, and scabies. Bullae can also form secondary to allergic contact dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, dyshidrotic eczema, pseudoporphyria, or porphyria cutanea tarda. If bullae are identified in childhood, bullous impetigo, epidermolysis bullosa, and bullous variants of mastocytosis should be considered in the differential.

Histopathology, direct and indirect immunofluorescence studies, salt-split skin, and ELISA testing may be necessary if the diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid is questioned.
