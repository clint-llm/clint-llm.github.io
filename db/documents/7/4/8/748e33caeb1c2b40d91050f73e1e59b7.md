Blood gas temperature correction is an important process to implement when assessing blood gas laboratory values. The laws of physics concerning gas solubility dictate the output values for blood gases. It is incumbent upon the practitioner to interpret these values while considering the physiological environment. This activity reviews blood gas temperature changes, correction equations, how each correction method alters management, and the role of the interprofessional team in blood gas interpretation.

**Objectives:**
- Outline how temperature changes alter blood gas values.
- Describe alpha-stat and Ph-stat temperature correction methods and their current applications.
- Identify current practices relating to blood gas correction.
- Explain how improved interprofessional communication can augment the success of blood gas temperature correction.
