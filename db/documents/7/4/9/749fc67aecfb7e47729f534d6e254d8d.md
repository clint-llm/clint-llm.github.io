Glucosamine sulfate is an oral supplement used in the management and treatment of osteoarthritis. This activity outlines the indications, hypothesized action, and contraindications for glucosamine sulfate as a valuable agent in managing osteoarthritis. This activity will highlight the hypothesized mechanism of action, adverse event profile, suggested dosing, monitoring for relevant interactions, and other key elements of glucosamine sulfate supplementation in the clinical setting pertinent for members of an interprofessional team managing the care of patients with osteoarthritis.

**Objectives:**
- Review the treatment considerations for osteoarthritic patients requesting to add glucosamine sulfate supplements to their treatment strategy. 
- Describe the management considerations for patients taking glucosamine sulfate supplements.
- Summarize the risks associated with initiating glucosamine sulfate supplementation and related key patient counseling points.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to ensure the appropriate screening of patients requesting glucosamine sulfate supplements as a part of their osteoarthritis management to improve patient outcomes by identifying contraindications and thus decreasing adverse events.
