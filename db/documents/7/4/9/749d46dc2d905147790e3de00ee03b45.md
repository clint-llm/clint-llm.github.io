Drug-induced liver injury can be prevented by educating patients by the clinician once starting them on hepatotoxic drugs and warning them about possible side effects. Clinical judgment on the part of clinician and balancing risks versus benefits when starting patients on drugs with the potential to be hepatotoxic are needed. The warnings about the possible presentations of drug-induced liver injury should be clearly stated on the medication. It also involves reporting drugs that are suspected to cause liver toxicity as well as regulatory bodies like FDA to take appropriate steps to withdraw the drugs from the market based on data. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health has developed Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network, which constitutes 6 university hospitals working to collect and analyze data.
