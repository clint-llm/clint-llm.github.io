Individuals with a Proteus infection may present with urethritis, cystitis, prostatitis, or pyelonephritis. A history of frequent renal stones may be indicative of an underlying chronic Proteus infection.

Urethritis typically presents with dysuria, pyuria (with or without urethral discharge), and increased urinary frequency. Symptoms are often mild and frequently ignored by patients.

Cystitis, on the other hand, tends to present acutely with dysuria, increased frequency, and urgency of urination, suprapubic or back pain, small volume urine, dark urine, or hematuria. Patients also may present with a fever which may be indicative of a more severe condition, such as pyelonephritis, bacteremia, or impending sepsis.

Prostatitis occurs more acutely in men than cystitis, with the same set of symptoms, though may also be accompanied by fever and chills. Prostatitis tends to be more common with increased age. If there is an associated obstruction, patients also may complain of perianal pain. A diffusely swollen and tender prostate may be noted on palpation during a physical examination.

Pyelonephritis occurs as a complication of either of the conditions mentioned above, and the patient may, therefore, complain of symptoms of urethritis or cystitis. Additional symptoms that are more definitive of pyelonephritis include flank pain, costovertebral angle tenderness, nausea and vomiting, fever, hematuria, and occasionally an enlarged kidney felt on palpation.
