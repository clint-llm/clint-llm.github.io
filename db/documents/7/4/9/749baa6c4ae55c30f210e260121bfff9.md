Patients with a stroke can deteriorate rapidly. Others may aspirate, fall or develop seizures. Thus, the nurse should monitor the patient closely for any new neurological deficit and inform the clinician.Â The bed railings should be raised because there is a high risk of falls. The patient must be assisted to compensate for any functional impairments that may increase their risk of falls.
