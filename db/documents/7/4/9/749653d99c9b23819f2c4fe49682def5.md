**Hypertonic Saline**

There are few adverse effects associated with hypertonic saline, though most are associated with longer infusion periods, as opposed to boluses. One possible side effect is hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis due to the addition of NaCl. Patients may also develop hypernatremia with long-term administration for the same reasons. One other known effect is osmotic demyelination syndrome, when severe hyponatremia is corrected too rapidly. Hypertonic saline is also pregnancy category C and is only used if necessary. The most common adverse effects are related to the route of administration and include infection at the IV site, thrombophlebitis, extravasation, and hypervolemia.

**Mannitol**

Common adverse reactions after mannitol administration are pulmonary congestion, electrolyte abnormalities, acidosis, marked diuresis, dehydration, headache, and injection site reactions, among others. There have been no animal reproduction studies performed with mannitol, so it is unknown whether it would harm a human fetus. Mannitol should only be used in pregnant women if necessary.
