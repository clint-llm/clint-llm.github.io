Untreated or inadequately managed AIS may result in severe psychological distress inÂ patients as they go through puberty into adulthood and their families at the same time. Psychological distress is more frequent in adults with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome than in those with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, irrespective of whether they were raised as male or female. Bouvattier C et al. conducted a study of men with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome, and they noted that in men with PAIS, all aspects of sexual activity were substantially impaired.
