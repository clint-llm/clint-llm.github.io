Patients usually present with unilateral pain over the dorsal aspect of the wrist, limited wrist motion, weakness, or a combination of the three. Wrist extension and axial loading exacerbate pain. Symptoms range from mild to debilitating. It is rarely bilateral, and trauma is often absent.

Physical examination commonly reveals wrist swelling, tenderness over the expected location of the lunate, synovitis, and loss of grip strength.
