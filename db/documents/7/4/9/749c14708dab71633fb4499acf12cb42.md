Patients on antidepressants are at increased risk of attempted overdose. They should be regularly screened for thoughts of suicide. Patients should be counseled to keep their medications in a safe location that children cannot access. They should be encouraged to contact their regional poison center if there is a concern for potential toxic overdose on these medications.
