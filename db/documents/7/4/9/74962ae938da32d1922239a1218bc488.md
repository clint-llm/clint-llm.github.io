Keratosis pilaris is an asymptomatic condition that generally improves over time. As a result, the treatment of the disease is unnecessary. However, patients can aid in the resolution of skin lesions by maintaining adequate hygiene, using hypoallergenic soaps, and abstaining from manipulating the papules. For patients interested in treatment, topical medications can be used to treat keratosis pilaris. The topical treatments include emollients and topical keratolytics. Skin texture improves with the use of either salicylic acid lotion 6% or urea cream 20%.

Some case reports have found success with the use of the topical retinoid, 0.01% tazarotene. When applied nightly, keratosis pilaris faded in two weeks and resolved after four to eight weeks.
