There is currently no consensus on optimal surgical management of labyrinthine fistulas.

Because of a lack of definitive diagnostic criteria, conservative management is preferred initially with head elevation, bed rest, and avoiding activities that would increase intracranial pressure and straining. If symptoms persist or are recurrent, exploratory tympanotomy is the next step. Surgery has been shown to often improve dizziness and vertigo, but rarely improved hearing loss with increased risk of iatrogenic sensorineural hearing loss.

Management of labyrinthine fistulas induced by cholesteatomas includes complete removal of the cholesteatoma matrix from the fistula and subsequent closure of the fistula.
