Risks to the procedure include introducing infection into the joint space, allergic reactions, bleeding, contrast reactions, chondrolysis with a local anesthetic injection into the joint, and damage to any adjacent structures. While infection is rare, there is an increased risk for the elderly population and those with diabetes mellitus, skin infection, or rheumatoid arthritis.

A common complication is post-injection pain. This is likely related to synovitis, affecting up to 66% of patients within several hours post-procedure, but typically will resolve in days.Â Complications are few, but most commonly would include synovial irritation known as chemical synovitis that is induced by the injected iodinated contrast agent. This is a reactive type of synovitis. Chemical synovitis is typically a self-limiting process and is treated with over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen or naproxen.

Currently, there are no known cases of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis related to arthrography. If there is a failure to access the glenohumeral joint space, this results in extra-articular contrast. Other complications include urticaria and vasovagal reaction/episodes.
