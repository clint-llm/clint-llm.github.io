The initial prognosis depends on mortality predictors such as the following

- CSF opening pressure of more than 25 cm of water

- Low CSF white cells count

- Sensory impairment

- Delayed diagnosis

- Elevated CSF antigen titers

- Rate of infection clearance

- CSF yeast count more than 10 mm^3 (a common practice in Brazil)

- Non-HIV-related patients and the prognostic factors in these patients, in addition to the already mentioned:

- Markers of a poor inflammatory response
- Absence of headache
- Underlying hematological malignancy
- Chronic renal or liver disease

Mortality varies from country to country depending on the resource settings. It remains high in the United States and France, with a 10-week mortality of 15% to 26%, and it is even higher in non-HIV patients because of the delayed diagnosis and dysfunctional immune responses. On the other hand, in poor-resource countries, mortality increase from 30% to 70% in 10 weeks because of the late presentation and lack of access to drugs, manometers, and optimal monitoring.
