The semen sample is collected by the man by self-masturbation near the laboratory or at home. It is recommended that semen is collected after a minimum of 3 days and a maximum of 7 days of abstinence.

The sample should be collected in a clean, wide-mouthed container that is nontoxic to spermatozoa. The sperm container should be kept at ambient temperature between 20 deg C and 37 deg C. If the patient is unable to produce a suitable sample by masturbation, semen can be collected in nontoxic condoms during sexual intercourse. Latex condoms should not be used in these situations as these condoms have chemical agents that can affect sperm viability and motility.

The semen should be delivered to the laboratory within 1 hour of its collection so that dehydration and temperature changes do not affect the sperm quality. Safety guidelines must be strictly adhered to at the laboratory while handling semen samples. The sample should be analyzed using standardized methods described in the WHO laboratory manual for the examination and processing of human semen.
