Multidisciplinary simulation is an increasingly utilized method of providing departments with continuing medical education (CME). For example – a cardiac arrest scenario that involves anesthetists, physicians, nurses, students, and healthcare assistants has higher face validity for inter-professional communication and teamwork than the same scenario staffed entirely by anesthetists – as is still common today. This methodology imparts clinical teams with strategies to improve inter-professional communication and teamwork and has demonstrated its ability to improve team confidence in managing airway emergencies, carotid artery injuries, cleft care, and non-technical operating room scenarios.

SMBE is particularly well suited as a method for difficult airway scenario CME. These rare clinical emergencies involve large amounts of disparate team members, who may have never worked together, who are required to make complex surgical decisions in short periods. There have been a large number of multidisciplinary simulation studies demonstrating that these courses improve medical confidence in managing difficult airway scenarios.
