During embryogenesis, the sinus urogenitalis gives rise to the Bartholin glands, the inferior part of the vagina, and the majority of its epithelium. The body of each Bartholin gland is composed of mucinous acini lined by simple columnar epithelium. Their efferent ducts are composed of transitional epithelium, which merges into squamous epithelium as the orifices open into the vagina.
