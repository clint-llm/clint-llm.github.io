The differential diagnosis of this disease includes:

- Focal nodular hyperplasia

- GiantÂ cavernous hemangioma

- Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)

Imaging plays a crucial role in differentiating these lesions. Focal nodular hyperplasia demonstrates characteristics that follow the normal surrounding liver parenchyma on the portal venous and later delayed phase imaging. In the early arterial phase, it can show hyperenhancement which is usually uniform.

Cavernous hemangiomas follow the enhancement characteristics of blood vessels in all three phases. The classic pattern seen is a discontinuous and nodular enhancement pattern in the periphery of these masses on the early phases with subsequent contrast filling of the center.

Conventional HCC includes prompt enhancement in the arterial phase with a washout of contrast in the delayed phases. These patients often have a cirrhotic liver which is reflected in the imaging.
