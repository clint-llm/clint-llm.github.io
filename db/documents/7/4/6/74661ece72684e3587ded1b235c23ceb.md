Clinicians can approximate the adequacy of coronary via several modalities. Nuclear imaging can demonstrate delivery of blood to various portions of the myocardium, both at rest and when stressed. Coronary imaging, via CT angiography or cardiac catheterization, can show luminal narrowing of the coronaries and implied reduction in forward flow. In general, a decrease in the diameter of 50% correlates with a loss of ability to respond to increased metabolic demand completely. A reduction in diameter of 80% or greater is substantial enough to affect resting flow.
