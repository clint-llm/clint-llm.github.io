Endoscopy in the acute setting may reveal erythema, erosion, mucosal soughing, ulcerations, and hemorrhage. In the chronic setting, fibrosis, atypia, and chronic inflammatory changes may be seen.

Effects of radiation esophagitisÂ predominately involve the basal cells of the squamous epithelium. Within 48 hours of radiation therapy, apoptotic bodies are seen. Within a few weeks, the submucosal layers of the esophagus become involved with mucosal gland degeneration, endothelial swelling, and capillary dilation creating erythema. Within one month, cytological atypia is described as having irregular nuclear membranes and abnormal smudge nuclei with loss of detail with prominent nuclei. In addition, the cytoplasm will reveal a bubble appearance, pleomorphism, cytomegaly, and hyperchromic nuclei with other common findings including parakeratosis and mucosal atrophy.

In chronic esophagitis, fibroblasts and inflammatory cells infiltrate the muscle wall, leading to edema, and thickening of the submucosa, leading to fibrosis and stricture formation.
