The organism is acquired by inhalation. After being deposited into the pulmonary alveoli, the yeast spores must survive the normal to high pH and the physiological concentrations of carbon dioxide before they are phagocytized by alveolar macrophages, a more acidic environment, and disseminated after a latent period of containment in the lung lymph nodes. The essential factor in the survival of C. neoformans in this extracellular environment is glucosylceramide synthase.

The host response includes both cellular and humoral components. Possibly, the eradication of Cryptococci relies on natural killer cells and antibody-dependent cell-mediated killing.

While all organs can be involved, Cryptococcus spp. have a strong affinity for the central nervous system. This neurotropism is linked to several cryptococcal-specific factors which facilitate the permeability of the blood-brain barrier; between them, metalloproteinases and ureases enzymes cause neuromodulation and mechanisms facilitate survival in the nutrient-deprived environment of the brain (autophagy and high-affinity sugar transporters).

There can be little or no necrosis or organ damage until later disease. In patients with heavy infections, organ dysfunction may be accelerated, primarily due to tissue distortion caused by the growing fungal burden.
