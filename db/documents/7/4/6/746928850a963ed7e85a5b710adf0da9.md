Oral cavity malignancy, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, is the most common carcinoma of the head and neck. 90% of these neoplasms are squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA), with minor salivary gland malignancies and other rare tumors comprising the rest.

Imaging is necessary for characterizing, staging the disease, and assessing the tumorâ€™s relationship with surrounding structures. The draining lymph nodes of the neck are also radiologically assessed, as locoregional spread of tumor via the lymphatics, specifically to the submandibular and jugulodigastric chains, is common. Treatment is tailored to individual patients and, in general, consists of primarily surgery, with chemoradiation also having an important role in select patients. The goal of therapy consists of a complete cure while preserving or restoring functionality. Long term follow-up is essential, as locoregional recurrence of disease is not uncommon and should be promptly addressed.
