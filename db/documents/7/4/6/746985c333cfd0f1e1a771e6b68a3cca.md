Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis is an uncommon disease affecting the eccrine glands, leading to eccrine unit necrosis. It is most commonly seen in adults receiving cytarabine as a part of the induction chemotherapy for the treatment of hematological malignancy. The diagnosis of neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis may signify that the patient has an underlying malignancy or relapse of previous malignancy. In newly diagnosed neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis patients with no history of malignancy, the primary care provider should be notified, and age-appropriate cancer screening guidelines should be followed. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and prognosis of neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis and examines the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.
