Viloxazine is a relatively safe drug at daily doses between 50 mg to 400 mg with no adverse effects other than mild GI discomfort. In the last few decades, very few cases of viloxazine toxicity have been reported. There have not been any reported severe toxicity cases with viloxazine. One report showed viloxazine overdose in 12 patients. However, all 12 of these patients had no EKG abnormalities.

In addition, the literature confirms that viloxazine exhibits significantly fewer side effects compared to other antidepressants. One study administered various doses from 100 mg to 4 g of viloxazine to patients and monitored them for complications. As a result, no deaths occurred. The only complications were transitory loss of consciousness and two cases of convulsive seizures.
