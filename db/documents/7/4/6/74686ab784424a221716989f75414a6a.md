Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common diagnosis and second deadliest malignancy for both sexes combined. CRC has both strong environmental associations and genetic risk factors. The incidence of new cases and mortality has been steadily declining for the past years, except for younger adults (younger than 50 years), possibly related to an increase in cancer screening and better therapy modalities. Approximately 5% of all CRC are attributed to two inherited syndromes, Familial Adenomatous Polyposis, and Lynch syndrome.Â  The change of the normal colonic epithelium to a precancerous lesion and ultimately an invasive carcinoma requires an accumulation of genetic mutations either somatic (acquired) and/or germline (inherited) in an approximately 10 to 15-year period.
