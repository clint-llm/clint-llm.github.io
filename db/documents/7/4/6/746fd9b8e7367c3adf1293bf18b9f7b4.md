All patients must be educated regarding the need for surgical excision and targeted medical therapy. The patients should be explained that excised mass can be a surface tumor and need timely and appropriate treatment. The need for regular follow-up post-surgery must be stressed. Additionally, since OSSN is associated with HIV, HPV, and Hepatitis B, the need for blood investigations must be explained to the patient. The patient should be educated to prevent direct excessive sunlight exposure and the side effects of medical therapy. In the end, the patient should be told that OSSN has an overall good prognosis and outcome is good in the majority of the cases.
