Ant/bee stings are very commonly encountered in the emergency department. While minor stings can be managed with supportive care, serious stings associated with anaphylaxis are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes the emergency department physician, specialty nurse, anesthesiologist, poison control, and intensivist.

Systemic reactions (anaphylaxis) are life-threatening and should be managed with the ATLS protocol.Â  Epinephrine and corticosteroids can be life-saving.

All patients with allergies should be told to carry epinephrine on them. Parents should avoid taking their children to areas where ants/bees are common.

The key is prevention, and the public health nurse or pharmacist should educate the patient on the prevention of insect bites. Besides wearing appropriate garments, and avoiding perfumes, one should not venture near hives or ant locations. Homeowners should not use noisy equipment in the presence of African bees who are easily irritated. Patients with severe reactions should be referred to an allergist for potential desensitization and immunotherapy.
