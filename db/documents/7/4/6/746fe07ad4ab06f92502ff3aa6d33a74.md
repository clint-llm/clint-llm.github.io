Upper blepharoplasty may be performed with straight local anesthesia with or without monitored sedation. These procedures can be performed safely in an office, surgical center or hospital operating theater. The surgeon must be familiar with the procedure of blepharoplasty and also have the experience and knowledge to address any preoperative and postoperative complications that may arise.
