Genetic counseling plays an important role in the management as well as appropriate evaluation and education for both the patient and involved family members. Consultation with a genetic counselor and clinical geneticist can provide important clinical information such as genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of the disease, possible disease progression, and the likelihood of disease occurring in relatives or offspring.
