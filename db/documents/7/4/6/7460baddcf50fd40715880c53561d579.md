Poliomyelitis (polio) is a viral disease that can range in severity from self-limiting disease to meningitis. In its most severe form, it may present as acute flaccid paralysis. Polio has the potential to severely damage motor neurons leading to a lifetime of muscular dysfunction or even death if the respiratory function is affected. To avoid such a disability, the vaccine must be administered as primary prevention. This activity reviews the diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and complications associated with this condition and the care of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the epidemiology of poliomyelitis.
- Explain the common physical exam findings of those with poliomyelitis.
- Identify complications of poliomyelitis.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients with poliomyelitis and post-polio syndrome.
