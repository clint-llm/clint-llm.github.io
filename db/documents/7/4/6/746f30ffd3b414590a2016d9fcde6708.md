The diagnosis and management of gastric volvulus is complex and best done with an interprofessional team that includes a radiologist, emergency department physician, general surgeon, gastroenterologist, and an intensivist. Delay in diagnosis or treatment can be fatal. Some patients may be managed with conservative treatment that includes decompression of the stomach, but most patients benefit from surgery.

Strangulated gastric volvulus is associated with mortality rates in excess of 30% and these patients need monitoring by ICU nurses. Even after surgery, patients may develop complications that can prolong recovery. The outcomes for most patients are guarded.
