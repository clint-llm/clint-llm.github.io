Invasive lobular carcinoma is the second most common histologic form of breast cancer, representing 5% to 15% of all invasive breast cancers. It is composed of non-cohesive cells individually dispersed or organized in a single-file linear pattern in a fibrous stroma. Invasive lobular carcinoma is usually associated with lobular carcinoma in situ. This activity educates the student about the etiology, epidemiology, clinical evaluation, and the importance of treatment of lobular carcinoma of the breast.
