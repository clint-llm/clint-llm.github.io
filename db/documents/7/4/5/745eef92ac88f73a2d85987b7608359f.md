The etiology of acute sympathomimetic toxicity is related to its effect on the inhibition of norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake at the preganglionic synapse. This can be due to any of the number of sympathomimetics, with the prototypical drug being cocaine. There have been others that have been in the forefront recently, most notably, Mephedrone (aka bath salts) and 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine or MDMA (including ecstasy and Molly). All of these have the common denominator of increasing the synaptic cleft with norepinephrine and dopamine for a longer period ofÂ time than is physiologically needed.
