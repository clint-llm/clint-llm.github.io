Brow ptosis is a fairly straightforward and well-defined diagnosis but may be confused with or obscured by other periorbital pathology. Asymmetric brow ptosis may seem like unilateral pathology unless a thorough physical examination reveals that the more ptotic side was masking the appearance of the less ptotic side. Severe dermatochalasis or blepharoptosis may distract the physician from identifying concomitant brow ptosis. A thorough history and physical examination will reveal whether a patient’s brow ptosis is age-related, traumatic, myogenic, spasm-induced, infectious, neoplastic, or iatrogenic.
