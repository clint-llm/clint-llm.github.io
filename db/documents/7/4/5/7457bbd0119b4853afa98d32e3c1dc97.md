The vaccine is a non-infectious subunit of the virus, which leads to an active immunity. Antibodies produced by vaccination target the outer protein coat or surface antigen. This leads to protection against all genotypes (A through H) of the virus and gives a broad immunity.

It is generally accepted that the hepatitis B vaccine confers lifelong protection; originally, it was thought to only last around eight years, but more recent research has confirmed ongoing immunity for at least 25 years in those individuals who demonstrated a good immune response from the vaccine series.

Patients who fail to develop a good response from the vaccine tend to be over 40 years of age, obese, have celiac disease, smoke tobacco, or misuse alcohol. This last group will especially be affected if they have progressed to liver disease.
