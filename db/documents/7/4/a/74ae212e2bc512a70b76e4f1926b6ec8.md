Indications for CABG using the GEA include but are not limited to the following:

- Grafting the distal RCA and posterior descending artery (PDA) as this is nearest to the in-situ GEA graft and most distant from the right internal mammary graft (RIMA).

- Grafting the distal left circumflex artery (LCx) or the left anterior descending artery (LAD) when the IMA is unavailable or unable to be grafted.

- If the ascending aorta is atherosclerotic, the in-situ arterial graft is a requirement for the aortic no-touch technique.

- In cases of redo CABG, GEA graft is more useful due to ease of mobilization of the GEA from the abdomen prior to the redo sternotomy.
