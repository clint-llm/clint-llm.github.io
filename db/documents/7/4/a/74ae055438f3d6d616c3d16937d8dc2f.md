There are several variations of brachioradialis anatomy that have been reported. One variant described has two superficial radial nerves and two muscle bellies of the brachioradialis. One of the superficial radial nerves runs between the two muscle bellies of the brachioradialis putting the nerve at risk for entrapment. The unique double muscle belly variant of the brachioradialis formed superficial and deep layers which both shared a common origin and insertion tendon.

Another variant of the brachioradialis muscle features additional muscle fibers contributing to the brachioradialis from a more proximal origin. These additional muscle fibers originate from the shaft of the humerus near the deltoid insertion and blend distally with the brachialis muscle. Some fibers have been reported to originate as proximal as the acromion. These variant muscle fibers then fuse distally with the brachioradialis.

A variant insertion of the brachioradialis has been reported where the tendon distally inserts to the third metacarpal.
