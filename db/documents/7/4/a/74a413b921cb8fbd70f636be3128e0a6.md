Usually generalized, painless, gradual enlargement of the tongue is noted. Muscular hypertrophy or glandular hyperplasia is seen in most cases of primary macroglossia. In acquired conditions, pathophysiology differs based on whether it is an infiltrative condition, trauma, vascular or lymphatic malformation. For example, amyloid deposition fibrils are noted in the tongue andÂ aids in diagnosis. In amyloidosis, macroglossia, due to amyloid depositions, can cause cosmetic problems, tongue ulcerations, functional disability, and life-threatening airway obstruction. A Congo red stain of a tongue biopsy specimen will show amyloid material as a peach-red color under light microscopy and, when viewed under polarization, will show the characteristic apple-green birefringence.

Macroglossia happens due to the accumulation of adipose tissue in the submucosa of the tongue.

Macroglossia in hypothyroidism is due to increased accumulation of subcutaneous mucopolysaccharides due to a decreased degradation.
