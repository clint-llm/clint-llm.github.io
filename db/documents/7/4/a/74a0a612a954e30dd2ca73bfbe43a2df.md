The ciliary muscle and both pupillary muscles are cranial neural crest derivatives and develop from the mesenchyme of the choroid.

The extraocular muscles, including the levator palpebrae superioris, are derivatives of periocular mesenchyme. Five of the six extraocular muscles originate at the annulus of Zinn (a tendinous ring), while the inferior oblique originates on the orbital portion of the bony maxilla. The annulus of Zinn overlies the superior orbital fissure and the optic foramen.

The orbicularis oculi derive from mesenchyme of the second pharyngeal arch, and forms from mesoderm of the eyelid.
