The lesser saphenous vein and greater saphenous vein typically terminate in the popliteal vein and femoral vein, respectively. However, variable connections between these veins are common, so the flow patterns should never be considered absolute. In a study of 200 lower extremities using Doppler sonography, 107 (53.5%) subjects had a lateral accessory branch of the great saphenous vein, and 33 (16.5%) had a medial accessory branch of the great saphenous vein.
