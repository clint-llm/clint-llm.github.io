Avascular necrosis of the hip is a condition characterized by the death of the femoral head due to disruption of its vascular supply, chiefly the MFCA. This condition results in the insidious onset of hip pain, usually with movement, and can be the result of a variety of factors. Some of the most common causes can be remembered by the mnemonic “ASEPTIC”:

- Alcohol/AIDS

- Steroids, sickle cell disease, SLE

- Erlenmeyer flask (Gaucher disease)

- Pancreatitis

- Trauma

- Idiopathic (Legg-Calve-Perthes disease), infection, iatrogenic

- Caisson disease

Making the diagnosis is dependent on a good history and physical along with imaging. Hip radiographs may be negative early in the course of the disease so if there is a high clinical suspicion then an MRI may be utilized.
