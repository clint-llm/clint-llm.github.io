Nephrology consultation should be considered if there are dysmorphic RBCs, cellular casts, abnormal renal functions, the presence of proteinuria, or unexplained microscopic hematuria. Urology consult is recommended for management of nephrolithiasis and anatomical abnormalities including renal mass or urinary tract masses.
