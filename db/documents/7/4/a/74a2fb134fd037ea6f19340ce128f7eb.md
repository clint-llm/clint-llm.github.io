Thrombosis is a blood clot within blood vessels that limits the flow of blood. Acute venous and arterial thromboses are the most common cause of death in developed countries. The mortality rate varies with the location and acuity of thrombosis. Myocardial infarctions and cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) account for the highest proportion of thrombosis-associated deaths in the United States. This activity reviews the basic pathophysiology, provoking risk factors, and evaluation of venous and arterial thromboses and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiologic factors associated with venous or arterial thromboses.
- Explain when the diagnosis of venous or arterial thromboses should be considered.
- Describe how to properly evaluate for venous or arterial thromboses.
- Outline the importance of enhancing care coordination among the interprofessional team to ensure proper evaluation and management of venous and arterial thromboses.
