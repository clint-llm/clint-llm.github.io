Cushing disease is a rare disorder characterized by increased adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production from the anterior pituitary, leading to excess cortisol release from the adrenal glands.

Cushing disease is a relatively rare disease. The average incidence of new cases is about 2.4 cases per million people per year. This disease often is diagnosed 3 to 6 years after the onset of the illness. The peak incidence of Cushing disease is in women between the ages of 50 and 60 years. The prevalence of hypertension and abnormalities of glucose metabolism are major predictors of morbidity and mortality in untreated cases of the disease. The mortality rate of Cushing disease is estimated to be about 10% to 11%.
