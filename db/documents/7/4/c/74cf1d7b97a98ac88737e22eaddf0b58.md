Patients can be reassured that pattern dystrophies do not typically negatively impact their vision significantly, and progression is gradual. Due to the challenges of distinguishing pattern dystrophies from AMD, patients are often mistaken for having AMD and have received treatments targeting AMD such as vitamins, anti-VEGF injections, and PDT.

Areas of atrophy may develop in older patients and affect central vision; however, patients can maintain reading vision in most cases. The majority of patients will not require intervention or treatment and can be followed over time.
