The gastrocnemius muscle consists of two heads. The medial head originates from the posterior medial femoral condyle while the lateral head arises from the posterior lateral femoral condyle. The gastrocnemius muscle is vulnerable to injury because it crosses 3 joints: the knee, the ankle, and the subtalar joint. While Achilles tendon injury is common, injuries over the posterior calf, including the gastrocnemius, soleus, plantaris, and flexor hallucis longus muscles, are far less prevalent. Proper and timely diagnosis is essential to treat patients with posterior calf injuries. Patients generally recover well if they received appropriate diagnosis and treatment. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of gastrocnemius strain and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the common mechanisms of injury that lead to gastrocnemius strains.
- Review the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of gastrocnemius strain.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for gastrocnemius strain.
- Summarize the importance of communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the care of patients with gastrocnemius strain.
