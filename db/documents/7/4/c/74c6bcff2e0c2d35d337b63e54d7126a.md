The complication rate of electrophysiological study is relatively low when performed by an experienced operator with the support of a well-trained arrhythmia team. Radiofrequency ablation and advanced age are the most important risk factors associated with an increased rate of complications.

Other less frequent complications include local vascular injury, thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, systemic arterial embolism, cardiac perforation and tamponade, catheter induced AV block, and induction of nonclinical atrial fibrillation. The risk of life-threatening complications such as myocardial infarction, stroke, or sudden death is generally less than 0.5%. Nevertheless, the patient must be thoroughly informed about all the possible risks and benefits associated with the procedure, and an undersigned consent must always be obtained from the provider who is responsible for the care of the patient.
