Drug-induced heart disease is not common, but when it occurs, it can lead to high morbidity and mortality. The key is to prevent the problem in the first place. Because there are thousands of drugs already in use and at least several dozen new ones being introduced every year, the onus is on every clinician to be aware of the problem.

Healthcare workers should always be aware of drug-induced heart disease. While the older weight loss agents were the culprits in many cases, several chemotherapy drugs can also cause heart problems. In general, it is important to conduct a thorough heart exam whenever a patient has been started on a new drug. Sometimes, the ECG may show an abnormal rhythm.

In addition, the pharmacist must educate the patient on the potential adverse effects and keep track of any cardiac symptoms. All new drugs undergo post-marketing surveillance, and the pharmacist/clinician should be aware of the reporting requirements. The onus is on all clinicians, irrespective of specialty, to be aware of drug-induced valvular heart disease. Only through a team approach, can one identify such drugs and reduce patient morbidity.

If ever a patient is suspected of having developed drug-induced heart disease, referral to a cardiologist is highly recommended.  The prognosis of patients with drug-induced heart disease depends on the severity of valvular heart disease. Cardiology nurses help arrange testing and follow up. they also participate in patient educations. Pharmacists should counsel patients on medications that can cause this condition to watch for new symptoms and to see the prescribing provider regularly. [Level 5]
