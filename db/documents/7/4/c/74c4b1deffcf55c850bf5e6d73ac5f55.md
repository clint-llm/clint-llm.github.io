EMTALA and COBRA laws prevent "patient dumping," which is a form of economic discrimination where uninsured patients do not receive treatment and transfer to public institutions or are discharged because of the high anticipated costs of their emergency diagnoses or treatments.

EMTALA has often been cited as a major contributor to emergency department overcrowding and costs.
