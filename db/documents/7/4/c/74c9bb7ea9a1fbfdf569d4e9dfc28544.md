Mitral valve stenosis can remain asymptomatic for years, especially when resulting from rheumatic fever. It can take decades following rheumatic fever before mitral valve stenosis develops.

Once symptoms become apparent, the progression of the disease generally accelerates, particularly when it is secondary to rheumatic fever. Approximately 80% of patients will not survive ten years from symptomatic onset. In patients with pulmonary hypertension secondary to mitral valve stenosis, survival is around three years. Heart failure often accompanies advanced cases.

The outlook for children born with mitral valve stenosis depends large on the severity of their condition, often requiring screening for related heart problems throughout their lives.
