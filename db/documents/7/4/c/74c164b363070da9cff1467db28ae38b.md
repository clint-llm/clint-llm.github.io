1. UBC and ABC affect the same age group, similar sites, and are fluid-filled cystic lesions making diagnosis difficult. However, ABC is more eccentric, aggressive, and shows increased trabeculations which help differentiate from UBC. Even so, traumatized UBC can be difficult to diagnose from primary ABC. In this case, a biopsy can be helpful; areas of cement-like substance indicate UBC while calcifying bluish fibrochondroid areas indicate ABC.

2. Telangiectatic Osteosarcoma: These lesions show similar features as ABC radiographically. A biopsy is particularly essential to rule out osteosarcoma. Atypical cells, mitosis, and irregular osteoid matric are features of telangiectatic osteosarcoma.Â Molecular biology, using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) will show rearrangement of USP6 in primary ABC.

3. Giant Cell Tumor

4. Eosinophilic granuloma, osteoblastoma, malignant tumors

5. Nonossifying fibroma and solid ABC could appear similar

Other cystic bone lesions:

Intraosseous ganglion cyst: These typically occur at the ends of the long bones particularly distal tibia, knee, and shoulder. On x-rays, they appear as well marginated, unilocular or multilocular lytic defects with a thin rim of sclerosis. Treatment involves local excision and curettage.

Epidermoid cyst: These are cystic lesions that are filled with keratinous material and lined with squamous epithelium.
