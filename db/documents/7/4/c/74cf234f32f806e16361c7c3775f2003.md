Malignant degeneration is rare. The prognosis is good. Patients usually present for cosmetic reasons due to pigmentation of the sclera and iris. Rarely it may be associated with cavernous hemangioma of the optic disc.

There is a 10.3% risk of glaucoma, and 1 in 400 patients developed malignant melanoma.Â For these reasons, annual ophthalmological screening is mandated for the measurement of intraocular pressures and dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy.

A skin biopsy should be done if clinical changes are suspected of malignant transformation. Ophthalmologic follow-up care is necessary for patients with increased intraocular pressure.

Overall, these lesions are typically benign with an excellent prognosis with or without treatment. Yearly screening for ruling out glaucoma and malignant melanoma by an ophthalmologist and dermatologist is recommended.
