A primary care physician can often do the preoperative clinical evaluation. However, in patients with symptoms or a history of heart disease, who will undergo moderate or high-risk procedures, it will often be necessary to involve the cardiologist.

Before the surgery, the doctor frequently must request electrocardiograms, laboratory tests, stress tests, echocardiography, etc., so it is important to him to keep in touch with the technicians and physicians who do them to know their details.

The physician who performs perioperative cardiac management should communicate with the surgeon, the anesthesiologist, and the intensivist (if the patient requires intensive care) to achieve the best possible results.

Initiation of preoperative high-dose beta-blockers without titration (in other words, to be initiated on the day of surgery) is not safe.

Management of perioperative antiplatelet therapy should be determined by a consensus of the interprofessional team, including the surgeon, anesthesiologist, cardiologist, and patient.
