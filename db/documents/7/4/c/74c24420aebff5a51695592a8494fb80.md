In NBS, it is the paradoxical abdominal pain with opioid use that is often unrecognized, and hence, the condition often goes unrecognized, resulting in escalating use of opioids, which in turn causes more severe abdominal pain. The key feature of NBS is the worsening abdominal pain that is centrally mediated. It should be differentiated from the usual peripheral adverse effects of opioids like nausea, vomiting, bloating, abdominal cramps and constipation.The latter collection of symptoms may occur in conjunction with NBS.
