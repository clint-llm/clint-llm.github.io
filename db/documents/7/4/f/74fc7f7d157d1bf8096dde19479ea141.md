The pathogenesis of Wells syndrome is unknown. It may be explained as an inappropriate eosinophilic reaction to a wide variety of stimuli due to an abnormal function of eosinophil regulatory systems. Many triggering factors have been proposed: insect bites, drugs, allergic contact dermatitis, an underlying myeloproliferative disorder, and infections (e.g., dermatophytes, viruses, Toxocara canis).
