Keratinocytic epidermal nevi are characterized by linear or whirled pink to hyperpigmented plaques that can become verrucous with time. Unilateral or bilateral involvement can be seen, but they tend to abruptly stop at the midline and are most frequently found on the trunk and extremities.

Sebaceous nevus is more frequently found on the head and neck. They have a striking salmon or yellow color with a waxy surface and are associated with an alopecic patch. They are typically noted around the time of birth, but around puberty become more pronounced due to hormonal influences.

Nevus comedonicus is characterized by a grouping of dilated follicles plugged with keratin. Similar to acne lesions, they can be complicated by superimposed bacterial infections and inflammation.

Beckerâ€™s nevi are typically located on the upper trunk or shoulder girdle and consist of a light brown hyperpigmented patch that can develop hypertrichosis usually around puberty.

CHILD nevus is characterized by unilateral and sometimes blaschkoid involvement of waxy yellow plaques, which can become verrucous with time.
