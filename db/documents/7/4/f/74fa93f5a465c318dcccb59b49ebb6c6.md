Sertoli cell identification first starts with looking towards the basolateral aspect of the seminiferous tubules. One can observe that Sertoli cells are large irregularly shaped cells that form an inner perimeter, along with smaller more-uniformly-shaped-circular cells. These are the primary spermatogonia that the Sertoli cells will provide sustenance too. The Sertoli cell can also be identified by looking for the paler nucleus’ in comparison to its neighboring cell, the primary spermatogonia, who have much darker, rounder nuclei. There are also primitive spermatids resting over the apical end of the Sertoli cell, which will undergo spermiogenesis and bud off into the lumen of the seminiferous tubules.
