**Treatment for Simple UTIs**

Acute uncomplicated UTI is mostly managed in the outpatient setting. In fact, women with typical symptoms of acute cystitis can be prescribed antibiotic therapy over the telephone.

Management of simple cystitis is relatively straightforward. Urine cultures should be obtained before initiating therapy:

- For patients who have been treated for cystitis in the past 3 months, urine culture and susceptibility testing should be obtained to guide antibiotic therapy due to the increased risk of antibiotic resistance.

- Patients presenting with complicated cystitis or pyelonephritis should also have urine cultures prior to initiating empiric antibiotics.

The first line options for empiric antibiotic therapy for simple cystitis are:

- Nitrofurantoin 100 mg twice daily orally for 5 to 7 days. It should be avoided in suspected pyelonephritis (due to poor tissue penetration) or if creatinine clearance is <30 mL/min.

- Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg twice daily orally for three days. It should be avoided if the local resistance rate exceeds 20%.

- Fosfomycin, as a single oral dose of 3 grams.

- Pivmecillinam. Not available in the US, but it is available in Europe and is the agent of choice for UTIs in Nordic countries. Avoid this agent in suspected pyelonephritis due to poor tissue penetration.

If the above options cannot be used, oral beta-lactams are the next best choice. Amoxicillin-clavulanate 500 mg twice daily, cefdinir (300 mg twice daily), cefadroxil (500 mg twice daily), and cefpodoxime (100 mg twice daily) are each given for five to seven days. Ampicillin or amoxicillin should be avoided due to high rates of resistance.

For inpatient management of patients with risk factors for multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogen infection, carbapenems (imipenem 500 mg intravenously (IV) six-hourly, or meropenem 1 gram IV eight-hourly, or doripenem 500 mg eight hourly) are used. If no risk factors for MDR are present, ceftriaxone (1 gram IV daily) or piperacillin-tazobactam (3.375 grams IV every six hours) can be used. Fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin), both oral and parenteral, are also good alternatives. For critically ill patients, carbapenems (as above) along with vancomycin are typically used. Aminoglycosides may also be used selectively, depending on urine culture and sensitivity results as well as local antibiotic susceptibility patterns.

Symptoms should respond to antibiotic therapy within 48 hours of initiation of therapy. If no improvement is noticed within the first 48 hours after starting therapy, a repeat urine culture should be obtained along with urologic imaging to rule out complications such as an obstructing urinary stone, hydronephrosis, urinary retention, renal abscess, or pyelonephritis.

Clinicians should not generally perform a post-treatment test of cure urinalysis or urine culture in asymptomatic patients. Repeat urine cultures should be obtained to guide further management when UTI symptoms persist following antimicrobial therapy.

**Treatment for Recurrent UTIs**

Recommended treatments for recurrent UTIs include maximizing personal hygiene factors, avoiding spermicides, wiping correctly, using vaginal estrogens if appropriate, etc. The effectiveness of lifestyle changes in personal hygiene in reducing recurrent UTIs has not been conclusively demonstrated.

Prophylactic methenamine has been suggested, along with vitamin C, to help acidify the urine.

D-mannose has been proposed as an aid in recurrent cystitis due to its ability to bind to bacterial surface ligands, which decrease the adherence of infecting organisms to the urothelial mucosa.

Antibiotic prophylaxis has been quite successful in controlling recurrent UTIs, but using alternative means first is preferable. When other measures fail or there is evidence of multiple rapid recurrences, antibiotic prophylaxis is reasonable. Prophylaxis is never appropriate in patients who have permanent catheters or nephrostomies as this will rapidly lead to highly resistant organisms.

There are several ways antibiotic prophylaxis for recurrent UTIs can be done. Post-coital prophylaxis is appropriate for women with frequent episodes of cystitis that are clearly associated with sexual activity. Another option is the self-directed therapy approach, where patients start a short course of antibiotic treatment at their first sign or symptom of a UTI. Such an approach is reasonable if the patient is sufficiently educated about the symptoms associated with infections and will reliably follow instructions.

Surveillance urine testing and cultures in asymptomatic patients is not recommended. Asymptomatic patients, even high-risk patients in nursing homes and diabetics, do not benefit from an additional evaluation, and any bacteriuria should not be treated without symptoms.

If a recurrent UTI patient develops an acute UTI, a urine culture should be obtained, and an alternate antibiotic agent used to treat the infection. The duration of treatment should be no longer than a week.

**Long Term, Low Dose Prophylaxis**

Continuous prophylaxis is typically done with a lower dose than is typically used for acute cystitis therapy. Therefore, this approach is called the long-term, low-dose therapy protocol. The selection of the antibiotic is based on culture and sensitivity results for that individual patient. Initial evaluation of the effectiveness of prophylaxis is suggested at three months. If effective, a six to twelve-month duration is typical. Unfortunately, many individuals will revert to their prior pattern of infections once prophylaxis stops.

Some experts will recommend continuing prophylaxis for up to two or more years in selected patients.

Beta-lactams can be used but tend to rapidly change GI flora, carry a risk of pseudomembranous colitis (Clostridia), provoke bacterial resistance, and stimulate yeast overgrowth.

There is only limited data on the use of fosfomycin for UTI prophylaxis, but it may be appropriate in selected situations.

There are some negative aspects to antibiotic prophylaxis. There is the added cost and inconvenience of taking additional medication. There are possible allergies and medication cross-reactivities. Yeast superinfections and Clostridia gastrointestinal overgrowth become more likely, and continuous prophylaxis fosters the emergence of more resistant urinary pathogens.

Overall, long-term, low dose antibiotic prophylaxis for recurrent UTIs substantially decreases recurrent urinary tract infections.
