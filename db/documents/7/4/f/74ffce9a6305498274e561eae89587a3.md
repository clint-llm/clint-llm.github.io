Regarding pathophysiology and etiology, empty sella syndrome (ESS) subdivides into two categories: primary empty sella syndrome (PES) and secondary empty sella syndrome (SES). Although this article will use this distinction, it is worth noting that both primary and secondary empty sella can be thought of and treated as one entity: ESS.

PES isÂ a disorder caused by the incompetence of the diaphragma sellae and the resultant herniation of CSF into the sella turcica.
