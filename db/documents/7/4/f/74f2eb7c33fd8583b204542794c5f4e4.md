The differential diagnosis for vulvar cancer is broad due to the sometimes-nonspecific nature of this disease. Several diseases that can mimic vulvar cancer include cutaneous SCC, cutaneous BCC, cutaneous melanoma, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, lichen sclerosus, lichen planus, lichen chronicus simplex, contact dermatitis, candidiasis, pemphigus vegetans, or mycosis fungoides.
