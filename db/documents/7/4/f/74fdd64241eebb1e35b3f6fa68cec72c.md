Location of contrecoup brain injuries has been the subject of several studies, sometimes with conflicting results. Temporal bone injuries in one study had the best correlation with contrecoup injuries also in the temporal lobe area on the opposite side.

The contrecoup brain injury has also been implicated in contralateral extra-axial skull pathology secondary to the trauma. One case report indicates a case of mild head injury in which a skull fracture was noted on the opposite side of the head from the impact of the fall.

There are also reports of epidural hematomas being located in a contralateral location from the side of the trauma.
