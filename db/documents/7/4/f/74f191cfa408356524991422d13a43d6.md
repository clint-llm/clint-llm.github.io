Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency (MCADD or MCAD deficiency) is one of the most common mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation disorders and is typically caused by a mutation in the ACADM gene.

The inability to provide energy to tissue when glycogen stores are depleted secondary to MCADD, particularly in neonates, may present with various symptoms due to hypoketotic hypoglycemia, including jaundice, cardiomyopathy, hepatopathy, altered mental status, seizure, and even death. Newborn screening has improved diagnosis before dangerous sequelae, but one study finds that it has not completely stopped the metabolic crisis or death.
