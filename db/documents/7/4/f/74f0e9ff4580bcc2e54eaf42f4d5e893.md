The prognosis of neurotrophic keratitis depends on the cause and severity of the trigeminal damage and the presence of associated ocular surface disease. It is accepted that the more severe the corneal sensory impairment, the higher the probability of neurotrophic keratitis progression. All the current therapeutic approaches focus on preventing the disease progression, but there are none to improve the corneal sensation and visual acuity. However, use of topical nerve growth factor derivatives and an Ergoline derivative, called Nicergoline are promising approaches in improving corneal sensation and thus extremely beneficial in patients who fail to respond to conventional therapy.
