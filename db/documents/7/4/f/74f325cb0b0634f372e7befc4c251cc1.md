A distinct complication of P. falciparum malaria is cerebral malaria (CM), a diffuse and symmetrical encephalopathy.

Other possible complications, predominantly caused by P. falciparum, include:

- Acute kidney injury complicates up to 40% of P. falciparum malaria.

- Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and hypoxia

- Electrolyte and fluid abnormalities

- Acid-base disturbances â€“ mostly acidosis and hyperlactatemia

- Hypoglycemia, often exacerbated by quinine therapy

- Anemia, with the reduction in hemoglobin levels being proportional to disease severity and duration of illness before treatment

- Other hematological complications (delayed hemolytic anemia following artemisinin treatment, hyper-reactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS), and splenic rupture)

- Blackwater fever and hemoglobinuria due to intravascular hemolysis in patients with severe clinical manifestations of falciparum malaria

- Profound thrombocytopenia is often associated with P. falciparum infection, however, bleeding and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) are rare.

- Hepatic dysfunction

- Shock and associated infections (such as Salmonella bacteriemia, aspiration pneumonia, nosocomial infections, etc.)

- Neurological sequelae (epilepsy, permanent focal deficits, etc.)

The three most common complications occurring in children are cerebral malaria, severe anemia, and acidosis, either isolated or overlapping.
