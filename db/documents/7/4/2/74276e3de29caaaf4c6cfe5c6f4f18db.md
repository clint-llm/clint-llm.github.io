As compression of the celiac artery is believed to be the primary pathology in celiac artery compression syndrome, therapy is directed at the release of this compression. There is no known medical treatment of celiac artery compression syndrome. As first-line therapy, the surgical division of median arcuate ligament can be performed in the following two ways: traditional open surgery or with the use of minimally invasive techniques. Traditional open surgery can involve either a retroperitoneal approach or a transperitoneal approach. The minimally invasive approach can involve laparoscopy or the use of a robot. The main advantage of minimally invasive techniques is a shorter hospital stay, improved pain control, use of smaller incisions, and avoidance of postoperative wound complications. The division of the ligament is often combined with neurolysis of the celiac nerve plexus and may contribute to improved symptom relief. In selected patients, additional procedures (also called co-surgical procedures) may be pursued. These include celiac artery bypass (such as an aortoÂ celiac or aorto hepatic bypass), superior mesenteric artery transposition, splenic artery transposition, balloon angioplasty with or without stenting, and para-spinal ganglion nerve blocks. Angioplasty with or without stenting is typically reserved for refractory cases where the first-line surgical therapies may have proven unsuccessful in providing symptomatic relief.
