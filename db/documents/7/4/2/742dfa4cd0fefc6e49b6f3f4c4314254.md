Terbinafine is formulated as a 250 mg tablet to be taken by mouth. The routine dosing for dermatophyte infections is one tablet, by mouth, daily. The duration of therapy varies, with treatment lasting for six weeks for fingernail onychomycosis and up to 12 weeks for toenail onychomycosis. Absorption and bioavailability are similar, regardless of food intake. The clearance of terbinafine occurs through both the liver and kidneys. Terbinafine has an inhibitory effect on the hepatic CYP450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme, and monitoring for drug interactions is necessary.

Other dosing schedules that have notÂ received approval from the FDA include pulse-dose treatment with terbinafine. This treatment schedule can be performed in multiple ways but can consist of one 250 mg tablet per day for four weeks, with four weeks of no therapy, and the resumption of one 250 mg tablet per day for another four weeks. The efficacy of this treatment schedule has been demonstrated to be similar to continuous dosing.
