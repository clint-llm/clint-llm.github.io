The causes of pelvic floor dysfunction are not well understood. No specific inciting event or factor has been generally identified as an etiology of PFD, but multiple factors have been discussed. Hypertonicity symptoms associated with voiding and defecation difficulties might be related to learning poor evacuation techniques. Habitual efforts to avoid urination or bowel movements might be lifestyle attributing factors.

Sexual abuse has been associated with chronic pelvic pain.
