# Continuing Education Activity

Cognitive decline affects many individuals above the age of 60. Mild cognitive impairment and dementia, commonly Alzheimer dementia, can affect many cognitive domains and negatively impact the quality of life. A geriatric evaluation can differentiate normal aging and age-related cognitive decline. This activity describes the assessment, treatment, and management of cognitive decline and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, treating, and managing the patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the steps in the geriatric evaluation.
- Review the etiology of age-related cognitive decline.
- Outline the examination findings in geriatric patients with age-related cognitive decline.
- Summarize the management of age-related cognitive decline.

# Introduction

With the increasing aging population in our communities, clinicians have to tackle the challenge of managing patients with multiple comorbidities and pay special attention to caring for the geriatric population. A decline in cognition occurs with increasing age. It is important to understand age-related changes in cognition to separate normal aging from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. The expected changes in normal aging are a decline in processing speed and performance on complex tasks while maintaining simple attention tasks, a decline in auditory discrimination, and learning new information and prospective memory.

In contrast, procedural memory stays intact with aging. There is also a decline in the executive cognition function, which involves problem-solving and decision-making. Lastly, there is a waning of visuospatial processing and judgment with aging. But, the recognition of objects and gestures stays intact.

MCI is a reduced function in either one or more areas of memory, attention, language, and judgment.

The term dementia is used when the cognitive deficiencies become significantly greater and impact daily life. The possible triggers for initiating a geriatric assessment include age, cognitive changes, memory issues, increased frequency of falls, taking multiple medications, frailty, and concerns for safety at home.

The assessment is not beneficial to certain patients with a terminal illness, lack of complete functional independence, severe dementia, and those requiring nursing home placement.

# Etiology

Understanding the etiology of cognitive decline is challenging and involves a deeper understanding of how medical and non-medical factors interact. Age itself is a risk factor that constantly increases to the age of 80.

Patients belonging to lower socioeconomic status and with a lower educational background have a high risk of cognitive decline.

Some biomarkers linked with progression to AD are apolipoprotein E4 genotype (ApoE4), positron emission tomography showing tau deposition in the lateral temporal lobe, and low plasma amyloid-beta levels.

# Epidemiology

The number of elderly patients will increase by 21% in the next 50 years. The prevalence of cognitive decline, especially dementia, increases exponentially with age. In adults greater than 60 years of age, the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment is roughly between 7 to 25%. MCI is 3 to 4 times more prevalent than dementia.

Cognitive decline is seen greater in aging women than men partly due to the difference in life expectancy between the sexes. The incidence of dementia exponentially rises to the age of 85 and continues to increase thereafter.

# Pathophysiology

Many medical diseases share a positive association with MCI. Traumatic brain injury, stroke, Parkinson disease (PD), and Huntington disease are such examples.

Alzheimer disease results from years of amyloid-beta deposition, neuritic plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles.

# History and Physical

The common complaints that bring attention to cognitive decline are memory loss, a decline in daily functioning, confusion, deteriorating language skills, and changes in behavior.

As a result, the patient might have one or more of the following on physical examination: decreased hearing, decreased vision, psychomotor slowing, and decreased Achilles reflex. In normal aging, attention span, simple copy, procedural memory as well as remote memory stay intact while multitasking capability, learning of new information, time of reaction, cognitive processing speed, and language fluency decline.

Patients with MCI tend to be aware of their impaired memory and are commonly troubled by it. This awareness is lost in patients with dementia, particularly in AD.

Close friends and family members must be interviewed separately from the patient to gather collateral information. The progression from MCI to dementia is also considered when the number of family member and friend-reported symptoms is greater than the patient-reported symptoms.

The patient or family members might explain that the patient quickly forgets things, has trouble putting objects in the correct places at home, repeats stories and questions, has wording finding difficulty, others fill in missing words while the patient is speaking, has difficulty learning new routines, hyperorality, behavioral changes, and may have some delusions.

# Evaluation

The evaluation of age-related cognitive decline is limited by the lack of specific diagnostic tests, non-pathological changes in the brain, and difficulty in differentiating signs and symptoms from normal aging.

The diagnosis of MCI is based on subjective complaints, as mentioned earlier. At the initial visit, certain conditions must be investigated, such as polypharmacy, hypothyroidism, Vitamin B12 deficiency, hypo/hyperglycemia, sensory loss (hearing/vision), obstructive sleep apnea, and underlying infection.

After common medical conditions that could alter the mentation are ruled out, the proceeding step is to interview the patient, followed by an interview of family members and, if possible close friends.

A comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is a multidisciplinary and multimodal approach to evaluating a geriatric patient.

- History of presenting illness

- Medical history

- Current and previous medications

- Family history with an emphasis on cognitive issues

- Social history, including occupation, education level, living situation, substance use, and advanced care planning

- Physical examination

- Cognitive assessment

- Laboratory studies

- Review of imaging

- Interview family members

- Identifying other professionals involved in the patient’s care

Subsequently, the following core components must be investigated:

**Cognition**- The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) does not recommend screening for cognitive impairment in older patients due to a lack of evidence for harm and benefit.

There are many screening tests available, and they generally test 1 or more domains of cognition. The most commonly used screening tests are the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Mini-Cognitive Assessment (Mini-Cog).

Other tests are the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the clock drawing test (CDT), and the St. Louis University Mental Status Examination (SLUMS). One meta-analysis reveals that the sensitivity of MMSE, MoCA, and other screening tools is 75 to 92%, and the specificity is 81 to 91%.

Depending on the screening test used, the domains tested are language, executive function, abstract reasoning, attention and concentration, memory, and visuospatial skills.

Office staff can also be trained to administer these screening tests. It is important to note that not one test can diagnose dementia or MCI. A positive screen must be followed by a thorough investigation that must include screening for mental health, especially depression.

Mood and altered thought content can also negatively impact cognitive and memory performance. These tests can also keep track of cognitive impairment over time. The caregiver completes certain screening tests, such as the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in The Elderly (IQCODE) and Alzheimer Disease Caregiver Questionnaire (ADCQ).

Interviewing family members and close friends also increase the amount of data that can be used to assess the patient’s cognitive abilities, especially memory and personality changes.

**Functional ability**- There are two key allotments of functional ability. The first is activities of daily living (ADL) which includes self-care activities, such as dressing, ambulation and transfers, bathing, toileting, feeding, grooming, and controlling bladder function. The second allotment is instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) which includes activities that a patient performs for independent living, such as managing finances, taking medication, driving, cooking, shopping, housework, and answering the phone.

It is common to see dependency in IADLs than ADLs, and further loss of IADLs can impact independent living. However, impairment in ADLs can lead to a reduced quality of life and functional decline. It is no surprise that early intervention can reduce negative future outcomes. The standard screening tool for functional ability is the Katz ADL scale for ADLs and the Lawton IADL scale for IADLs.

**Falls, gait, and mobility assessment**- Falls are underreported to the clinicians by the elderly patients.

Gait should also be observed when the patient walks into the examination room by direct observation. The get-up and go-test evaluate a patient’s mobility and postural stability in addition to the gait. If the patient takes more than 12 seconds to complete the test, there is an increased risk of falls and functional decline. The office staff can also help the physician by administering this test. Direct observation is beneficial for identifying patients who might require assistive devices for ambulation and physical therapy for improving strength.

**Polypharmacy**- Certain medications can cause functional impairment in the elderly owing to their side effect profiles. The American Geriatrics Society (AGS) Beers Criteria lists certain medications that should be potentially avoided in older patients unless there is a specific indication for use.

Physicians should take the time to review the medication list of their patients, especially when there are multiple specialists involved in medical management. The use of anticholinergic medications, opiates, benzodiazepines, muscle relaxants, sleep medications, and tricyclic anti-depressants must be reevaluated regularly to prevent polypharmacy and avoid adverse outcomes.

Antihypertensive medications can also cause hypotension leading to falls. Other tools to address the appropriateness of prescriptions are the Screening Tool To Alert Doctors To The Right Treatment (START) and Screening Tool of Older Persons' Prescriptions (STOPP). It is important to consider the time to achieve the medical benefit, the patient’s ability to manage and take the medication, and overall treatment goals when addressing the relevance of a medication.

**Diet and nutrition**- It is vital to assess the patient's capacity to prepare their food, swallow, digest, and appetite level. Some objective measurements of nutrition include body mass index, height, and weight. Older individuals have reduced physiologic reserves, which puts them at increased risk for malnutrition, especially during an acute illness or hospitalization. One study showed that the body mass index under 23 kg/m² was associated with increased mortality.

Cognition, social, and financial factors must be taken into account for a patient who reports significant weight loss. It is equally important to assess for underlying medical issues and psychological causes. After a thorough investigation, a plan of care can be devised for the patient to address their nutrition status, and if needed, appetite stimulants can be considered if appropriate.

**Hearing -**Age-related hearing loss, also called presbycusis, is an important consideration when assessing an elderly patient as it can lead to poor performance on cognitive assessments, social isolation, misunderstanding, anxiety or depression, and cognitive fatigue from an assessment, increased effort from listening, and frailty.

The finger rub test whispered voice test, or an audiometric test can be used to assess for hearing impairment.

**Vision**- Age-related visual changes are expected in the geriatric population. Reduced vision can impact the quality of life and activities of daily living, which can further reduce the chances of independent living. With aging, the visual acuity under low illumination is reduced, leading to low spatial contrast sensitivity, reduced color discrimination, and poor adaptation to the dark.

Even though there is a lack of evidence for screening of vision loss by USPSTF and AAFP, vision testing can be done using a Snellen chart in the office. Some key aspects of visual assessment include testing the visual field, acuity, color and contrast discrimination, use of visual and non-visual cues, and patient’s assessment of lighting.

It is also essential to observe the patient for their ability to perform the ADLs and IADLs for comfort level, stressors, and safety. Adverse consequences of visual deficits include increased risk of falls, reduced accessibility, postural instability, and increased risk of an automobile collision.

**Screening for depression**- Normal aging does not include depression, and patients with depression have reduced function, poor appetite, sleep, and quality of life. They may also have multiple vague complaints, anxiety, preoccupation with finances, bodily function, and difficulty making decisions. Many studies have shown that depression affects cognitive impairment and memory, which is why any evaluation for them must have a screen for depression.

Depression is seen in almost 40% of elderly patients residing in nursing home settings, whereas it is seen between 4% and 9% of elderly patients living in a community.

**Urinary incontinence**- The incidence of urinary incontinence increase with age, and it does not come without repercussions. Some of them are urinary tract infections, decubitus ulcers, sepsis, and increased mortality.

A review of medications must also be performed to rule out any reversible causes. A screening questionnaire asking if the patient has lost control of their bladder in the last year and got wet, as well as asking if it has happened on more than six different days, is effective in identifying incontinence. It is also important to ask if the incontinence occurs with sneezing, coughing, or lifting. Other components of assessment include inquiry into previous urologic surgeries, fluid intake, and mobility.

**Socioenvironmental circumstances**- Understanding the social health of elderly patients is tied to their overall well-being. Social history involves assessing the informal needs of the patient at their place of residence, eligibility of care resources, support structure, community involvement, caregiver needs, exercise, and financial assessment.

Determining the most appropriate living arrangement is an important shared decision that usually occurs after home safety, injury risk, financial security, and caregiver support are well analyzed.

Caregivers should be screened for burnout, and if needed, alternative living arrangements and support group referrals should be made. Sexually transmitted infections and sexual activity are commonly missed on CGA. Similarly, sexual dysfunction and impotence also need to be discussed for potential treatment options.

Another important topic of inquiry is mistreatment. Elder abuse prevalence is about 10%, and women are more likely to be the victims of abuse than men. A shared living space with a spouse or adult children (the two most common abusers) is a risk factor, along with low income, isolation, and poor physical health.

Types of abuse include financial exploitation, physical, verbal, sexual, and neglect. There are many manifestations of abuse, such as the presence of abrasions, lacerations, fractures, subtle signs of intimidation by the caregiver, frequent urinary tract infections while in a living facility, failure to pay for medications or renew prescriptions, worsening of chronic medical conditions, presence of decubitus ulcers, signs of malnutrition, dehydration, and poor hygiene.

When abuse is suspected, the physician should seek support from law enforcement, social work, and protective services to report and intervene.

**Frailty**- Frailty is described as a state of reduced physiologic reserve that leads to a state of vulnerability to external stressors.

Frailty encompasses the physical, social, and cognitive aspects of the patient. The two common measures of frailty include frailty index and frailty phenotype. The five areas of assessment for frailty phenotype are weakness (grip strength lower than 20% at baseline), unintentional weight loss (>10 pounds in the prior year), poor endurance and energy (self-reported), slowness, and low physical activity.

The frailty index, which is a continuous scale based on the effect of functional, psychosocial, medical, and age-related deficits, can predict mortality better than the frailty phenotype.

Frailty can predict cognitive decline, and conversely, cognitive impairment can predict frailty.

**Advanced care planning (ACP)**- ACP is the process of identifying the patient’s goals and the extent of medical care in the future when the patient is unable to make a decision due to a serious illness. The key steps in the process are assessing the willingness of the patient, appointing surrogate decision-makers, articulating and documenting the patient’s values on medical care and quality of life, and translating those values and preferences into clinical management and treatment plans.

# Treatment / Management

Identifying and controlling the risk factors associated with cognitive impairment and dementia is key to planning a treatment plan for the patient.

Lifestyle modification has been shown to positively impact the risk of cognitive decline. Regular physical activity, engaging in cognitively stimulating activities, social activity, cessation of smoking, and healthy dietary habits have been linked to a reduced risk.

The Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study showed no significant difference in cognitive outcomes in the moderate-intensity exercise group and the health education control group. However, patients over 80 years and those with poor baseline physical activity had better cognition scores.

The Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) study revealed no difference in the incidence of dementia with the training of memory, reasoning, and speed of processing compared to the control group.

Cholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs), such as donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine, are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat mild to severe AD.

These medications should be cautiously used in patients with peptic ulcer disease, cardiac conduction disorders, and seizures. The risk of heart block must be assessed in all patients before initiating AChEIs with an electrocardiogram. Setting expectations with the patient at the beginning of the treatment prevents disappointment and establish realistic goals. The efficacy of the medication is determined 2 to 3 months after starting the medication with a reevaluation of cognition and function. These medications are not shown to delay the onset of dementia in patients with MCI.

Antagonists to N-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA), such as memantine, are another class of FDA-approved medication to treat moderate to severe AD. These medications prevent activation of the NMDAR (NMDA receptor) glutamate receptor to prevent cell death from calcium influx. The most common side effect of memantine is confusion and drowsiness.

It is important to note that even though AChEIs and NMDAs have therapeutic effects, they only help treat the symptoms and do not prevent or cure AD.

Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) target underlying mechanisms that damage a nerve cell. There are a few ongoing clinical trials that allow DMT (aducanumab, gantenerumab, and solanezumab) to be add-on therapies to either cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine.

Despite innovation, many new drugs fail phase III trials upon failure to meet the endpoint targets. Continued investigations into combination therapies, repurposing existing drugs, and DMTs add-on to standard-of-care are needed to meet the challenge of treating AD.

**Modifying other risk factors**- On cessation of smoking, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are reduced. Similarly, on stopping alcohol, there is a reduced risk of nutritional deficiency and alcohol-related neuron damage. Avoid ototoxic medications, clear out tympanic canal sediment in the clinic, assistive hearing devices, and audit rehabilitation can address hearing loss.

Treatment of depression can significantly improve the quality of life and function in the elderly population. Treatment options for depression are multimodal and not limited to psychosocial therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, medications, and electroconvulsive therapy.

Reducing the risk factors of MCI can slow the progression of AD-related dementia and delay mortality.

# Differential Diagnosis

As previously discussed, certain common clinical conditions can present in an uncommon manner that can be confused with primary cognitive impairment or functional change. An infection, whether urinary, respiratory, or from a wound, can cause functional change, altered mental status, or worsening falls.

Similarly, hypothyroidism, depression, vitamin B12, frailty, and electrolyte abnormalities combined with existing comorbidities can complicate the presentation of a new problem. Thus, a careful clinical assessment, close management of existing medical problems, and identification of reversible causes are important.

# Prognosis

It is important to note that not all patients with MCI will progress to dementia. According to some estimates, about 30 to 50% of patients with MCI return to normal cognitive function within one year from the initial presentation.

A study using data from the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center showed that the annual progression probability from normal cognition to MCI varied from 4 to 10% from underlying AD.

Another study investigated individuals with positive amyloid pathology and showed that there was about a 40.8% probability of transitioning from asymptomatic to MCI-AD stage with a 5.3% probability of annual reversion back to the asymptomatic stage.

Some favorable factors encouraging the possible return to normal cognition include successful treatment of depression, lack of ApoE4, higher scores on cognitive testing, and greater hippocampal volume seen on imaging.

# Complications

Complications of cognitive impairment include the inability to perform daily tasks of living, increased risk for infection, behavioral disturbances (hallucinations and psychosis with severe dementia), frequent falls, increased mortality, and personality changes.

As dementia progresses, individuals with cognitive impairment experience difficulties eating and swallowing and are at risk for aspiration. Functional disability can also restrict the patient from using utensils correctly, and likewise, depression can limit food intake.

Worsening agitation can be problematic to the patient as well as the caregivers. The possibility of environmental factors must be investigated first before any intervention. Excessive noise, uncomfortable temperature, and restraints can escalate behavioral disturbance.

Another common factor is unrecognized pain, as individuals with advanced cognitive impairment or dementia may not be able to verbally express discomfort. Addressing any potentiating factor is the key treatment.

Constant supervision and frequent assistance with activities and dealing with hallucinations, paranoia, and anger from the patient can contribute to caregiver burnout.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

As the population ages, physicians should pay careful attention to their elderly patient panel. Avoidance of polypharmacy, assessment of falls, frailty, mood, and function are some of the key topics to address at each clinic visit. A comprehensive geriatrics assessment can be broken down into multiple visits to account for time constraints.

Early detection of cognitive impairment opens the opportunity to initiate investigation and interventions to prevent progression to dementia. A holistic overview of the patient’s care and treatment goals will prevent unnecessary medical interventions. Conservative measures such as restricted diets and screening procedures with frequent blood draws can often precipitate behavioral disturbances in the elderly population and are inappropriate for patients with advanced dementia.

Frequent counseling, access to community resources, and social support groups must be offered to the patient and the caregiver.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Geriatric care and management of a patient with cognitive impairment is an interprofessional effort. While it is essential to recognize that different specialties focus on different problems, maximum benefit is achieved when multiple assessments are synthesized into a coherent plan.

Coordination and clear communication must be established with physicians, nurses, healthcare agencies, pharmacists, and others who are involved in the patient care. Safety planning and assessment of the living situation can be performed by involving a social worker.

Using a common centralized electronic record system between specialties to organize appointments and medications is important to prevent adverse outcomes and helps maintain adherence.
