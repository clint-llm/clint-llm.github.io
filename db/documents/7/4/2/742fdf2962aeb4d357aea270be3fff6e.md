Studies have found that misdiagnosis occurred 18.3% of the time in patients with lung torsion. Most of the differentials can be excluded by CT scan, CT angiography, or bronchoscopy from the abnormal lobular placement. Diagnosis is confirmed with the vascular obstruction and airway obstruction seen on the CT scan. Differential diagnosis of lung torsion includes the following:

- Hemothorax

- Hemorrhage

- Pneumonia (infectious versus aspiration)

- Contusion (after sub-lobar resection - can appear like airspace consolidation that resolves after a few days)

- Lung gangrene

- Parenchymal infection

- Atelectasis

- Tumor

- Loculated effusion

- Emphysema

- Inadvertent ligation of the hilum

- Diaphragmatic herniation

- Leakage of the anastomosis site
