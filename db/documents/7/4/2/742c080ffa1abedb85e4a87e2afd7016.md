Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is the most common histological subtype and accounts for 50-60% of total renal sarcomas. However, renal leiomyosarcoma is still a remarkably rare tumor.

There is no consensus on the role of neoadjuvant or adjuvant radio/chemotherapy in the management of renal LMS.

If protocol therapy is not available or the patient is not eligible, the treatment approach differs based upon grade and histology. For patients with intermediate and high-grade tumors, large tumors, and the risk of distant metastatic disease is high, then preoperative radiotherapy (RT) alone, preoperative chemotherapy (with postoperative RT), or preoperative chemoradiotherapy are all acceptable options. Responders to neoadjuvant treatments tend to do better than nonresponders, whether this reflects the impact of chemotherapy/RT or disease biology. In patients with large, high-grade leiomyosarcomas and dedifferentiated liposarcomas, the addition of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to surgery is being investigated in a randomized trial (STRASS-2) conducted by the European organization for research and treatment of cancer (EORTC).

Neoadjuvant radiotherapy is generally administered while it is not indicated postoperatively in R0 (tumor resection with negative macro and microscopic margins). Adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended in cases of R2 resections (tumors with positive macro and microscopic resection margins) as well as in unresectable and metastatic disease.
