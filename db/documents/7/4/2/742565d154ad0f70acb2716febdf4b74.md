The prognosis of amblyopia is dependent if it is treated at an early age and the severity of amblyopia. Amblyopia has significant morbidity and is a common cause of monocular decreased vision. At least 75% of children treated with occlusion therapy do show a good return of vision. However, in at least 50% of children, there is a slight decrease in visual acuity over time. The best outcomes are in children who are referred early in life. However, in many cases, the actual real-life images may be slightly altered in many children as they grow.
