As discussed above, the main differential diagnosis is exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB). EIB symptoms are usually expiratory, occur later during exercise, and respond to bronchodilators. Also, expiratory wheezing is more characteristic of EIB.

Chest tightness and dyspnea are also seen in some cardiac diseases as well as anxiety attacks.

Anatomical abnormalities of the larynx and trachea are also on the differential. This includes subglottic stenosis, laryngeal or tracheal compression due to a mass, tracheal ring, or sling.
