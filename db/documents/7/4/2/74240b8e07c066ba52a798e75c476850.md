Pimavanserin is an atypical antipsychotic that received FDA approval in the U.S. in 2016 for hallucinations and delusions that accompany Parkinson disease psychosis (PDP).

In addition to Parkinson disease, psychotic symptoms can also manifest in different subtypes of dementia. At present, there are no FDA-approved agents indicated for dementia-related psychosis (DRP). Pimavanserin is under evaluation for its potential use in DRP.

In a study examining the discontinuation rate of patients with PDP or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) given either pimavanserin or quetiapine, the discontinuation rate of patients treated with pimavanserin was lower earlier on and higher later on in comparison to quetiapine.

Researchers further observed that there was a consequential improvement in social functioning and negative symptoms.
