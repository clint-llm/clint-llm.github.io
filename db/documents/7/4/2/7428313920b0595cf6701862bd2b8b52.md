The clinical presentation of idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH) varies from an acute onset illness with hemoptysis and dyspnea to a chronic cough and dyspnea to repetitive hemoptysis with fatigue, anemia, and slowly progressive dyspnea. In some cases, asymptomatic anemia is the only finding present. In adults, respiratory symptoms tend to be more prominent; however, children present with failure to thrive and anemia.

IPH presents in two phases. The first as an acute phase corresponds with intra-alveolar bleeding episodes associated with cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and potentially respiratory failure. The second chronic phase is characterized by the slow resolution of previous symptoms with or without treatment.

Patients who present in the acute phase of the disease show a wide variety of signs and symptoms, including but not limited to respiratory failure, cough, hemoptysis, and worsening anemia. However, many patients may present with a normal physical exam. Rapid asphyxiation due to massive pulmonary hemorrhage has also been reported. Generally, patients who present in the chronic phase of the disease demonstrate exam findings of pallor, emaciation, hepato-splenomegaly, failure to thrive, or even a completely normal exam. In patients with fibrosis, bilateral crackles and finger clubbing may also be present.
