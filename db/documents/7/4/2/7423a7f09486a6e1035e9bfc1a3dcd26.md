Females with endometrial carcinoma most commonly present with postmenopausal bleeding. In premenopausal women, intermenstrual bleeding and irregular menstrual cycles can also be symptoms of endometrial cancer. In a recent study by Megan A Clarke, 34,432 patients with postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) were analyzed. The pooled prevalence of PMB in women positive for endometrial cancer was 91%.

Other important symptoms include vague abdominal pain, pelvic discomfort, nausea, and dysuria. When the tumor has metastasized to other parts of the body, weight loss, anorexia, and changes in bowel and bladder habits may also occur. On physical examination, the patient may appear pale due to the loss of blood caused by abnormal uterine bleeding. The abdominal exam may be normal if the uterus is small in size and non-tender. On vaginal examination, bloody vaginal discharge or blood clots may be present in the vaginal canal.Â  In the case of uterine sarcoma, postmenopausal bleeding, pelvic pressure, and ascites may be the first presenting complaints. On abdominal examination, the uterus is enlarged and may be tender.
