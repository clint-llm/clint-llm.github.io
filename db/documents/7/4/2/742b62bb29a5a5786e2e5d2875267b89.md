All eye structures, except for the eyelids and conjunctiva, are supplied by branches of the internal carotid artery. The external carotid artery supplies the eyelids and conjunctiva. The internal carotid artery has many branches;Â one is the ophthalmic artery. This artery branches into the posterior ciliary, retinal, and muscular arteries. These arteries supply blood to the ciliary bodies, retina, and muscles, respectively. The central retinal artery is a branch of ophthalmic artery which runs within the optic nerve.
