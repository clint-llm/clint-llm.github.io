Treatment of thrombi could reduce the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and pulmonary embolism. There are no standardized guidelines for the treatment of mural thrombi. Heparin and warfarin are often used to inhibit the initiation and propagation of existing thrombi. Heparin binds to and activates the enzyme inhibitor antithrombin 3, and warfarin inhibits vitamin K epoxide reductase, both enzymes are needed to produce clotting factors. Heparin is a preferred drug for dissolving the clot. If thrombi do not resolve after two weeks of heparin therapy, then surgery is an option. Thrombolytic therapy is another option for clot dissolution. It includes streptokinase, urokinase, reteplase, and tenecteplase. These are usually administered intravenously. Surgical candidates include younger patients, those having a low risk of perioperative complications, those in whom conservative treatment is unsuccessful, and those who have a highly mobile thrombus with high embolic risk. The surgical procedure includes thrombectomy, segmental aortic resection, thromboaspiration, and endoluminal stent-grafts. No approach is definitively superior. Endoluminal stent grafting is the least invasive option, but it carries a high risk of distal embolization through wire manipulation and stent deployment.
