The crystalline lens is an avascular structure. It derives nutrition mainly from intraocular fluids. In complicated cataracts, the metabolism of the lens is deranged due to the diffusion of toxins released in the ocular fluids either due to inflammation or degenerative conditions. The posterior capsule of the lens is thin and lacks epithelial support; hence the toxins diffuse posteriorly, leading to the development of opacification in the posterior pole at the earliest stage. A posteriorÂ subcapsular cataract is the commonest manifestation of complicated cataracts.
