Lead is most commonly absorbed via contact with the skin and mucosal surfaces, by the GI tract after ingestion, and in the lungs after inhalation. Initially, absorbed lead has a high affinity for red blood cells (approximately 99% of lead is bound to erythrocytes) and, therefore, early on has a relatively low volume of distribution.

The half-life of lead in the fast compartments (blood and soft tissue) is 1 to 2 months but might be decades in the slow compartment (bone). Clearance rates are also dependent on whole blood lead levels. Lead is primarily excreted renally, with about 70% being cleared in the urine.
