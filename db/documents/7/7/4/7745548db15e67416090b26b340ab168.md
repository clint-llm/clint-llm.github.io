Predisposing high-risk factors for non-traumatic aortic dissection include:

- Hypertension (occurs in 70% of patients with distal Standford type B AAD)

- An abrupt, transient, severe increase in blood pressure (e.g., strenuous weight lifting and use of sympathomimetic agents such as cocaine, ecstasy, or energy drinks)

- Genetic conditions including Marfan syndrome (In an IRAD review, Marfan syndrome was present in 50% of those under age 40, compared with only 2% of older patients), Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Turner syndrome, and bicuspid aortic valve, coarctation of the aorta. In patients with Marfan syndrome, cystic medial necrosis is seen in the tissues

- Pre-existing aortic aneurysm

- Atherosclerosis

- Pregnancy and delivery (risk compounded in pregnant women with connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome)

- Family history

- Aortic instrumentation or surgery (coronary artery bypass, aortic or mitral valve replacement, and percutaneous stenting or catheter insertion)

- Inflammatory or infectious diseases that cause vasculitis (syphilis, cocaine use)
