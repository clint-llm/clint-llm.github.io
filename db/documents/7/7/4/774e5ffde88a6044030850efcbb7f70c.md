In the acute setting, the patient complains of burning sensation in skin associated with some pain, usually without any triggering factor. Fever and general debility accompany the appearance of pustules. A few individuals complain of joint pains.

Following are the clinical subtypes based on morphology and natural history:

- The most acute and extreme form of pustular psoriasis is von Zumbusch. It has been given this name after Leo von Zumbusch who described the disease in two siblings, caused by some topical treatment. Diagnosis is based upon clinical features and abnormal laboratory studies (leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or C-reactive protein) along with histopathological evidence of spongiform pustules.

- Early onset plaque psoriasis may develop into pustular psoriasis after years, the cause usually being steroids or any other environmental factor or the onset maybe de novo, usually after an infection. In either form, the earliest symptom is burning sensation in the skin, which becomes dry and tender. These danger signs, not found in all cases, are followed by a sudden onset of high fever and severe malaise. Pre-existing lesions develop into minute pustules. Worsening of erythema occurs, and pustules spread to involve the previously normal skin, mostly the flexures and genital regions. Pustules may be in the form of discrete pustules, lakes of pus, circinate lesions, erythematous plaques covered with pustules, or a generalized erythroderma. Pustules appear in a series, and dried pustules start exfoliating. The nail changes include thickening and subungual areas of pus. The oral mucosa and tongue may also be involved. The disease process may resolve within a few days or weeks; psoriasis can revert backÂ to its normal state or erythroderma can develop.

- A rare subacute form represents generalized pustular psoriasis in infancy and early childhood. The disease starts as discrete areas of erythema which become elevated. Pustules appear peripherally on the advancing edge, becoming dry and shedding in the form of scales as the lesion gradually progresses. There are no accompanying systemic symptoms.

- Impetigo herpetiformis represents widespread pustular psoriasis occurring in pregnancy. Onset is usually in the third trimester of pregnancy, but may be earlier, and has been documented in the first month of pregnancy and in the first day of the puerperium. The disease often persists until the child is born and may last after childbirth. It is characterized by salient features of generalized pustular psoriasis, usually starting from flexural surfaces as symmetrical, confluent areas of pustulation. The outbreak of lesions begins in the groin region and other flexures, with small pustules appearing on an inflamed skin. These spread radially, become dry in the center, or form plaques which may become widespread and leave a reddish brown pigmentation as they heal. The tongue, oral cavity, and even the esophagus may be involved, with erosions following pustules.

- Complications include delirium, gastrointestinal upset, tetany, cardiac or renal failure, and ultimately death. The risks of placental insufficiency include stillbirth, neonatal death, or fetal abnormalities and are directly proportional to the severity and chronicity of the disease. The disease recurs in next pregnancies and on subsequent use of oral contraceptives.

- In 30% of cases, the onset of the disease occurs in the first year of life. The disease may start in the first few weeks of life and may be present congenitally.

In infants, systemic symptoms are often absent, and the disease may require no treatment. Pustular psoriasis may be limited to flexural areas, such as the neck, for prolonged periods. More severe forms with systemic involvement require active management.

In children, the age of onset is mostly 2 to 10 years. The lesions may be of von Zumbusch pattern, but annular and circinate forms are more common. Attacks may settle within a few days, but relapses with inflammatory episodes may occur. In older children, the disease resembles that in the adult and may take any pattern.
