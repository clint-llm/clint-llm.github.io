The diaphragm has 3 major openings and 5 minor openings.

**Major**

- The vena caval trunk lies at the level of the T8 vertebra in the central tendon. It allows passage of Inferior vena cava and some branches of the right phrenic nerve.

- The esophageal hiatus lies at the level of the T10 vertebra in a sling of muscle fibers derived from the right crus at the left of the median plane. It allows passage of esophagus, the right and left vagus trunks, the esophageal branches of the left gastric vessels, and the lymph vessels.

- The aortic hiatus lies anterior to the body of the T12 vertebra between the crura. It allows passage of aorta, thoracic duct, and azygos vein.

**Minor**

- The lesser aperture of right crus (permits lesser and greater splanchnic nerves)

- The lesser aperture of left crus (permits hemiazygous vein; and lesser and greater splanchnic nerves)

- The sympathetic trunk runs posteriorly below the medial lumbocostal arches.

- Foramen of Morgagni is found in the areolar tissue between the sternal and costal part of diaphragm contains the superior epigastric branch of the internal thoracic artery and the lymphatics of the abdominal wall.

- The medial and lateral lumbocostal arches can contain areolar tissue that, when present, separates the superior and posterior surface of a kidney from the pleura.

The figure below shows the openings in the diaphragm: A=vena cava, B=esophagus, C=aorta. The muscular diaphragm surrounds the central tendon in the periphery.
