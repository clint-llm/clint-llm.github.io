Frailty is a multidimensional geriatric syndrome characterized by an increased vulnerability to various stressors. Frailty is strongly linked to adverse outcomes, including mortality, admission to nursing homes, falls, and delirium. The Clinical Frailty Scale is a well-validated scale used to quantify the degree of disability from frailty. This activity reviews the clinical frailty of geriatric patients and highlights the role of the Clinical Frailty Scale for use by clinicians in evaluating a patient for frailty.

**Objectives:**
- Describe frailty as a geriatric syndrome.
- Outline the risk factors for developing frailty. 
- Identify the various components of the Clinical Frailty Scale.
- Summarize the clinical significance of the Clinical Frailty Scale.
