Axial flaps are indicated for one-stage reconstruction of wounds when a large amount of skin is needed to fill a defect following trauma or mass resection. There are various areas from which axial flaps can be taken. The recipient site must be healthy and without any infection indications; however, granulation tissue does not have to be present. Unlike grafts, the flap carries its own blood supply and does not require a vascular bed. Advantages of axial flaps include a greater width to length ratio versus random pattern flaps, full-thickness coverage, durable skin, and excellent cosmetic results. Due to these flaps' predictable vascular supply, they can provide durable full-thickness skin, which can result in minimal scar tissue and near-normal hair growth.
