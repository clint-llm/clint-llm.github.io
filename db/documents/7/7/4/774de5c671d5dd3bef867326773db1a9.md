The talus is innervated on the medial side by the posterior tibial nerve and saphenous nerve, while the deep peroneal nerve innervates the dorsal aspect of the talus. The dorsolateral aspect of the talus is innervated by the medial dorsal cutaneous branch of the superficial peroneal nerve, while the lateral side of the talus receives innervation from the intermediate dorsal cutaneous branch of the superficial peroneal nerve.
