ION is the most common subtype of POVL in most patients. Consequently, in most patients, an effective treatment has not been discovered, and the prognosis is poor.

Subtypes of POVL with a more favorable outcome, unfortunately, include the less common causes of POVL, which include pituitary apoplexy, cortical blindness secondary to PRES, and corneal abrasion. Most patients with pituitary apoplexy who undergo surgery within 48 hours of the presentation will improve visual deficits.

The prognosis of cortical vision loss depends on the extent of cerebral ischemia. In PRES, a typically reversible condition is not characterized by extensive ischemia but rather subcortical edema. Therefore, complete resolutionÂ results in most patients.
