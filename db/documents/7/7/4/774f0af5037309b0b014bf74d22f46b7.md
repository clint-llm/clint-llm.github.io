Successful treatment of ITBS is only possible through an interprofessional approach. Patients with ITBS often present initially to their primary careÂ clinician and nonoperative treatment can be started at that time before seeing an orthopedic surgeon. Physical therapy is imperative to strengthening the abductors, loosening the ITB tension, and teaching proper biomechanics during the activity. The sport-specific trainers must also be knowledgeable on how to prevent or minimize activities that are at high risk for developing this syndrome. Open communication with the patient, physical therapist, and treating clinician is imperative to limit progression or relapse of the disease.

To summarize, ITBS requires an interprofessional team approach, including clinicians, specialists, physical therapists, specialty-trained nurses, and occasionally pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. [Level 5]
