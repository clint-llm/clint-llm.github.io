Patients on systemic corticosteroids, those who are hospitalized, and those with neutropenia have a poor prognosis when combined with B. cereus bacteremia. Patients with hematologic malignancies and neutropenia, along with B. cereus infections, have a worse prognosis, which improves with the resolution of neutropenia.B. cereus bacteremia noted primary symptom presentation to be neurologic symptoms rather than gastrointestinal. Moreover, they noted these infections to be related to central venous catheters.Â Of the 12 patients in this case series, four died of B. cereus septicemia. They noted delayed initiation of appropriate antibiotics, liver dysfunction, and evidence of central nervous system involvement with a poor and fatal prognosis.B. cereus infection in the neonatal period has been associated with a poor outcome despite timely antibiotic therapy.
