Several variantsÂ of the latissimus dorsi may occur. A muscular arch may exist between the axillary border of the latissimus dorsi extending anteriorly to the axillary vessels and nerves and joining with the tendon of the pectoralis major, coracobrachialis, or the fascia of the biceps brachii. Also, a fibrous connection may exist between the tendon of the latissimus dorsi near its insertion site and the long head of the triceps brachii. Other variations may occur, but the listed ones are the most common.
