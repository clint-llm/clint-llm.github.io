While the exact mechanism of action is unknown, prostaglandin E2 causes contractions in the myometrium via direct stimulation.  It binds to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) EP1-4 that lead to a variety of downstream events depending on the EP subtype and cell-type-specific expression patterns.

The role of prostaglandin E2 in inflammation is complex; it has demonstrated pro-inflammatory activity in specific settings and plays an anti-inflammatory role in others.
