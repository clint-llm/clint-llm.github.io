Evaluation of patients with nocturnal headaches must include ruling out conditions like cerebral tumors, giant cell arteritis, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and other sleeping disorders.

MRI brain with/without contrast is needed for patients to rule out any structural abnormality like tumors, etc. Overnight polysomnography (sleep) study is necessary to rule out OSA and other sleeping disorders. Once any organic cause of the headache is ruled out, the diagnosis is mostly clinical based on the ICHD-3 diagnostic criteria. MRI brain may also show grey matter volume reduction in the hypothalamus.
