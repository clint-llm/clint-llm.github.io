There are two acceptable techniques for collecting the Pap Smear: liquid-based and conventional. A clinician will place a speculum into the woman's vagina and identify the cervix. The liquid-based method involves collecting cells from the transformation zone of the cervix by using a brush and transferring the cells to a vial of liquid preservative.  The conventional technique involves collecting cells from the transformation zone of the cervix by using a brush and spatula, transferring the cells to a slide, and fixing the slide with a preservative.  The liquid-based technique allows testing for HPV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia from a single collection. Theoretically, the liquid-based technique has the advantages of easier interpretation, fewer unsatisfactory results, and the filtering of blood and debris.
