The standard of care of anesthesia monitoring is employed when using opioid anesthetics, including ECG, pulse oximetry, end-tidal CO2,Â respiratory rate, ventilation volume and pressures, and blood pressure. The more severe adverse effects that require monitoring include bradycardia, hypotension, and depressed respiratory drive. All of these are already monitored under the standard of care. Monitoring can also involve assessing intraoperative nociception to optimize opioid dosing, using the lowest possible dose to achieve the needed effect.
