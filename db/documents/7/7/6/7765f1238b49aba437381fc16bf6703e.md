**Method of Auscultation**

The examination is preferably performed in a quiet room. Both the patient and the examiner should be comfortable and relaxed. The patient is in the sitting position. Ideally, the cone-shaped long and narrow bell of Ford-Bowles stethoscope should be used to listen to the faint sound of ocular bruit. However, the bell of the modern stethoscope is also usable. The patient should fix the gaze of their open eye of the patient on a distant object or one of the examiner's fingers. The bell of the stethoscope should be kept over the closed eye gently and firmly. The patient should not move the eyeball or eyelids during auscultation. The patient is requested to hold breath during auscultation. The contralateral carotid pulse is used to know the timing of the bruit. Valsalva maneuver may be used to accentuate the bruit.
