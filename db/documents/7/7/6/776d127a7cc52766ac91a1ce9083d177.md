Here are some important points to take into consideration:

- Intention tremor is defined as a rhythmic, oscillatory, and high amplitude tremor during a directed and purposeful motor movement, worsening before reaching the endpoint.

- Incidence of intention tremor is challenging to ascertain, but the most common cause is essential tremor and physiological tremor (caused by stress, fear, anger).

- Feedback and feedforward centers are impaired, leading to deficits in fine motor movement, coordination, precision, and poor communication between tracts affecting the somatosensory, motor, and cerebellar function.

- It is associated with damage to the superior cerebellar peduncle, dentate nucleus, and surrounding cerebellar tracts in the brainstem and the thalamus.

- Intention tremors may be accompanied by other cerebellar dysfunction symptoms, including difficulties with activities of daily living (drinking from a cup, grabbing utensils, ambulating independently, eye-object coordination), nystagmus, slow saccades, dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesia, hypotonia, proprioception deficits, hyperreflexia, and ataxic gait.

- Treatment usually consists of treating the underlying cause of the tremor. Physical and gait rehabilitation can be useful for the recovery of functional activities.
