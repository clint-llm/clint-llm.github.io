Although there is a wide differential for the causes of WCT, the prognosis of all these etiologies is dependent on the duration of the arrhythmia, how it affected the hemodynamic stability of the patient during the episode, and if the patient had any subsequent complications from the event. Patients who are hemodynamically stable on initial presentation and their WCT is quickly terminated typically tend to have a better prognosis than those who are unstable because of the lower incidence of complications. Prognosis is also dependent on preventing the recurrence of WCT. Patients with a history of VT (or at increased risk for it) may be eligible for placement of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) devices, which can help improve morbidity and mortality. Catheter ablation is also another potential treatment option for some etiologies of WCT, which can improve prognosis. Myocardial infarction is a potential complication during a WCT event, which can further worsen a patient’s prognosis due to the increased risk for sudden death. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is strongly associated with a patient’s prognosis and can help determine those who are at risk for sudden cardiac death. Patients with an LVEF of < 30% are considered to have an overall annual mortality rate that approaches 10%.
