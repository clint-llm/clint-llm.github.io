Tetanus is a serious life-threatening infection that is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The best way to manage tetanus is to prevent it in the first place. Public health nurses, pharmacists, and primary care clinicians need to educate patients on the importance of childhood tetanus vaccination. Patients should be educated about how tetanus is acquired and when they should seek medical assistance. The key is to see a clinician as soon as possible. Healthcare workers should develop aseptic techniques when doing procedures and emergency room personnel should always ask patients if they have had tetanus immunization. Anytime a nurse manages a wound, he or she should always ask the patient if he or she is up to date with tetanus vaccination. Only through open communication and creating awareness of the morbidity of tetanus can the outcomes be improved

The prognosis of patients infected with C.Tetani depends on the time of presentation, the inoculation dose, and the time to the first tetanic spasm. Overall, patients who develop tetanus quickly have a poor prognosis. Those who survive tetanus, may have some residual deficits but the life span is not reduced. However, some patients may have hypotonia for life. Despite active infection, no immunity is created and the patients need active immunization to prevent a recurrence.
