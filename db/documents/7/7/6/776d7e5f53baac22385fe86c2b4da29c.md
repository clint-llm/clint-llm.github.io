The etiology of infective endocarditis has its basis on whether the valve is native or prosthetic and for prosthetic valve endocarditis, the etiology is dependent upon the timing with the early phase defined as less than two months and the late phase defined as greater than 12 months. The native valve infective endocarditis is most commonly caused by Streptococcus viridans and Staphylococcus aureus. For the early phase, prosthetic valve endocarditis causative agents include coagulase-negative staphylococci (Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Staphylococcus aureus whereas for the late phase the key culprits include Streptococcus viridans and Staphylococcus aureus. Enterococci enter the bloodstream as a consequence of gastrointestinal or genitourinary tracts manipulation. Streptococcus bovis and Clostridium
septicum are associated with colonic malignancies whereas HACEK group agents (Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter (previously Actinobacillus), Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, Kingella) infect patients with poor dental hygiene or from needle contaminate with saliva in intravenous drug users. Fungal endocarditis is the gravest form of infective endocarditis, and the risk factors include prosthetic heart valves, intravenous drug use, and an immunocompromised state.
