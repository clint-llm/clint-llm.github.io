Videostroboscopy is the most commonly used method to visualize vocal fold vibration and is an essential tool for voice assessment. Recordings of the vocal fold vibration pattern are analyzed and shared with a speech-language pathologist to guide treatment. Videostroboscopy can also be used to monitor disease processes as well as assess pre- and post-operative outcomes. This activity reviews the videostroboscopic evaluation of the larynx and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating patients with dysphonia.

**Objectives:**
- Review the mechanism by which videostroboscopy provides improved dynamic visualization of the glottis.
- Identify the indications for videostroboscopy.
- Describe the components of the mucosal wave that can be visualized with videostroboscopy.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies that can improve patient care and outcomes for individuals who undergo an assessment with videostroboscopy.
