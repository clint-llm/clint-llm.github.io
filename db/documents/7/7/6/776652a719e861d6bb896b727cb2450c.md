The outcomes of a trapped lung depend on the underlying cause. To improve outcomes, prompt consultation with a pulmonologist, thoracic surgeon, and/or an intervention radiologist is highly recommended. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for trapped lung when they come across a case of chronic stable pleural effusion with no apparent diagnosis. Radiologists play a vital role in identifying the presence of thickened rind of visceral pleura on imaging studies. Patient education is extremely important and an interdisciplinary discussion must be held with the patient and their caregivers for better outcomes. In patients with underlying malignancy oncologists and surgical pathologists must be involved in the care of these patients.
