Qualitative and semi-quantitative examinations are those that give non-numerical results. Qualitative examinations measure the presence or absence of a substance or evaluate cellular characteristics such as morphology. Semi-quantitative examinations provide an estimate of how much of the measured substance is present.

Positive and negative controls are recommended for many qualitative and semi-quantitative tests, including procedures that use special stains or reagents and tests with endpoints such as agglutination or color change. These controls should generally be used with each test run. The use of controls will also help to validate a new lot number of test kits or reagents, to check on temperatures of storage and testing areas, and to evaluate the process when new testing personnel is carrying out the testing.

The laboratory must establish a quality control program for its qualitative and semi-quantitative tests.

When utilizing traditional controls for qualitative or semi-quantitative tests, take in mind the following: Test control materials in the same manner as testing patient samples; use a positive and negative control, preferably once each day of testing, or at least as often as recommended by the manufacturer; choose positive controls that are close to the cut-off value of the test, to be sure the test can detect weak positive reactions; and for agglutination procedures, include a weak positive control as well as a negative control and stronger positive control.

The laboratory must participate in the external quality control or proficiency testing (PT) program because it is a regulatory requirement published by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) regulations. It is helpful to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the laboratory compared to other laboratories performing the same or comparable assays. Required participation and scored results are monitored by CMS and voluntary accreditation organizations.

Consider all specimens, control materials, and calibrator materials as potentially infectious. Exercise the normal precautions required for handling all laboratory reagents. Disposal of all waste material should be in accordance with local guidelines. Wear gloves, a lab coat, and safety glasses when handling human blood specimens. Place all plastic tips, sample cups, and gloves that come into contact with blood in a biohazard waste container.
