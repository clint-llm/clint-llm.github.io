The diagnosis of dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy is challenging without a known family history of the disease. Clinical symptoms can mimic other familial degenerative or acquired ataxic disorders.Â An extensive metabolic and genetic workup can be helpful if the diagnosis is unclear. Advanced imaging, along with cerebrospinal fluid and serum studies, may also help rule out other disorders.

Differential diagnoses for adult-onset DRPLA include:

- Huntington disease

- Spinocerebellar ataxia

- Atypical parkinsonism with cerebellar ataxia

- Alcohol

- Toxic/metabolic induced ataxias

- Ataxic paraneoplastic syndromes

Differentials for juvenile-onset DRPLA are broad and include:

- Familial essential myoclonus and epilepsy

- Progressive myoclonic epilepsy

- Lafora disease

- Unverricht-Lundborg disease

- Infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy

- Neuroferritinopathy

- Myoclonus epilepsy associated with ragged red fibers

- Heoxosaminidase A deficiency

- Neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis

- Gaucher disease

- Sialidosis

- Galactosialidosis
