Nursing can educate patients about the signs and symptoms of allergies and avoid triggers. The pharmacist can educate the patients about drugs that can trigger drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions. Clinicians, including nurse practitioners, may participate in the proper diagnosis. An allergist/immunologist may useÂ the basophil activation test (BAT) and skin tests to evaluate IgE-mediated allergic reactions to food, insect, drugs, and chronic urticaria.
