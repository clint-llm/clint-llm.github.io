Streptomycin is the first discovered aminoglycoside antibiotic, originally isolated from the bacteria Streptomyces griseus. It is now primarily used as part of the multi-drug treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. It has additional activity against several aerobic gram-negative bacteria. This activity will discuss the indications, mechanism of action, and contraindications of using streptomycin in both children and adults. It will also describe the administration, dosing, and monitoring of streptomycin. Additionally, it will touch on the adverse event profile and other key factors to keep in mind as a healthcare team when using streptomycin as an antibiotic agent to treat pulmonary tuberculosis or other aerobic gram-negative infections.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of streptomycin.
- Describe the possible adverse effects of streptomycin.
- Review the appropriate monitoring for patients receiving streptomycin.
- Explain some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance safe and effective treatment with streptomycin to improve outcomes.
