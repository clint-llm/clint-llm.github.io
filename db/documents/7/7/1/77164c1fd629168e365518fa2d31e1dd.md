Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is characterized by skin fragility and the development of blisters at sites of trauma; therefore, patients should be educated on methods for preventing skin trauma. Patients should be counseled to reduce friction on their skin by avoiding vigorous rubbing or washing. Avoid adhesive bandages or tape on the skin. Loose-fitting clothing and shoes should be worn. Patients should attempt to keep the skin cool and avoid prolonged exposure to heat and humidity. Shower water should not be warmer than body temperature.

Patients should receive guidance on proper wound care for any eroded blisters. Application of antibacterial ointment over skin erosions is recommended to decrease the risk of developing a secondary bacterial infection. Wounds should be covered with a non-adhesive dressing and loosely wrapped with gauze rather than adhesives. Patients should be instructed on recognizing a secondary skin infection and when to seek medical care for non-healing or worsening wounds. Nutritional support may be needed for optimal wound healing, and patients should be monitored for nutritional deficiencies.
