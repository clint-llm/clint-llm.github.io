Normal labor is defined as regular uterine contractions that cause cervical change. Abnormal labor patterns are characterized as abnormalities of the first, second, or third stage of labor. In order to understand abnormal labor, a good understanding of normal labor is needed. The first stage of labor begins with the start of labor and ends with complete cervical dilation. The second stage of labor starts with complete cervical dilation and ends with the delivery of the fetus. The third stage of labor involves the delivery of the placenta.

Labor is divided into three stages and subsequent phases within the first stage:

- First Stage: 0-10 cm dilation

- Latent phase (0-5 cm dilation)
- Active phase (6 cm dilation to complete cervical dilation)

- Second Stage: uterine contractions along with maternal expulsive efforts leading to the descent of the presenting part and to the delivery of the fetus

- Third Stage: begins with the delivery of the fetus and ends with the delivery of the placenta

The following criteria should be kept in mind when labeling the labor as abnormal:

**First Stage Protraction and Arrest**

- **Latent Phase Protraction:**
- **In nulliparas women:**greater than at least 20 hours
- **In multiparas women:**greater than at least 14 hours
- ****Due to its variable and slow progression, latent phase protraction alone should not be an indication for cesarean delivery.

- **Active Phase (once 6 cm cervical dilation is achieved)**
- **No cervical dilation after 4 hours of adequate contractions with ruptured membranes**
- **No cervical dilation after 6 hours of inadequate contractions, with ruptured membranes, despite oxytocin administration**

**Second Stage Protraction and Arrest**

- **For nulliparous women:**more than 3 hours without epidural or 4 hours with an epidural

- **For multiparous women:**more than 2 hours without epidural or 3 hours with an epidural

- Longer durations may be appropriate with reassuring maternal and fetal status and continued descent of the fetal presenting part
