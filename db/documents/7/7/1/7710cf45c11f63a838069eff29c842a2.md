For oral administration, peak methamphetamine concentrations are seen in 2-4 hours; snorting, smoking, and injecting peak concentrations occur within minutes. Elimination half-life ranges from 6-15 hours. Methamphetamine is metabolized via the cytochrome P450 complex to active amphetamine, and p-OH-amphetamine and norephedrine, which are both inactive. The rate of excretion into the urine is enhanced as pH falls. Urine toxicology screening may be positive up to 4 days after use.
