If traveling to endemic areas, minimizing the contact with tick can be achieved by:

- Wearing protective clothing

- Repellent application [such as permethrin or N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET)] to clothing

- A thorough check and removal of ticks with the use of tweezers daily.

Antibiotic prophylaxis with oral doxycycline 200 mg is the recommended course for individuals with tick attachment for at least 36 hours.

Medical evaluation is necessary for people who develop a rash in the site of tick attachment, multiple skin lesions, or generalized flu-like symptoms.
