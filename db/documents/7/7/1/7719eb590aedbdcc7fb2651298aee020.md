As mentioned earlier, CFDR may not present with the typical symptoms of diabetes. Therefore routine screening for CFRD is vital in individuals with cystic fibrosis. Guidelines published by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and American Diabetes Association recommend the 2-hour 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test (or 1.75 gm glucose/kg for individuals under 42 kg body weight) as the only acceptable screening test for CFRD. Annual screening for CFRD should begin by ten years of age in all individuals with cystic fibrosis.

Additional screening methods such as urine glucose testing, random plasma glucose measurements, fructosamine testing, and monitoring of hemoglobin A1c levels are not recommended due to their low sensitivity.

At baseline health, the standard American Diabetes Association criteria are used to make the diagnosis of CFRD: 2-hour plasma glucose level greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL on oral glucose tolerance testing, fasting plasma glucose greater than or equal to 126mg/dL, HgA1c greater than or equal to 6.5%, and/or random glucose greater than or equal to 200mg/dL with clinical symptoms. In a state of acute illness, a 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose level greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL or a fasting plasma glucose greater than or equal to 126mg/dL persists for 48 hours more are diagnostic.
