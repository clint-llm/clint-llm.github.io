Astrocytes are characterized by the intermediate filament glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). GFAP is present in abundance in the astrocytic cytoplasm. Â Other markers specific to astrocytes include EAAT1/GLAST and EAAT2/GLT-1. The cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes does not contain GFAP, but markers commonly used for the characterization of oligodendrocytes include oligodendrocyte specific protein (OSP), and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). Schwann cells express the intermediate filament vimentin. Both Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes express myelin basic protein (MBP). The intermediate filament vimentin is present in microglia, and nestin-positive microglia may be present.
