Atropine or atropine sulfate carries FDA indications for anti-sialagogue/anti-vagal effect, organophosphate/muscarinic poisoning, and bradycardia. Atropine acts as a competitive, reversible antagonist of muscarinic receptors: an anticholinergic drug. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, safe administration, adverse effects, contraindications, toxicology, and monitoring of atropine.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of atropine.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of atropine.
- Summarize the indications for atropine use.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance patient outcomes and minimize adverse events with atropine.
