The latissimus flap may be compromised if a patient has had prior injuries or surgery to the shoulder and back that have disrupted the flapâ€™s blood supply; in such cases, latissimus transfer should not be undertaken. Patients should not proceed with reconstructive surgery without medical optimization first and thorough cardiovascular evaluation, as surgical time can be for an extended time, and blood loss may be significant, particularly during free tissue transfer.

Patients should be counseled to expect several days for recovery in the hospital after surgery and should be prepared for the possibilities of partial or complete flap failure, post-operative infection, and other risks of surgery. If patients require radiotherapy as part of comprehensive cancer management after surgical resection and reconstruction, then a muscle-only flap with overlying split-thickness skin grafts should not be transferred. Skin grafts require a minimum of six weeks of healing before they can be subjected to radiation, so employing skin grafts in reconstruction could delay the start of radiotherapy.
