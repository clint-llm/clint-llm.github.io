The majority of the causes are multifactorial associated with the embryological process, and recently the genetic research has demonstrated that the gene transcription factors TITF-1(Nkx2-1), Foxe1(TITF-2) and PAX-8 are essential for thyroid maturation and differentiation. Mutation in these genes may share a connection with abnormal migration of the thyroid.

- Thyroid ectopy: Genes:  1- NKX2-5 (Ectopy, no cardiac alterations) 2- FOXE1 (Bamforth-Lazarus syndrome)

- Thyroid hypoplasia: Genes: 1- NKX2-1 (Choreoathetosis, hypothyroidism, and pulmonary alterations) 2- TSHR (Resistance to TSH)  3- PAX8 (Hypothyroidism)

-  Athyreosis: Genes: 1- FOXE1 (Bamforth-Lazarus syndrome)2- NKX2-5 (Athyreosis, no cardiac alterations)  3- PAX8 (Hypothyroidism)
