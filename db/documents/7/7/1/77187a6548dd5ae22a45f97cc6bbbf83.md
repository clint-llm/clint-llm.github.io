A neuroma is a benign tumor of nerve tissue that is often associated with pain or specific types of various other symptoms. Neuromas most commonly arise from non-neuronal nervous tissue after amputation or trauma, or they can be true neoplasms. It is outside of the scope of this article to discuss all nerve-related tumors and syndromes; they will be mentioned only in classification (etiology section). This article will focus on traumatic neuromas.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiology of neuroma formation and propagation.
- Identify sub-types and outline symptoms associated with neuromas.
- Outline primary treatment modalities, focusing on surgery.
- Summarize the importance of education on the topic and collaboration by the interprofessional team to improve the delivery of care.
