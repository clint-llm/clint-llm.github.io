Acute Q fever has an excellent prognosis when promptly diagnosed and treated. Patients with known valvular heart disease and pregnant females with acute Q fever are at risk of developing endocarditis. Monitoring serology at frequent intervals and an echocardiogram for elevated serologic titers is recommended. Q fever treatment in pregnancy often results in better outcomes. For endocarditis, treatment outcomes are better with dual therapy than monotherapy.
