As the arytenoid is extremely mobile with a small oval articulating surface, it is vulnerable to displacement fromÂ its normal position during intubation. In fact, even slight pressure from the tip of the endotracheal tube directed toward the cricoarytenoid joint is enough to cause anteromedial displacement, dislocating the cartilage.

Subluxation results in hypomobility of the true vocal cords and incomplete closure of the glottis, mimicking vocal cord paralysis.****Left-sided displacements/dislocations occur more often because most anesthesiologists insert the endotracheal tube from the right side of the mouth and oropharynx, placing undue force on the left arytenoid by the convex curvature of the endotracheal tube. After the lesion occurs, hemarthrosis with subsequent fibrosis and paresis of the recurrent laryngeal nerve may occur.
