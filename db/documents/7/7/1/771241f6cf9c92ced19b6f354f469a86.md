The internal iliac artery (IIA), or hypogastric artery, is the primary artery supplying the pelvic viscera and an important contributor to structures of the pelvic wall, perineum, gluteal region, and thigh. The internal iliac artery arises where the common iliac artery bifurcates into internal and external iliac arteries; it then crosses the pelvic brim to give off numerous branches within the pelvis. The pelvic arteries arising from the internal iliac artery are highly variable in their branching pattern and number, an important feature to note during pelvic surgery. In addition, there are notable differences in the branches of the internal iliac artery in males and females, given that the reproductive organs are within their supply territory.
