Ileus is a common consequence of intra-abdominal surgical procedures. There is little consensus on when the gastrointestinal tract resumes motility postoperatively. However, colonic motility, which is the last to return, is typically restored within 72hrs. Thus, postoperative ileus lasting longer than this duration is often considered pathologic. While operative manipulation is traditionally blamed for inciting ileus, the exact mechanisms which lead to a prolonged ileus are poorly understood. Therefore, it is difficult to predict who will develop prolonged postoperative ileus. However, these underlying mechanisms can be broken into three broad categories: neurogenic, inflammatory, and pharmacologic.

Causes of postoperative ileus were studied extensively in efforts to prevent or treat the condition adequately. Multiple factors contribute to the development of the condition, but no direct causation relationship was confirmed with any of the factors. High correlation with ileus was identified with the following conditions:

- Interruption of the GI continuity (in cases of resection) or manipulation of the bowel

- Anesthetic and analgesic medications

- Immobility

- Electrolytes imbalance especially hypokalemia

- Intra-abdominal hematoma

- Intra-abdominal severe infection or sepsis

- Chronic medical conditions like diabetes mellitus (DM)

- Local or generalized abdominal inflammation like pancreatitis

- Severe pain

- Cardiopulmonary failure
