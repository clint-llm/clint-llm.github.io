The overdose of sertraline is generally well-tolerated. Sertraline toxicity may result in serotonin syndrome, resulting in myoclonus, muscle rigidity, diaphoresis, tremor, hyperreflexia, agitated delirium, and hyperthermia. Treatment of serotonin syndrome requires discontinuing the medication and supportive care. Consider antiemetics (non-serotonergic), benzodiazepines, and standard cooling measures for symptom relief. The patient can also receive serotonin antagonists such as cyproheptadine. If severe toxicity and the patient develops muscular rigidity and hyperthermia with body temperatures higher than 41 degrees C, consider sedation, endotracheal intubation, external cooling, and neuromuscular paralysis. It is important to note that antipyreticsÂ are likely not beneficial to patients experiencing hyperthermia due to serotonin syndrome.
