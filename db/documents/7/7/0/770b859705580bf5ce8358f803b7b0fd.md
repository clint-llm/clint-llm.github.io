**History**

The most common symptom of eyelid myokymia is lower eyelid twitching. Clinical evaluation of individuals with the symptoms mentioned above includes a full medical history and include questions about precipitating factors like smoking, caffeine intake, lifestyle, and medications.

**Physical Examination**

On examination, fine contractions of the orbicularis oculi muscle may be noticeable. These contractions are more apparent to the patient than visible to the spectator. When the eyelid is pulled manually, the symptoms often improve. Infrequently, the contractions may induce movement of the globe and cause mild nystagmus-like eye movements. When examing the patient, tapping on the area where the movements occur may reveal the myokymia.
