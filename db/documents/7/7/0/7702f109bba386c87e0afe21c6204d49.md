A corn, also known as a "calvus," heloma," or "focal intractable plantar hyperkeratosis," is a type of callosity. Corns are uncomfortable, thickened skin lesions that result from repeated mechanical trauma due to friction or pressure forces. In the literature, confusing terminology is often used to call different types of hyperkeratotic skin lesions. Nevertheless, a corn should be distinguished from a callus, which is a more diffuse type of callosity. Thus, a corn is a well-delimited focal area of hyperkeratosis. This condition is often seen in athletes and patients exposed to unequal friction force from footwear or gait problems, including the elderly, patients with diabetes, and amputees. It should be regarded as a symptom rather than an effective disease. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of corns and examines the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology and pathophysiology of corn formation.
- Describe appropriate physical exam techniques to diagnose a corn, and differentiate between the two types.
- Review management techniques for helping patients who present with corns.
- Describe the importance of improving coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care for patients affected by corns.
