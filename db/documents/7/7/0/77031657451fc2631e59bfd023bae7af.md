The diagnosis of hepatic angiosarcoma remains difficult during the early stages due to unspecific symptoms. Prognosis is poor due to its rapid progression, high recurrence rate, and resistance to traditional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Surgical resection remains the most definite curative therapy. However, there are no therapeutic guidelines established to date due to the rarity of cancer. Exposure to environmental and chemical substances, as previously mentioned, remains the most common known etiology of the disease.
