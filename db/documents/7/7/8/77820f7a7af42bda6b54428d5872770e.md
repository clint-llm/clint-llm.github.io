Gabapentin is a widely prescribed drug by primary care providers, mid-level practitioners, neurologists, internists, and orthopedic surgeons for a range of medical disorders. The drug has several uses besides its antiseizure properties. While gabapentin has a relatively safe profile, the pharmacist should assist the team and monitor the patient's medication list to ensure no potential drug interactions exist. Nursing can answer patient questions, review dosing, and serve as a point of contact for the clinician. All interprofessional team members should be aware of the possibility of misuse of gabapentin. This type of interprofessional team coordination will serve to optimize gabapentin therapy while minimizing potential adverse effects. [Level 5]
