Key histologic features include dilated hair follicles, keratin plugging, abundant dystrophic and cornfield inner root sheath epithelium, and numerous, large eosinophilic trichohyalin granules within the inner root sheath cells.

Other features include apoptotic cells, epidermal acanthosis and may include mild perifollicular lymphocytic inflammation.

The inner root sheath epithelial cells stain with Ki-67, indicative of hyperproliferation, andÂ toluidine blue, which reflects increased nucleic acids from dysplastic cells.
