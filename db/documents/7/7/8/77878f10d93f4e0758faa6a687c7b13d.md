Pancreatic pseudoaneurysm though uncommon can present with life-threatening complications. Accurate diagnosis and timely intervention can improve outcomes. However, these patients are often hemodynamically unstable and need aggressive resuscitation and invasive hemodynamic monitoring. Blood should always be made available for transfusion even when a percutaneous intervention is being planned.

If the patient is unstable, angiography may not be an option, and an immediate exploratory laparotomy is required. Following the entry into the abdomen, all four quadrants should be packed with lap pads to tamponade the bleeding. The lap pads should then be removed in succession starting from the area which is least suspicious for bleeding. In rare cases, there may be torrential bleeding which makes viewing the surgical field difficult. In such cases, cross-clamping of the aorta just above the take of the celiac artery can be life-saving. These patients are best monitored in the intensive care unit, and the presence of post-surgical hemorrhage carries a mortality of 7% to 70%
