A time-out should be performed at which time the staff identify the patient, discuss which procedure will be performed, and verify the side of the body to be treated. The patient should be placed on the fluoroscopy table in the prone position. Some clinicians choose to provide the patient with intravenous sedation at this time. Once the target area has been identified, the area should be cleaned thoroughly with a betadine solution and then covered with a sterile draping. After the patient has been positioned appropriately and the skin has been sterilized, the clinician may proceed.
