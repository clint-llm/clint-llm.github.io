The epidemiology of echinococcal disease varies from species to species. Although E. granulosus is almost prevalent throughout the world, higher incidence rates are found in South America, the former Soviet Union, the Middle East and the eastern Mediterranean, few sub-Saharan African countries, and western China. In particular, the areas where dogs can consume organs of infected animals, such as the rural and the grazing ones, possess higher infection rates.

E. multilocularis is mostly limited to the Northern Hemisphere in areas such as the northern parts of Europe, Asia, and North America, as well as Central Europe. On the other hand, the remaining two Echinococcus species, E. vogeli and E. oligarthrus, are only limited to South and Central America.

The prevalence of echinococcal disease increases with age. Older and immunocompromised people are more vulnerable to develop such infections. There is no sex predilection for hydatid cysts. While cystic Echinococcus is the disease of adulthood (average age of 30 to 40 years), alveolar Echinococcus tends to occur in old age (older than 50 years of age).
