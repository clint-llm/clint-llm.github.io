Intravitreal implants are controlled drug delivery systems that are an emerging field in treating intraocular inflammation and other posterior segment diseases needing chronic therapy. They have the advantage of targeted delivery of high drug concentrations to the posterior segment for a prolonged period. This activity reviews the various types of intravitreal implants, their indications and contraindications, the technique of implantation, the possible complications, and the role of the interprofessional team in management and follow-up.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the different types of intravitreal implants currently available and elaborate on their mechanism of action and possible complications.
- Review the indications for each implant and identify the situations where they might be contraindicated.
- Identify the techniques of implantation of the intravitreal implants along with the choice of anesthesia and instrumentation needed.
- Explain the role of ancillary investigations and follow-up for intravitreal implants.
