Assessment of the severity of the disease helps to stratify the patients into different treatment groups. The CURB65 scoring is a suitable tool to use in all cases of CAP as it takes clinical history, examination findings, and laboratory value into account and can be used in primary healthcare settings as well. It includes the following elements for assessment:

- Confusion with new-onset (Abbreviated mental score: < 9 or, orientation to time, place, person: < 3)

- Blood Urea Nitrogen: > 19 mg/dL

- Respiratory Rate: 30/minute or higher

- Blood Pressure: < 90 mmHg (systolic) or <60 mmHg (diastolic)

- Age of 65 or more

Each element carries one point. The patient can be managed according to the outcome score, which ranges from 0-5.

- Score 0-1: Outpatient treatment; may need further assessment

- Score 2: Consider hospitalization to monitor and start therapy

- Score 3-5: Hospitalization, possibly intensive care unit (ICU) admission, particularly for a score of 4 or 5

**Empirical Therapy**

Because mixed infections with organisms such as pneumococci, legionella, and mycoplasma are common and testing for atypical microorganisms may take time, it is wise to initiate empirical treatment for community-acquired pneumonia. For outpatients, a macrolide (e.g., azithromycin) or a fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin or levofloxacin) can be prescribed. If the patient has risk factors such as chronic lung conditions, recent use of antibiotics, or admitted to the hospital, then beta-lactam with a macrolide is preferred, but respiratory fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, gemifloxacin) can be given if the patient is allergic to the former regimen.

**Direct Therapy**

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends azithromycin and doxycycline as first-line drugs for the treatment of chlamydial infections; alternatively, levofloxacin, erythromycin, and ofloxacin are considered.

- IfÂ C. pneumoniae is diagnosed, then azithromycin (500 mg as a loading dose on day 1 and 250 mg maintenance dose for 4 days daily) is given. Tetracycline, clarithromycin, doxycycline, or fluoroquinolones can be used as alternatives.

- If C. psittaci is found, then tetracyclines are preferred; doxycycline is given in a dose of 100 mg twice daily for 7-10 days. Macrolides such as azithromycin or erythromycin can be used as an alternative, especially where doxycycline is contraindicated, such as in pregnancy and children below 8 years of age.

- Erythromycin (50 mg/kg for 14 days in 4 doses) is the drug of choice for C. trachomatis pneumonia. Azithromycin can be an alternative. To eradicate the infection in the mother, azithromycin is preferred as a single dose in these cases.

A novel investigational drug, AZD0914, which inhibits DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, is reported to have shown efficacy against chlamydial infections comparable to other proven antibiotics such as azithromycin, doxycycline, and levofloxacin.

Other than the antibiotics, antipyretics, fluids, personal hygiene, and rest is advised to the patient to enhance recovery.
