Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors enjoy use in a wide variety of conditions and diseases for their analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties. Diseases and conditions in which COX-inhibitors are indicated include but are not limited to osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, musculoskeletal injury, spondyloarthritis, migraines, and colon cancer (aspirin). According to the World Health Organization ladder, COX inhibitors are indicated for mild pain. Most professional societies, including the American College of Rheumatology, recommend the lowest dose and shortest duration regimen due to the risks associated with COX inhibitors.
