Exogenous lipoid pneumonia is caused by aspiration or inhalation of lipid-containing products. In the past, the most common agents included mineral oil-based laxatives and nasal decongestants. Other causes include inhalation of petroleum jelly used as a lubricant, i.e., tracheostomy care.

Endogenous lipoid pneumonia, also known as "cholesterol pneumonia," was first discovered by Mcdonald et al. in 1949, which he termed "obstructive pneumonitis" in the setting of lung neoplasm.
