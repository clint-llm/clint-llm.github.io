To evaluate a patient for POI, it is important to obtain a thorough and complete history. Obtaining the history of present illness is critical as it may help to form the appropriate differential diagnosis. The history should include integral aspects such as age, medical comorbidities, gynecologic history, obstetric history, and social factors including potential stressors. When eliciting past medical history, it is very important to inquire about the history of various illnesses including but not limited to mumps, shigella, tuberculosis, malaria, and varicella. These diseases have the potential to affect the ovary causing oophoritis and potential damage to the oocyte reserve.

The physical exam should include vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and weight/body mass index. Then, a general survey of the patient should be performed looking for any pathognomonic signs of disease. For example, hirsutism, obesity, and acne may be indicative of PCOS or short stature, increased carrying angle, broad chest, and webbing of the neck may be indicative of Turner Syndrome.
