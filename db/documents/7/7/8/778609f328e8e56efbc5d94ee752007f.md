Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) is frequently used to assess left ventricular filling, represent left atrial pressure, and assess mitral valve function. Right heart catheterization remains a vital tool in the diagnosis, prognostic evaluation, and management of patients with suspected pulmonary hypertension (PH) and selected heart failure patients. This activity outlines and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients who undergo right heart catheterization for assessment of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.
- Identify the indications for checking pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.
- Outline the most common adverse events associated with right heart catheterization. 
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to ensure the appropriate selection of candidates to measure pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and to improve outcomes of patients undergoing this procedure.
