The new guidelines recommend a pulmonary embolism response team (PERT) approach at healthcare facilities. This is an interprofessional team that is alerted in the event of submassive or massive pulmonary embolism diagnosis. The team members include multiple clinical providers from emergency medicine, internal medicine, critical care, cardiovascular, vascular surgery, and interventional radiology specialties. The team also consists of specialized nurses and pharmacists to assist in delivering CDT once the decision is made to pursue that course. On initial referral to the PERT team, the clinicians determine the best course of action to treat critically ill patients with massive and submassive PE.
