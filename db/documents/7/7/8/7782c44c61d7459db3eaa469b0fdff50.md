Cancer is one of the three major causes of death after an organ transplant. Cardiovascular disease and infection are the other two reasons for death after an organ transplant, but they both are decreasing in frequency because of effective screening, prophylaxis, and interventional therapies. Knowledge of post-transplant malignancy is inadequate regarding early detection and lack of established guidelines. In this activity, we focus on the epidemiology, pathophysiology, presentation, diagnosis, screening and highlight the role of the interprofessional team in its treatment strategy.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of post-transplant cancer.
- Review the pathophysiology of post-transplant cancer.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for post-transplant cancer.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of post-transplant cancer and improve outcomes.
