All other causes of atypical pneumonia, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Francisella tularensis (tularemia), Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), and Legionella, should also be considered when suspecting Chlamydia pneumoniae.

Other than pneumonia, the chlamydial species can manifest a broad spectrum of diseases in the patients, such as bronchitis, pharyngitis, sinusitis, or laryngitis. Usually, patients present with atypical and mild symptoms, and they can be misdiagnosed as upper respiratory tract infection, gastroenteritis, or simple sore throat depending upon the presentation. Other differential diagnoses include the following:

- Bacterial pneumonia

- Fungal pneumonia

- Viral pneumonia

- Tuberculosis

- Influenza
