After the third week of development, a fusion of the neural folds into a tube (neurulation) occurs; the neural tube then closes completely at day 28 and forms the brain and the spinal cord.

The caudal neural tube's cross-sectional view initially appears diamond-shaped, lined by neuroepithelial cells, which divide and multiply into neuroblasts that populate surrounding areas called the mantle zone, eventually forming the gray matter. Divided neuroepithelial cells now form the ependymal lining of the central spinal canal with roles in CSF production.

The mantle zone differentiates into - basal plate, alar plate, and intermediolateral plate. More lateral parts form into the marginal zone, which becomes the white mater with ascending and descending myelinated fibers.

The basal plates differentiate into the anterior or ventral gray horn. Multipolar neurons in the anterior horn are first-order neurons and give off motor fibers that exit the spinal segments and become myelinated by Schwann cells (derivative of neural crest cells).

The alar plates differentiate into the posterior or dorsal gray horn. They comprise second-order pseudo-unipolar neurons, which receive sensory communication from first-order neurons derived from neural crest-derived dorsal ganglia.

The intermediolateral plates in cervical and thoracic regions are populated by pre-ganglion neurons, which give off fibers exiting ventrally onto the sympathetic trunk.
