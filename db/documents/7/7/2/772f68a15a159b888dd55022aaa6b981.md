Without timely treatment, coronary artery occlusion results in decreased perfusion to the myocardium, resulting in myocardial ischemia followed by myocardial infarction (MI). Approximately 40 percent of myocardial infarctions involve the inferior wall. Traditionally, inferior MIs have a better prognosis than those in other regions, such as the anterior wall of the heart. The mortality rate of an inferior wall MI is less than 10 percent. However, several complicating factors can lead to increased mortality, including right ventricular infarction, hypotension, bradycardia, heart block, and cardiogenic shock. This activity examines when a myocardial infarction should be considered on differential diagnosis, how to properly evaluate for it, and the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain how a patient can lessen their risk of myocardial infarction by optimizing their modifiable risk factors.
- Explain features suggestive of inferior wall myocardial infarction. 
- Explain the proper management of an inferior wall myocardial infarction. 
- Describe how coordination of the interprofessional team can lead to more rapid detection of myocardial infarction and subsequently decrease associated morbidity and mortality in affected patients.
