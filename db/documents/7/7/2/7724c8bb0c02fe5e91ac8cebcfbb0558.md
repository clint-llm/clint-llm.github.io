The etiology of oropharyngeal carcinoma is broadly categorized into two categories, HPV associated and non-HPV associated carcinomas.

HPV associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma occurs in patients who have been infected with the human papillomavirus. Among the many types of human papillomavirus, HPV16 is the most common type found in oropharyngeal cancers

Oral sex and open-mouthed kissingÂ have been regarded as the most common reasons for oral HPV infection

On the other hand, smoking tobacco and alcohol consumption have been widely identified as the major risk factors for non-HPV-associated oropharyngeal carcinomas
