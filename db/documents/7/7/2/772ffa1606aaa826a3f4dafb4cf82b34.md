Sodium polystyrene sulfonate can be administered either orally or rectally. It is available in oral suspension, oral powder formulation, and rectal enema formulation. Appropriate dosing of sodium polystyrene sulfonate is varying on the route of administration. Usually, the dose of sodium polystyrene sulfonate is between 15 g (60 mL) to 60 g (240 mL), and each 15 g of sodium polystyrene sulfonate can bind 15 mEq of potassium.

Patients with gastroparesis may require a longer period between SPS and other oral medications. When using an enema, the administration of a cleansing enema should be before administering sodium polystyrene sulfonate. It should be as warm as body temperature for rectal formulation. After administration, SPS should be retained in the colon for at least 30 to 60 min. After completing retention, irrigation should be done with a non-sodium colonic irrigant to remove the remaining resin. In the past, SPS used to be coadministered with sorbitol to reduce the chance of constipation, but in 2009, the FDA issued a warning against the concomitant use of SPS and sorbitol due to the occurrence of colonic necrosis and other serious GI side effects. Nowadays, the concurrent use of sorbitol is not recommended.

**Storage**

Resin powder should be stored at 25 degrees C (77 F); excursions permitted to 15 to 30 degrees C (59 to 86 F). After the preparation of suspension, it should be used within 24 hours.
