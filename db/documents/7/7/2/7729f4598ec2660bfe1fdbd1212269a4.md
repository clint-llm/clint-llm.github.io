Digoxin comes from the foxgloves plant known as Digitalis lanata. It is a cardiotonic glycoside and belongs to the digitalis class. The chemical formula of digoxin is C41 H64 O14. Cardiac glycosides, including digitalis and digoxin, have long-standing use in clinical practice. This drug received approval from the FDA in 1954 and is used to treat various heart problems such as atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure with its associated symptoms and to induce fetal demise prior to an abortion. Superior therapies with milder adverse effects and better safety profiles have replaced it, such as beta-blockers and calcium-channel blockers. In current practice, it is reserved as a backup drug when first-line agents are ineffective. Its optimal use is in the treatment of mild to moderate heart failure in adult patients and to increase myocardial contraction.

Digoxin is beneficial in patients with systolic heart failure, better known as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), with an ejection fraction below 40%.

It is used for rate control in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter when conventional therapies have not achieved the heart rate goal. Digoxin should not be administered in cases of pre-excitation caused by accessory pathways, as digoxin induces AV blockade and may trigger ventricular tachyarrythmias. It is ineffective in states of high sympathetic activity. Beta-blockers are preferable in such cases.

Supraventricular tachycardias that are not rate controlled by traditional therapies may benefit from digoxin.

Digoxin use has shown some success in the treatment of fetal supraventricular tachyarrhythmia. The lowest effective dose should be administered to the mother as digoxin might cause uterine contractions and result in abortion.
