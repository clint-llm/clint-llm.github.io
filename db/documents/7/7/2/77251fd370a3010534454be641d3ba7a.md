The incidence of pulseless electrical activity varies among different the United States patient populations. It accounts for approximately 20% of sudden cardiac deaths outside of the hospital setting.

A study found that 68% of the recorded in-hospital deaths and 10% of all in-hospital deaths were attributed to pulseless electrical activity. In addition, hospitalized patients are more likely to have a pulmonary embolism, among other complications. Pulseless electrical activity is the first documented rhythm in 30 to 38% of adults with in-hospital cardiac arrest. Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers may alter contractility, leading to increased susceptibility and resistance to treatment.
