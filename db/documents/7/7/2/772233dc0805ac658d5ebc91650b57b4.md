The true incidence of unilateral vocal fold paralysis is not known. However, it is known to be relatively uncommon. The reason for the difficulty in determining the true incidence is two-fold. First, making a confirmed diagnosis is a difficulty, as it requires a visual evaluation of the larynx, which requires indirect laryngoscopy or direct laryngoscopy with use of an endoscope. Second, a myriad of other pathologies can cause dysphonia, including acid reflux, laryngitis, muscle tension dysphonia, etc. Therefore, if symptoms like dysphonia are being used to make a presumed diagnosis, the true incidence would be drastically underestimated, as dysphonia due to unilateral vocal fold paralysis would often be attributed to other, more common causes.

Stanford University reviewed their experience with vocal fold paralysis from 1983 through 1991. They identified 187 charts that listed vocal fold paralysis as a diagnosis. One hundred and thirteen (113) of these charts met their inclusion criteria to be reviewed. Their data demonstrated 84 patients (74.3%) diagnosed with unilateral vocal fold paralysis and 29 patients (25.7%) with bilateral vocal fold paralysis. Among the unilateral vocal fold paralysis group, 45 (53.6%) were men, and 39 (46.4%) were women. The mean age was 58. In 57 patients (67.9%), the left cord was affected, whereas the right cord was affected in 27 patients (32.1%).
