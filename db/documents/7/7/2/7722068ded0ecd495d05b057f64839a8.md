Aspergillus is a ubiquitous saprophyteÂ in nature found in air, soil and organic matter. Humans normally inhale the spore form of the fungi. However, the disease is usually seen in immunocompromised patients. The immune system plays an important role not only in recognizing inhaled mold and controlling growth but also in regulating the body's allergic and inflammatory response to the infection.

High mortality rates often accompany systemic Aspergillus fumigatus infections; therefore, early diagnosis and treatment in the immunocompromised population are important.
