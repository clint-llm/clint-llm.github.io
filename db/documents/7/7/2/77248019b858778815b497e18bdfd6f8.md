Duodenal perforations can either be free or contained. Free perforation arises when bowel contents leak freely into the abdominal cavity and causing diffuse peritonitis. Contained perforation occurs when the ulcer creates a full-thickness hole, but free leakage is prevented by contiguous organs such as the pancreas wall off the area. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of duodenal perforation and explains the healthcare team's role in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the presentation of duodenal perforation.
- Describe the risk factors for developing duodenal perforation.
- Summarize the treatment for duodenal perforation.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve patient outcomes affected by duodenal perforation.
