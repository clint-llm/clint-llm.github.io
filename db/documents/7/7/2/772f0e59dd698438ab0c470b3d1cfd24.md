Temozolomide is an oral alkylating agent which exerts its pharmacologic effect by deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation, resulting in irreversible DNA damage. Temozolomide is the recommended first-line chemotherapy. Temozolomide has been shown to improve progression-free and overall 5-year survival rates in responders.

For tumors that are progressing on or after the first course of temozolomide, there are, unfortunately, no other evidence-based treatments available at this time; therefore, maximizing and prolonging temozolomide efficacy is critical. Despite limited experience, options include long-term treatment with temozolomide as long as it is effective and clinically tolerated.

Controlling pituitary hormone hypersecretion is as mandatory in patients with pituitary cancer as in any patient with a functional pituitary tumor. For patients with lactotroph tumors, dopamine agonists, such as cabergoline, can be given at high doses.

Potential future therapeutic options that are currently being studied include immunotherapy as well as molecularly targeted therapies such as bevacizumab (anti-VEGF antibody), everolimus (mTOR inhibitor), and several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).
