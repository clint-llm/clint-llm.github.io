Cholangiocarcinoma has an annual incidence ranging from 0.72 to 1.62 per 100,000 individuals recorded in the U.S. Although this incidence varies in different countries, as an increase in the number of cases is reported worldwide. With a rate of more than 80 per 100,000 individuals, Northeast Thailand (Asia) is noted to have the highest incidence of the disease, most likely due to chronic infection with hepatobiliary flukes.

Over the past several decades, multiple studies have documented a steady growth in the incidence of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Multiple factors have been recorded as to the reason for this rise, preceding the chronic inflammation and irritation of the biliary tract epithelium. The incidence also increases with age, and it is slightly more common in men than in women, possibly because of the higher rate of primary sclerosing cholangitis in men at age 40 or even younger, which is documented as a risk factor to developing cholangiocarcinoma.
