Aortic transection represents a range of severity in traumatic disruption of the integrity of the aortic wall. The severity is classified by grade, which reflects the degree of disruption present. Grading of the injury is important because treatment is guided by the extent of the injury. A grade 1 injury describes an intimal tear. This injury does not change the contour of the aorta and is unlikely to be visible on plain film X-ray. Grade 1 injuries may be seen on CTA or intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Angiography may fail to identify an intimal tear. Grade 2 injuries are intramural hematoma or dissection caused by a disrupted media layer. The contour of the aorta may be affected by a grade 2 injury. These are readily visible on CTA, IVUS, and angiography. Grade 3 injuries describe a pseudoaneurysm. Similar to grade 2 injuries, these affect the aortic contour and are seen on all imaging modalities. Grade 4 injuries describe a complete rupture of the aortic wall.
