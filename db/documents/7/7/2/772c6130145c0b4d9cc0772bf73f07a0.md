Presbycusis is generally insidious in onset, and mild cases are difficult to detect. It is imperative that primary care providers screen for hearing loss, especially geriatricians and those caring for adults age 60 and beyond. Often, family members and friends are more aware of hearing loss than patients themselves. A common initial presentation is difficulty discriminating speech in specific situations, such as a room with significant background noise.

The general physical exam is usually unremarkable in patients with presbycusis. It is common for older adults to have age-related benign opacification of the tympanic membrane and build-up of cerumen.
