Complications often develop with decubitus ulcers. The most common problem is infection. Grade III and IV ulcers require management intensively as their complications can be life-threatening. Microbial analysis has shown that both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria are present in the lesions.

These wounds are catabolic (meaning that they use up a lot of energy). The catabolic nature of these ulcers causes severe fluid and protein loss, which can result in hypoproteinemia or malnutrition. Up to 50 grams of body protein can be lost daily due to a draining ulcer.

Chronic decubitus ulcers can cause chronic anemia or secondary amyloidosis. Anemia also occurs secondary to chronic water loss and bleeding.

If there is inadequate postoperative care complications secondary to reconstructive surgery can occur. These include hematoma or seroma formation, wound dehiscence, abscess formation, or postoperative wound sepsis.
