Lumbar spinal stenosis is a common disease process in the outpatient setting. These patients have symptoms such as leg pain and low back pain. The cause of this condition is most likely secondary to chronic wear-and-tear damages to the vertebral column. Despite the fact that imaging studies can show there is indeed lumbar spinal stenosis, the patient's may or may not have corresponding symptoms. Because there is no evidence to demonstrate the superiority of surgical versus non-surgical treatments of lumbar spinal stenosis, it is essential to take an interprofessional approach.

Primary physicians must recognize the patient's presentation; the care of the patient must include coordinated effort with physical medicine and rehabilitation, pain management, orthopedist, and/or neurosurgeons (if there is a neurosurgical emergency). Physical therapists must also have involvement as physical therapy is the mainstay in the conservative treatment of this condition. In patients who need to undergo surgical treatment, the nursing staff (including orthopedic specialty nurses) must be aware of the patient's medical status. In short, the care of patients suffering from lumbar spinal stenosis requires an interprofessional team-based cooperative model.
