Bowel necrosis is a late stage finding of several different disease processes characterized by cellular death due to reduced blood flow to the gastrointestinal tract. This serious and often fatal condition can be secondary to vascular occlusion, bowel inflammation, obstruction, or infection. This activity describes the etiology, classification, pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of bowel necrosis and highlights the role of interprofessional teams in improving outcomes for such patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, and classification of patients with bowel necrosis.
- Outline the evaluation in patients with bowel necrosis.
- Summarize the resuscitation and surgical treatment options available for patients with bowel necrosis.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination to facilitate rapid diagnosis and targeted management of patients with bowel necrosis.
