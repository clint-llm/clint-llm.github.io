Prognosis of helminthiasis depends on the extent of helminth infection. If the worm burden is high, ascariasis may produce some serious complications such as intestinal obstruction. Strongyloidiasis carries a good prognosis, although hyperinfection syndrome and disseminated strongyloidiasis carry a high mortality rate. For A. duodenale, and N. americanus infection, the prognosis is excellent, and appropriate anthelmintic treatment with iron and diet therapy completely cure the manifestations in most of the cases. The prognosis of echinococcosis mainly depends on the type of infestation.

Prognosis of cystic echinococcosis is generally good, and it may be cured completely if total surgical excision can be done without spillage. In alveolar echinococcosis, the prognosis is worse than cystic echinococcosis, and early detection with complete surgical excision can cure the disease. Diphyllobothriasis carries an excellent prognosis. Filarial diseases are rarely fatal, and the prognosis is generally good. In the case of schistosomiasis, hepatosplenic schistosomiasis carries a good prognosis because the hepatic function is preserved.

Patients with end-stage complications of portal hypertension, severe pulmonary hypertension, or cor pulmonale are much less likely to benefit from treatment. The prognosis of schistosomiasis is generally dependent on the worm burden. Prognosis of taeniasis is excellent who receives antihelminthic treatment, and it depends on the location of the cysts.
