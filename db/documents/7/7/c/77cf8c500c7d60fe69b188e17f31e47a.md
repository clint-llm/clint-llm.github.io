Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee is a relatively rare condition that necessitates a high index of suspicion when evaluating the undifferentiated patient with a focally tender knee. The majority of patients may present to the primary care provider or the emergency department. Thus, these clinicians, including nurses, need to know about SONK-delays in diagnosis, and erroneous treatment can lead to significant disability. The radiologist should be asked to perform the relevant imaging. If SONK is suspected, it is critical that the primary care physician and nurse institute the proper workup and makes a referral to an orthopedic surgeon if indicated. An orthopedic specialty-trained nurse can be an asset in these cases, by verifying patient compliance with medical therapy and assisting on surgical interventions. They would also help counsel the patient on the condition, and assist with post-surgical assessment as well. All these specialties working collaboratively demonstrate how an interprofessional team approach towards diagnosis and management of spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee will drive the best patient outcomes regardless of the disease stage.
