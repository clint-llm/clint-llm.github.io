Renal fusion anomalies were first described by Wilmer in 1938, with the classification being expanded by McDonald and McClellan in 1957.

The term pelvic kidney encompasses a range of anatomical abnormalities when the kidney fails to rise from the pelvis in its metanephros stage during embryogenesis. Most cases are asymptomatic, although they are generally associated with higher risks for traumatic injury, urinary tract infections, renal calculi, and other urological problems. They may also complicate other surgeries, such as for aortic aneurysms.

Congenital renal anomalies are among the most common birth deformities, exceeded only by cardiac and skeletal defects.

An ectopic kidneys' vascular supply is not consistent, and they may receive vascular access from a range of vessels as the fetal blood supply can be retained. Multiple vascular sources may supply the ectopic kidney. The iliac arteries, direct branches from the aorta, mid sacral vessels, or the hypogastric arteries have all been found supplying ectopic kidneys.****

Ectopic kidneys are also associated with several other congenital abnormalities. This may be in the pelvis, such as Mullerian agenesis or unicornuate uterus in females.
