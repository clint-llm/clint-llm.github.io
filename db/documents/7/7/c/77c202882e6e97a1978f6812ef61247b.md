Most commonly, NSAIDs are available as oral tablets. According to the package insert, the dosage for the most common over-the-counter NSAIDs are as follows:

- Ibuprofen: for 200 mg tablets, 1 to 2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours while symptoms persist. The daily limit for ibuprofen is 1200 mg.

- Aspirin regular strength: for 325 mg tablets, 1 to 2 tablets every 4 hours, or 3 tablets every 6 hours. The daily limit for aspirin is 4000 mg.

- Naproxen sodium: for 220 mg tablets, 1 to 2 tablets every 8 to 12 hours. The daily limit for naproxen sodium is 660 mg.

Topical NSAIDs are also available (diclofenac sodium 1.5% topical solution, diclofenac hydroxyethyl pyrrolidine 1.3% patch, and diclofenac sodium gel 1%). They are most useful for treating pain due to soft-tissue injuries and osteoarthritis.

Specific NSAIDs can also be administered parenterally; for example, intravenous ibuprofen is available, given as a 30-minute infusion; this can be used as a non-opioid analgesic to manage pain and can also reduce fever. Trials have shown that using intravenous ibuprofen and morphine in postoperative adult patients can lower the total use of morphine. For treating pyrexia, an initial 400mg dose then 400 or 100 to 200 mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed. For the treatment of pain, 400 to 800 mg, every 6 hours as needed, is the recommended dose regimen.
