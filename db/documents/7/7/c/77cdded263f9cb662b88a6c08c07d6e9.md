Ovulation induction is the simplest and minimally invasive technique used in patients with anovulatory infertility. The method of ovulation induction selected by the clinician is based upon the underlying cause of anovulation and efficacy, cost, risks, and potential complications associated with each method. Women with ovulatory disorders must undergo conventional ovulation induction techniques before considering assisted reproductive techniques, as the success rates are good. In addition, if monitored by an experienced clinician, complication rates are low.

Induction of ovulation should be differentiated from stimulation of multiple follicle development in ovulatory women (controlled ovarian hyperstimulation) as done with assisted conception techniques. The main aim of this treatment modality is inducing monofollicular rather than multi follicular development and subsequent ovulation resulting in pregnancy and ultimately the birth of a healthy newborn, maximizing the rates of singleton pregnancies and minimizing the risk of OHSS (ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome).
