Although the corpus luteum has no muscle attachments, it affects an essential muscular pelvic organ, the uterus. As discussed previously, the corpus luteum plays an important role in producing hormones responsible for the decidualization of the endometrium. The hormones released from the corpus luteum cause the ovary to enter a luteal phase and the uterus to enter a secretory phase. During this time, the uterus is preparing for implantation and growth of the fertilized egg.
