One study showed approximately 20% of the population has anatomical variations of the trigeminal nerve. All of these are related to the mandibular nerve and its branches, not the ophthalmic or maxillary nerve. Some anatomical variations that have been reportedÂ include:

- Anatomical variations of the inferior alveolar nerve

- Anatomical variations of the lingual nerve

- Anatomical variations of the buccal nerve

- Anatomical variations of the auriculotemporal nerve and

- Cervical plexus: Additional innervation of the mandibular region

The inferior alveolar nerve can give multiple extraosseous branches before it enters the mandibular canal and within the bony canal, it may give rise to multiple intraosseous branches. The inferior alveolar nerve may also show anatomical variations in its relation with the maxillary artery.

Quantitative studies have been done to estimate the position of the lingual nerve in relation to the third molar region. The studies report that the mean horizontal distance of the nerve to the lingual plate ranges from 0.58 to 3.45 mm; whereas the mean vertical distance of the lingual nerve below the alveolar crest is between 2.28 and 8.32 mm. This is important for oral surgery, for example, third molar extraction, mandibular trauma management, periodontal procedures, and excision of neoplastic lesions.

The long buccal nerve may innervate the mandibular molar teeth by entering the alveolar bone through the retromolar foramina. This could be responsible for the failure of the traditional alveolar nerve block.

The auriculotemporal nerve has been described to have a connection with the inferior alveolar nerve. In regional anesthesia, this compromises the efficacy of the inferior alveolar nerve block.

The cervical plexus may give rise to additional nerve fibers that provide supplementary innervation to the mandibular area. The cervical plexus gives rise to the great auricular nerve which provides afferent innervation to the mastoid process, the parotid gland, and the outer ear. In cases of third molar extractions where conventional anesthesia was not successful, anesthesia of the great auricular nerve was reported. This suggests that the great auricular nerve is involved in the innervation of the angle of the mandible, and a separate infiltration of the nerve may be required to achieve complete anesthesia of the mandibular region.
