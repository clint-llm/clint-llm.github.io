Airway management is widely indicated in the prehospital setting, commonly where a patient has become unable to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation or where they have become unable to protect their airway due to intercurrent illness or injury.

In choosing a primary method for advanced airway management, circumstances must allow time for appropriate visualization, suctioning, and gentle placement of the device. Hypoxia should not occur, and a physiologic “cushion” should allow for apneic time without desaturation. Techniques to provide this cushion, such as apneic oxygenation and nitrogen washout, should be explored separately. If the primary method fails, a backup method should be implemented; this should allow for promptly securing the airway but without the comfort of a cushion to maintain oxygenation during the apneic period. Examples of a backup device include video or bougie-assisted laryngoscopy or a laryngeal mask airway (LMA). Rescue methods are used in sequence when the above methods fail, or as the initial method when the patient is too ill and iatrogenic injury will be caused by further delays in oxygenation and ventilation. The rescue method of choice should allow for rapid placement and should be familiar to the practitioner.
