The back muscles are separated into extrinsic and intrinsic components based on their function in movement and embryological origin. The extrinsic muscles include the trapezius, latissimus dorsi, rhomboid major and minor, levator scapulae, and the serratus posterior superior and inferior muscles. The principal function of the extrinsic muscles of the back is to move the upper extremity by controlling the movement of the scapula and humerus.
