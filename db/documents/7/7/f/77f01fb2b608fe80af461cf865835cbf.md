Complications from airway suctioning are relatively uncommon if performed with care and adequate pre-oxygenation.

- Suctioning can stimulate the vagal nerve, predisposing the patient to bradycardia and hypoxia.

- Hypoxia can be profound from occlusion, interruption of oxygen supply, and prolonged suctioning.

- Mucosal trauma, physical injuries, and bleeding can result from blunt or penetrating trauma.

- Infections can result from the introduction of commensals into the respiratory tract.

- Pain and discomfort can result from suctioning.

- Anxiety can be associated with suctioning.
