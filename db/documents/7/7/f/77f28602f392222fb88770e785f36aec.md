BCTs develop from Kulchitsky cells found within the bronchial mucosa.  They also develop from tracheobronchial tree cartilage, more specifically, the epithelium of this cartilage. The difference between carcinoid tumors and tumorlets is that BCTs exhibit neuroendocrine function. They secrete substances, which are typically peptide hormones and neuroamines, which secrete serotonin, ACTH, somatostatin, and bradykinin.

Bronchial carcinoid tumors are further subclassified into typical and atypical carcinoid tumors based on the presence or absence of tumor suppression marker mutations.  Typical BCTs lack mutations or abnormalities of the p53, BCL2, or BAX genes, while atypical tumors have known expression abnormalities of these genes.

The majority of BCTs arise from the hilum or perihilar region of the lung, 75% of which arise in the lobar bronchi. In comparison, 10% and 15% arise from the mainstem bronchi and periphery, respectively.  These tumors are highly vascularized and polypoid masses, which are less than 3 to 4 cm in size.
