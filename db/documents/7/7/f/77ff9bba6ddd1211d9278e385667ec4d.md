Ozone is a potent oxidant that has the potential to be helpful or harmful, like most other substances depending on the concentration, location, and duration of exposure. For example, ozone has been shown to be beneficial in treating chronic limb ischemia and several kinds of skin infections.

In discussing toxicokinetics, it may be helpful to differentiate the exposure location, as the skin is somewhat tolerant (although chronic contact can be deleterious), while the respiratory system is essentially intolerant and can show harmful effects even at low ambient environmental concentrations. Tissue effects can be considered on the basis of ozone’s specificity to certain compounds in addition to its low aqueous solubility and diffusibility. It is important to note that all possible pathways of injury are not yet known, and some known effects are not yet well understood.

Toxic effects are considered to occur through free radicals and oxidation or through radical-dependent pathways. Aside from the generation of free radicals, ozone can deplete a tissue of specific compounds, such as antioxidants (tocopherols and ascorbate), in separate layers of skin (upper epidermis, lower epidermis, dermis).

While effects are still related to oxidation and inflammatory pathways, the respiratory tract has some mediation through interleukin-8 and growth-related oncogene-α.
