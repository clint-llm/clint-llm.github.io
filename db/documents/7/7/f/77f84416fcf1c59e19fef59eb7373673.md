Tooth eruption is a very complex and finely regulated process that influences the healthy development of the craniofacial region. Factors such as eruption timing, sequence, direction, rate, position, and morphology of teeth are crucial for facial esthetics and phonetics.

Disturbances in tooth eruption are a common problem in dental practice. Tooth eruption may be delayed, completely impaired, or premature, and teeth may also erupt in an ectopic position. This article intends to elucidate what is known about the physiology of normal tooth eruption, but a summary of the common eruption complications is provided below.

**Ectopic Eruption**

When a tooth does not follow its usual course, it is known as an ectopic eruption.

Reports also exist of nasal teeth, which are teeth that appear in the nasal cavity as supernumerary.

**Delayed Eruption**

When the emergence timing deviates significantly from the established norms assigned to ethnicity and sex, the condition is known as a delayed eruption.

It may occur due to local factors (mucosal barrier, gingival fibromatosis, odontogenic and non-odontogenic tumors, premature loss of a primary tooth, radiation damage), systemic conditions, and endocrinal disorders (hypothyroidism,

Long-term chemotherapy or drugs (aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, indomethacin, bisphosphonates) may inhibit the prostaglandins pathway resulting in decreased osteoclastic activity in periodontal tissues, thus, slowing down the rate of eruption.

Chronic and prolonged malnutrition (vitamin deficiencies) during childhood also correlates with delayed eruption.

**Impacted Teeth**

These teeth cannot erupt due to a physical barrier preventing their eruption.

**Embedded Teeth**

These teeth with no physical obstruction in their path remain unerupted due to la ack of eruptive force.

**Submerged Teeth**

Submerged teeth are those that, after the eruption, ankylose and lose their ability to maintain the continuous eruptive potential as the jaws grow.

**Primary Failure of Eruption**

Primary failure of eruption refers to the partial or complete failure of the tooth's eruption.

**Intraosseous Ectopic Migration of Unerupted Teeth**

It is a rare occurrence reported in less than 1% of the population with an increased preference for females and the mandibular arch. It usually involves the mandibular second premolar or the mandibular canine.

**Premature Eruption**

Premature eruption refers to teeth eruption before its stipulated time.Â Teeth present in the oral cavity at the time of birth are referred to as natal teeth, whereas the teeth that erupt within the first month of life are referred to as neonatal teeth.

Premature eruption of teeth can occur due to several factors such as genetic abnormalities, endocrine disturbances (pituitary, thyroid, and gonads), congenital syphilis, local factors (excessive resorption of the overlying bone), environmental factors (environmental pollutants such as toxic polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, and dibenzofurans), poor maternal health, and febrile episodes during pregnancy.

Some syndromes are also reported to be associated with natal teeth and neonatal teeth, such as chondroectodermal dysplasia, Rubinstein-taybi, Pierre-robin, neonatal progeria, cleft lip/palate, ectodermal dysplasia, craniofacial dysostosis, and Down syndrome.

**Natal/Neonatal Teeth**

They may lead to ulceration on the ventral surface of the tongue due to the sharp incisal edge of the tooth.

This condition is known as Riga-Fede disease/syndrome. As the root development of these teeth is incomplete, they are mobile, which increases the possibility of swallowing and aspiration of teeth. Other complications include injury to the mother's breast and difficulty in suckling.

**Eruption Cyst**

An eruption hematoma over an erupting tooth that presents as a bluish swelling due to the filling of blood-tinged fluid in the follicle surrounding the erupting tooth is usually asymptomatic.

**Detrimental Habits that Affect Tooth Eruption**

**Digit Sucking**

This habit affects the eruption path of maxillary incisors resulting in their protrusion due to the disturbance in the balance between the outward force of the tongue musculature on the palate and the inward force of the cheek musculature.

**Tongue Thrust**

In children with tongue thrust habit, greater outward force by the tongue musculature is applied, resulting in a change in the eruption pathway of maxillary incisors.

**Lip Habit**

Sucking or biting the lips, particularly the lower lip, results in more significant inward pressure by the lip musculature, which in turn leads to a change in the eruption path of the mandibular incisors.
