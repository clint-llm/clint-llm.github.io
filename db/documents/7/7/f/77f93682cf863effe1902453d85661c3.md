Complaints that occur in different etiologies of SSC share common symptoms such as a headache (up to 90%), diplopia (up to 90%), painless or painful ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, proptosis, chemosis, facial sensory loss, visual loss, fever, facial asymmetry, hearing loss, and seizure. Assessment should include a determination of whether symptoms are unilateral or bilateral, and if the onset of symptoms is acute, subacute, or chronic, and if conditions are painful or painless.

Physical exam findings depend on the etiology as well as the extent of CS involvement. The following sign(s) may be seen in patients with CCS:

- Involvement of cranial nerves with motor and/or sensory findings: the most common are CN III (85%), VI (70%), V1 and/or V2, and IV

- Reflexes: Decreased or absent corneal, direct and/or indirect light reflexes

- Ophthalmoplegia, painful or painless

- Chemosis, the swelling (or edema) of the conjunctiva

- Proptosis, protrusion or displacement of an eye

- Ocular and cranial bruits

- Funduscopic findings: Papilledema, pallor and/or retinal hemorrhages

- Visual problems: Visual field cut, blurry vision, diplopia and/or vision loss

Common symptoms and signs on presentation can usually accompany the specific etiologies below:

- Cavernous sinus tumors may cause isolated or combined ophthalmoplegia, painful ophthalmoplegia, anesthesia in CNIII, unitemporal or bitemporal visual field defects, acromegaly, and galactorrhea.

- Carotid-cavernous fistulas may cause ocular bruit (auscultated over the globe in high-flow CCFs), proptosis, chemosis, and conjunctival injection, ocular and/or orbital pain, headache, diplopia, blurry vision.

- Cavernous sinus thrombosis may present signs of an infectious process involving paranasal sinuses and/or orbital cellulitis, conjunctival injection, chemosis, proptosis.

- Tolosa-Hunt syndrome may cause typically unilateral (bilateral symptoms 4% to 5%)

- Sarcoidosis may cause systemic signs, uveitis, ophthalmoplegia, and facial diplegia.

- Herpes zoster also may present with acute zoster ophthalmicus, typical skin lesion, and keratitis.
