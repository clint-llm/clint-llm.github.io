Plasminogen activation results in increased conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, the latter an enzyme that breakdowns the fibrinogen in blood clots. There is a wide usage of tissue plasminogen activators in clinical practice during the treatment of ischemic cerebral vascular events. Since ischemic cerebral vascular events are a leading cause of morbidity in the United States, a general understanding of the physiology of plasminogen activation is critical, both as a base for the utilization of these therapies and an understanding of coagulation homeostasis in the body. This article will serve as a review of plasminogen activation with a discussion on inhibitors of plasminogen activation and will conclude with a short discussion on medical thrombolytic therapy.
