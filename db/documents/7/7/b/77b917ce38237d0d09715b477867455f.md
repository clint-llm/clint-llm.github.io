Chorioretinitis is a type of uveitis involving the posterior segment of the eye, which includes inflammation of the choroid and the retina of the eye. Though the term uveitis means inflammation of the uveal tract (iris, ciliary body, and choroid), it can involve the adjacent structures like the retina, retinal vessels, vitreous, optic nerve head, and sclera.
