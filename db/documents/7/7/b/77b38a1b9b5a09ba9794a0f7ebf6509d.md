Irritable bowel syndrome is a complex condition with an unclear etiopathogenesis. Researchers postulated that serotonin might be involved in one of the mechanisms of IBS because greater than 90% of the body's serotonin is present in the enterochromaffin cells of the gut.

Alosetron is a 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT3, serotonin) receptor antagonist that blocks these receptors, thus inhibiting peristalsis and slowing colonic transit time to allow for more water reabsorption to allow for more formed stool.
