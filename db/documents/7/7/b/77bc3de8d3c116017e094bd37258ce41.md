The RNV scan can help examine the anatomy and physiology related to each cardiac cycle. The radionuclide tracer is based on a principle that the amount of radioactivity in each chamber is proportional to the amount of volume in that chamber.

The wall motion can be assessed through the RNV scan and classified as normal wall motion, hypokinetic (decreased wall motion), akinetic (no wall motion), or dyskinetic (paradoxical wall motion). The heart muscle receives its vascular supply through the coronary arteries; the left anterior descending coronary artery supplies the anterior wall, intraventricular septum, apex, and a part of the anterolateral wall of the left ventricle; the left circumflex artery supplies the left atrium, posterolateral wall and a part of the anterolateral wall; and the right coronary artery supplies right ventricle, right atrium and the posterior portion of the intraventricular septum. By delineating the segmental wall motion abnormalities seen with ischemia or infarction, the radionuclide ventriculography can help localize the corresponding coronary artery supplying to the myocardium.
