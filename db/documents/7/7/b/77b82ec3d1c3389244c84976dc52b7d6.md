Medication errors can be detrimental and costly to patients. Drug calculation and basic mathematical skills play a role in the safe administration of medications. Pediatric populations are especially vulnerable to medication errors due to the need to calculate dosages incorporating many factors; height, weight, body surface area, and growth and development level. The higher the complexity of the math, the increased the risk potential for dose calculation errors.

According to a study of intensive care nurses (ICU) in 2016, 80% of nurses considered knowledge on drug dosage calculation essential to decrease medication errors during the preparation of intravenous drugs.

One study by a group of oncology nurses in 3 Swiss hospitals published in 2018 discusses the process of double-checking and its limitations in the current healthcare environment, specifically, increased nurse workload and time constraints, distracting environments, and lack of resources. The study concluded that oncology nurses strongly believed in the effectiveness of double-checking medication despite reporting limitations of the procedure in clinical practice.
