Acute RVT presenting with loin pain and hematuria can mimic renal colic, pyelonephritis, renal papillary necrosis, or renal infarction from renal artery thrombosis or embolism. Renal cyst in adult polycystic kidney disease is another condition to consider. Rarely, a tumor thrombus (extension of a tumor into the vein) may be confused with RVT.
