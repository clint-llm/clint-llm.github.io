Early and timely diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleeding is essential for timely intervention, which can include image-guided minimally invasive endoscopic or surgical intervention. Gastrointestinal bleeding is a noninvasive study and is helpful in determining approximate location and severity of the bleeding with detection rates as low as 0.1 mL/m. GIBS has a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 95%. It has the added benefit of continuous imaging for a longer duration to detect intermittent bleeds. The radiation exposure with GIBS is lower than a three-phase CT Angiography.
