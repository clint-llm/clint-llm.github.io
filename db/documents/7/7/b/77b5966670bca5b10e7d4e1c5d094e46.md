**Laboratory:(optional depending on the clinical scenario)**

CBC (complete blood count) to assess for blood loss

Coagulation studies (only if the patient is known to be on anticoagulants)

**Imaging:**

Plain radiograph of the affected finger/hand and amputated part; this allows assessment of bony injuries, bone quality, and guide decisions regarding bony fixation methods. Angiograms are normally not requested unless it forms part of investigations for other injuries.
