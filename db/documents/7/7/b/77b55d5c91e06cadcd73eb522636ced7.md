Before prescribing escitalopram, a proper risk assessment for hypersensitivity reactions to other medications (especially antidepressants and SSRIs), possible QT prolongation, and serotonin syndrome is indicated for all patients. This drug is contraindicated for patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to escitalopram or citalopram.

Co-administration of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) is also contraindicated with escitalopram due to the risk of causing serotonin syndrome. MAOIs include phenelzine, selegiline, isocarboxazid, and selegiline.

Although it is a relative contraindication, the risk of QT prolongation is another consideration when starting escitalopram. A family history of long QT syndrome, or sudden, premature cardiac death, should be evaluated. Concomitant use of other drugs that can cause prolonged QT syndrome, including antipsychotics (especially older typical antipsychotics), should also be carefully assessed.

In recent years, liver enzyme CYP2C19 activity has been assessed by pharmacogenetics as a determinant for contraindicating escitalopram use. CYP2C19 metabolizes escitalopram, and it is now possible to assess an individual patient's enzyme activity via genetic testing. Poor metabolizers, or those with decreased activity of this enzyme, are shown to have higher concentrations of escitalopram in their bloodstream and are, therefore, at higher risk of adverse drug reactions.

**Box Warning**

Patients taking escitalopram should be monitored for mood or behavioral changes, including suicidality. An increase in suicidal thoughts and self-destructive behavior in pediatric and adolescent patients taking SSRIs have been documented.
