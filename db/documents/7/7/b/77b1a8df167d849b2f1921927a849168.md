In 1847, Latham first introduced the diagnosis of ventricular septal rupture (VSR). The interventricular septum divides the ventricular chamber into right and left ventricles. A rare but lethal complication of acute myocardial infarction is a ventricular septal rupture. The condition is now rare because of an aggressive approach towards early reperfusion therapy; however, mortality is still high. Any part of the interventricular septum can develop a rupture. The size of the rupture determines the prognosis of the patient. This activity describes the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of VSR and highlights the interprofessional team's role in managing these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of ventricular septal rupture (VSR). 
- Outline the clinical presentation of a patient with ventricular septal rupture (VSR). 
- Summarize the treatment options available for ventricular septal rupture (VSR). 
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients with ventricular septal rupture (VSR).
