Symptoms of Addison disease can be nonspecific and, therefore, can be difficult to recognize. A high index of suspicion is required to make this diagnosis. The acute presentation includes cardiovascular collapse and hemodynamic instability.

In the Addisonian crisis, treatment is a priority and should not be delayed for diagnostic confirmation; delayed treatment can be fatal.

Glucocorticoid doses should be doubled in the presence of fever, infection, or other stresses.
