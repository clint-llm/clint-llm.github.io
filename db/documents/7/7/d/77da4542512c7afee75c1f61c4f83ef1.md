The measurement of the post-void residual urine is necessary to establish a baseline level of bladder distension or over-distension.  In general, the greater the amount of residual urine and the longer it has been present, the greater the chance for a prolonged post-obstructive diuresis.

By definition, post-obstructive diuresis is the condition of prolonged urine production of at least 200 cc for at least two consecutive hours immediately following the relief of urinary retention or similar obstructive uropathy. It may also be defined as more than 3,000 cc over 24 hours.
