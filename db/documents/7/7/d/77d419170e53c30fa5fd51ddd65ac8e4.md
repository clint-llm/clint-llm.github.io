Dofetilide is a class III antiarrhythmic agent usually prescribed by the cardiologist. However, these patients are often followed and monitored by the primary care provider, cardiac nurse, and internist. Healthcare providers who look after patients with arrhythmias must know the adverse effects of these agents; this extends to the nursing staff who will administer the drug and most likely perform the initial observation of any adverse effects or drug interactions.

Pharmacists should verify dosing and perform thorough medication reconciliation to rule out drug interactions and ensure proper dosing, preventing potentially severe adverse effects. They should communicate any concerns to the physician or nursing staff to initiate appropriate corrective action.

All class III (potassium channel blockers) antiarrhythmic drugs are proarrhythmic as well. Therefore, extreme care should is necessary for clinicians when prescribing dofetilide.

All healthcare workers, including the cardiac nurse and pharmacist, should consult with a cardiologist regarding any potential changes in dosing or administration schedule.

As demonstrated above, an interprofessional team approach with open lines of communication is the optimal approach to dofetilide therapy so that patients can achieve the best possible outcomes. [Level 5]
