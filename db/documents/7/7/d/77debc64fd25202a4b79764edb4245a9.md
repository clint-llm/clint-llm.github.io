The only absolute contraindication to the usage of terazosin is allergy or hypersensitivity to the medication. Relative contraindications include usage in geriatric populations due to the potential for patient harm associated with syncope and/or postural hypotension due to terazosin use, patients with heart failure, and general intolerance of the adverse effects associated with terazosin.

While terazosin is not contraindicated for use in pediatric populations, caution is advised due to limited data available regarding the use of the drug in children. However, there are small studies of safe usage in children without adverse outcomes.

**Warnings**

**Prostatic Cancer**

BPH and prostate carcinoma can cause many similar symptoms, and both diseases usually co-exist. Hence, patients thought to have benign prostatic hyperplasia should be tested before starting terazosin to exclude the carcinoma of the prostate.

**Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS)**

During cataract surgery, IFIS has been observed in some patients treated with alpha-1 blockers presently or in the past. Therefore, the ophthalmologist should consider possible modifications of surgical techniques, such as using iris dilator rings, iris hooks, or viscoelastic substances. There is no benefit of stopping terazosin before cataract surgery.
