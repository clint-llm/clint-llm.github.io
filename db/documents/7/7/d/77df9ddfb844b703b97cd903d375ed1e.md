A patient with oxazepam overdose typically presents with normal vital signs with severe CNS depression. Clinical symptoms may include ataxia, slurred speech, confusion, drowsiness, and lethargy. Comatose patients are also commonly seen with severe toxicity. Respiratory compromise most commonly occurs when patients intentionally ingest benzodiazepine with another sedative agent such as an opioid. Oxazepam is the least sedating among all benzodiazepines due to slower absorption.

If toxicity is suspected, maintenance of airway, breathing, and circulation must be rapid and immediate. Intubation may be necessary if there is a severe compromise.

If the clinician suspects an isolated oxazepam overdose with a patient having stable hemodynamics and a relatively normal physical examination, monitoring of vital signs and clinical observation are appropriate.

Patients who exhibit respiratory compromise due to oxazepam toxicity may have also taken another drug such as an opioid. Therefore, it may be appropriate to administer naloxone. Clinicians can administer flumazenil, a competitive benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, to reverse an overdose. However, the administration may precipitate withdrawal seizures in patients who chronically use benzodiazepines and have developed tolerance.
