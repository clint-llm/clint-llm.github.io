Informed consent must be obtained from the patient prior to performing the procedure. The patient should be placed in a supine position with the wrist slightly palmar flexed. A rolled sheet or towel can be placed under the wrist for proper positioning. All landmarks are identified with the needle site marked. The area can be cleaned with either betadine or chlorhexidine. Lidocaine 1% or 2% can be used for local anesthetic. However, some clinicians choose to use a topical ethyl chloride alone or no local anesthesia at all.
