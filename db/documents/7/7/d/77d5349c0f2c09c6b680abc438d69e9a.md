When electrical alternans is found on an ECG, further evaluation is needed because treatment will vary based on the underlying pathophysiology. Therefore, a thorough history and examination of the patient are necessary to focus on the cardiovascular and pulmonary exam. In the case of pericardial effusion, patients are usually asymptomatic unless tamponade physiology is present. Signs of tamponade include Becks triad: hypotension, muffled heart sounds, and distended neck veins. Additional signs of tamponade may also include tachypnea and dyspnea in the form of Kussmaul breathing and Pulsus Paradoxus.
