Cardiac toxicity is a known side effect of radiation therapy delivered to the thoracic region. Therapeutic radiation plays a role in the treatment of many malignant and a few benign conditions. As overall survival for cancer patients improves with the development of new therapies and detection of disease at earlier stages, long-term toxicities of treatment become more relevant. This activity describes the pathophysiology of radiation-induced cardiac toxicity, cardiac toxicity mitigation techniques, and the need for team-based monitoring and identification of undesired cardiac toxicity to improve long-term patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of radiation therapy-induced cardiac toxicity.
- Identify risk factors for patients at increased risk for suffering major adverse cardiac events resulting from therapeutic radiation.
- Describe the symptomatic presentation associated with a patient with radiation therapy-induced cardiac toxicity.
- Describe how interprofessional team measures can help reduce radiation dose to prevent radiation therapy-induced cardiac toxicity.
