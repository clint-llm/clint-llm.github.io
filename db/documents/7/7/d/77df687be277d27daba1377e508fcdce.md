Determination of true clinical incidence & prevalence of pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis is challenging, given subtle symptoms & delayed diagnostic consideration often resulting in post mortem confirmation. Pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis represents only 6 to 8% of pulmonary metastasis.

Lymphangitic carcinomatosis seems to occur in the age of 40Â to 49 years.
