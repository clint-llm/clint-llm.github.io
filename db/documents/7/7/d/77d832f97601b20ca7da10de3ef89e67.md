The most common adverse effect of inhaled anesthetic agents is postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). There has been some evidence showing that intravenous anesthesia instead of inhaled agents reduces the risk of PONV.

Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is also an adverse effect that can occur with the administration of inhaled anesthetics, most commonly seen with the inhaled gas halothane. Patients susceptible to this adverse effect have heritable alterations between their proteins and muscular cytosolic concentrations of Ca2+.

A few inhalation agents are known to irritate the airways of patients with severe asthma and induce bronchospasm due to the pungent smell on induction, primarily with desflurane and isoflurane. Other agents like sevoflurane can be used in asthmatic patients to help relax the airways on induction as they do not have such pungent smells.

Isoflurane, sevoflurane, desflurane will decrease systemic vascular resistance leading to a drop in systemic blood pressure. These changes are more profound in hypovolemic patients.

Nitrous oxide can cause diffusion hypoxiaÂ quickly following discontinuation of the agent. It is recommended that 100% FiO2 be used to counteract the rapid dilution of O2 in the alveoli.
