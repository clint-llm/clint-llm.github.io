Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is an uncommon soft tissue tumor that involves the dermis, subcutaneous fat, and in rare cases, muscle and fascia. The tumor typically presents as a slowly growing, firm plaque on the trunk of young adults. The cause of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is not clearly understood, though studies have implicated a chromosomal translocation that results in a fusion protein that promotes tumor growth through the overproduction of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Diagnosis is made via skin biopsy. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans and stresses the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the population most at risk for developing dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.
- Review the typical clinical presentation of a patient with dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.
- Outline the treatment strategy for a patient with dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance outcomes for patients affected by dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.
