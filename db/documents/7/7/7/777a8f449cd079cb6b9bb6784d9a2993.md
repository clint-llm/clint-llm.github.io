A study examining cadaveric specimens looked at specific ligaments of the MCL (anterior bundle, posterior bundle, and transverse ligament). Specifically, they focused on the transverse ligament and its relationship with the anterior ligament. The majority of the transverse ligament continues to the distal half of the anterior ligament, and less common variants included transverse ligaments that traveled the entire anterior ligament.

There is minimal variation with the anterior and posterior bundles. Of note, while the most common insertion site for the anterior bundle of the MCL is the sublime tubercle, variations have been found. Studies have found anterior bundle insertion only 1 mm away from the joint line. Other studies have found the insertion of the anterior bundle to be 3 mm more distal. This distal insertion has clinical relevance because it creates a small recess on arthrograms, which simulates a partial undersurface tear of the anterior bundle.

An accessory or "extra bundle" ligament belonging to the MCL was also present in a quarter of examined specimens found in one study. The addition of this ligament creates an MCL comprised of four ligaments. The extra-bundle ligament originates from the posteromedial aspect of the capsule and inserts on the transverse bundle. The transverse bundle itself has a variation of a fanlike distribution with insertions onto the anterior bundle and coronoid; this creates a strong oblique pattern on imaging.
