The etiology of congenital lobar emphysema in not known in 50% of the patients. In 25% of the patients, there is an absence of bronchial cartilage, hypoplasia, or dysplasia. Due to absent or defective cartilage, there is bronchial collapse and thus air trapping during expiration. The congenital lobar emphysema could be due to:

- Idiopathic in 50% of the cases.

- Absence of bronchial cartilage, hypoplasia, or dysplasia in 25% of patients

- Parenchymal diseases.

- External bronchial obstruction.

- Internal bronchial obstruction.

Congenital lobar emphysema could be due to parenchymal disease like a poly-alveolar lobe. A poly-alveolar lobe theory for the etiology of congenital lobar emphysema proposed that there could be a 3-Â to 5-fold increase in the number of alveoli in the affected lobes of the lung compared to normal lobes. The reason behind air trapping in poly-alveolar lobes is not known.
