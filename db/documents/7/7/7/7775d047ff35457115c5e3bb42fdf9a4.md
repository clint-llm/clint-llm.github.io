The nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) emtricitabine is used in combination with other antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the treatment of HIV-1, HIV-2, and hepatitis B virus (HBV). It is also used in combination therapy for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection. Emtricitabine is FDA-approved for use in HIV treatment but is not FDA-approved for the treatment of HBV. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, pharmacology, monitoring, and relevant interactions of emtricitabine, pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the treatment of patients with HIV or who require HIV prophylaxis.

**Objectives:**
- Review the mechanism of action of NRTIs including emtricitabine.
- Identify the regimens for HIV treatment and prevention that use emtricitabine as a component.
- Outline the need for monitoring and followup when prescribing antiretroviral therapy where emtricitabine is involved.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients when using ART, including with emtricitabine.
