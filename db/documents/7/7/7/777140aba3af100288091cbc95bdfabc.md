The superior oblique muscle attaches to the trochleaâ€”a fibrous, cartilaginous pulley attached to the trochlear fovea of the frontal bone. Originating from the periosteal covering of the sphenoid, the superior oblique reaches the trochlea by passing along the medial border of the roof of the orbit. Upon reaching the trochlea, the superior oblique tendon turns posterolaterally to cross the eyeball and continues to reach its insertion point on the outer posterior quadrant of the eyeball.

This unique path of the superior oblique muscle allows the eye to distinctively move down and out (i.e., inferolaterally) when contracted. However, under normal circumstances, this muscle does not act in isolation, and instead, its movements combine with other extraocular muscles. One such combined movement is the depression of the eye when the medial rectus has adducted the eye. Depression of the eye is normally the function of the inferior rectus muscle; however, adduction of the eye neutralizes the mechanical positioning of the inferior rectus.
