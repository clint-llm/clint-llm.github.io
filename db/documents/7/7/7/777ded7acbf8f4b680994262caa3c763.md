The following represent key points in patient education:

- Patients should be advised to present to their emergency department if they experience heavy vaginal bleeding(two pads per hour for approximately two consecutive hours).

- Signs and symptoms of infection should be discussed with patients especially following surgical management.

- Treatment with misoprostol can cause a febrile reaction which can be misinterpreted as a sign of infection.

- Prophylactic antibiotics are not routinely administered but can be considered in select patients.

- Patients should adhere to follow-up sonogram and outpatient appointments especially when additional doses of misoprostol are considered to be clinically necessary.

- A miscarriage can be a traumatic experience for a patient. Reassurance and empathy play a key role in helping patients through the grieving process.
