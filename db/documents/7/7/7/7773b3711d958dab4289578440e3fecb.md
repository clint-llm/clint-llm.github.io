The symptoms of patients with emphysematous cholecystitis often are suggestive of acute cholecystitis which can be indistinguishable from that of any other acute upper abdominal pathology such as a liver abscess or a perforated duodenal ulcer. The usual combination of presenting symptoms are right upper quadrant pain and fever with nausea or vomiting. The lack of dramatic symptoms often does not alert the clinician to an underlying sinister pathology. The symptoms may be trivial in patients with associated diabetes and renal failure; however, the patient's condition may rapidly deteriorate despite the moderate pain. If not treated early, the patient can progress to a clinical picture of frank sepsis and shock. Signs of peritonitis is an indication of perforation. Whenever there is a delay, the patient can present with tachycardia, hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse.
