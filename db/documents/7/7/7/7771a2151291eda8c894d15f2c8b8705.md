Nucleus pulposus herniation is the most common cause of radicular pain in the lumbar spine and the second most common cause in the cervical spine after degenerative spondylosis; however, other conditions in the differential diagnosis should be considered such as:

- Conjoined nerve root

- Facet joint cyst

- Facet joint/ligamentum flavum hypertrophy

- Neurinoma/schwannoma

- Spondylolisthesis
