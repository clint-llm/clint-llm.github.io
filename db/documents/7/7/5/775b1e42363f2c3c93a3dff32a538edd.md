Peripheral nerve injury can vary wildly in severity and presentation, ranging from mild soreness to severe muscle weakness. Axillary nerve injuries typically respond well to conservative management, though a surgical intervention may be required. Failure to accurately diagnose and manage patients may lead to life-long disability that can affect the overall quality of life. While axillary nerve lesions are somewhat rare, they must be considered in patients presenting with shoulder weakness and sensory loss. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients with axillary nerve injuries and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the typical presentation of a patient with an axillary nerve injury.
- Describe the proper evaluation of a patient with a suspected axillary nerve injury.
- Summarize the treatment options available for patients with axillary nerve injuries.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with axillary nerve injuries.
