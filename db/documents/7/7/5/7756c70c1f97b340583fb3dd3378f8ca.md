Patients with urethritis may present to the emergency department, urgent care clinic, or primary care provider. It is important for these healthcare professionals to be aware ofÂ the cause of urethritis and its treatment. In many cases, the treatment is empirical until the laboratory has confirmed the diagnosis.

Patients should be instructed to avoid sex for 1 week and until partners are treated. Partners should be tested and treated for urethritis.
