Treatment of diabetic foot ulcer should be systematic for an optimal outcome.  The most important point is to identify if there is any evidence of ongoing infection, by obtaining a history of chills, fever, looking for the presence of purulence or presence of at least two signs of inflammation that includes, pain, warmth, erythema or induration of the ulcer. It should is noteworthy that even in the presence of severe diabetic foot infection, there can be minimal systemic signs of infection.

The next step is to decide if the patient’s ulcer can is manageable in the outpatient setting or inpatient setting. Need for parenteral antibiotics, concern for noncompliance, inability to care for the wound, ability to offload pressure, are few points to be considered for hospitalization.

The common organisms seen in a diabetic foot ulcer are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and rarely E. coli. Diabetes patients have higher carriage rate of Staphylococcus aureus in the nares and skin, and this increases the chances of infection of the ulcer.

The typical outpatient antibiotics regimen includes oral cephalosporins, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination, (If MRSA is not of concern). If MRSA is suspected, then the oral regimens include linezolid, clindamycin or cephalexin plus doxycycline or a trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole combination.

Parenteral antibiotic regimens include piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin-sulbactam, and if penicillin-allergic, then carbapenems including ertapenem or meropenem. The other combinations regimen including adding metronidazole for anaerobic coverage along with quinolones like ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin, or with cephalosporins like ceftriaxone, cefepime or ceftazidime. Intravenous agents which cover MRSA include vancomycin, linezolid or daptomycin.

The next therapeutic step is to treat any underlying peripheral vascular disease. Inadequate blood supply limits the oxygen supply and the delivery of the antibiotics to the ulcer; hence revascularization improves both, and there is a better chance for the healing of the ulcer.  The subsequent step is to perform local debridement or removal of calluses.

Vacuum assisted closure can be undertaken for clean non healing wounds. Others may benefit from hydrotherapy to get rid of infected debris.

If the patient has charcot foot, then the initial treatment is immobilization with braces or specially made shoes, but most will require a surgical procedure like arthrodesis or an osteotomy.

Finally, efforts should be made for the prevention of new ulcers or worsening of the existing ulcer, which occurs by offloading the pressure from the site by using walkers or therapeutic shoes.

To have the best outcome a team of health care providers including primary care physician, podiatrist, a vascular surgeon, an infectious disease specialist and wound care nursing staff are imperative.
