Due to the respiratory insufficiency caused by paralyzing respiratory muscles, vecuronium only should be administered by experienced healthcare providers equipped with the necessary skills for advanced airway management. Assisted or controlled ventilation using a bag-valve-mask connected to supplemental oxygen or a mechanical ventilator should be readily accessible. Closely monitor the patient's blood pressure, heart rate, and peripheral nerve stimulation before administering vecuronium. Furthermore, the clinician should also have reversal agents immediately available.
