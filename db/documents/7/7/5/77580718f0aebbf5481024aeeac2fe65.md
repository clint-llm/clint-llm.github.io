There are many causes of lipodystrophies. Healthcare workers who encounter patients with lipodystrophy should refer these patients to a plastic surgeon or a dermatologist. Lipodystrophy does not only result in poor cosmesis but it is also associated with metabolic complications. Hence, a referral to an internist is also recommended.

Management of lipodystrophies is dependent upon the specific subtype and the extent of associated metabolic abnormalities. For patients with severe metabolic derangement, it is important to implement the use of lipid-lowering agents and diabetic medications. With a goal of increasing insulin sensitivity, pioglitazone has been shown to be more efficacious than metformin in this patient population. Severe cases may require insulin. Leptin analogs, particularlyÂ metreleptin, have shown efficacy in maintaining normal metabolism in patients who cannot effectively synthesize leptin naturally. Metreleptin is recombinant human leptin and the only FDA-approved replacement therapy for certain patients with lipodystrophy.
