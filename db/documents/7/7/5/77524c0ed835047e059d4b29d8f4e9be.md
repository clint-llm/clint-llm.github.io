In most patients with hemiplegic migraine, aura symptoms resolve completely, although they may be prolonged. In rare cases, hemiplegic migraine leads to permanent neurological deficits, cerebral infarctions, cognitive decline, or death. Poor outcomes are often associated with an early onset of hemiplegic migraine with severe attacks, recurrent coma, or seizures. The frequency of attacks decreases after age 50 as the hemiplegic attacks evolve into more typical migraine attacks without motor symptoms. Migraine with aura increases the risk of stroke in individuals, and it is important to remember that patients with hemiplegic migraine can have strokes. Further, acute ischemic strokes can also occur in these individuals due to vascular risk factors. Hence acute stroke interventions and vascular risk factor reduction must be considered in such individuals.
