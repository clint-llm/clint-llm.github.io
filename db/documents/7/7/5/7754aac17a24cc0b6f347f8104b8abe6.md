The complications associated with pudendal nerve blocks are rare. These complicationsÂ include:

- Laceration of the vaginal mucosa

- Accidental intravascular injection of a local anesthetic can cause cardiovascular and CNS toxicity. The patient can present with palpitations, hypotension, bradycardia, dysarthria, tinnitus, drowsiness, confusion, loss of consciousness, and convulsions.

- Hematoma from injury to the pudendal artery or surrounding vessels

- Infection and/or pain at the injection site

- Abscess formation

Pudendal decompression surgery may also produce complications, although these are also uncommon. There can be an injury to a small branch of the nerve during surgery. A microsurgical repair of the injured nerve can be performed if necessary. An injury or transection of the sacrotuberous ligament can occur during surgery. This would cause an unstable pelvis. (Using a midline vertical incision would help avoid this rare complication.)

Relief from surgery is rarely immediate. Rather, the pain slowly decreases over a period of months. This is not a complication of the surgery but rather just the expected healing process.
