Aspiration of gastric acid into the bronchial tree can lead to chemical pneumonitis. Depending on the volume of aspirated material, it may be unilateral or bilateral. Often, because the right main-stem bronchus is less acutely angled at the carina, it affects the right lower lobe. However, based on the patient's position at the time of aspiration, any lobe may be affected, or all of them given a sufficiently large volume. In chemical aspiration, the injury to the bronchial mucosa is instantaneous. If witnessed, and the equipment is available, bronchoalveolar lavage may be performed to clear the airways and prevent obstruction. However, the tissue reaction to the acid naturally causes increased permeability of the mucosa and neutralization of the acid. The pH of the aspirate is also important, with the highest risk when aspirates are below 2.5 pH.
