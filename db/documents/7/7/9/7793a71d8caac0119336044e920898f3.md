After verifying the appropriate placement site, place the pulse oximeter so that the light will penetrate through the tissue and be picked up by the detector. When placing the pulse oximeter on a fingertip, the probe must fit the finger well. It should not be too tight or too loose. Take extra caution to make sure the probe does not restrict circulation to the digit, as this may provide an inaccurate reading. There are also probes made for the earlobe. In an emergency, the pulse oximeter may have to be placed on the fingertip sideways as nail polish or pigment may obstruct the light.
