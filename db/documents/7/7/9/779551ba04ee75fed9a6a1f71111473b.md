Lower blepharoplasty is performed for many reasons, although the commonest presentation by patients is one of "looking old" or "looking tired." Other complaints may include "baggy eyelids," swollen eyelids that are worse in the morning, and "my photographs make me look tired." There are many different techniques available when performing lower blepharoplasty, and modern surgeons must perform a careful preoperative assessment in order to choose procedures to optimize cosmetic and functional results for each patient. Surgeons must possess a thorough understanding of each surgical technique to ensure adequate patient selection for the procedure and ensure optimal outcomes. This activity reviews the role of the interprofessional team in the care of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures, indications, and contraindications of lower lid blepharoplasty via a subciliary approach.
- Describe the technique necessary to perform blepharoplasty via a subciliary approach.
- Review the potential complications of blepharoplasty via a subciliary approach.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication when considering blepharoplasty via a subciliary approach to improving outcomes.
