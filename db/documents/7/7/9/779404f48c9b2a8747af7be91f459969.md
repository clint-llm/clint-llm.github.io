Diverticulosis is a clinical condition in which multiple sac-like protrusions (diverticula) develop along the gastrointestinal tract. Though diverticula may form at weak points in the walls of either the small or large intestines, the majority occur in the large intestine (most commonly the sigmoid colon). The majority of individuals with diverticulosis are asymptomatic. Diverticular disease occurs when there is symptomatic diverticulosis (e.g., diverticular bleeding); diverticulitis (e.g., acute or chronic inflammation that may or may not is complicated by abscess formation, fistula formation, bowel obstruction, or perforation); or associated segmental colitis (e.g., inflammation in segments of the mucosal segments of the colon in between diverticula). This activity reviews the causes, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of diverticulosis and highlights the interprofessional team's role in managing these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of diverticulosis.
- Describe the workup of a patient with diverticulosis.
- Summarize the treatment options for diverticulosis.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by diverticulosis.
