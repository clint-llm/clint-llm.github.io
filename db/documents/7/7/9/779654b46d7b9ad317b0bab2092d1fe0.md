Anatomical variants of the trapezius muscle, though statistically rare, are noteworthy and diverse. Many of these variants are developmental in nature and related to agenesis of the trapezius, whether unilateral or bilateral, resulting in hypoplasia or accessory lobes of muscle.

One reported case of heritable absence of the trapezius reported that the daughter of two parents with absent trapezius muscles also had the absence of the muscle. Other phenomenaÂ would be dysfunction or absence of the spinal accessory nerve (CN XI), causing hypoplasia of the trapezius muscles, not an actual absence.
