With increasing misinformation about cannabis being safe with no risks, it is important to bring evidence to the discussion. Providers need to educate patients, especially those under the age of 21, who are at a higher risk for long-term, potentially irreversible, cognitive impairments. Pregnant patients should be counseled, whether they admit to usage or not, on the potential impact of cannabis on the fetus. Adults should be informed that cannabis and its paraphernalia should be kept in a locked and hidden location to prevent pediatric intoxication if they desire to use it. Despite the legalization of medical marijuana in many states, employers can still enforce their company policies and terminate workers who present to work intoxicated or test positive for cannabis.
