The treatment for DIC centers on addressing the underlying disorder which ultimately led to this condition. Consequently, therapies such as antibiotics for severe sepsis, possible delivery for placental abruption, and possible exploratory surgical intervention for trauma represent the mainstays of treatment for DIC. Platelet and plasma transfusions should only be considered in patients with active bleeding or a high risk of bleeding or those patients requiring an invasive procedure. A common threshold utilized for platelet transfusions in this patient population is less than 50 x 10^9 platelets per liter for actively hemorrhaging patients and 10-20 x 10^9 platelets per liter for those not actively bleeding but at high risk of future bleeding. Likewise, fresh frozen plasma, typically at a dose of 15 mL/kg to 30 mL/kg, and cryoprecipitate can be transfused to replenish coagulation factors. Prothrombin complex concentrate may also be considered; however, this formulation only contains some coagulation factors and will only somewhat correct a patient’s hemostasis. Heparin may also become necessary if a patient has extensive clotting, as this medication may prevent further activation of the clotting cascade. Patients with DIC who are not actively bleeding should receive prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).
