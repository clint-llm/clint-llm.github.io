The anterior and posterior-lateral nasal arteries are branches of the external carotid system, and between them, significant portions of both the external nose and the nasal cavity are perfused. The excellent collateral circulation of the nose permits rapid healing and infection resistance, as well as the flexibility to manipulate tissue extensively for reconstructive purposes.
