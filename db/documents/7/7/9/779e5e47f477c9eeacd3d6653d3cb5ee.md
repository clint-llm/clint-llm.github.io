The Dix-Hallpike maneuver should be avoided in a patient with neck pathology, in whom the movements involved could be dangerous to the patient. Cervical instability, vascular problems like vertebrobasilar insufficiency and carotid sinus syncope, acute neck trauma and cervical disc prolapse are absolute contraindications. In patients without an absolute contraindication, one paper suggests briefly assessing neck rotation and extension before attempting the maneuver to see ifÂ these positions can be comfortably maintained for thirty seconds.
