Hyperkalemia is the most prevalent and life-threatening hazard of potassium therapy. ECG changes are the most critical indicator of silent potassium toxicity. They include tall, peaked T waves, ST-segment depression, the disappearance of the P wave, QT interval prolongation, and widening of the QRS complex with slurring. Clinical signs and symptoms of hyperkalemia include paresthesias, drowsiness, mental confusion, flaccid paralysis, gray pallor, cold skin, peripheral vascular collapse with a fall in blood pressure, critical cardiac arrhythmias, and heart block.

Treatment of hyperkalemia is dependant on its severity, and there are multiple regimens available.not receiving cardiac glycosides should immediately be given calcium gluconate or another calcium salt IV with continuous ECG monitoring to antagonize the cardiotoxic effects of potassium. If abnormalities on the ECG persist, repeated doses of the calcium salt may be given.

When the ECG normalizes, the subsequent efforts should point toward removing potassium from the body. Some potassium adsorption can be accomplished by administering sodium polystyrene sulfonate orally or as an enema. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis will reduce plasma potassium concentrations and can be necessary for patients with renal insufficiency.
