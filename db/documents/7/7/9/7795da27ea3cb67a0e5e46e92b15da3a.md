Biopsy of lesional skin for histopathology is recommended. (See Histopathology for findings.)

Biopsy of perilesional skin for direct immunofluorescence (DIF) is recommended. DIF typically demonstrates IgG and C3 as a linear band at the basement membrane zone.

Indirect immunofluorescence is recommended; however, it is only positive in a small percentage of patients. The titer is usually low.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing for the presence of anti-BP180 C terminal domain and anti-laminin 332 may be helpful in diagnosis; however, this may not be readily available through all laboratories.
