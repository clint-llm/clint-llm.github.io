At least 150 to 200 million peripheral intravenous (PIV) catheters are placed each year in the United States, and up to 80 percent of patients receive a PIV during their hospital stay. Unfortunately, many factors may complicate the process of obtaining PIV access, a few of which include obesity, intravenous drug abuse, and hypovolemia. This activity describes the technique for ultrasound-guided intravenous access and highlights the role of this technique in avoiding complications and enhancing patient comfort. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the contraindications to ultrasound-guided venous access.
- Describe the indications for ultrasound-guided venous access.
- Review the technique involved in ultrasound-guided venous access.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the utilization of ultrasound-guided venous access and improve outcomes.
