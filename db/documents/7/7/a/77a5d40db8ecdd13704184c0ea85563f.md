Mechanical aortic valve replacement requires open-heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Any contraindication to cardiopulmonary bypass and higher frailty index making the patient an unsuitable candidate for the cardiopulmonary bypass should be considered as a contraindication for mechanical aortic valve replacement. In this case, the patient should be evaluated for transcatheter valve replacement.
