Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2, has overwhelmed many healthcare systems worldwide. Remdesivir is the first and only currently available therapeutic drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use in managing patients with severe suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection.

Although remdesivir has been approved by the FDA, there is limited published data regarding its long-term adverse effects and interaction with other drugs. Hence its clinical use in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 illness requires an interprofessional team that includes physicians across specialties, nurses, and pharmacists who should be aware of the mechanism of action reported, potential side effects, drug-drug interactions, and recommended doses. The patient should receive the fact sheet issued by the US FDA before receiving the drug. There should be close communication between the ordering physician, the pharmacist, and the nurse. Such a holistic approach would lead to the early identification of potential side effects and drug-drug interactions associated with this drug.
