The forearm fractures are common in the pediatric population, with an incidence of around 1 in 100 children each year, and the peak incidence occurs in the 5 to 14 years age group accounting for approximately 34% of the cases. Both bone diaphyseal forearm fractures constitute around 5.4% of all fractures in children under 16 years of age. Among adults, a relatively higher incidence is reported between 25 to 34 years of age group.

In the forearm fractures, the most common site is at the distal radius or ulna (32.9%), and the least common location is the proximal region (2.8%). Open fractures, on the other hand, most commonly involve the diaphyseal region.
