Arrhythmias originating from the ventricular myocardium or His-Purkinje system are grouped under ventricular arrhythmia (VA). This includes a subset of arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), premature ventricular contractions (PVC), and ventricular flutter. Wide complex tachycardia (WCT) is used to define all tachyarrhythmia with QRS complex duration greater than 0.12 seconds. VF is a WCT caused by irregular electrical activity and characterized by a ventricular rate of usually greater than 300 with discrete QRS complexes on the electrocardiogram (ECG). QRS morphology in VF varies in shape, amplitude, and duration with a prominent irregular rhythm.

VF has been identified in nearly 70% of cardiac arrest patients. Without treatment, the condition is fatal within minutes. The rates of survival for VF patients outside the hospitals have increased slightly but many continue to have residual anoxic brain damage and neurological deficits.
