The pericardium is a double-layered, fibro-elastic sac surrounding the heart. It consists of a visceral layer overlying the epicardium, and a richly innervated parietal layer, separated by a potential space which normally contains 15 to 50 mL of serous fluid.

Frequently, pericardial inflammation can be accompanied by increased fluid accumulation within the pericardial sac forming a pericardial effusion, which may be serous, hemorrhagic or purulent depending on etiology. This fluid accumulation may become hemodynamically significant, particularly when the pericardial effusion is large, or rate of accumulation is too rapid, as the fluid can extrinsically compress the cardiac chambers limiting diastolic filling and causing the syndrome of cardiac tamponade.

The aforementioned pericardial syndromes may be seen in association with acute pericarditis, but are not a prerequisite for the diagnosis, and will be discussed in more detail elsewhere.
