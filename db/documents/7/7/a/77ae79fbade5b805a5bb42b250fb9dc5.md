During the sixth week of development of the human embryo, the early lymphatic system is composed of blunt buds near the base of the neck. Six lymph sacs form by the end of the embryonic period. These lymph sacs are the cisterna chyli, two jugular lymph sacs, two iliac lymph sacs, and a retroperitoneal lymph sac. Lymphatic vessels develop to connect these sacs and form the early lymphatic system. The thoracic duct develops from lymphatic trunks on either side of the aorta that anastomoses to form a channel from the jugular lymph sacs to the cisterna chyli. Trunks continue to anastomose and enlarge, forming embryonic right and left thoracic ducts. The adult thoracic duct is derived from both of these embryonic thoracic ducts. The right primitive thoracic duct eventually develops into the lower adult thoracic duct whereas the left primitive thoracic duct develops into the upper portion of the adult thoracic duct.
