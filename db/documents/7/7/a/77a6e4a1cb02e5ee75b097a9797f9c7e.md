The shoulder movements are the integrated response of all the muscles of the body (fixers, facilitators, antagonists, etc.), but in particular, from the proprioceptive information of the elbow.

The first rib in an inspiratory position or the first four dorsal vertebrae can limit the movement of shoulder abduction, as well as all the joints that form the thoracic outlet (clavicle-sternum, clavicle-scapula, rib-sternum, rib-vertebra).
