An untreated parathyroid adenoma could cause complications related to hypercalcemia. A rare clinical phenomenon is a parathyroid crisis, which is characterized by extremely high calcium levels, usually more than 15 mg/dL. Symptoms include changes in mental status leading to nervous system failure and coma.

Complications can also arise with resection of the parathyroid adenoma. Injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve is a serious complication of endocrine surgery and has consequences of hoarseness (unilateral damage) or airway occlusion (bilateral damage). Direct trauma to the nerve due to clipping, grasping, or stretching can cause damage. Indirect deleterious effects on the nerve include skeletonization, thermal injury, or compression. The damage may be transient in cases of compression or stretching and may resolve in 4 to 6 weeks. However, if improvement in function is not seen after 6 to 12 months, the damage should be presumed to be permanent. If the damage is recognized intraoperatively, immediate primary repair or grafting should be performed.
