Structurally and phylogenetically, SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and is composed of four main structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E) glycoprotein, nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M) protein, along with 16 nonstructural proteins, and 5-8 accessory proteins.****

SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into the hosts' cells by binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike or S protein (S1) to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors abundantly on respiratory epithelium such as type II alveolar epithelial cells. Besides the respiratory epithelium, ACE2 receptors are also expressed by other organs, such as the upper esophagus, enterocytes from the ileum, myocardial cells, proximal tubular cells of the kidney, and urothelial cells of the bladder.

The viral attachment process is followed by priming the spike protein S2 subunit by the host transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) that facilitates cell entry and subsequent viral replication endocytosis with the assembly of virions.

Genetic variation in the viral genes of SARS-CoV-2 can have implications for its pathogenesis, especially if it involves the RBD, which mediates viral entry into the host cells and is an essential target of vaccine sera monoclonal antibodies. As described previously, the three reported VOCs (B.1.1.7; B.1.351; and P.1) have mutations in the RBD and the NTD, of which N501Y mutation located on the RBD is common to all variants and results in increased affinity of the spike protein to ACE 2 receptors enhancing the viral attachment and its subsequent entry into the host cells. Although the respiratory system is the predominant target for SARS-CoV-2, as described above, it can affect other major organ systems such as the gastrointestinal tract (GI), hepatobiliary, cardiovascular, renal, and central nervous systems. SARS-CoV-2–induced organ dysfunction, in general, is possibly explained by either one or a combination of the proposed mechanisms, such as direct viral toxicity, ischemic injury caused by vasculitis, thrombosis, or thrombo-inflammation, immune dysregulation, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) dysregulation.

- **Effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the Central Nervous System (CNS)**
- There is emerging evidence of ACE2 receptors in human and mouse brains, indicating the potential brain infection by SARS-CoV-2. Zubair et al. outlined that neuroinvasion by SARS-CoV-2 can occur with various possible routes, such as transsynaptic transfer across infected neurons via the olfactory nerve, vascular endothelial cell infection, or migration of leukocytes across the blood-brain barrier.

- **Effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the Cardiovascular system**
- The pathogenesis of CVS involvement in COVID-19 is unknown and is likely multifactorial, and several theories have been postulated. ACE2 receptors are also exhibited by myocardial cells implicating direct cytotoxicity by the SARS-CoV-2 on the myocardium leading to myocarditis. Conversely, the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 can lead to vascular inflammation, myocarditis, and cardiac arrhythmias.
- Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is also a well-recognized cardiac manifestation of COVID-19. It is likely multifactorial due to the associated thrombogenicity associated with this virus and possibly due to the release of inflammatory cytokines, which may reduce coronary blood flow, reduce oxygen supply resulting in the destabilization of coronary plaque microthrombogenesis.

- **Effect of SARS-CoV-2****on the Gastrointestinal (GI) Tract**
- The pathogenesis of GI manifestations of COVID-19 is unknown and is likely multifactorial. Several mechanisms have been proposed, including the direct ACE 2-mediated viral cytotoxicity of the intestinal mucosa, cytokine-induced inflammation, gut dysbiosis, and vascular abnormalities.

- **Effect of SARS-CoV-2****on the Hepatobiliary System**
- The pathogenesis of liver injury in COVID-19 patients is unknown. Liver injury is likely multifactorial and is explained by various hypotheses, including ACE-2-mediated viral replication in the liver and its resulting cytotoxicity, hypoxic or ischemic damage, immune-mediated inflammatory response, and drug-induced liver injury (DILI), or worsening of pre-existing liver disease.

- **Effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the Renal System**
- The pathogenesis of COVID-19-associated kidney injury is unknown. It is likely multifactorial, explained by a single or a combination of many factors such as direct cytotoxic injury from the virus, imbalance in the RAAS, associated cytokine-induced hyperinflammatory state, microvascular injury, and the prothrombotic state associated with COVID-19. Other factors can contribute to kidney injury, such as associated hypovolemia, potential nephrotoxic agents, and nosocomial sepsis.
