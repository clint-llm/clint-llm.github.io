Adverse effects present in about 20 to 30% of patients prescribed nifedipine. These are primarily the result of the vasodilatory properties of nifedipine.

The most common adverse effects include flushing, peripheral edema, dizziness, headache. Tolerance is better with the extended-release preparations than the immediate-release preparations of nifedipine. Hypersensitivity reactions, such as pruritus, urticaria, and bronchospasms, are relatively rare. Abrupt discontinuance of the drug after prolonged use may lead to rebound hypertension or angina.
