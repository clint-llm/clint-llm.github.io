It should be acknowledged that theÂ validity of CRT results may be affected by many factors, including differences in ambient conditions, patient age, skin pigmentation, and the presence of nail polish or artificial nails; it is even subject to intraobserver and interobserver reliability.

Specific guidelines to standardize the setting of CRT do not currently exist. As such, healthcare providers must be aware of potentially confounding elements and their implications, especially in treating patients in dissimilar circumstances, austere environments (paramedics, wilderness first responders), or hypothermia. Newer methods to increase reliability have been proposed, including photoplethysmography and fiberoptic force sensors.
